The original parasite material, derived from an infected Aotus trivirgatus monkey, was diluted more than 100 million times by the addition of human erythrocytes at 3- or 4-day intervals. The parasites continued to reproduce in their normal asexual cycle of approximately 48 hours but were no longer highly synchronous. They have remained infective to Aotus."
https://openalex.org/W1544605152,"Bovine epididymal spermatozoa incubated aerobically in vitro in the presence of 0.1 to 0.2 mM CaCl2 accumulate 25 to 50 nmol of calcium/10(8) cells. The addition of low concentrations of the ionophore A23187 (0.01 to 0.5 nmol/mg of sperm protein) induces efflux of this accumulated calcium. At high ionophore concentrations (0.5 to 5.0 nmol/mg of sperm protein), calcium release is followed by an influx of up to 25 nmol of calcium/10(8) cells that is not dependent on mitochondrial energization. A selective increase in the permeability of the sperm plasma membrane produced by treatment with the polyene antibiotic, filipin, results in the release of that calcium which is accumulated in the presence of high concentrations of A23187. Sperm first treated with filipin possess the ability to accumulate and retain calcium (in the presence of an oxidizable substrate) but release Ca2+ without subsequent reaccumulation after the addition of 3 nmol of A23187/mg of protein. These observations are explained by the existence of competing calcium pumps operating within the mitochondrial and plasma membranes of the spermatozoan. Treatment with high concentrations of A23187 allows calcium influx into a non-mitochondrial compartment of the sperm cell as a consequence of the equilibration of this cation across both mitochondrial and plasma membranes. The amount of calcium uptake and its sensitivity to filipin indicate that calcium binding to soluble, intracellular components is also involved. The ability of low concentrations of A23187 to induce calcium efflux is explained as a result of the continued operation of the plasma membrane pump coincident with ionophore-induced decay of the concentration gradient across the mitochondrial membrane. This hypothetical action of low levels of the ionophore on the mitochondria is supported by the observation of net movements of calcium with filipin-treated cells and the respiratory responses and movements of phosphate and membrane-associated calcium with intact sperm. It is suggested that the basis of this apparent selectivity of ionophore action lies in the relative activities and kinetic properties of the competing calcium pumps in the plasma and mitochondrial membranes of these cells. Ionophore-induced influx of calcium into the extramitochondrial space results in a stimulation of respiration and kinetic activity of the sperm. This activation of motility is observed also with cells made entirely dependent upon glycolysis (by treatment with respiratory inhibitors) and suggests a direct involvement of calcium in the regulation of flagellar function."

All these phages have previously been shown to carry genes for rRNA (Ohtsubo et al., 1974; Lindahl et al., 1975; Jaskunas et al., 1975a). We have analyzed the position of these tRNA genes by hybridizing purified RNAs to restriction fragments of the phage DNA. The tRNA genes are located inside the rRNA transcription unit in the spacer region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes."
https://openalex.org/W1619272169,"Growing cultures of mutant Escherichia coli with temperature-senstive peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase were shifted to nonpermissive 4o degrees. There followed a roughly linear increase in a fraction of isolated tRNA (over 50% after 20 min) whose amino acid-accepting activity was masked until treatment with active peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase. The ionophoretic mobility of amino acid label associated with this fraction could be altered by treatment with the hydrolase, trypsin, RNAse, and alkali. The rate of accumulation of this fraction could be altered by treating the growing cells with chloramphenicol, which reduced the rate, or erythromycin, which enhanced it. It is concluded that peptidyl-tRNA dissociates from ribosomes of the mutant cells during protein biosynthesis. The primary metabolic role of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase is to prevent the accumulation of dissociated peptidyl-tRNA, which inhibits protein synthesis. The rate of dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from ribosomes was estimated at between 1 per 90 and 1 per 2600 peptide elongation steps in the absence of antibiotics, depending on the level of inhibition of protein synthesis. After 20 min at 40 degrees, the size distribution of peptides found on tRNA was heterogeneous, with over 74% having a molecular weight greater than 8 X 10(2). The effect of erythromycin suggests that its mechanism of action is to destabilize the peptidyl-tRNA/ribosome interaction and thereby stimulate the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA. The mechanism of inhibition of protein synthesis by accumulating peptidyl-tRNA and reasons why peptidyl-tRNA dissociates from ribosomes are discussed in terms of the current data."

https://openalex.org/W1587485068,"In the presence of the Escherichia coli DNA binding protein, single-stranded DNA is resistant to both the endo- and exonucleolytic activities of the recBC DNase. Linear duplex DNA, on the other hand, is unwound at a normal rate, but converted to large, single-stranded fragments which are resistant to further hydrolysis. Therefore, in the presence of the binding protein and linear duplex DNA, the recBC enzyme acts not as a DNase, but primarily as an ATP-dependent unwinding enzyme, able to generate large, single-stranded material. Duplex circular DNA containing short, single-stranded gaps is also resistant to the hydrolysis in the presence of the binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1514366116,"Interaction of bacterial polypeptide chain initiation factor 2 (IF-2) with Escherichia coli formylmethionyl-tRNA in the absence of free Mg2+ renders the fMet-tRNA adsorable to nitrocellulose membrane filters. This reaction does not require GTP and is strongly inhibited by low concentration (1 mM) of Mg2+ in the reaction mixture. The structural requirements of the tRNA for binary complex formation have been studied using modified fMet-tRNAfMet molecules and a series of N-blocked and normal aminoacyl-rRNAs. It has been observed that IF-2 will not blind either to free formylmethionine or to a short fMet-oligonucleotide, but will bind to any xRNA structure covalently attached to an N-blocked methionine group. The E. coli initiator and noninitiator methiionine tRNAs, which have many differences in primary structure, were found to bind identically. In addition, fMet-tRNAfMet molecules containing structural modidifications at 20 different sites had the same affinity for IF-2 as unmodified fMet-tRNAfMet. N-blocked eukaryotic initiator tRNAs were also found to bind strongly to the factor. Binary complex formation was readily reversible, f[14C]Met-tRNAfMet being competed out by addition of an equal amount of unlabeled fMet-tRNAfMet to the preformed complex. In contrast, deacylated tRNAfMet was a poor compeitor, a 30-fold excess being required for 50% inhibition of complex formation in the presence of limiting factor. Although tRNAs having an N-blocked methionine were found to have the greatest affinity for IF-2, specificity for the amino acid in binary complex formation was not absolute. Partial binding was observed with N-substituted tyrosine, valine, and phenylalanine tRNAs, and weak or no binding with N-subsituted lysine, alanine, and leucine tRNAs. In all cases, N-blocked derivatives had a higher affinity for IF-2 than the corresponding unsubstituted aminoacyl-tRNAs. These results indicate that IF-2 alone is not capable of distinguishing the nucleotide sequence of tRNAs and selects the initiator tRNA by recognizing the fMet moiety. The overall data suggest that the role of IF-2 in formation of the ribosomal initiation complex is to stablize the interaction of fMet-tRNAfMet with the ribosome at low Mg2+ concentrations by binding to both the ribosomal particle and the fMet group of the tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1548083858,"DNA polymerase I has been purified to greater than 90% homogeneity from a strain of Escherichia coli K12 that bears the temperature-sensitive DNA polymerase I mutatation, polA12. The mutant enzyme has a reduced electrophoretic mobility and sedimentation rate. It is abnormally thermolabile and is rapidly inactivated at low salt concentrations. Its polymerase and 5' leads to 3' exonuclease activities are not grossly defective at 30 degrees, yet its capacity to promote the concerted 5' leads to 3' polymerization and the 5' leads to 3' exonucleolytic hydrolysis of nucleotides at a nick (nick translation) is decreased 10-fold. These effects are probably the result of a significant alteration in the tertiary structure of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2092313457,"The distribution of length heterogeneity in adjacent repeating units of X. laevis 5S DNA has been examined by “cloning” 5S DNA in bacteria. Fragments of 5S DNA produced by partial digestion with Hind III and containing 1, 4, and 5 repeating units have been inserted at the single Hind III site of the tetracycline-resistance plasmid, pSC101, and the hybrid plasmids cloned in E. coli. Adjacent 5S DNA repeats in the cloned multi-repeat fragments can differ in length. This finding rules out some mechanisms which have been proposed to account for the parallel evolution of tandem repeated DNAs. The results are consistent with an unequal crossing-over mechanism and place some constraints on the molecular processes in this recombinatory event."
https://openalex.org/W1548518275,"A previous report from this laboratory (van Golde, L.M.G., Schulman, H., and Kennedy, E.P. (1973) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 70, 1368-1372) described the discovery in Escherichia coli of a novel class of oligosaccharides, containing glucose as the sole sugar, substituted with glycerophosphate units derived from membrane phospholipids, and with succinic acid in O-ester linkage. These membrane-derived oligosaccharides, comprising about 0.5 to 1.0% of the dry weight of E. coli, represent a family of closely related oligosaccharides that may be subfractionated on anion exchange resins. The present paper describes studies of the oligosaccharide A-1 described by van Golde et al. in the previous report. The glycerophosphate linked to the oligosaccharide in phosphodiester bond is the sn-glycero-1-P enantiomer. This finding strongly supports the previous conclusion that the oligosaccharides are the acceptors of the polar headgroups of membrane phospholipids, since the unesterified glycerophosphate of phosphatidyl glycerol is an sn-glycero-1-P residue, otherwise rare in nature. The glycerophosphate residues in the membrane-derived oligosaccharide are not substituted in the sn-2 or sn-3 positions, since they are readily oxidized by periodate under mild conditions. Alkaline hydrolysis liberates glycerophosphate, and only negligible amounts of free glycerol, consistent with the view that the glycerophosphate residues are linked to glucose units through position 6, unfavorable for the formation of glucose cyclic phosphate intermediates that would eliminate free glycerol. Oligosaccharide A-1 (but not Fraction A-2) contains phosphoethanolamine residues equivalent to 30 to 40% of the total phosphorus. The phosphoethanolamine residues are linked to position 6 of glucose units, as proved by the isolation of glucose 6-phosphate as a product of partial acid hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1479746115,"Ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase from Escherichia coli consists of a 1/1 complex of two nonidentical subunits called proteins B1 and B2. The enzyme reduces the four common ribonucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides and is allosterically regulated by nucleoside triphosphates which influence its substrate specificity as well as its overall activity. The B1 subunit contains binding sites for the effectors while B2 contains iron and an organic free radical essential for catalytic activity. We now establish that only protein B1 binds substrates. Competition experiments support the presence of two identical substrate binding sites, distinct from the effector binding sites. The catalytic site of the enzyme thus is formed from both the B1 and B2 subunits. Dissociation constants for substrates ranged from 2 X 10(-5) to about 10(-3) M. In all cases effectors decreased these constants in agreement with their influence on the substrate specificity of ribonucleotide reductase, but did not induce cooperative effects. The increase in binding was pronounced at 20 degrees but only marginal at 0 degrees. Arrhenius plots of the influence of temperature on the catalytic activity of the enzyme showed sharp breaks at 12 degrees. The temperature effects can be interpreted as a conformational change occurring in the structure of protein B1 at the critical temperature."

(1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 6424-6433). After peptic digestion of the labeled, denatured, reduced, and cyanoethylated enzyme three radioactive peptides were isolated. The peptide originating from the sucrase subunit had the following sequence: Ile-Asp-Met-Asn-Gln-Pro-Asn-Ser-Ser; the other two, deriving from the isomaltase subunit, had the sequences: Asn-Gly2-Gln-Ile-Asp-Met and Ile-Asp-Met. The radioactive label was in each case bound to the beta carboxyl group of an aspartic acid residue."
https://openalex.org/W1516105725,"The divalent cation ionophore A23187 has been used to investigate the kinetics of energy-dependent Ca2+ uptake by rat liver mitochondria under steady state conditions. During A23187-induced cyclic Ca2+ flux, the free Ca2+ concentration is adjusted using [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) buffers. The rate of Ca2+ transport, which is inferred from the rate of succinate oxidation, is a function of the free Ca2+ concentration in the medium. The kinetics are sigmoidal with the free Ca2+ concentration at half-maximal respiratory stimulation (K0.5) equal to 3.1 +/- 0.4 muM at 25 degrees. The maximal Ca2+-stimulated respiratory rate (Vmax) is a function of the ionic composition of the medium. Magnesium and Mg2+ plus phosphate produced a parallel stimulation of the maximal respiration rate whether activated by Ca2+ uptake or by the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). In the absence of A23187, Ca:O rations of 4.0 were obtained under most experimental conditions. Magnesium is a potent competitive-like inhibitor, increasing the K0.5 for Ca2+ to 30.0 muM at 2.0 mM MgCl2. Magnesium dramatically decreases the apparent affinity for Ca2+ but does not appear to alter the kinetic mechanism. In contrast, the alkali metal cations are weak inhibitors, at most doubling the K0.5 for Ca2+; however, they antagonized Mg2+ inhibition with an order of effectiveness Li+ greater than or equal to Na+ greater than K+ greater than Rb+ =Cs+. Phosphate and acetate increased the Vmax slightly without altering the K0.5 for Ca2+. Phosphate did not influence the inhibitory effects of Mg2+ or Mg2+ plus K+. This study suggests that during steady state conditions, the maximal rate of Ca2+ accumulation is primarily electron transport-limited. The results are also discussed in terms of a possible physiological role for Mg2+ and K+ in the intracellular regulation of energy-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in liver."

https://openalex.org/W1561680536,"Old Yellow Enzyme has been purified in high yield from crude extracts of brewers bottom yeast using an affinity matrix for the sole chromatographic step. The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis indicate that the enzyme is nearly homogeneous and consists of identically sized subunits of molecular weight of about 49,000. However, when the enzyme is isolated without the protective presence of a protease inhibitor, the electrophoretic pattern comprises three bands, which suggests limited, perhaps single bond cleavage of the polypeptide chain. This proteolytic cleavage results in weaker binding of ligands to the enzyme. The binding of a large number of compounds to the enzyme has been investigated, particularly with reference to the concomitant appearance of long wavelength absorption bands. The structural requirements for formation of long wavelength absorption are that the ligand must be aromatic in character, with an ionizable hydroxyl or thiol substituent."

https://openalex.org/W1511055887,"Tryptic digestion of Escherichia coli lac repressor under nondenaturing conditions readily removes 59 amino acids from the NH2-terminal end of the polypeptide chain. Longer digestion removes an additional 20 or more amino acids from the COOH terminus, leaving a highly trypsin-resistanct core molecule. The lac repressor tetrameric structure and inducer-binding activity are retained by the tryptic core. Operator-binding activity, however, is lost as the NH2-terminal end is degraded. Many or all of the possible trypsin cleavage sites in the NH2-terminal region are available to attack by the enzyme, indicating that this part of the polypeptide chain is exposed to the environment. Lac repressor, missing the NH2-terminal end, renatures efficiently from random-coil solvent to tetramers with full inducer-binding activity, indicating that the NH2-terminal region is not necessary for the appropriate three-dimensional folding of the polypeptide chains. Core which lacks both the NH2 and COOH termini renatures to tetramers with low efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2012954203,"When E. coli cells are subjected to energy source downshift, the accumulation of RNA (and overall cell growth) is drastically restricted within 1 to 2 min. However, the identity of the primary metabolic signal for this adjustment is a mystery. Earlier studies, and further evidence presented here, show that there is no satisfactory correlation between the sudden adjustment of RNA accumulation and the kinetics of changes in the levels of prospective signalling compounds, such as glycolytic intermediates, ppGpp, ATP, or the three adenylate nucleotides. We have discovered an unusual nucleotide, which we call the phantom spot, whose level decreases dramatically within a minute of downshift, correlating well with the adjustment of RNA accumulation. Preliminary characterization of the phantom spot indicates that it is a triphosphate derived from the guanylate pathway, and suggests that it is a form of GTP with a modification of the imidazole portion of the purine ring. We postulate that this nucleotide serves as a regulatory facsimile of ATP, linking the rate of RNA accumulation and other anabolic processes to the overall rate of phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1562088808,"By comparing the fluorescence emission properties of the wild type lac repressor with two lac repressors altered at tryptophan 190 and 209, respectively, we show that tryptophan residue 209 has its environment changed, either by its own motion, or that of the surrounding amino acids when an inducer molecule is bound. Substitution of this tryptophan with other amino acids results in lac respressor molecules with reduced affinity for inducer molecules, indicating that the geometry at residue 209 affects the geometry of the inducer-binding site. From the results of potassium iodide quenching of fluorescence from the tryptophans, and from attempts to react the native lac repressor with dimethyl(2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl) sulfonium bromide and 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide, we propose that tryptophan residue 209 is involved in a conformational change of the protein upon binding of inducer, but does not come in direct contact with inducer."

https://openalex.org/W1608654712,"We studied the incorporation of 14C-labeled guanosine into riboflavin under conditions precluding the metabolic conversion of guanosine compounds to free guanine. For this purpose we isolated a mutant BM 2 of Salmonella typhimurium deficient in the enzymes IMP dehydrogenase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and purine nucleotide pyrophosphorylase. The mutant incorporated [ribose-14C]guanosine into riboflavin and GMP without dilution. The isolated compounds were exclusively labeled in the ribityl and ribosyl side chain, respectively. AMP and CMP were not labeled. [2-14C]Guanosine was incorporated into riboflavin and GMP without dilution. The isolated compounds were exclusively labeled in the isoalloxazine and guanine moiety, respectively. AMP and CMP were again unlabeled. We conclude that the ribose moiety of proffered guanosine is directly converted to the ribityl moiety of riboflavin. Thus the biosynthesis of the vitamin begins at the level of a guanosine compound. Guanine, ribose, ribitol, and the respective phosphates are not direct precursors of the vitamin."
https://openalex.org/W1509067990,"The sequence of 29 nucleotides in the region preceding the initiation of the transcription of the Escherichia coli tyrosine tRNA gene has been determined. This is: (5') ---GGGGCGCATCATATCAAATGACGCGCCGC--- (3') (3') ---CCCCGCGTAGTATAGTTTACTGCGGCGGCG--- (5'). The general approach used for the sequence determination involved the DNA polymerase I-catalyzed elongation of suitable deoxyribopolynucleotide primers when hybridized to the 1-strand of phi80psuIII plus DNA at the appropriate site. Sequences of the newly grown oligonucleotide chains were determined by a combination of two-dimensional fingerprinting following partial exonucleolytic degradation, nearst neighbor analyses, and determination of pyrimidine tracts. Primer elongations were carried out in a controlled and stepwise manner and the newly grown oligonucleotide chains were kept short by incorporating the following features into the method: (a) the insertion of a ribonucleotide unit at or near the 3' terminus of the primers; (b) the use of a maximum of three nucleoside 5'-triphosphates in the first stage of the elongation reaction isolation of the elongated primer, and its reuse in a second step together with different sets of deoxy-nucleoside triphosphates; and (c) elongation of the primer using all of the four nucleoside triphosphates with one of the triphosphates being supplied in a limiting concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1516444945,"Protein D of molecular weight 80,000 is incorporated into the membrane of Escherichia coli B/r for a brief fraction of the cell cycle. The protein is incorporated into the outer membrane; its incorporation seems to reflect de novo synthesis and, once incorporated, it is stable. In synchronous acetate-grown cultures a 10-fold increase in the rate of protein D synthesis occurs toward the end of the cell cycle, near the end of one round of DNA synthesis and the start of the next. In synchronous glucose-grown cultures the protein appears approximately halfway through the cell cycle, shortly before DNA synthesis begins. The observed correlation between protein D synthesis and DNA initiation, approximately 15 min later, is strengthened by experiments with inhibitors and mutants. Inhibition of protein synthesis at any time during DNA synthesis delays the subsequent appearance of protein D and the initiation of the next round of DNA synthesis. The synthesis of both protein D and DNA is prevented by nalidixic acid; after its removal a sharp spike of protein D synthesis is followed by a wave of DNA synthesis. Experiments with DNA and DNAB mutants, with amino acid starvation of an auxotroph and with nutritional shift-up, all supported the coupling of protein D synthesis with the initiation of DNA synthesis. The addition of beta-lactam antibiotics which affect murein metabolism dramatically increases the amount of protein D. The cells are prevented from terminating protein D synthesis; different antibiotics have different kinetics of action. Protein D preferentially binds to double-stranded DNA in vitro. We suggest that this protein provides a metabolic link between murein synthesis, protein synthesis, and DNA initiation, and that it acts at a specific time in the cell cycle as an attachment site for DNA to the cell envelope."

No differences were detected in the physical or chemical properties examined, except that the E. coli mtDNA lacked the alkali lability characteristic of animal mtDNAs. Heteroduplexes between the LA9 portions of the recombinant plasmids and LA9 mtDNA were analyzed by absorbance melting. The melting temperatures were indistinguishable from reannealed LA9 mtDNA homoduplexes, indicating that single-base replication errors occur at a frequency of fewer than 1 nucleotide in 300. Electron microscopic analyses of plasmid-LA9 mtDNA heteroduplexes and a comparison of agarose gel electrophoresis of restriction endonuclease fragments also indicated no differences. These results were independent of the order or the relative orientation of the pSC101 and mtDNA fragments.

Two independently derived preparations of anti-sera from hamsters bearing group C adenovirus tumors were tested for antibody against the single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. One antiserum contained antibodies that reacted with these DNA-binding proteins, while the second antiserum did not contain detectable levels of antibody.

Mutants were isolated from this phage that carry deletions removing various amounts of the distal end of this transcription unit. These deletions were physically mapped on the lambdarifd18 phage genome. Synthesis of rRNAs and of tRNAGlu/2 was examined in ultraviolet-irradiated E. coli cells infected with lambdarifd18 or with various deletion mutants. It was observed that mutant phages in which the distal end (the 5S rRNA gene and a part of the 23S rRNA gene) of the rRNA transcription unit is deleted can still synthesize both 16S rRNA (or its precursor) and tRNAGlu/2. Apparently, the post-transcriptional cleavage that produces these RNA molecules does not require the presence of the entire transcription unit, that is, it can take place without the complete structure of the transcript (""30S pre-ribosomal RNA"").

Experiments were also done using other transducing phages that carry dapD+ but not polC+. The data indicate that both the tsf and rpsB genes map near dapD at about 4 min on the E. coli genetic map. This location is different from the two chromosomal locations, the str-spc region and the rif region, where many ribosomal protein genes, the genes for RNA polymerase components, as well as other elongation factor genes (fus, tufA, and tufB) are located."
https://openalex.org/W1574790869,"Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I shows a delay in the initiation of polymerization after binding to the cohesive ends of lambda DNA. This delay is significantly longer than the time required for the synthesis of an octanucleotide sequence on the right-hand cohesive end of the lambda DNA. When the extent of polymerization is limited by omission of one or more of the deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and polymerization started again by their addition, the delay still occurs. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that two forms of the enzyme or enzyme - DNA complex exist, only one of which is active. The delay, therefore, represents the time necessary to convert the inactive to the active form of the enzyme or enzyme complex. One consequence of the defect in DNA polymerase I, due to the polA12 mutation, is apparently to alter the equilibrium between the two forms. However, the rate of polymerization and the rate of conversion of inactive to active enzyme or enzyme complex are not changed significantly."

https://openalex.org/W1989025016,"We have shown that the relA gene can affect the rates of synthesis of many nonribosomal proteins in E. coli. We used rel− and relA strains that contain a temperature-sensitive valyl tRNA synthetase. Upon transfer from a permissive temperature (30°C) to a semi-restrictive one (36.5°C), these strains continue to grow, although underoing a partial deprivation of valyl tRNA. In the rel+ strain, the concentration of ppGpp increases immediately, and the accumulation of RNA ceases abruptly but temporarily. In contrast, in the relA strain, the concentration of ppGpp falls, whereas the rate of accumulation of RNA increases. As judged by gel electrophoresis, the rates at which individual polypeptides are synthesized by the strains after their transfer to 36.5°C depend to a large extent upon the allelic state of the relA gene. In both strains, the concentration of ppGpp changes soon enough to have altered the synthesis of some of the proteins by affecting the transcription of their genes."

The properties of the mutant indicate a strong potential for its use in biochemical and genetic work. In particular, the mutant makes possible the variation of the intracellular concentration of selected protein, permitting an evaluation of its role in cell growth and biochemistry. The mutant also permits the selective radiochemical labeling of proteins in vivo for in vitro identification and analysis. The utilization of the mutant for these and other applications is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1494984572,"Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase of Escherichia coli has 1.8 binding sites for L-tryptophan with Kdiss of 12 x 10(-5) M as shown by equilibrium dialysis. The results are in accord with the known structure of the enzyme, and alpha2 dimer of 74,000 molecular weight, and with 2 binding sites for tryptophanyl-ATP ester. Ordinary sucrose density gradient centrifugation reveals a complex composed of one tRNATrp bound per enzyme dimer. When tRNATrp is mixed throughout the gradient at concentrations from 5.4 x 10(-6) M to 2.0 x 10(-5) M, a new peak appears in the position expected for a complex with two tRNATrp molecules bound per enzyme dimer. Sedimentation through gradients lacking tRNATrp favors dissociation of the 1:2 complex but not the 1:1 complex. The data indicate 2 binding sites for tRNATrp on tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W2130790665,"tRNA pseudouridylation activities have been detected in embryonic mouse cell fractions and in extracts from HeLa, mouse L-cell and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell lines. These activities were identified by the use of heterologous reaction systems, with tRNA from hisT strains of Salmonella typhimurium as substrate. hisT mutants are defective for an enzyme that forms psi residues in the anticodon region of many tRNAs and accumulate undermodified species of tRNA. The pseudouridylation activity from BHK cells has been examined in detail and quantitated by a modified tritium release assay (Cortese, R., Kammen, H.O., Spengler, S.J., and Ames, B.N. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 1103-1108). Maximal rates of tritium release required a suitable cationic environment (optimally, a combination of Mg2+ and NH4+) and a thiol reductant. The activity was totally inhibited in the presence of thiol-reactive reagents, such as 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and p-chloromercuribenzoate. A major portion of this 3H release activity was associated with psi modification reactions. This conclusion stems from the following observations: (a) BHK extracts preferentially catalyzed a release of 3H from hisT [5-3H]tRNA, rather than from similarly labeled wild type tRNA; (b) this activity was specific for protons attached to C5 of the pyrimidine rings; no release of 3H was obtained with hisT or wild type [6-3H]tRNA as substrate; (c) the reaction products of hisT tRNA with BHK enzyme were examined by reverse phase column chromatography of tRNAPhe isoacceptors on RPC-5 columns. The enzyme modified both of the principal isoacceptors of hisT tRNAPhe to an equal extent, yielding products indistinguishable from wild type tRNAPhe. Significant levels of 3H release were obtained by the action of enzyme on wild type [5-3H]tRNA, even after gel filtration of the enzyme. This suggests that the enzyme may be able to hypermodify certain species of wild type S. typhimurium tRNA. The activities for wild type tRNA and hisT tRNA appeared to be associated with the same enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1602388021,"Investigations of peptide transport in Salmonella typhimurium are presented. A strain designated proB25, a proline auxotroph, grew on a variety of di, tri-, and tetrapeptides containing proline. In contrast (Pro)6, peptides acylated on the NH2 terminus and Ala-Pro-D-Ala did not satisfy the nutritional requirement of proB25 for proline because they were not transported. A derivative of proB25, strain TN87, deficient in a proline aminopeptidase and an X-Pro dipeptidase, was able to utilize only four of 25 proline-containing peptides investigated. The inability of TN87 to grow on most of these peptides was due to the lack of the requisite peptidase activity. Evidence for a functional dipeptide transport system in this strain is indicated by growth on Pro-Leu and Pro-Ala, and by growth inhibition by certain X-Pro dipeptides. Leu-Pro, Val-Pro, Met-Pro, and Arg-Pro cause temporary growth inhibition of strain TN87 whereas Gly-Pro, Ala-Pro, and Pro-Pro have no effect on growth. Evidence for a functional oligopeptide transport system is indicated by growth on Pro-Val-Gly and Pro-Gly-Gly and by uptake of label from L-methionyl-L-methionyl-L-[14C]methionine and L-alanyl-L-prolyl-[14C]glycine. The presence of multiple oligopeptide transport systems for certain proline-containing peptides was demonstrated using triornithine-resistant mutants (oligopeptide permease deficient) and competition experiments. Finally L-Ala-L-Pro-[14C]Gly is shown to be transported intact into strain TN87."
https://openalex.org/W1599993195,"Native tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase purified from Escherichia coli B has on each identical subunit a single thiol group which rapidly forms a mixed disulfide with a thionitrobenzoate moiety of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The reaction and the concomitant inactivation of the enzyme are both reversible by reductive removal of the thionitrobenzoate with dithiothreitol. Iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide also react with the thiol group required for enzyme activity, but iodoacetic acid inactivates the enzyme through another mechanism. Three or 4 half-cystine residues/subunit were detected by amino acid analysis and by titration of the denatured enzyme with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); no disulfide bonds were detected by borohydride reduction. Cleavage of the subunit (molecular weight 37,000) with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid gave fragments of molecular weights 32,000, 27,000, and 9,500. Five carboxymethylated peptides were isolated from the trypsin products of the denatured enzyme after treatment with iodo[14C]lacetate. Three of these peptides represented unique sequences surrounding thiol groups in the enzyme. One cysteine-containing nonapeptide has a heptapeptide sequence homologous to a heptapeptide sequence in a cysteine containing decapeptide from the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase of human placenta. The nonapeptide appears to bear the thiol group required for enzyme activity."

https://openalex.org/W1524219154,"Glutaminase B from Escherichia coli is modulated by nucleotides and divalent cations. ATP and ADP inhibit glutaminase B whereas AMP and divalent cations activate it. Inhibition and activation required preincubation of the nucleotides with glutaminase B at 4 degrees. Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ activated the enzyme and prevented the inhibition by ATP. Dialysis in the presence of an activator ligand reversed the ATP inhibition of glutaminase B. The modulation of glutaminase B by energy charge is similar to that observed with other catabolic enzymes. We suggest that a pattern of reciprocal regulation of glutaminase B and glutamine synthetase by adenine nucleotides prevents the formation of a futile cycle of amide synthesis and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1549282519,"Glutaminase B is both activated and inhibited by L-glutamate, the product of the reaction. The activation process is time- and temperature-dependent. Activation by L-glutamate alters the Vmax, So.5, and shape of the substrate saturation curve. The activation decays as a first order process with time after separation of L-glutamate from glutaminase B. L-Glutamate inhibits both glutaminase B and the glutamate-activated enzyme. Like L-glutamate, borate activates and inhibits glutaminase B. Inhibition of the enzyme by glutamine and glutamate analogs is also examined and similarities between the glutamate activation and activation by warming at 23 degrees are noted."
https://openalex.org/W1985796310,"The rate of rRNA synthesis from E. coli DNA in vitro can exhibit an unusual temperature dependence. Instead of the typical sigmoid curve, at least five to six pronounced peaks of rRNA synthesis are detectable over a 30degrees range in temperature. rRNA synthesis from performed initiation complexes exhibits a similar pattern and shows that the number of polymerases able to initiate rRNA synthesis increases with each successive peak. These results are interpreted in terms of a model which proposes that the rRNA cistrons are served by multiple promoter sites (subpromoters) whose activation energies form a graded series. Thus the number of polymerases initiating rRNA synthesis could be controlled by regulating the number of active subpromoters."
https://openalex.org/W1514506752,"The transaldolase-dihydroxyacetone carbanion intermediate formed in the reaction of transaldolase with its donor substrates fructose-6-P or sedoheptulose-7-P is susceptible to oxidation by hexacyanoferrate(III). The dihydroxyacetone moiety is oxidized to the corresponding 2-ketoaldehyde, i.e. hydroxy-pyruvaldehyde (CH2OH-CO-CHO). This oxidation product is, in contrast to dihydroxyacetone, readily released from the enzyme. In the presence of hexacyanoferrate(III) transaldolase thus functions as an efficient catalyst of the oxidative cleavage of its donor substrates fructose-6-P or sedoheptulose-7-P into hydroxypyruvaldehyde and glyceraldehyde-3-P or erythrose-4-P, respectively. Two moles of hexacyanoferrate(III) are reduced per mole of oxidatively cleaved donor substrate. The molecular activity for oxidative cleavage of fructose-6-P at a hexacyanoferrate(III) concentration of 0.5 mM is 0.65% of that for the normal transfer reaction with erythrose-4-P as the acceptor substrate. The present data emphasize the applicability of certain oxidants as trapping agents for enzymatic carbanion intermediates as proposed previously (Healy, M.J.,, and Christen, P. (1973) Biochemistry 12, 35-41)."
https://openalex.org/W1587802305,"Endogenous fatty acid biosynthesis in the bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum is greatly decreased upon addition of exogenous fatty acids (Henderson, T.A., and McNeil, J.J. (1966) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 25, 662-669). We have demonstrated the presence of five pantothenate-containing compounds in L. plantarum which have been identified by co-chromatography with authentic samples: pantothenate, 4'-phosphopantetheine, 3'-dephosphocoenzyme A, coenzyme A, and acyl carrier protein (ACP). The concentrations of the above pantothenate-containing compounds were found to be: 0.009, 0.13, 0.067, 0.69, and 0.22 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. L. plantarum ACP was shown to have a molecular weight near that of Escherichia coli ACP but to have a lower isoelectric point (pI = 3.75). Oleate in the presence of Triton X-100 was found to reduce the concentration of ACP by 80% with little effect on the concentrations of the other pantothenate-containing compounds. The synthesis of ACP apparently ceased soon after the addition of oleate and the rate of decrease in concentration of ACP was quanitatively consistent with the previously observed rate of decrease in the initial rate of fatty acid biosynthesis in this organism (Weeks, G., and Wakil, S.J. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 1913-1921). Thus, the change in rate of fatty acid biosynthesis in L. plantarum upon addition of oleate to the medium can be quantitatively related to the concentration of ACP (and probably to the concentration of co-repressible enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis)."
https://openalex.org/W1555870103,"A procedure is described for the purification of the tryptophan synthetase alpha2beta2 complex from cell extracts of Proteus mirabilis. A 30-fold purification was achieved with an overall yield of about 23% and a specific activity of 1,600. The complex can be dissociated and the subunits isolated in a pure form. The complex can be reconstituted from the isolated subunits to regain the initial activity. The alpha and beta2 subunits of the tryptophan synthetase complex of P. mirabilis are not significantly different from those of Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria as to their physical properties, amino acid compositions, and enzymic properties. Complementation studies indicate that the alpha subunit of P. mirabilis hybridizes well with the beta2 subunit from E. coli. Similarly, the beta2 subunit of P. mirabilis readily complexes with the alpha subunits from E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Serratia marcescens. The hybrids formed are all effective in catalyzing the conversion of indoleglycerol phosphate plus serine into tryptophan and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. However, these hybrids have reduced or no activity in the other reactions, namely, the condensation of indole and serine to form tryptophan or the aldolytic cleavage of indoleglycerol phosphate."
