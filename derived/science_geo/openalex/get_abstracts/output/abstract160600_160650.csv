Here we report the results of an international collaboration to produce and make freely available a draft sequence of the human genome. We also present an initial analysis of the data, describing some of the insights that can be gleaned from the sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2122727913,"Ultralong beltlike (or ribbonlike) nanostructures (so-called nanobelts) were successfully synthesized for semiconducting oxides of zinc, tin, indium, cadmium, and gallium by simply evaporating the desired commercial metal oxide powders at high temperatures. The as-synthesized oxide nanobelts are pure, structurally uniform, and single crystalline, and most of them are free from defects and dislocations. They have a rectanglelike cross section with typical widths of 30 to 300 nanometers, width-to-thickness ratios of 5 to 10, and lengths of up to a few millimeters. The beltlike morphology appears to be a distinctive and common structural characteristic for the family of semiconducting oxides with cations of different valence states and materials of distinct crystallographic structures. The nanobelts could be an ideal system for fully understanding dimensionally confined transport phenomena in functional oxides and building functional devices along individual nanobelts."

https://openalex.org/W2061008984,"We describe a map of 1.42 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed throughout the human genome, providing an average density on available sequence of one SNP every 1.9 kilobases. These SNPs were primarily discovered by two projects: The SNP Consortium and the analysis of clone overlaps by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium. The map integrates all publicly available SNPs with described genes and other genomic features. We estimate that 60,000 SNPs fall within exon (coding and untranslated regions), and 85% of exons are within 5 kb of the nearest SNP. Nucleotide diversity varies greatly across the genome, in a manner broadly consistent with a standard population genetic model of human history. This high-density SNP map provides a public resource for defining haplotype variation across the genome, and should help to identify biomedically important genes for diagnosis and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1971646616,"The human genome is by far the largest genome to be sequenced, and its size and complexity present many challenges for sequence assembly. The International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium constructed a map of the whole genome to enable the selection of clones for sequencing and for the accurate assembly of the genome sequence. Here we report the construction of the whole-genome bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) map and its integration with previous landmark maps and information from mapping efforts focused on specific chromosomal regions. We also describe the integration of sequence data with the map."
https://openalex.org/W1986718451,"Local realism is the idea that objects have definite properties whether or not they are measured, and that measurements of these properties are not affected by events taking place sufficiently far away. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen used these reasonable assumptions to conclude that quantum mechanics is incomplete. Starting in 1965, Bell and others constructed mathematical inequalities whereby experimental tests could distinguish between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories. Many experiments have since been done that are consistent with quantum mechanics and inconsistent with local realism. But these conclusions remain the subject of considerable interest and debate, and experiments are still being refined to overcome 'loopholes' that might allow a local realistic interpretation. Here we have measured correlations in the classical properties of massive entangled particles (9Be+ ions): these correlations violate a form of Bell's inequality. Our measured value of the appropriate Bell's 'signal' is 2.25 +/- 0.03, whereas a value of 2 is the maximum allowed by local realistic theories of nature. In contrast to previous measurements with massive particles, this violation of Bell's inequality was obtained by use of a complete set of measurements. Moreover, the high detection efficiency of our apparatus eliminates the so-called 'detection' loophole."
https://openalex.org/W1968035612,"Single soft-x-ray pulses of ∼90–electron volt (eV) photon energy are produced by high-order harmonic generation with 7-femtosecond (fs), 770-nanometer (1.6 eV) laser pulses and are characterized by photoionizing krypton in the presence of the driver laser pulse. By detecting photoelectrons ejected perpendicularly to the laser polarization, broadening of the photoelectron spectrum due to absorption and emission of laser photons is suppressed, permitting the observation of a laser-induced downshift of the energy spectrum with sub-laser-cycle resolution in a cross correlation measurement. We measure isolated x-ray pulses of 1.8 (+0.7/−1.2) fs in duration, which are shorter than the oscillation cycle of the driving laser light (2.6 fs). Our techniques for generation and measurement offer sub-femtosecond resolution over a wide range of x-ray wavelengths, paving the way to experimental attosecond science. Tracing atomic processes evolving faster than the exciting light field is within reach."
https://openalex.org/W2066444607,"Now that whole genome sequences are available for many eukaryotic organisms from yeast to man, we can form broad hypotheses on the basis of the relative expansion of protein families. To investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the organization of membrane compartments, we identified members of the SNARE, coat complex, Rab and Sec1 protein families in four eukaryotic genomes. Of these families only the Rab family expanded from the unicellular yeast to the multicellular fly and worm. All families were expanded in humans, where we find 35 SNAREs, 60 Rabs and 53 coat complex subunits. In addition, we were able to resolve the SNARE class of proteins into four distinct subfamilies."
https://openalex.org/W1964817578,"Axonal growth cones that cross the nervous system midline change their responsiveness to midline guidance cues: They become repelled by the repellent Slit and simultaneously lose responsiveness to the attractant netrin. These mutually reinforcing changes help to expel growth cones from the midline by making a once-attractive environment appear repulsive. Here, we provide evidence that these two changes are causally linked: In the growth cones of embryonic Xenopus spinal axons, activation of the Slit receptor Roundabout (Robo) silences the attractive effect of netrin-1, but not its growth-stimulatory effect, through direct binding of the cytoplasmic domain of Robo to that of the netrin receptor DCC. Biologically, this hierarchical silencing mechanism helps to prevent a tug-of-war between attractive and repulsive signals in the growth cone that might cause confusion. Molecularly, silencing is enabled by a modular and interlocking design of the cytoplasmic domains of these potentially antagonistic receptors that predetermines the outcome of their simultaneous activation."
https://openalex.org/W1965941177,"The completion of the human genome will greatly accelerate the development of a new branch of science—evolutionary genomics. We can now directly address important questions about the evolutionary history of human genes and their regulatory sequences. Computational analyses of the human genome will reveal the number of genes and repetitive elements, the extent of gene duplication and compositional heterogeneity in the human genome, and the extent of domain shuffling and domain sharing among proteins. Here we present some first glimpses of these features."
https://openalex.org/W2063604936,"The low solubility of fullerenes in aqueous solution limits their applications in biology. By appropriate substitution, the fullerenes can be transformed into stabilized anions that are water soluble and can form large aggregated structures. A laser light scattering study of the association behavior of the potassium salt of pentaphenyl fullerene (Ph5C60K) in water revealed that the hydrocarbon anions Ph5C60- associate into bilayers, forming stable spherical vesicles with an average hydrodynamic radius and a radius of gyration of about 17 nanometers at a very low critical aggregation concentration of less than 10(-7) moles per liter. The average aggregation number of associated particles in these large spherical vesicles is about 1.2 x 10(4)."
https://openalex.org/W2053037206,"We have searched the human genome for genes encoding new proteins that may be involved in three nuclear gene expression processes: transcription, pre-messenger RNA splicing and polyadenylation. A plethora of potential new factors are implicated by sequence in nuclear gene expression, revealing a substantial but selective increase in complexity compared with Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Although the raw genomic information has limitations, its availability offers new experimental approaches for studying gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2089817566,"The complete human genome sequence will facilitate the identification of all genes that contribute to disease. We propose that the functional classification of disease genes and their products will reveal general principles of human disease. We have determined functional categories for nearly 1,000 documented disease genes, and found striking correlations between the function of the gene product and features of disease, such as age of onset and mode of inheritance. As knowledge of disease genes grows, including those contributing to complex traits, more sophisticated analyses will be possible; their results will yield a deeper understanding of disease and an enhanced integration of medicine with biology."

 Broecker
 discusses whether this warm period was global or regional in extent. He argues that it is the last in a long series of climate fluctuations in the North Atlantic, that it was likely global, and that the present warming should be attributed in part to such an oscillation, upon which the warming due to greenhouse gases is superimposed."
https://openalex.org/W1978283952,"Abstract We have placed 7,600 cytogenetically defined landmarks on the draft sequence of the human genome to help with the characterization of genes altered by gross chromosomal aberrations that cause human disease. The landmarks are large-insert clones mapped to chromosome bands by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Each clone contains a sequence tag that is positioned on the genomic sequence. This genome-wide set of sequence-anchored clones allows structural and functional analyses of the genome. This resource represents the first comprehensive integration of cytogenetic, radiation hybrid, linkage and sequence maps of the human genome; provides an independent validation of the sequence map 1,2 and framework for contig order and orientation; surveys the genome for large-scale duplications, which are likely to require special attention during sequence assembly; and allows a stringent assessment of sequence differences between the dark and light bands of chromosomes. It also provides insight into large-scale chromatin structure and the evolution of chromosomes and gene families and will accelerate our understanding of the molecular bases of human disease and cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1987494769,"Nuclei undergoing fission can be described by a multi-dimensional potential-energy surface that guides the nuclear shape evolution--from the ground state, through intermediate saddle points and finally to the configurations of separated fission fragments. Until now, calculations have lacked adequate exploration of the shape parameterization of sufficient dimensionality to yield features in the potential-energy surface (such as multiple minima, valleys, saddle points and ridges) that correspond to characteristic observables of the fission process. Here we calculate and analyse five-dimensional potential-energy landscapes based on a grid of 2,610,885 deformation points. We find that observed fission features--such as the distributions of fission fragment mass and kinetic energy, and the different energy thresholds for symmetric and asymmetric fission--are very closely related to topological features in the calculated five-dimensional energy landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2027335734,"The non-recombining region of the human Y chromosome (NRY), which comprises 95% of the chromosome, does not undergo sexual recombination and is present only in males. An understanding of its biological functions has begun to emerge from DNA studies of individuals with partial Y chromosomes, coupled with molecular characterization of genes implicated in gonadal sex reversal, Turner syndrome, graft rejection and spermatogenic failure1,2. But mapping strategies applied successfully elsewhere in the genome have faltered in the NRY, where there is no meiotic recombination map and intrachromosomal repetitive sequences are abundant3. Here we report a high-resolution physical map of the euchromatic, centromeric and heterochromatic regions of the NRY and its construction by unusual methods, including genomic clone subtraction4 and dissection of sequence family variants5. Of the map's 758 DNA markers, 136 have multiple locations in the NRY, reflecting its unusually repetitive sequence composition. The markers anchor 1,038 bacterial artificial chromosome clones, 199 of which form a tiling path for sequencing."

https://openalex.org/W2006937113,"Zic and Gli family proteins are transcription factors that share similar zinc finger domains. Recent studies indicate that Zic and Gli collaborate in neural and skeletal development. We provide evidence that the Zic and Gli proteins physically and functionally interact through their zinc finger domains. Moreover, Gli proteins were translocated to cell nuclei by coexpressed Zic proteins, and both proteins regulated each other's transcriptional activity. Our result suggests that the physical interaction between Zic and Gli is the molecular basis of their antagonistic or synergistic features in developmental contexts and that Zic proteins are potential modulators of the hedgehog-mediated signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2009996294,"Identification of the genes that cause oncogenesis is a central aim of cancer research. We searched the proteins predicted from the draft human genome sequence for paralogues of known tumour suppressor genes, but no novel genes were identified. We then assessed whether it was possible to search directly for oncogenic sequence changes in cancer cells by comparing cancer genome sequences against the draft genome. Apparently chimaeric transcripts (from oncogenic fusion genes generated by chromosomal translocations, the ends of which mapped to different genomic locations) were detected to the same degree in both normal and neoplastic tissues, indicating a significant level of false positives. Our experiment underscores the limited amount and variable quality of DNA sequence from cancer cells that is currently available."

Although addiction involves many psychological and social factors, it also represents a biological process: the effects of repeated drug exposure on a vulnerable brain. The sequencing of the human and other mammalian genomes will help us to understand the biology of addiction by enabling us to identify both genes that contribute to individual risk for addiction and those through which drugs cause addiction. We illustrate this potential impact by searching a draft sequence of the human genome for genes related to desensitization of receptors that mediate the actions of drugs of abuse on the nervous system."

This knowledge could lead to the development of therapies for treating jet lag and sleep disorders, and add to our understanding of the genetic contribution of clock gene alterations to sleep and neuropsychiatric disorders. The human genome will also aid in the identification of output genes that ultimately control circadian behaviours."

https://openalex.org/W1992824211,"Analyses of marine carbonates through the interval 63.9 to 65.4 million years ago indicate a near-constant flux of extraterrestrial helium-3, a tracer of the accretion rate of interplanetary dust to Earth. This observation indicates that the bolide associated with the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) extinction event was not accompanied by enhanced solar system dustiness and so could not have been a member of a comet shower. The use of helium-3 as a constant-flux proxy of sedimentation rate implies deposition of the K-T boundary clay in (10 +/- 2) x 10(3) years, precluding the possibility of a long hiatus at the boundary and requiring extremely rapid faunal turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1979333126,"Every organism must have cells that can replicate indefinitely. Can the draft human genome sequence tell us how the cell cycle works and how it evolved? We studied two protein families--the cyclins and their partners the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks)--and a conserved regulatory circuit, the spindle checkpoint. Disappointingly, we discovered a few novel cyclins and no new Cdks or components of the spindle checkpoint, and could shed little light on the organization of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2015638905,"Assessing the energy costs of development in extreme environments is important for understanding how organisms can exist at the margins of the biosphere. Macromolecular turnover rates of RNA and protein were measured at -1.5 degrees C during early development of an Antarctic sea urchin. Contrary to expectations of low synthesis with low metabolism at low temperatures, protein and RNA synthesis rates exhibited temperature compensation and were equivalent to rates in temperate sea urchin embryos. High protein metabolism with a low metabolic rate is energetically possible in this Antarctic sea urchin because the energy cost of protein turnover, 0.45 joules per milligram of protein, is 1/25th the values reported for other animals."
https://openalex.org/W2023435500,"Telomeres are the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. To ensure that no large stretches of uncharacterized DNA remain between the ends of the human working draft sequence and the ends of each chromosome, we would need to connect the sequences of the telomeres to the working draft sequence. But telomeres have an unusual DNA sequence composition and organization that makes them particularly difficult to isolate and analyse. Here we use specialized linear yeast artificial chromosome clones, each carrying a large telomere-terminal fragment of human DNA, to integrate most human telomeres with the working draft sequence. Subtelomeric sequence structure appears to vary widely, mainly as a result of large differences in subtelomeric repeat sequence abundance and organization at individual telomeres. Many subtelomeric regions appear to be gene-rich, matching both known and unknown expressed genes. This indicates that human subtelomeric regions are not simply buffers of nonfunctional 'junk DNA' next to the molecular telomere, but are instead functional parts of the expressed genome."
https://openalex.org/W2040295661,"Seafloor spreading is accommodated by volcanic and tectonic processes along the global mid-ocean ridge system. As spreading rate decreases the influence of volcanism also decreases, and it is unknown whether significant volcanism occurs at all at ultraslow spreading rates (<1.5 cm yr(-1)). Here we present three-dimensional sonar maps of the Gakkel ridge, Earth's slowest-spreading mid-ocean ridge, located in the Arctic basin under the Arctic Ocean ice canopy. We acquired this data using hull-mounted sonars attached to a nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Hawkbill. Sidescan data for the ultraslow-spreading (approximately 1.0 cm yr(-1)) eastern Gakkel ridge depict two young volcanoes covering approximately 720 km2 of an otherwise heavily sedimented axial valley. The western volcano coincides with the average location of epicentres for more than 250 teleseismic events detected in 1999, suggesting that an axial eruption was imaged shortly after its occurrence. These findings demonstrate that eruptions along the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel ridge are focused at discrete locations and appear to be more voluminous and occur more frequently than was previously thought."

By this approach, we could establish the long-range organization of the maps early in the project, and all contig extension, gap closure and problem-solving was simplified by containment within local regions. The maps currently represent more than 94% of the euchromatic (gene-containing) regions of these chromosomes in 176 contigs, and contain 96% of the chromosome-specific markers in the human gene map.

https://openalex.org/W2000862340,Tomographic images of upper mantle velocity structure beneath an overlapping spreading center (OSC) on the East Pacific Rise indicate that this ridge axis discontinuity is underlain by a continuous region of low P -wave velocities. The anomalous structure can be explained by an approximately 16-kilometer-wide region of high temperatures and melt fractions of a few percent by volume. Our results show that OSCs are not necessarily associated with a discontinuity in melt supply and that both OSC limbs are supplied with melt from a mantle source located beneath the OSC. We conclude that tectonic segmentation of the ridge by OSCs is not the direct result of magmatic segmentation at mantle depths.

https://openalex.org/W1991481111,"The extracellular N-terminal domain of the human Ca(2+) receptor (hCaR) consists of a Venus's-flytrap (VFT) domain and a cysteine-rich (Cys-rich) domain. We have shown earlier that the Cys-rich domain is critical for signal transmission from the VFT domain to the seven-transmembrane domain. The VFT domain contains 10 cysteines: two of them (Cys(129) and Cys(131)) were identified as involved in intermolecular disulfide bonds necessary for homodimerization, and six others (Cys(60)-Cys(101), Cys(358)-Cys(395), and Cys(437)-Cys(449)) are predicted to form three intramolecular disulfide bonds. The Cys-rich domain contains nine cysteines, the involvement of which in disulfide bond formation has not been defined. In this work, we asked whether the remaining cysteines in the hCaR VFT, namely Cys(236) and Cys(482), form disulfide bond(s) with cysteines in the Cys-rich domain. We constructed mutant hCaRs with a unique tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site inserted between the VFT domain and the Cys-rich domain. These mutant hCaRs remain fully functional compared with the wild type hCaR. After TEV protease digestion of the mutant hCaR proteins, dimers of the VFT were identified on Western blot under nonreducing conditions. We concluded that there is no disulfide bond between the VFT and the Cys-rich domains in the hCaR."
