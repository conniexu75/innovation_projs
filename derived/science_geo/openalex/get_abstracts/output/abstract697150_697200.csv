https://openalex.org/W4286007893,"The APOBEC3 family of cytosine deaminases has been implicated in some of the most prevalent mutational signatures in cancer1-3. However, a causal link between endogenous APOBEC3 enzymes and mutational signatures in human cancer genomes has not been established, leaving the mechanisms of APOBEC3 mutagenesis poorly understood. Here, to investigate the mechanisms of APOBEC3 mutagenesis, we deleted implicated genes from human cancer cell lines that naturally generate APOBEC3-associated mutational signatures over time4. Analysis of non-clustered and clustered signatures across whole-genome sequences from 251 breast, bladder and lymphoma cancer cell line clones revealed that APOBEC3A deletion diminished APOBEC3-associated mutational signatures. Deletion of both APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B further decreased APOBEC3 mutation burdens, without eliminating them. Deletion of APOBEC3B increased APOBEC3A protein levels, activity and APOBEC3A-mediated mutagenesis in some cell lines. The uracil glycosylase UNG was required for APOBEC3-mediated transversions, whereas the loss of the translesion polymerase REV1 decreased overall mutation burdens. Together, these data represent direct evidence that endogenous APOBEC3 deaminases generate prevalent mutational signatures in human cancer cells. Our results identify APOBEC3A as the main driver of these mutations, indicate that APOBEC3B can restrain APOBEC3A-dependent mutagenesis while contributing its own smaller mutation burdens and dissect mechanisms that translate APOBEC3 activities into distinct mutational signatures."
https://openalex.org/W4286005456,"Abstract Oocytes form before birth and remain viable for several decades before fertilization 1 . Although poor oocyte quality accounts for most female fertility problems, little is known about how oocytes maintain cellular fitness, or why their quality eventually declines with age 2 . Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced as by-products of mitochondrial activity are associated with lower rates of fertilization and embryo survival 3–5 . Yet, how healthy oocytes balance essential mitochondrial activity with the production of ROS is unknown. Here we show that oocytes evade ROS by remodelling the mitochondrial electron transport chain through elimination of complex I. Combining live-cell imaging and proteomics in human and Xenopus oocytes, we find that early oocytes exhibit greatly reduced levels of complex I. This is accompanied by a highly active mitochondrial unfolded protein response, which is indicative of an imbalanced electron transport chain. Biochemical and functional assays confirm that complex I is neither assembled nor active in early oocytes. Thus, we report a physiological cell type without complex I in animals. Our findings also clarify why patients with complex-I-related hereditary mitochondrial diseases do not experience subfertility. Complex I suppression represents an evolutionarily conserved strategy that allows longevity while maintaining biological activity in long-lived oocytes."

These challenges impair HSC function, but whether this functional impairment extends beyond the duration of inflammatory exposure is unknown. Unexpectedly, we observed an irreversible depletion of functional HSCs following challenge with inflammation or bacterial infection, with no evidence of any recovery up to 1 year afterward. HSCs from challenged mice demonstrated multiple cellular and molecular features of accelerated aging and developed clinically relevant blood and bone marrow phenotypes not normally observed in aged laboratory mice but commonly seen in elderly humans. In vivo HSC self-renewal divisions were absent or extremely rare during both challenge and recovery periods. The progressive, irreversible attrition of HSC function demonstrates that temporally discrete inflammatory events elicit a cumulative inhibitory effect on HSCs. This work positions early/mid-life inflammation as a mediator of lifelong defects in tissue maintenance and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4286007946,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an antiviral signalling protein that is broadly conserved in both innate immunity in animals and phage defence in prokaryotes1-4. Activation of STING requires its assembly into an oligomeric filament structure through binding of a cyclic dinucleotide4-13, but the molecular basis of STING filament assembly and extension remains unknown. Here we use cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structure of the active Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-STING filament complex from a Sphingobacterium faecium cyclic-oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling system (CBASS) defence operon. Bacterial TIR-STING filament formation is driven by STING interfaces that become exposed on high-affinity recognition of the cognate cyclic dinucleotide signal c-di-GMP. Repeating dimeric STING units stack laterally head-to-head through surface interfaces, which are also essential for human STING tetramer formation and downstream immune signalling in mammals5. The active bacterial TIR-STING structure reveals further cross-filament contacts that brace the assembly and coordinate packing of the associated TIR NADase effector domains at the base of the filament to drive NAD+ hydrolysis. STING interface and cross-filament contacts are essential for cell growth arrest in vivo and reveal a stepwise mechanism of activation whereby STING filament assembly is required for subsequent effector activation. Our results define the structural basis of STING filament formation in prokaryotic antiviral signalling."
https://openalex.org/W4286007968,"The ability to associate temporally segregated information and assign positive or negative valence to environmental cues is paramount for survival. Studies have shown that different projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are potentiated following reward or punishment learning1-7. However, we do not yet understand how valence-specific information is routed to the BLA neurons with the appropriate downstream projections, nor do we understand how to reconcile the sub-second timescales of synaptic plasticity8-11 with the longer timescales separating the predictive cues from their outcomes. Here we demonstrate that neurotensin (NT)-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) projecting to the BLA (PVT-BLA:NT) mediate valence assignment by exerting NT concentration-dependent modulation in BLA during associative learning. We found that optogenetic activation of the PVT-BLA:NT projection promotes reward learning, whereas PVT-BLA projection-specific knockout of the NT gene (Nts) augments punishment learning. Using genetically encoded calcium and NT sensors, we further revealed that both calcium dynamics within the PVT-BLA:NT projection and NT concentrations in the BLA are enhanced after reward learning and reduced after punishment learning. Finally, we showed that CRISPR-mediated knockout of the Nts gene in the PVT-BLA pathway blunts BLA neural dynamics and attenuates the preference for active behavioural strategies to reward and punishment predictive cues. In sum, we have identified NT as a neuropeptide that signals valence in the BLA, and showed that NT is a critical neuromodulator that orchestrates positive and negative valence assignment in amygdala neurons by extending valence-specific plasticity to behaviourally relevant timescales."
https://openalex.org/W4285805988,"Human cleavage-stage embryos frequently acquire chromosomal aneuploidies during mitosis due to unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that S phase at the 1-cell stage shows replication fork stalling, low fork speed, and DNA synthesis extending into G2 phase. DNA damage foci consistent with collapsed replication forks, DSBs, and incomplete replication form in G2 in an ATR- and MRE11-dependent manner, followed by spontaneous chromosome breakage and segmental aneuploidies. Entry into mitosis with incomplete replication results in chromosome breakage, whole and segmental chromosome errors, micronucleation, chromosome fragmentation, and poor embryo quality. Sites of spontaneous chromosome breakage are concordant with sites of DNA synthesis in G2 phase, locating to gene-poor regions with long neural genes, which are transcriptionally silent at this stage of development. Thus, DNA replication stress in mammalian preimplantation embryos predisposes gene-poor regions to fragility, and in particular in the human embryo, to the formation of aneuploidies, impairing developmental potential."
https://openalex.org/W4285806771,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a neuromodulation therapy for a broad and expanding set of neurologic conditions. However, the mechanism through which VNS influences central nervous system circuitry is not well described, limiting therapeutic optimization. VNS leads to widespread brain activation, but the effects on behavior are remarkably specific, indicating plasticity unique to behaviorally engaged neural circuits. To understand how VNS can lead to specific circuit modulation, we leveraged genetic tools including optogenetics and in vivo calcium imaging in mice learning a skilled reach task. We find that VNS enhances skilled motor learning in healthy animals via a cholinergic reinforcement mechanism, producing a rapid consolidation of an expert reach trajectory. In primary motor cortex (M1), VNS drives precise temporal modulation of neurons that respond to behavioral outcome. This suggests that VNS may accelerate motor refinement in M1 via cholinergic signaling, opening new avenues for optimizing VNS to target specific disease-relevant circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W4286005654,"Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to multiple nutrients, including the essential amino acid leucine1. Recent work in cultured mammalian cells established the Sestrins as leucine-binding proteins that inhibit mTORC1 signalling during leucine deprivation2,3, but their role in the organismal response to dietary leucine remains elusive. Here we find that Sestrin-null flies (Sesn-/-) fail to inhibit mTORC1 or activate autophagy after acute leucine starvation and have impaired development and a shortened lifespan on a low-leucine diet. Knock-in flies expressing a leucine-binding-deficient Sestrin mutant (SesnL431E) have reduced, leucine-insensitive mTORC1 activity. Notably, we find that flies can discriminate between food with or without leucine, and preferentially feed and lay progeny on leucine-containing food. This preference depends on Sestrin and its capacity to bind leucine. Leucine regulates mTORC1 activity in glial cells, and knockdown of Sesn in these cells reduces the ability of flies to detect leucine-free food. Thus, nutrient sensing by mTORC1 is necessary for flies not only to adapt to, but also to detect, a diet deficient in an essential nutrient."
https://openalex.org/W4286005784,"Data regarding women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during early trimesters are scarce. We aimed to assess preterm birth (PTB) and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) rates in a large and unselected cohort by trimester at infection and overall.A retrospective cohort study including all women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test during a non-ectopic singleton pregnancy between February 21st 2020 and July 2nd 2021 (N = 2753). Each infected woman was matched to a non-infected pregnant woman by age, last menstruation date, sector, and socioeconomic status.Logistic regression was conducted to assess the risks of PTB and SGA including an interaction between group and trimester of infection. Multivariable models included underlying diseases, previous abortions and null parity. Subgroup analyses were conducted on symptomatic infected women and matched non-infected women.A total of 2753 /2789 (98.7%) eligible women that were infected during pregnancy could be matched, among them, 17.4% and 48.4% were infected during the first and third trimesters, respectively. While first and second trimester infections were not associated with PTB (p>0.8), third trimester infections and in particular after 34 weeks of gestation had a greater risk of PTB with adjusted ORs of 2.76 (95% CI 1.63-4.67) and 7.10 (95% CI 2.44-20.61), respectively. PTB risk was further heightened in symptomatic third trimester infections (OR = 4.28, 95% CI 1.94-9.25). SGA risk was comparable between study groups across all trimesters of infection. Pregnancy loss incidence was similar in both groups (adjusted OR = 1.16; 95% CI 0.90-1.50).SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased risk of PTB only among women infected during late pregnancy, particularly among symptomatic women."
https://openalex.org/W4286005475,"Dengue fever is a severe disease spread by Aedes mosquito-borne dengue viruses (DENVs) in tropical areas such as Bangladesh. Since its breakout in the 1960s, dengue fever has been endemic in Bangladesh, with the highest concentration of infections in the capital, Dhaka. This study aims to develop a machine learning model that can use relevant information about the factors that cause Dengue outbreaks within a geographic region. To predict dengue cases in 11 different districts of Bangladesh, we created a DengueBD dataset and employed two machine learning algorithms, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). This research also explores the correlation among environmental factors like temperature, rainfall, and humidity with the rise and decline trend of Dengue cases in different cities of Bangladesh. The entire dataset was divided into an 80:20 ratio, with 80 percent used for training and 20% used for testing. The research findings imply that, for both the MLR with 67% accuracy along with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.57 and SVR models with 75% accuracy along with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.95, the number of dengue cases reduces throughout the winter season in the country and increases mainly during the rainy season in the next ten months, from August 2021 to May 2022. Importantly, Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, will see the maximum number of dengue patients during this period. Overall, the results of this data-driven analysis show that machine learning algorithms have enormous potential for predicting dengue epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W4286256609,"Area CA2 is a critical region for diverse hippocampal functions including social recognition memory. This region has unique properties and connectivity. Notably, intra-hippocampal excitatory inputs to CA2 lack canonical long-term plasticity, but inhibitory transmission expresses a long-term depression mediated by Delta-opioid receptors (DOR-iLTDs). Evidence indicates that DOR-iLTDs are insufficient to underlie social coding. Here, we report a novel inhibitory plasticity mediated by cannabinoid type 1 receptor activation (CB1R-iLTD). Surprisingly, CB1R-iLTD requires previous induction of DOR-iLTDs, indicating a permissive role for DOR plasticity. Blockade of CB1Rs in CA2 completely prevents social memory formation. Furthermore, the sequentiality of DOR- and CB1R-mediated plasticity occurs in vivo during successive social interactions. Finally, CB1R-iLTD is altered in a mouse model of schizophrenia with impaired social cognition but is rescued by a manipulation that also rescues social memory. Altogether, our data reveal a unique interplay between two inhibitory plasticities and a novel mechanism for social memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W4285993188,"The success of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy in the treatment of hematologic malignancies has prompted the development of numerous CAR-T technologies, including switchable CAR-T (sCAR-T) systems that combine a universal CAR-T with bispecific adapter proteins. Owing to their controllability and versatility, sCAR-Ts have received considerable attention. To explore the therapeutic utility of sCAR-Ts targeting the receptor tyrosine kinase ROR1, which is expressed in hematologic and solid malignancies, and to identify bispecific adaptor proteins that efficiently mediate universal CAR-T engagement, a panel of switches based on ROR1-targeting Fabs with different epitopes and affinities was compared in in vitro and in vivo models of ROR1-expressing cancers. For switches targeting overlapping or identical epitopes, potency correlated with affinity. Surprisingly, however, we identified a switch targeting a unique epitope with low affinity but mediating potent and selective antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Converted to a conventional CAR-T, the same anti-ROR1 mAb (324) outperformed a clinically investigated conventional CAR-T that is based on an anti-ROR1 mAb (R12) with ~200-fold higher affinity. Thus, demonstrating therapeutic utility on their own, sCAR-Ts also facilitate higher throughput screening for the identification of conventional CAR-T candidates for preclinical and clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W4286005558,"This study surveyed people regarding their acceptance of periodic doses (i.e., annual boosters) of the COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, factors that correlate with attitudes toward periodic COVID-19 vaccines were assessed and identified.The study employed a cross-sectional methodology. The study questionnaire was distributed using Google Forms. Data were collected during the last quarter of 2021, and 1,416 adults (18 years old and over) from Jordan responded. Acceptance of COVID-19 periodic vaccine doses was calculated as a percentage of the total number of study participants, and their attitudes were scored. A multiple regression model was used to determine the predictors of public attitudes toward the annual dose of COVID-19 vaccines.The acceptance rate for receiving periodic doses of the COVID-19 vaccine was low (19.3%). Additionally, 26% of participants were unsure about receiving additional doses of the vaccine. However, 54.7% had a negative attitude toward getting periodic doses. The mean score for attitudes toward periodic doses was 47.9 (range: 29-66). Among the identified factors leading to decisions not to receive periodic doses were side effects (49.1%), waiting for further clinical studies (38.8%), and perceived no risk of contracting COVID-19 (17.7%). Regression analysis showed that income, educational attainment, and following the news about COVID-19 were predictors of participants' attitudes toward the periodic COVID-19 vaccine.Acceptance of periodic doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in Jordan is low, and the public's attitude is generally negative. Health programs and educational interventions are needed to promote vaccine acceptance and positive attitudes."
https://openalex.org/W4286008886,"In the last decade, several cases affected by Developmental Topographical Disorientation (DTD) have been described. DTD consists of a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting the ability to orient in the environment despite well-preserved cognitive functions, and in the absence of a brain lesion or other neurological or psychiatric conditions. Described cases showed different impairments in navigational skills ranging from topographic memory deficits to landmark agnosia. All cases lacked a mental representation of the environment that would allow them to use high-order spatial orientation strategies. In addition to the single case studies, a group study performed in Canada showed that the disorder is more widespread than imagined. The present work intends to investigate the occurrence of the disorder in 1,698 young Italian participants. The sample is deliberately composed of individuals aged between 18 and 35 years to exclude people who could manifest the loss of the ability to navigate as a result of an onset of cognitive decline. The sample was collected between 2016 and 2019 using the Qualtrics platform, by which the Familiarity and Spatial Cognitive Style Scale and anamnestic interview were administered. The data showed that the disorder is present in 3% of the sample and that the sense of direction is closely related to town knowledge, navigational strategies adopted, and gender. In general, males use more complex navigational strategies than females, although DTD is more prevalent in males than in females, in line with the already described cases. Finally, the paper discusses which protective factors can reduce DTD onset and which intervention measures should be implemented to prevent the spread of navigational disorders, which severely impact individuals' autonomy and social relationships."

Siemens AI Pathway Companion is a decision support tool that provides physicians with comprehensive patient information from various systems. In the present study, we examined the impact of providing organized patient information in comprehensive dashboards on information quality, effectiveness, and satisfaction of physicians in the clinical decision-making process.Ten urologists in our department performed the entire diagnostic workup to treatment decision for 10 patients in the prostate cancer screening setting. Expenditure of time, information quality, and user satisfaction during the decision-making process with AI Pathway Companion were recorded and compared to the current workflow.A significant reduction in the physician's expenditure of time for the decision-making process by -59.9% (p < 0,001) was found using the software. System usage showed a high positive effect on evaluated information quality parameters completeness (Cohen's d of 2.36), format (6.15), understandability (2.64), as well as user satisfaction (4.94).The software demonstrated that comprehensive organization of information improves physician's effectiveness and satisfaction in the clinical decision-making process. Further development is needed to map more complex patient pathways, such as the follow-up treatment of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4286005595,"Electronic health record (EHR) databases provide an opportunity to facilitate characterization and trends in patients with COVID-19.Patients with COVID-19 were identified based on an ICD-10 diagnosis code for COVID-19 (U07.1) and/or a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral lab result from January 2020 to November 2020. Patients were characterized in terms of demographics, healthcare utilization, clinical comorbidities, therapies, laboratory results, and procedures/care received, including critical care, intubation/ventilation, and occurrence of death were described, overall and by month.There were 393,773 patients with COVID-19 and 56,996 with a COVID-19 associated hospitalization. A greater percentage of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 relative to all COVID-19 cases were older, male, African American, and lived in the Northeast and South. The most common comorbidities before admission/infection date were hypertension (40.8%), diabetes (29.5%), and obesity (23.8%), and the most common diagnoses during hospitalization were pneumonia (59.6%), acute respiratory failure (44.8%), and dyspnea (28.0%). A total of 85.7% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had CRP values > 10 mg/L, 75.5% had fibrinogen values > 400 mg/dL, and 76.8% had D-dimer values > 250 ng/mL. Median values for platelets, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and fibrinogen tended to decrease from January-March to November. The use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine during hospitalization peaked by March (71.2%) and was used rarely by May (5.1%) and less than 1% afterwards, while the use of remdesivir had increased by May (10.0%) followed by dexamethasone by June (27.7%). All-cause mortality was 3.2% overall and 15.0% among those hospitalized; 21.0% received critical care and 16.0% received intubation/ventilation/ECMO.This study characterizes US patients with COVID-19 and their management during hospitalization over the first eleven months of this disease pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4286007951,"While the recent advancements of computed tomography (CT) technology have contributed in reducing radiation dose and image noise, an objective evaluation of image quality in patient scans has not yet been established. In this study, we present a patient-specific CT image quality evaluation method that includes fully automated measurements of noise level, structure sharpness, and alteration of structure. This study used the CT images of 120 patients from four different CT scanners reconstructed with three types of algorithm: filtered back projection (FBP), vendor-specific iterative reconstruction (IR), and a vendor-agnostic deep learning model (DLM, ClariCT.AI, ClariPi Inc.). The structure coherence feature (SCF) was used to divide an image into the homogeneous ( R H ) and structure edge ( R S ) regions, which in turn were used to localize the regions of interests (ROIs) for subsequent analysis of image quality indices. The noise level was calculated by averaging the standard deviations from five randomly selected ROIs on R H , and the mean SCFs on R S was used to estimate the structure sharpness. The structure alteration was defined by the standard deviation ratio between R S and R H on the subtraction image between FBP and IR or DLM, in which lower structure alterations indicate successful noise reduction without degradation of structure details. The estimated structure sharpness showed a high correlation of 0.793 with manually measured edge slopes. Compared to FBP, IR and DLM showed 34.38% and 51.30% noise reduction, 2.87% and 0.59% lower structure sharpness, and 2.20% and -12.03% structure alteration, respectively, on an average. DLM showed statistically superior performance to IR in all three image quality metrics. This study is expected to contribute to enhance the CT protocol optimization process by allowing a high throughput and quantitative image quality evaluation during the introduction or adjustment of lower-dose CT protocol into routine practice."
https://openalex.org/W4286210129,"The Chinese Government commenced the One Belt One Road (OBOR) project in 2013 for the multidimensional development to restore the historical Silk Road paradigms. The Economic Corridor provides networks and connections based on two geographical territories. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is one of them, a chunk of the Silk Road Economic Belt’s economic corridors. CPEC would be an economic game-changer for Pakistan. It will generate businesses, minimize poverty, generate employment opportunities, and improve local communities’ health and education. However, it is more lucrative for the Chinese economy because CPEC is a safe, cheapest, and shortest route for importing energy rather than other routes. The present study investigates the social, infrastructural, and tourism effects of CPEC through the mediation role of rural development and knowledge sharing, including income, employment, business, land-use change variables, and CPEC adoptability for a local community in Pakistan. This study is based on four different regions of Gilgit Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh in Pakistan. The study incorporates the collected data from the respondents living on the CPEC routes via face-to-face interviews from citizens (cities, villages, and towns). Besides, the study applied univariate and Structural Equation Model techniques to draw the results. The study results reveal that CPEC plays a significant role in Pakistan’s socio-economic and rural development. This mega project’s expectations might bring positive changes in infrastructure development, energy sector, and social development projects in Pakistan. The Results also indicated that CPEC would link rural areas to urban areas, which would offer development opportunities for rural regions to achieve sustainable development."
https://openalex.org/W4286005518,"The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened continued access to public health services worldwide, including HIV prevention and care. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV service access and delivery in the Asia region.A descriptive, cross-sectional, online study, conducted between October-November 2020, assessed the impact of COVID-19 on HIV prevention and care among people living with HIV (PLHIV), key populations (KPs), and healthcare providers (HCPs). The study populations were recruited across ten Asian countries/territories, covering Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.Across the region, 702 PLHIV, 551 KPs, and 145 HCPs were recruited. Both PLHIV and KPs reported decreased or had yet to visit hospitals/clinics (PLHIV: 35.9%; KPs: 57.5%), reduced HIV RNA viral load testing (21.9%; 47.3%), and interruptions in antiretroviral therapy (ART) (22.3%) or decreased/complete stop of HIV prevention medication consumption (40.9%). Travel constraints (40.6%), financial issues (28.9%), and not receiving prescription refills (26.9%) were common reasons for interrupted ART access, whereas reduced engagements in behaviours that could increase the risks of HIV acquisition and transmission (57.7%), travel constraints (41.8%), and less hospital/clinic visits (36.7%) underlie the disruptions in HIV preventive medications. Decreased visits from PLHIV/KPs and rescheduled appointments due to clinic closure were respectively reported by 50.7%-52.1% and 15.6%-17.0% of HCPs; 43.6%-61.9% observed decreased ART/preventive medication refills. Although 85.0% of HCPs adopted telemedicine to deliver HIV care services, 56.4%-64.1% of PLHIV/KPs were not using telehealth services.The COVID-19 pandemic substantially disrupted HIV prevention to care continuum in Asia at the time of the study. The findings highlighted differences in HIV prevention to care continuum via telehealth services utilisation by PLHIV, KPs, and HCPs. Efforts are needed to optimise infrastructure and adapt systems for continued HIV care with minimal disruptions during health emergency crises."
https://openalex.org/W4286210176,"It is well established that counter-regulation to hypoxia follows a hierarchical pattern, with brain-sparing in preference to peripheral tissues. In contrast, it is unknown if the same hierarchical sequence applies to recovery from hypoxia after correction of anemia with packed red blood cell transfusion (PRBCT).To understand the chronology of cerebral and splanchnic tissue oxygenation resulting after correction of anemia by PRBCT in preterm infants using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).Prospective cohort study.Neonatal intensive care.Haemodynamically stable infants: <32 weeks gestation, <37weeks postmenstrual age, <1500 grams birth weight; and ≥120 mL/kg/day feeds tolerated.PRBCT at 15 mL/Kg over 4 hours.Transfusion-associated changes were determined by comparing the 4-hour mean pre-transfusion cerebral and splanchnic fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOEc0; FTOEs0) with hourly means during (FTOEc1-4; FTOEs1-4) and for 24 hours after PRBCT completion (FTOEc5-28; FTOEs5-28).Of 30 enrolled infants, 14[46.7%] male; median[IQR] birth weight, 923[655-1064]g; gestation, 26.4[25.5-28.1]weeks; enrolment weight, 1549[1113-1882]g; and postmenstrual age, 33.6[32.4-35]weeks, 1 infant was excluded because of corrupted NIRS data. FTOEc significantly decreased during and for 24 hours after PRBCT (p < 0.001), indicating prompt improvement in cerebral oxygenation. In contrast, FTOEs showed no significant changes during and after PRBCT (p>0.05), indicating failure of improvement in splanchnic oxygenation.Improvement in regional oxygenation after PRBCT follows the same hierarchical pattern with a prompt improvement of cerebral but not splanchnic tissue oxygenation. We hypothesise that this hierarchical recovery may indicate continued splanchnic hypoxia in the immediate post-transfusion period and vulnerability to transfusion-associated necrotizing enterocolitis (TANEC). Our study provides a possible mechanistic underpinning for TANEC and warrants future randomised controlled studies to stratify its prevention."
https://openalex.org/W4286005788,"In vivo biomechanical characterization of the cornea remains a challenge. We have developed a high-frequency ultrasound elastography method, the ocular pulse elastography (OPE), to measure corneal axial displacement (CAD) induced by the ocular pulse. Here we compared CAD and a stiffness index derived from CAD between keratoconus patients and normal controls. We also explored the trend of these parameters with keratoconus grade. Twenty normal subjects and twenty keratoconus patients were recruited in this study. Corneal topography, tomography, intraocular pressure (IOP) and ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) were obtained in each measured eye. The cornea’s heartbeat-induced cyclic axial displacements were measured by high-frequency (50 MHz) ultrasound. A corneal stiffness index (CSI) was derived from CAD normalized against OPA. CAD and CSI were compared between normal and keratoconus groups, and across keratoconus grades. Keratoconus corneas had significantly greater CAD and lower CSI than normal controls (p’s&lt;0.01). Both parameters correlated strongly with grade, in which CAD increased significantly (p = 0.002) and CSI decreased significantly (p = 0.011) with grade. These results suggested a biomechanical weakening in keratoconus which worsens at higher disease severity. This study also demonstrated the ability of high-frequency ultrasound elastography to provide a safe, quick, and accurate evaluation of the cornea’s biomechanical condition in vivo. The OPE-measured biomechanical metrics, when integrated with existing diagnostic criteria, may aid the decision-making in the early and definitive diagnosis and staging of keratoconus."
https://openalex.org/W4286005836,"To evaluate the correlation between clinical presentations, radiological findings and high risk histopathological features of primary enucleated eyes in patients with advanced retinoblastoma at a tertiary child hospital in Thailand.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who were treated with primary enucleation of tumor eyes between 2015-2020. Demographic data, radiological assessment, and histopathological findings were collected. The association between clinical presentations and high-risk histopathological features in the primary enucleated eyes were evaluated. The radiological findings, which showed characteristic of high risk features, were compared with the histopathological findings.Thirty-three enucleated eyes were enrolled in this study. The mean age at diagnosis was 23.12 months. Most patients had unilateral group E retinoblastoma, with no difference in sex and laterality of the eye. Leukocoria was the most common presentation, followed by proptosis and uveitis. Older age at presentation were statistically associated with post laminar cribrosa optic nerve invasion (P-value 0.0027) and high-risk histopathological features in enucleated eyes (P-value 0.0032). Clinical presentations with proptosis were statistically associated with post laminar cribrosa optic nerve invasion, while leukocoria and uveitis were statistically associated with anterior segment invasion. Unifocal intraocular mass with necrosis was the most common histopathological finding. High-risk features were found in 45% of primary enucleated eye. The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detected optic nerve invasion in retinoblastoma patients were 75% and 54%, respectively.Patients with unilateral retinoblastoma who presented with older age related to high-risk features after enucleation. Ophthalmic examination with slitlamp is the best way for detection of anterior segment invasion. Choroidal invasion was unable to predict with clinical presentation.

However, the presence of cholesterols and lipids in serum greatly hinders the analysis of the effects of cholesterol depletion on cells in culture. In this study, we developed a defined serum-free culture condition accessible to a variety of different types of adherent cancer cells. We tested different factors that are considered essential for cell culture and various extracellular matrix for plate coating, and found cells cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) basal media supplemented with Albumin (BSA) and insulin-transferrin-selenium-ethanolamine (ITS-X) on fibronectin-precoated plate (called as “DA-X condition”) showed comparable proliferation and survival to those in a serum-containing medium. Interestingly, we observed that DA-X condition could be adapted to a wide variety of adherent cancer cell lines, which enabled the analysis of how cholesterol depletion affected cancer cells in culture. Mechanistically, we found the beneficial effects of the DA-X condition in part can be attributed to the appropriate level of membrane cholesterol, and fibronectin-mediated signaling plays an important role in the suppression of cholesterol production."
https://openalex.org/W4286007942,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of intrahepatic tumors induces distant tumor growth through activation of interleukin 6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/tyrosine-protein kinase Met (c-MET) pathway. Yet, the predominant cellular source still needs to be identified as specific roles of the many types of periablational infiltrating immune cells requires further clarification. Here we report the key role of activated myofibroblasts in RFA-induced tumorigenesis and successful pharmacologic blockade. Murine models simulating RF tumorigenic effects on a macrometastatic tumor and intrahepatic micrometastatic deposits after liver ablation and a macrometastatic tumor after kidney ablation were used. Immune assays of ablated normal parenchyma demonstrated significantly increased numbers of activated myofibroblasts in the periablational rim, as well as increased HGF levels, recruitment other cellular infiltrates; macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells, HGF dependent growth factors; fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19) and receptor of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-1 (VEGFR-1), and proliferative indices; Ki-67 and CD34 for microvascular density. Furthermore, macrometastatic models demonstrated accelerated distant tumor growth at 7d post-RFA while micrometastatic models demonstrated increased intrahepatic deposit size and number at 14 and 21 days post-RFA. Multi-day atorvastatin, a selective fibroblast inhibitor, inhibited RFA-induced HGF and downstream growth factors, cellular markers and proliferative indices. Specifically, atorvastatin treatment reduced cellular and proliferative indices to baseline levels in the micrometastatic models, however only partially in macrometastatic models. Furthermore, adjuvant atorvastatin completely inhibited accelerated growth of macrometastasis and negated increased micrometastatic intrahepatic burden. Thus, activated myofibroblasts drive RF-induced tumorigenesis at a cellular level via induction of the HGF/c-MET/STAT3 axis, and can be successfully pharmacologically suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W4286007994,"Detailed, well-dated palaeoclimate and archaeological records are critical for understanding the impact of environmental change on human evolution. Ga-Mohana Hill, in the southern Kalahari, South Africa, preserves a Pleistocene archaeological sequence. Relict tufas at the site are evidence of past flowing streams, waterfalls, and shallow pools. Here, we use laser ablation screening to target material suitable for uranium-thorium dating. We obtained 33 ages covering the last 110 thousand years (ka) and identify five tufa formation episodes at 114-100 ka, 73-48 ka, 44-32 ka, 15-6 ka, and ~3 ka. Three tufa episodes are coincident with the archaeological units at Ga-Mohana Hill dating to ~105 ka, ~31 ka, and ~15 ka. Based on our data and the coincidence of dated layers from other local records, we argue that in the southern Kalahari, from ~240 ka to ~71 ka wet phases and human occupation are coupled, but by ~20 ka during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), they are decoupled."
https://openalex.org/W4286008115,"To address a major knowledge gap for flatback sea turtles (Natator depressus), a species endemic to Australia and considered 'Data Deficient' for IUCN Red List assessment, we present the first-ever skeletochronology-derived age and growth rate estimates for this species. Using a rare collection of bone samples gathered from across northern Australia, we applied skeletochronology and characterized the length-at-age relationship, established baseline growth rates from the hatchling to adult life stages, and produced empirical estimates of age-at- and size-at-sexual-maturation (ASM, SSM). We analyzed humeri from 74 flatback sea turtles ranging in body size from 6.0-96.0 cm curved carapace length (CCL), and recovered from Western Australia (n = 48), Eastern Australia (n = 13), central Australia (n = 8; Northern Territory n = 3, the Gulf of Carpentaria n = 5), and unknown locations (n = 5). We identified the onset of sexual maturity for 29 turtles, based on rapprochement growth patterns in the bones. Estimates for ASM ranged from 12.0 to 23.0 years (mean: 16.3 ± 0.53 SE), SSM ranged from 76.1 to 94.0 cm CCL (mean: 84.9 ± 0.90 SE), and maximum observed reproductive longevity was 31 years for a 45-year old male flatback. Growth was modeled as a smoothing spline fit to the size-at-age relationship and at the mean SSM (84.9 cm CCL) corresponded with a spline-predicted maturity age of 18 years (95% CI: 16 to 24), while mean nesting sizes reported in the literature (86.4 to 94 cm CCL) corresponded to estimated ages of 24+ years. A bootstrapped von Bertalanffy growth model was also applied and showed consistencies with the spline curve, yielding an estimated upper size limit, Linf, at 89.2 ± 0.04 cm (95% CI: 85.5 to 95.9 cm) with the intrinsic growth rate parameter, k, at 0.185 ± 0.0004 (0.16 to 0.22); at the same mean SSM (84.9 cm CCL) the estimated ASM was 16.3 ± 0.05 years (95% CI: 12.8 to 27.7 years). Lastly, four of the samples analyzed were collected from deceased adult females that had previous sizes known from on-going mark/recapture studies at nesting sites in Western Australia. The paired CCL data (measured at nesting and back-calculated) did not significantly differ (p = 0.875). This first skeletochronology study for flatback sea turtles generates valuable empirical estimates for ongoing conservation and management efforts."
https://openalex.org/W4286209385,"Changing climate and human demographics in the world’s mountains will have increasingly profound environmental and societal consequences across all elevations. Quantifying current human populations in and near mountains is crucial to ensure that any interventions in these complex social-ecological systems are appropriately resourced, and that valuable ecosystems are effectively protected. However, comprehensive and reproducible analyses on this subject are lacking. Here, we develop and implement an open workflow to quantify the sensitivity of mountain population estimates over recent decades, both globally and for several sets of relevant reporting regions, to alternative input dataset combinations. Relationships between mean population density and several potential environmental covariates are also explored across elevational bands within individual mountain regions (i.e. “sub-mountain range scale”). Globally, mountain population estimates vary greatly—from 0.344 billion (&lt;5% of the corresponding global total) to 2.289 billion (&gt;31%) in 2015. A more detailed analysis using one of the population datasets (GHS-POP) revealed that in ∼35% of mountain sub-regions, population increased at least twofold over the 40-year period 1975–2015. The urban proportion of the total mountain population in 2015 ranged from 6% to 39%, depending on the combination of population and urban extent datasets used. At sub-mountain range scale, population density was found to be more strongly associated with climatic than with topographic and protected-area variables, and these relationships appear to have strengthened slightly over time. Such insights may contribute to improved predictions of future mountain population distributions under scenarios of future climatic and demographic change. Overall, our work emphasizes that irrespective of data choices, substantial human populations are likely to be directly affected by—and themselves affect—mountainous environmental and ecological change. It thereby further underlines the urgency with which the multitudinous challenges concerning the interactions between mountain climate and human societies under change must be tackled."
https://openalex.org/W4286210065,"Access to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is threatened by the increased rate of loss to follow-up (LTFU) among adolescents on ART care. We investigated the rate of LTFU from HIV care and associated predictors among adolescents living with HIV/AIDS in Tanzania. A retrospective cohort analysis of adolescents on ART from January 2014 to December 2016 was performed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine failure probabilities and the Cox proportion hazard regression model was used to determine predictors of loss to follow up. A total of 25,484 adolescents were on ART between 2014 and 2016, of whom 78.4% were female and 42% of adolescents were lost to follow-up. Predictors associated with LTFU included; adolescents aged 15-19 years (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.57; 95% Confidence Interval (CI); 1.47-1.69), having HIV/TB co-infection (aHR: 1.58; 95% CI, 1.32-1.89), attending care at dispensaries (aHR: 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07-1.18) or health center (aHR: 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.15), and being malnourished (aHR: 2.27; 95% CI,1.56-3.23). Moreover, residing in the Lake Zone and having advanced HIV disease were associated with LTFU. These findings highlight the high rate of LTFU and the need for intervention targeting older adolescents with advanced diseases and strengthening primary public facilities to achieve the 2030 goal of ending HIV as a public health threat."
https://openalex.org/W4286210318,"Parkinson disease (PD) is associated with cognitive impairments. However, the underlying neural mechanism of cognitive impairments in PD is still not clear. This study aimed to investigate the anatomic alternations of gray matter in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and their associations with neurocognitive measurements.T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired from 23 PD patients with MCI, 23 PD patients without MCI, and 23 matched healthy controls. The MRI data were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surfaced-based morphometry (SBM) methods to assess the structural changes in gray matter volume and cortical thickness respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to examine the diagnostic accuracies of the indexes of interest. The correlations between the structural metrics and neurocognitive assessments (e.g., Montreal cognitive assessment, MOCA; Mini-mental state examination, MMSE) were further examined.PD patients with MCI showed reduced gray matter volume (GMV) in the frontal cortex (e.g., right inferior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus) and extended to insula as well as cerebellum compared with the healthy controls and PD patients without MIC. Thinner of cortical thickens in the temporal lobe (e.g., left middle temporal gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus) extending to parietal cortex (e.g., precuneus) were found in the PD patients with MCI relative to the healthy controls and PD patients without MCI.ROC analysis indicated that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values in the frontal, temporal, and subcortical structures (e.g., insula and cerebellum) could differentiate the PD patients with MCI and without MCI and healthy controls. Furthermore, GMV of the right middle frontal gyrus and cortical thickness of the right superior temporal gyrus were correlated with neurocognitive dysfunctions (e.g., MOCA and MMSE) in PD patients with MCI.This study provided further evidence that PD with MCI was associated with structural alternations of brain. Morphometric analysis focusing on the cortical and subcortical regions could be biomarkers of cognitive impairments in PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W4286210640,"The aim of the research was to evaluate fertilization technologies for the indicators of the quality and quantity of highbush blueberry yield. In the experiment, a similar level of mineral fertilization was used in all treatments. The experiment was to show the differences between fertilization with biostimulation and without biostimulation. The research was carried out in two seasons (2019-2020) on ´Bluecrop` shrubs growing in the Blueberry Experimental Field in central Poland (51° 55'42.7 ""N 20° 59'28.7"" E). Shrubs grow at a distance of 1 x 3 m. Plants are rejuvenated every year in spring and irrigated by drip. The experiment was carried out in a random block design (4 fertilizer treatments x 5 replications x 6 bushes). The experiment assessed the effect of fertilization on yield, berry mass, fruit setting, leaf surface and physicochemical parameters of fruit. Based on the conducted research, it was proved that the applied fertilization technologies had a significant impact on the size and quality of the yield of ""Bluecrop"" highbush blueberry. Particularly noteworthy is the fertilization technology with biostimulation (treatment T4), which has a positive effect on the yield, fruit mass, percentage of setting and firmness of the berries. Analysis of the issue in the light of the results of the conducted research shows that the use of biostimulated products has an important impact on the intensification of production while maintaining good quality of fruits. Through research, the positive effect of fertilization programs with biostimulation (treatment T4) on the most important production parameters of blueberry fruit from the producer's point of view has been proven."
https://openalex.org/W4286210776,"Background &amp; aims Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common health problems worldwide. Sleep apnea (SA) causes cardiovascular and metabolic problems, as well as a significant socioeconomic burden. Although several studies have found that SA causes NAFLD, there is no evidence that NAFLD causes SA. The goal of this study was to look at the relationship between NAFLD and SA in realworld data. Methods We evaluated 334,334 healthy individuals without comorbidities who underwent National Health checkups in the Republic of Korea from 2009 to 2014. NAFLD was defined by a surrogate marker, the fatty liver index (FLI). The association between FLI and SA was analyzed using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results During a median followup of 5.3 years, 1,351 patients (0.4%) were newly diagnosed with SA. Subjects were categorized into quartile groups according to FLI (range: Q1, 0–4.9; Q2, 5.0–12.5; Q3, 12.6–31.0; Q4, &gt;31.0). Subjects with higher FLIs had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of SA than those with lower FLIs (Q1, 119 [0.1%]; Q2, 210 [0.3%]; Q3, 339 [0.4%]; Q4, 683 [0.8%]; P &lt; 0.001). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) revealed that a higher FLI was independently associated with an increased risk of SA (HR between Q4 and Q1, 4.03; 95% confidence interval, 3.22–5.05; P &lt; 0.001). This association remained statistically significant after further adjustment for Body mass index (BMI) (HR between Q4 and Q1, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.69–2.83; P &lt; 0.001). FLI was significantly associated with an increased risk of new-onset SA regardless of baseline characteristics. Conclusion This study demonstrated that NAFLD, assessed by FLI, was independently associated with increased risk for SA in the healthy Korean population."
https://openalex.org/W4286005566,"In the context of the rapid nutrition transition experienced by middle-income countries of the Arab region, children and adolescent's food choices and dietary behaviors are early risk factors for the development of non-communicable diseases. Assessment of factors influencing food choices among this age group is challenging and is usually based on self-reported data, which are prone to information and recall bias. As the popularity of technologies and video gaming platforms increases, opportunities arise to use these tools to collect data on variables that affect food choice, dietary intake, and associated outcomes. This protocol paper describes the SCALE study (School and community drivers of child diets in Arab cities; identifying levers for intervention) which aims to explore the environments at the level of households, schools and communities in which children's food choices are made and consequently identify barriers and enablers to healthy food choices within these environments.Field studies are being conducted in primary schools, among children aged 9-12 years, in Greater Beirut, Lebanon and Greater Tunis, Tunisia. A stratified random sample of 50 primary schools (public and private) are selected and 50 children are randomly selected from grades 4-5-6 in each school. The study includes surveys with children, parents/caregivers, school directors, teachers, and nutrition/health educators to assess individual diets and the contextual factors that influence children's food choices. Innovative locally adapted tools and methods such as game-based choice experiments, wearable cameras and neighborhood mapping are used to describe the environments in which children's food choices are made.The SCALE study will generate contextual knowledge on factors in school and neighborhood environments that influence child dietary behaviors and will inform multi-level interventions and policies to address childhood malnutrition (under-and over-nutrition). By integrating methods from various disciplines, including economics, data science, nutrition, and public health and by considering factors at various levels (home, school, and neighborhood), the study will identify levers for intervention with the potential to improve children's dietary behaviors. This will help fill existing gaps in research on food systems and consequently guide positive change in Lebanon and Tunisia, with the potential for replicability in other contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4286005774,"The association between life event stress and depressive symptoms has not been analyzed in the general population before.In the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall study, we assessed the association of 1.) the presence of important life events and 2.) life event stress, with the amount of depressive symptoms in univariable linear regressions and in multivariable regressions adjusted for age and sex (model 1) and age, sex and optimism as important determinants of coping with life events (model 2). Presence of life events and life event stress were assessed with the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS), optimism with the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), and depressive symptoms with the 15-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).Of the total cohort of 4,814 participants, 1,120 had experienced important life events during the previous 6 months. Presence of important life events was significantly associated with higher CES-D scores (B = 2.6, 95%CI = 2.2 to 3.0, p < .001; model 2) compared to absence of life events. Associations were stronger for women than for men and for pessimists than for optimists. Among the participants with important life events, median (Q1; Q3) stress-score was 45.0 (39.0; 63.0). Stress-scores >Q3 were significantly associated with higher CES-D scores (2.2, 1.1 to 3.3, < .001) with a stronger association in pessimists than in optimists.Experiencing life-changing events is associated with depression. Women and individuals with pessimistic personality are especially vulnerable which should be considered in prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4286007871,"The presence of synanthropic rodents, such as Rattus norvegicus, in urban environments generates high costs of prophylaxis and control, in large part due to the environmental transmission of the pathogenic spirochete Leptospira interrogans, which causes leptospirosis. In Salvador, Brazil, The Center for Control of Zoonosis (CCZ) is responsible for planning and implementing Rodent Control Programs (RCP) which are based on chemical rodenticide. However, these strategies have not been standardized for use in developing countries.This study aimed to identify the effect of a chemical control campaign on the demographic variables of urban R. norvegicus, analyzing relative abundance, sex structure, body mass, and age of the population, as well as the characterization of spatial distribution among households, rodent capture campaigns and interventions.This study was carried out during 2015 in three valleys of an urban poor community in Salvador. Individuals of R. norvegicus were systematically captured before (Pre-intervention) and three months (1st post-intervention) and six months (2nd post-intervention) after a chemical control intervention conducted by the CCZ in two valleys of the study area while the third valley was not included in the intervention campaign and was used as a non-intervention reference. We used analysis of variance to determine if intervention affected demographic variables and chi-square to compare proportions of infested households (Rodent infestation index-PII).During the chemical intervention, 939 households were visited. In the pre-intervention campaign, an effort of 310 trap nights resulted in 43 rodents captured, and in the 1st and 2nd, post-intervention campaigns resulted in 47 rodents captured over 312 trap nights and 36 rodents captured over 324 traps-nights, respectively. The rodent infestation index (PII) points did not show a reduction between the period before the intervention and the two periods after the chemical intervention (70%, 72%, and 65%, respectively). Regarding relative abundances, there was no difference between valleys and period before and two periods after chemical intervention (trap success valley 1: 0,18; 0,19; 0,18 / Valley 3 0,15; 0,17; 0,13/ P>0,05). Other demographic results showed that there was no difference in demographic characteristics of the rodent population before and after the intervention, as well as there being no influence of the application of rodenticide on the areas of concentration of capture of rodents between the campaigns.Our study indicates that the chemical control was not effective in controlling the population of R. norvegicus and provides evidence of the need for re-evaluation of rodent control practices in urban poor community settings."

Whereas, the potential function and mechanism of miR-552 in VSMCs remains unclear. Our aim was to explore the role of miR-552 on VSMCs and underlying mechanism.MTT assay and transwell assay were used to measure the proliferation, invasion, and migration of human brain VSMCs (HBVSMCs) and mice VSMCs (mVSMCs), respectively. Bioinformatics tools and luciferase assay were adopted to verify the association between miR-552 and SKI. Rescue experiments were employed to assess the interaction of miR-552 and SKI in modulating biological functions in HBVSMCs and mVSMCs. The expression level of transcription factors (TFs)was measured via qRT-PCR assay. The effect of ATF4 on miR-552 and SKI expression was tested by qRT-PCR or western blot assay. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and JASPAR databases were used to analyze the regulatory linkage between ATF4 and miR-552.We found that miR-552 was upregulated in HBVSMCs treated with PDGF-bb and miR-552 overexpression could promote proliferation, invasion, and migration of HBVSMCs and mVSMCs, whereas, miR-552 knockdown had the opposite impact. In addition, we also found that SKI was a direct target of miR-552, which reversed miR-552-mediated proliferation, invasion, and migration in HBVSMCs and mVSMCs. Furthermore, we also discovered that miR-552 overexpression promoted the effects of ATF4 elevation on proliferation, migration and invasion of HBVSMCs and mVSMCs, but, miR-552 decline had the opposite impact.ATF4-miR-552-SKI axis played critical roles in the proliferation and migration of HBVSMCs and mVSMCs, which were closely involved in atherosclerosis (AS). Therefore, our findings might offer a novel therapeutic target for AS."

Despite the availability of management options, the progression of the disease as a function of waiting time may challenge the effort to attain a desired outcome. There is a conflicting report on the role of waiting time to initiate an appropriate treatment in improving patients’ survival. Objective This review aims to evaluate the association between delayed time to initiate any treatment indication with survival in patients with cervical cancer. Methods An internet-based literature search will be performed using text words, MESH terms and truncated words in databases, namely MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus. Grey literature searches in Google Scholar, Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD) and Dissertations and Theses Global will be made. All articles published until 30 th of December 2021 on human subjects will be searched without a language restriction. Studies which fulfil the inclusion criteria will be screened in full reading, selected, appraised and assessed for methodological quality by two independent reviewers. Data on participants, study methods, interventions, and outcomes will be abstracted. Included studies will be pooled for meta-analysis. Microsoft-Excel and R packages will be employed to carry out the statistical analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using Cochrane Q statistic, Tau 2 , and I 2 .

https://openalex.org/W4286209312,"Objectives This study aimed to explore current data collection and feedback practice, in the form of monitoring and evaluation, among youth mental health (YMH) services and healthcare commissioners; and to identify barriers and enablers to this practice. Design Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted via Zoom videoconferencing software. Data collection and analysis were informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Data were deductively coded to the 14 domains of the TDF and inductively coded to generate belief statements. Setting Healthcare commissioning organisations and YMH services in Australia. Participants Twenty staff from healthcare commissioning organisations and twenty staff from YMH services. Results The umbrella behaviour ‘monitoring and evaluation’ (ME) can be sub-divided into 10 specific sub-behaviours (e.g. planning and preparing, providing technical assistance, reviewing and interpreting data) performed by healthcare commissioners and YMH services. One hundred belief statements relating to individual, social, or environmental barriers and enablers were generated. Both participant groups articulated a desire to improve the use of ME for quality improvement and had particular interest in understanding the experiences of young people and families. Identified enablers included services and commissioners working in partnership, data literacy (including the ability to set appropriate performance indicators), relational skills, and provision of meaningful feedback. Barriers included data that did not adequately depict service performance, problems with data processes and tools, and the significant burden that data collection places on YMH services with the limited resources they have to do it. Conclusions Importantly, this study illustrated that the use of ME could be improved. YMH services, healthcare commissioners should collaborate on ME plans and meaningfully involve young people and families where possible. Targets, performance indicators, and outcome measures should explicitly link to YMH service quality improvement; and ME plans should include qualitative data. Streamlined data collection processes will reduce unnecessary burden, and YMH services should have the capability to interrogate their own data and generate reports. Healthcare commissioners should also ensure that they provide meaningful feedback to their commissioned services, and local and national organisations collecting youth mental health data should facilitate the sharing of this data. The results of the study should be used to design theory-informed strategies to improve ME use."
https://openalex.org/W4286210251,"In aging populations, multimorbidity (MM) is a significant challenge for health systems, however there are scarce evidence available in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, particularly in Brazil. A national cross-sectional study was conducted with 11,177 Brazilian older adults to evaluate the occurrence of MM and related clusters in Brazilians aged ≥ 60 years old. MM was assessed by a list of 16 physical and mental morbidities and it was defined considering ≥ 2 morbidities. The frequencies of MM and its associated factors were analyzed. After this initial approach, a network analysis was performed to verify the occurrence of clusters of MM and the network of interactions between coexisting morbidities. The occurrence of MM was 58.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 57.0-60.2). Hypertension (50.6%) was the most frequent morbidity and it was present all combinations of morbidities. Network analysis has demonstrated 4 MM clusters: 1) cardiometabolic; 2) respiratory + cancer; 3) musculoskeletal; and 4) a mixed mental illness + other diseases. Depression was the most central morbidity in the model according to nodes' centrality measures (strength, closeness, and betweenness) followed by heart disease, and low back pain. Similarity in male and female networks was observed with a conformation of four clusters of MM and cancer as an isolated morbidity. The prevalence of MM in the older Brazilians was high, especially in female sex and persons living in the South region of Brazil. Use of network analysis could be an important tool for identifying MM clusters and address the appropriate health care, research, and medical education for older adults in Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W4286210397,"Cancer has become a leading cause of death and aroused the cancer scare. Breast and cervical cancer are two main health threats for women. In order to reduce mortality through early detection and early treatment, cancer screening has been widely recommended and applied for breast and cervical cancer detection and prevention. However, the benefit of cancer screening has been a controversial issue for the recent decades. The Chinese government has launched a free screening program on breast and cervical cancer for women since 2009. There is lack of strong data and sufficient information, however, to examine the effect of breast and cervical cancer screening. A Difference-in-Difference model estimated by Cox proportional hazard estimation was applied to evaluate the effects of breast and cervical cancer screening using data from Nown County Cancer Registry between the year 2009 and 2013. Based on the case study in a county of central China, this study found that the screening program reduced the risk of death, but found the lion's share for the benefit has been mainly due to the cervical cancer screening rather breast cancer screening, which may be related to the difference between early detection screening and preventive screening. Our results suggest sufficient funding and better education of related cancer knowledge will be meaningful measures for the prevention and treatment of breast and cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4286007886,"Distributed leadership pattern has been a topic of growing interest in recent years, recognizing that much remains to be known about this phenomenon. The research on distributed leadership acknowledges that responsibility and power are not exclusively limited to one formal leader, but are distributed between formal and informal leaders. The decision-making behavior of team members plays a vital role in optimizing cooperation and team performance. Nevertheless, little attention is paid to investigating the underlying mechanisms about how people in a team cooperate to initiate effective interactions and enhance team performance. Game theory offers a comprehensive analysis of rational behavior under the circumstances of strategic interdependence. By organizing the formal leader, the informal leader, and the ordinary employee in a team, this study constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model and analyzes the internal mechanism of distributed leadership patterns. The study finds that the equilibrium of the three parties is affected by multiple factors. The simulation results reveal that the empowerment of the formal leader to the informal leader is indispensable to promoting optimal cooperation and team performance in distributed leadership patterns. These findings have theoretical implications for the distributed leadership literature and managerial implications for practitioners."
https://openalex.org/W4286008105,"Here, we describe DAB-quant, a novel, open-source program designed to facilitate objective quantitation of immunohistochemical (IHC) signal in large numbers of tissue slides stained with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB). Scanned slides are arranged into separate folders for negative controls and test slides, respectively. Otsu's method is applied to the negative control slides to define a threshold distinguishing tissue from empty space, and all pixels deemed tissue are scored for normalized red minus blue (NRMB) color intensity. Next, a user-defined tolerance for error is applied to the negative control slides to set a NRMB threshold distinguishing stained from unstained tissue and this threshold is applied to calculate the fraction of stained tissue pixels on each test slide. Results are recorded in a spreadsheet and pseudocolor images are presented to document how each pixel was categorized. Slides can be analyzed in full, or sampled using small boxes scattered randomly and automatically across the tissue area. Quantitation of sampling boxes enables faster processing, reveals the degree of heterogeneity of signal, and enables exclusion of problem areas on a slide, if needed.

https://openalex.org/W4286008176,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. miRNAs have been found in urine and have shown diagnostic potential in human nephropathies. Here, we aimed to characterize, for the first time, the feline urinary miRNAome and explore the use of urinary miRNA profiles as non-invasive biomarkers for feline pyelonephritis (PN). Thirty-eight cats were included in a prospective case-control study and classified in five groups: healthy Control cats (n = 11), cats with PN (n = 10), cats with subclinical bacteriuria or cystitis (SB/C, n = 5), cats with ureteral obstruction (n = 7) and cats with chronic kidney disease (n = 5). By small RNA sequencing we identified 212 miRNAs in cat urine, including annotated (n = 137) and putative novel (n = 75) miRNAs. The 15 most highly abundant urinary miRNAs accounted for nearly 71% of all detected miRNAs, most of which were previously identified in feline kidney. Ninety-nine differentially abundant (DA) miRNAs were identified when comparing Control cats to cats with urological conditions and 102 DA miRNAs when comparing PN to other urological conditions. Tissue clustering analysis revealed that the majority of urine samples clustered close to kidney, which confirm the likely cellular origin of the secreted urinary miRNAs. Relevant DA miRNAs were verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Eighteen miRNAs discriminated Control cats from cats with a urological condition. Of those, seven miRNAs were DA by both RNAseq and qPCR methods between Control and PN cats (miR-125b-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-21-5p, miR-27b-3p, miR-125a-5p, miR-17-5p and miR-23a-3p) or DA between Control and SB/C cats (miR-125b-5p). Six additional miRNAs (miR-30b-5p, miR-30c, miR-30e-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-27b-39 and miR-222) relevant for discriminating PN from other urological conditions were identified by qPCR alone (n = 4) or by both methods (n = 2) ( P &lt;0.05). This panel of 13 miRNAs has potential as non-invasive urinary biomarkers for diagnostic of PN and other urological conditions in cats."
https://openalex.org/W4286008659,"Heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the calcium sensing-receptor (CaSR), causes familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1), a typically benign condition characterized by mild hypercalcemia. In contrast, homozygous mutation of this dimer-forming G-protein coupled receptor manifests as the lethal neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT). To investigate the mechanisms by which CaSR mutations lead to these distinct disease states, we engineered wild-type (WT) and an exon 5-deficient disease-causing mutation, and transfected expression constructs into human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. WT protein was mainly membrane-expressed whereas the mutant CaSR protein (mCaSR) was confined to the cytoplasm. Co-expression of WT CaSR directed mCaSR to the cell membrane. In assays of CaSR function, increases in extracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]o) increased intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) in cells expressing WT CaSR while the response was reduced in cells co-expressing mutant and WT receptor. Untransfected cells or those expressing mCaSR alone, showed minimal, equivalent responses to increased [Ca2+]o. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed an association between mutant and wild-type CaSR. The affinity of the WT CaSR for calcium was three times greater than that of the heterodimer. The maximal functional response to [Ca]o was dependent on localization of CaSR to the membrane level and independent of homo- or heterodimerizations. In summary, these results suggest that heterodimerization of WT and mCaSR receptors, rescues the trafficking defect of the mutant receptors and also reduces the affinity of the WT-mutant heterodimer for [Ca]o. In contrast, the homozygous mutants do not produce functional receptors on cell membrane. These data indicate how substantial differences between signaling of hetero- and homodimeric mutants may lead to profound differences in the severity of disease in heterozygous and homozygous carriers of these mutations."
https://openalex.org/W4286008700,"Objective Effective and brief positive parenting interventions could be adopted widely, but evidence is limited. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a positive parenting programme in Hong Kong Chinese parents. Methods We conducted a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial in 2017 in 144 Hong Kong Chinese parents (84.7% women, mean age 42.5 [SD 5.87] years) of school-age children (mean age 10.9 [2.8] years) in 4 family service centres (clusters). The intervention included two 2-hour interactive talks (4 hours in total). The contents covered skills of giving praise, showing appreciation and playing enjoyable family games. The control group was offered the intervention after all the data were collected. Praise, appreciation and enjoyment related behaviours were measured as primary outcomes at baseline, 1 month and 3 months. The secondary outcomes were subjective happiness, wellbeing, personal health and happiness, family health, family happiness and harmony, and family relationship. After the completion of all assessments, five focus group discussions with the parents and four individual in-depth interviews with community service providers were conducted to explore their experiences. Results Compared with the control group (n = 69), the intervention group (n = 75) showed greater positive changes in appreciation and enjoyment at 3 months with small effect sizes ( d = 0.42 and 0.32, respectively), and greater improvements in the secondary outcomes at 3 months with small effect sizes ( d : 0.29–0.48). In the focus groups, the parents reported more praise to their children, better temper control, more focus on their children’s strengths and better family relationships. According to the service providers, most of the parents enjoyed the activities. Conclusions The brief intervention in community settings with the engagement of community service providers has shown preliminary effectiveness in promoting positive parenting and mental wellbeing of Hong Kong Chinese parents. Trial registration The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. The study reported in this manuscript is registered as clinical trial at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03282071 . https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03282071 ."
https://openalex.org/W4286209430,"Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between tear film lipid layer thickness and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) from the ocular area in patients with short tear break-up time (TBUT)-type dry eye and healthy controls. Methods This prospective study included 25 eyes of patients with short TBUT-type dry eye disease and 25 eyes of healthy controls. Results Tear film lipid layer thickness was measured using an interferometer, and TEWL from the ocular area was measured using a Tewameter TM300 with custom-made goggles. The correlation between tear film lipid layer thickness and TEWL was evaluated. Additionally, other parameters such as TBUT, Schirmer I score, ocular surface staining, the presence and type of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), ocular surface disease index (OSDI), and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were evaluated. Tear film lipid layer thickness did not show a significant correlation with TEWL from the ocular area measured using a Tewameter TM300. However, tear film lipid layer thickness was significantly correlated with tear break-up time (p = 0.004) and ocular surface staining by NEI (National Eye Institute) scheme (p = 0.03). TEWL showed positive correlation with the Schirmer I score ( p = 0.004). Conclusions The tear film lipid layer affected the stability of the tear film more than the amount of TEWL in patients with short TBUT dry eye and healthy controls."
https://openalex.org/W4286209574,"Mild curvature of the fifth finger (or clinodactyly) is a relatively common trait. While severe forms can cause functional impairment and are a feature of certain congenital syndromes, mild clinodactyly is considered a minor morphological variant. Despite exhibiting continuous variation, clinodactyly is rarely treated as a quantitative trait. Consequently, the degree of fifth finger curvature in the general population and the factors that impact this curvature are not well understood. In the present study, we measured fifth finger curvature in a sample of 1,295 U.S. adults and investigated the role of sex, age and body size. We found that clinodactyly exhibited a non-normal distribution. All participants displayed some degree of curvature, but it tended to be slight with an overall mean of 3.68 degrees (median: 3.58 degrees). In only 0.8% of cases did the curvature exceed the nominal 10-degree threshold for clinically meaningful clinodactyly. We did not find statically significant sex differences. Further, there was no meaningful relationship with height and only a weak positive relationship with age. We found that clinodactyly showed asymmetry; the curvature was greater on the left than on the right fifth finger (p < 2.2e-16), but this was not influenced by sex, age, or height. These results suggest the possibility that the kind of ubiquitous mild clinodactyly observed in the general population may be etiologically distinct from more rare and severe forms of the condition."

Images were independently evaluated by 2 radiologists. The sensitivities, specificities, accuracies, and areas under the curve (AUCs) for the differentiation between NMIBC and MIBC with fFOV DWI and with rFOV DWI sequence were calculated using VI-RADS. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) values were measured for each patient and averaged.The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC by reader 1 were 92%, 78%, 82% and 0.905 with fFOV DWI, and 92%, 86%, 88% and 0.916 with rFOV DWI sequence, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC by reader 2 were 96%, 76%, 82% and 0.900 with conventional DWI, and 96%, 81%, 85% and 0.907 with rFOV DWI sequence, respectively. The specificity and accuracy of reader 1 were significantly better with rFOV DWI sequence than with fFOV DWI, in contrast there was no significant difference for the others. The average of ADC values of fFOV DWI and rFOV DWI sequence were 1.004×10-6 mm2/s and 1.003×10-6 mm2/s, respectively.The diagnostic ability of rFOV DWI sequence may be better than that of fFOV DWI using VI-RADS for the differentiation between NMIBC and MIBC regardless of image-reading experience, it is controversial."
https://openalex.org/W4286210036,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the factorial structure of the Spanish version of the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire (Version 1.0) and to estimate the impact that acquiescence has on it as response bias. Exactly 500 workers from organizations from different industries, primarily located in Ecuador, participated in this study. The comparison of different models using Confirmatory Factor Analysis proved that when acquiescence is not controlled, evidence leads to the rejection of a one-dimensional-or essentially one-dimensional-structure (bifactor model), thus questioning the initial conceptualization of the construct. But when this response bias is controlled, both the one-dimensional model (χ2 = 429.608 [223], p < .001; CFI = .974; TLI = .982; RMSEA = .043; SRMR = .063) and the bifactor model (χ2 = 270.730 [205], p = .001; CFI = .992; TLI = .994; RMSEA = .026; SRMR = .047) show relevant improvement in terms of goodness of fit over the three-correlated-factors model (χ2 = 537.038 [132], p < .001; CFI = .950; TLI = .942; RMSEA = .079; SRMR = .070). However, the low reliability of the substantive factors of the bifactor model makes the one-dimensional model preferable in applied studies. Finally, the results show how mistakes could be made when concluding on the possible relationships between work performance and other relevant variables, in case acquiescence is not controlled."
https://openalex.org/W4286210164,"The analysis of an author's writing style implies the characterization and identification of the style in terms of a set of features commonly called linguistic features. The analysis can be extrinsic, where the style of an author can be compared with other authors, or intrinsic, where the style of an author is identified through different stages of his life. Intrinsic analysis has been used, for example, to detect mental illness and the effects of aging. A key element of the analysis is the style markers used to model the author's writing patterns. The style markers should handle diachronic changes and be thematic independent. One of the most commonly used style marker in extrinsic style analysis is n-gram. In this paper, we present the evaluation of traditional n-grams (words and characters) and dependency tree syntactic n-grams to solve the task of detecting changes in writing style over time. Our corpus consisted of novels by eleven English-speaking authors. The novels of each author were organized chronologically from the oldest to the most recent work according to the date of publication. Subsequently, two stages were defined: initial and final. In each stage three novels were assigned, novels of the initial stage corresponded to the oldest and those at the final stage to the most recent novels. To analyze changes in the writing style, novels were characterized by using four types of n-grams: characters, words, Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags and syntactic relations n-grams. Experiments were performed with a Logistic Regression classifier. Dimension reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) algorithms were evaluated. The results obtained with the different n-grams indicated that all authors presented significant changes in writing style over time. In addition, representations using n-grams of syntactic relations have achieved competitive results among different authors."
https://openalex.org/W4286210448,"The aim of this study was to develop and characterize a Prussian Blue based biocompatible and chemically stable T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent with near infrared (NIR) optical contrast for preclinical application. The physical properties of the Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) (iron (II); iron (III);octadecacyanide) were characterized with dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential measurement, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In vitro contrast enhancement properties of PBNPs were determined by MRI. In vivo T1-weighted contrast of the prepared PBNPs was investigated by MRI and optical imaging modality after intravenous administration into NMRI-Foxn1 nu/nu mice. The biodistribution studies showed the presence of PBNPs predominantly in the cardiovascular system. Briefly, in this paper we show a novel approach for the synthesis of PBNPs with enhanced iron content for T1 MRI contrast. This newly synthetized PBNP platform could lead to a new diagnostic agent, replacing the currently used Gadolinium based substances."
