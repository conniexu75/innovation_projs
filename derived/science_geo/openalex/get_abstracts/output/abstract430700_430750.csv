https://openalex.org/W2092505220,"The corpus callosum is hypothesized to play a fundamental role in integrating information and mediating complex behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that lack of normal callosal development can lead to deficits in functional connectivity that are related to impairments in specific cognitive domains. We examined resting-state functional connectivity in individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) and matched controls using magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEG-I) of coherence in the alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (12–30 Hz) and gamma (30–55 Hz) bands. Global connectivity (GC) was defined as synchronization between a region and the rest of the brain. In AgCC individuals, alpha band GC was significantly reduced in the dorsolateral pre-frontal (DLPFC), posterior parietal (PPC) and parieto-occipital cortices (PO). No significant differences in GC were seen in either the beta or gamma bands. We also explored the hypothesis that, in AgCC, this regional reduction in functional connectivity is explained primarily by a specific reduction in interhemispheric connectivity. However, our data suggest that reduced connectivity in these regions is driven by faulty coupling in both inter- and intrahemispheric connectivity. We also assessed whether the degree of connectivity correlated with behavioral performance, focusing on cognitive measures known to be impaired in AgCC individuals. Neuropsychological measures of verbal processing speed were significantly correlated with resting-state functional connectivity of the left medial and superior temporal lobe in AgCC participants. Connectivity of DLPFC correlated strongly with performance on the Tower of London in the AgCC cohort. These findings indicate that the abnormal callosal development produces salient but selective (alpha band only) resting-state functional connectivity disruptions that correlate with cognitive impairment. Understanding the relationship between impoverished functional connectivity and cognition is a key step in identifying the neural mechanisms of language and executive dysfunction in common neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders where disruptions of callosal development are consistently identified."
https://openalex.org/W2157595657,"Recent research suggests profound sex and sexual orientation differences in sexual response. These results, however, are based on measures of genital arousal, which have potential limitations such as volunteer bias and differential measures for the sexes. The present study introduces a measure less affected by these limitations. We assessed the pupil dilation of 325 men and women of various sexual orientations to male and female erotic stimuli. Results supported hypotheses. In general, self-reported sexual orientation corresponded with pupil dilation to men and women. Among men, substantial dilation to both sexes was most common in bisexual-identified men. In contrast, among women, substantial dilation to both sexes was most common in heterosexual-identified women. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed. Because the measure of pupil dilation is less invasive than previous measures of sexual response, it allows for studying diverse age and cultural populations, usually not included in sexuality research."
https://openalex.org/W2009506181,"Recently, there has been renewed interest in the role of tumor stem cells (TSCs) in tumorigenesis, chemoresistance, and relapse of malignant tumors including osteosarcoma. The potential exists to improve osteosarcoma treatment through characterization of TSCs and identification of therapeutic targets. Using transcriptome, proteome, immunophenotyping for cell-surface markers, and bioinformatic analyses, heterogeneous expression of previously reported TSC or osteosarcoma markers, such as CD133, nestin, POU5F1 (OCT3/4), NANOG, SOX2, and aldehyde dehydrogenase, among others, was observed in vitro. However, consistently significantly lower CD326, CD24, CD44, and higher ABCG2 expression in TSC-enriched as compared with un-enriched osteosarcoma cultures was observed. In addition, consistently higher CBX3 expression in TSC-enriched osteosarcoma cultures was identified. ABCA5 was identified as a putative biomarker of TSCs and/or osteosarcoma. Lastly, in a high-throughput screen we identified epigenetic (5-azacytidine), anti-microtubule (vincristine), and anti-telomerase (3,11-difluoro-6,8,13-trimethyl- 8H-quino [4,3,2-kl] acridinium methosulfate; RHPS4)-targeted therapeutic agents as candidates for TSC ablation in osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2055026825,"We used a combination of fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), and NMR spectroscopies in conjunction with size exclusion chromatography to help rationalize the relative antibacterial, antiplasmodial, and cytotoxic activities of a series of proline-free and proline-containing model antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in terms of their structural properties. When compared with proline-free analogs, proline-containing peptides had greater activity against Gram-negative bacteria, two mammalian cancer cell lines, and intraerythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum, which they were capable of killing without causing hemolysis. In contrast, incorporation of proline did not have a consistent effect on peptide activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In membrane-mimicking environments, structures with high α-helix content were adopted by both proline-free and proline-containing peptides. In solution, AMPs generally adopted disordered structures unless their sequences comprised more hydrophobic amino acids or until coordinating phosphate ions were added. Proline-containing peptides resisted ordering induced by either method. The roles of the angle subtended by positively charged amino acids and the positioning of the proline residues were also investigated. Careful positioning of proline residues in AMP sequences is required to enable the peptide to resist ordering and maintain optimal antibacterial activity, whereas varying the angle subtended by positively charged amino acids can attenuate hemolytic potential albeit with a modest reduction in potency. Maintaining conformational flexibility improves AMP potency and selectivity toward bacterial, plasmodial, and cancerous cells while enabling the targeting of intracellular pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2059806554,"CD44 and CD147 are associated with cancer metastasis and progression. Our purpose in the study was to investigate the effects of down-regulation of CD44 or CD147 on the metastatic ability of prostate cancer (CaP) cells, their docetaxel (DTX) responsiveness and potential mechanisms involved in vitro and in vivo. CD44 and CD147 were knocked down (KD) in PC-3M-luc CaP cells using short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Expression of CD44, CD147, MRP2 (multi-drug resistance protein-2) and MCT4 (monocarboxylate tranporter-4) was evaluated using immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The DTX dose-response and proliferation was measured by MTT and colony assays, respectively. The invasive potential was assessed using a matrigel chamber assay. Signal transduction proteins in PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways were assessed by Western blotting. An in vivo subcutaneous (s.c.) xenograft model was established to assess CaP tumorigenecity, lymph node metastases and DTX response. Our results indicated that KD of CD44 or CD147 decreased MCT4 and MRP2 expression, reduced CaP proliferation and invasive potential and enhanced DTX sensitivity; and KD of CD44 or CD147 down-regulated p-Akt and p-Erk, the main signal modulators associated with cell growth and survival. In vivo, CD44 or CD147-KD PC-3M-luc xenografts displayed suppressed tumor growth with increased DTX responsiveness compared to control xenografts. Both CD44 and CD147 enhance metastatic capacity and chemoresistance of CaP cells, potentially mediated by activation of the PI3K and MAPK pathways. Selective targeting of CD44/CD147 alone or combined with DTX may limit CaP metastasis and increase chemosensitivity, with promise for future CaP treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1985520978,"Background Patients with end stage renal disease often fail to follow prescribed dietary and fluid regimen, leading to undesirable outcomes. This study aimed to examine and identify factors influencing dietary, fluid, medication and dialysis compliance behaviours in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Methods This was a cross-sectional study which employed purposive sampling design. A total of 188 respondents were recruited from 14 dialysis centres in Malaysia between 2008–2011. Self-reported compliance behaviours and biochemical measurements were used as evaluation tools. Results Compliance rates of dietary, fluid, medication and dialysis were 27.7%, 24.5%, 66.5% and 91.0%, respectively. Younger, male, working patients and those with longer duration on hemodialysis were found more likely to be non-compliant. Lacks of adequate knowledge, inadequate self-efficacy skills, forgetfulness and financial constraints were the major perceived barriers towards better compliance to fluid, dietary, medication and dialysis, respectively. Conclusions Healthcare professionals should recognise the factors hindering compliance from the patients' perspective while assisting them with appropriate skills in making necessary changes possible."
https://openalex.org/W2160439849,"Background Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease noteworthy for its vulnerability to stress and emotion-induced symptom intensification. The fact that psychological stress and mood and anxiety disorders appear to increase expression of asthma symptoms suggests that neural signaling between the brain and lung at least partially modulates the inflammatory response and lung function. However, the precise nature of the neural pathways implicated in modulating asthma symptoms is unknown. Moreover, the extent to which variations in neural signaling predict different phenotypes of disease expression has not been studied. Methods and Results We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural signals in response to asthma-specific emotional cues, following allergen exposure, in asthmatics with a dual response to allergen challenge (significant inflammation), asthmatics with only an immediate response (minimal inflammation), and healthy controls. The anterior insular cortex was differentially activated by asthma-relevant cues, compared to general negative cues, during the development of the late phase of the dual response in asthmatics. Moreover, the degree of this differential activation predicted changes in airway inflammation. Conclusions These findings indicate that neurophenotypes for asthma may be identifiable by neural reactivity of brain circuits known to be involved in processing emotional information. Those with greater activation in the anterior insula, in response to asthma-relevant psychological stimuli, exhibit greater inflammatory signals in the lung and increased severity of disease and may reflect a subset of asthmatics most vulnerable to the development of psychopathology. This approach offers an entirely new target for potential therapeutic intervention in asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2134945464,"The PACE trial compared the effectiveness of adding adaptive pacing therapy (APT), cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), or graded exercise therapy (GET), to specialist medical care (SMC) for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. This paper reports the relative cost-effectiveness of these treatments in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and improvements in fatigue and physical function.Resource use was measured and costs calculated. Healthcare and societal costs (healthcare plus lost production and unpaid informal care) were combined with QALYs gained, and changes in fatigue and disability; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were computed.SMC patients had significantly lower healthcare costs than those receiving APT, CBT and GET. If society is willing to value a QALY at £30,000 there is a 62.7% likelihood that CBT is the most cost-effective therapy, a 26.8% likelihood that GET is most cost effective, 2.6% that APT is most cost-effective and 7.9% that SMC alone is most cost-effective. Compared to SMC alone, the incremental healthcare cost per QALY was £18,374 for CBT, £23,615 for GET and £55,235 for APT. From a societal perspective CBT has a 59.5% likelihood of being the most cost-effective, GET 34.8%, APT 0.2% and SMC alone 5.5%. CBT and GET dominated SMC, while APT had a cost per QALY of £127,047. ICERs using reductions in fatigue and disability as outcomes largely mirrored these findings.Comparing the four treatments using a health care perspective, CBT had the greatest probability of being the most cost-effective followed by GET. APT had a lower probability of being the most cost-effective option than SMC alone. The relative cost-effectiveness was even greater from a societal perspective as additional cost savings due to reduced need for informal care were likely."
https://openalex.org/W2170426667,"Magnetic tweezers (MT) are a powerful tool for the study of DNA-enzyme interactions. Both the magnet-based manipulation and the camera-based detection used in MT are well suited for multiplexed measurements. Here, we systematically address challenges related to scaling of multiplexed magnetic tweezers (MMT) towards high levels of parallelization where large numbers of molecules (say 103) are addressed in the same amount of time required by a single-molecule measurement. We apply offline analysis of recorded images and show that this approach provides a scalable solution for parallel tracking of the xyz-positions of many beads simultaneously. We employ a large field-of-view imaging system to address many DNA-bead tethers in parallel. We model the 3D magnetic field generated by the magnets and derive the magnetic force experienced by DNA-bead tethers across the large field of view from first principles. We furthermore experimentally demonstrate that a DNA-bead tether subject to a rotating magnetic field describes a bicircular, Limaçon rotation pattern and that an analysis of this pattern simultaneously yields information about the force angle and the position of attachment of the DNA on the bead. Finally, we apply MMT in the high-throughput investigation of the distribution of the induced magnetic moment, the position of attachment of DNA on the beads, and DNA flexibility. The methods described herein pave the way to kilo-molecule level magnetic tweezers experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1975112068,"It is well-known that many species with small diaspores can disperse far during extended temporal scales (many years). However, studies on short temporal scales usually only cover short distances (in, e.g., bryophytes up to 15 m). By using a novel experimental design, studying the realized dispersal, we extend this range by almost two orders of magnitude. We recorded establishment of the fast-growing moss Discelium nudum on introduced suitable substrates, placed around a translocated, sporulating mother colony. Around 2,000 pots with acidic clay were placed at different distances between 5 m and 600 m, in four directions, on a raised bog, with increased pot numbers with distance. The experiment was set up in April–May and the realized dispersal (number of colonized pots) was recorded in September. Close to the mother colony (up to 10 m), the mean colonization rates (ratio of colonized pots) exceeded 50%. At distances between 10 and 50 m colonization dropped sharply, but beyond 50 m the mean colonization rates stabilized and hardly changed (1–3%). The estimated density of spores causing establishments at the further distances (2–6 spores/m2) was realistic when compared to the estimated spore output from the central colonies. Our study supports calculations from earlier studies, limited to short distances, that a majority of the spores disperse beyond the nearest vicinity of a source. The even colonization pattern at further distances raises interesting questions about under what conditions spores are transported and deposited. However, it is clear that regular establishment is likely at the km-scale for this and many other species with similar spore output and dispersal mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2010036918,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome contains two large gene families encoding proteins of unknown function, characterized by conserved N-terminal proline and glutamate (PE and PPE) motifs. The presence of a large number of PE/PPE proteins with repetitive domains and evidence of strain variation has given rise to the suggestion that these proteins may play a role in immune evasion via antigenic variation, while emerging data suggests that some family members may play important roles in mycobacterial pathogenesis. In this study, we examined cellular immune responses to a panel of 36 PE/PPE proteins during human and bovine infection. We observed a distinct hierarchy of immune recognition, reflected both in the repertoire of PE/PPE peptide recognition in individual cows and humans and in the magnitude of IFN-γ responses elicited by stimulation of sensitized host cells. The pattern of immunodominance was strikingly similar between cattle that had been experimentally infected with Mycobacterium bovis and humans naturally infected with clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. The same pattern was maintained as disease progressed throughout a four-month course of infection in cattle, and between humans with latent as well as active tuberculosis. Detailed analysis of PE/PPE responses at the peptide level suggests that antigenic cross-reactivity amongst related family members is a major determinant in the observed differences in immune hierarchy. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a subset of PE/PPE proteins are major targets of the cellular immune response to tuberculosis, and are recognized at multiple stages of infection and in different disease states. Thus this work identifies a number of novel antigens that could find application in vaccine development, and provides new insights into PE/PPE biology."
https://openalex.org/W2025373612,"Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) play a key role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Na(V)1.8 is a tetrodotoxin (TTX) resistant VGSC expressed in nociceptors, peripheral small-diameter neurons able to detect noxious stimuli. Na(V)1.8 underlies the vast majority of sodium currents during action potentials. Many studies have highlighted a key role for Na(V)1.8 in inflammatory and chronic pain models. Lipid rafts are microdomains of the plasma membrane highly enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Lipid rafts tune the spatial and temporal organisation of proteins and lipids on the plasma membrane. They are thought to act as platforms on the membrane where proteins and lipids can be trafficked, compartmentalised and functionally clustered. In the present study we investigated Na(V)1.8 sub-cellular localisation and explored the idea that it is associated with lipid rafts in nociceptors. We found that Na(V)1.8 is distributed in clusters along the axons of DRG neurons in vitro and ex vivo. We also demonstrated, by biochemical and imaging studies, that Na(V)1.8 is associated with lipid rafts along the sciatic nerve ex vivo and in DRG neurons in vitro. Moreover, treatments with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) led to the dissociation between rafts and Na(V)1.8. By calcium imaging we demonstrated that the lack of association between rafts and Na(V)1.8 correlated with impaired neuronal excitability, highlighted by a reduction in the number of neurons able to conduct mechanically- and chemically-evoked depolarisations. These findings reveal the sub-cellular localisation of Na(V)1.8 in nociceptors and highlight the importance of the association between Na(V)1.8 and lipid rafts in the control of nociceptor excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2028641936,"Ceramide transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus is crucial in sphingolipid biosynthesis, and the process relies on the ceramide trafficking protein (CERT), which contains pleckstrin homology (PH) and StAR-related lipid transfer domains. The CERT PH domain specifically recognizes phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PtdIns(4)P), a characteristic phosphoinositide in the Golgi membrane, and is indispensable for the endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport of ceramide by CERT. In this study, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the CERT PH domain by using solution NMR techniques. The structure revealed the presence of a characteristic basic groove near the canonical PtdIns(4)P recognition site. An extensive interaction study using NMR and other biophysical techniques revealed that the basic groove coordinates the CERT PH domain for efficient PtdIns(4)P recognition and localization in the Golgi apparatus. The notion was also supported by Golgi mislocalization of the CERT mutants in living cells. The distinctive binding modes reflect the functions of PH domains, as the basic groove is conserved only in the PH domains involved with the PtdIns(4)P-dependent lipid transport activity but not in those with the signal transduction activity."
https://openalex.org/W1973771238,"Background Mutations in the PRRT2 gene have recently been identified in patients with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia with infantile convulsions (PKD/IC) and patients with sporadic PKD/IC from several ethnic groups. To extend these recent genetic reports, we investigated the frequency and identities of PRRT2 mutations in a cohort of Taiwanese patients with PKD/IC. Methodology and Principal Findings We screened all 3 coding exons of PRRT2 for mutations in 28 Taiwanese patients with PKD/IC. Among them, 13 had familial PKD/IC and 15 were apparently sporadic cases. In total, 7 disparate mutations were identified in 13 patients, including 8 familial cases and 5 apparently sporadic cases. The mutations were not present in 500 healthy controls. Four mutations were novel. One patient had a missense mutation and all other patients carried PRRT2 mutations putatively resulting in a protein truncation. Haplotype analysis revealed that 5 of the 7 patients with the PRRT2 p.R217Pfs*8 mutation shared the same haplotype linked to the mutation. Conclusions and Significance PRRT2 mutations account for 61.5% (8 out of 13) of familial PKD/IC and 33.3% (5 out of 15) of apparently sporadic PKD/IC in the Taiwanese cohort. Most patients with the PRRT2 p.R217Pfs*8 mutation in Taiwan likely descend from a single common ancestor. This study expands the spectrum of PKD/IC-associated PRRT2 mutations, highlights the pathogenic role of PRRT2 mutations in PKD/IC, and suggests genetic heterogeneity within idiopathic PKD."
https://openalex.org/W2136415990,"Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis and is associated with several post-infectious manifestations, including onset of the autoimmune neuropathy Guillain-Barré syndrome, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Poorly-cooked chicken meat is the most frequent source of infection as C. jejuni colonizes the avian intestine in a commensal relationship. However, not all chickens are equally colonized and resistance seems to be genetically determined. We hypothesize that differences in immune response may contribute to variation in colonization levels between susceptible and resistant birds. Using high-throughput sequencing in an avian infection model, we investigate gene expression associated with resistance or susceptibility to colonization of the gastrointestinal tract with C. jejuni and find that gut related immune mechanisms are critical for regulating colonization. Amongst a single population of 300 4-week old chickens, there was clear segregation in levels of C. jejuni colonization 48 hours post-exposure. RNAseq analysis of caecal tissue from 14 C. jejuni-susceptible and 14 C. jejuni-resistant birds generated over 363 million short mRNA sequences which were investigated to identify 219 differentially expressed genes. Significantly higher expression of genes involved in the innate immune response, cytokine signaling, B cell and T cell activation and immunoglobulin production, as well as the renin-angiotensin system was observed in resistant birds, suggesting an early active immune response to C. jejuni. Lower expression of these genes in colonized birds suggests suppression or inhibition of a clearing immune response thus facilitating commensal colonization and generating vectors for zoonotic transmission. This study describes biological processes regulating C. jejuni colonization of the avian intestine and gives insight into the differential immune mechanisms incited in response to commensal bacteria in general within vertebrate populations. The results reported here illustrate how an exaggerated immune response may be elicited in a subset of the population, which alters host-microbe interactions and inhibits the commensal state, therefore having wider relevance with regard to inflammatory and autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W1987217763,"Recent evidence suggests that estrogen is synthesized in the spinal dorsal horn and plays a role in nociceptive processes. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Using electrophysiological, biochemical, and morphological techniques, we here demonstrate that 17β-estradiol (E2), a major form of estrogen, can directly modulate spinal cord synaptic transmission by 1) enhancing NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in dorsal horn neurons, 2) increasing glutamate release from primary afferent terminals, 3) increasing dendritic spine density in cultured spinal cord dorsal horn neurons, and 4) potentiating spinal cord long term potentiation (LTP) evoked by high frequency stimulation (HFS) of Lissauer's tract. Notably, E2-BSA, a ligand that acts only on membrane estrogen receptors, can mimic E2-induced facilitation of HFS-LTP, suggesting a nongenomic action of this neurosteroid. Consistently, cell surface biotinylation demonstrated that three types of ERs (ERα, ERβ, and GPER1) are localized on the plasma membrane of dorsal horn neurons. Furthermore, the ERα and ERβ antagonist ICI 182,780 completely abrogates the E2-induced facilitation of LTP. ERβ (but not ERα) activation can recapitulate E2-induced persistent increases in synaptic transmission (NMDA-dependent) and dendritic spine density, indicating a critical role of ERβ in spinal synaptic plasticity. E2 also increases the phosphorylation of ERK, PKA, and NR2B, and spinal HFS-LTP is prevented by blockade of PKA, ERK, or NR2B activation. Finally, HFS increases E2 release in spinal cord slices, which can be prevented by aromatase inhibitor androstatrienedione, suggesting activity-dependent local synthesis and release of endogenous E2.

LTP is a long lasting form of synaptic plasticity, and synaptic plasticity is fundamental to many neuronal functions, including learning, memory, and pain (25Ji R.R. Kohno T. Moore K.A. Woolf C.J. Central sensitization and LTP. Do pain and memory share similar mechanisms?.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 696-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). In the pain pathway, activation of peripheral nociceptors results in neuronal plasticity in the CNS, which modifies the performance of the nociceptive pathway by enhancing and prolonging responses to subsequent peripheral stimuli. These changes in the spinal cord are known as spinal central sensitization (26Ji R.R. Zhang Y.Q. The role of MAP kinase cascades in cell signaling, neural plasticity and pain facilitation.Neurosci. Bull. 2005; 21: 3-9Google Scholar). High frequency stimulation (HFS) of peripheral nerves produces LTP of C-fiber-evoked responses in the spinal dorsal horn, which are thought to be a substrate for spinal central sensitization (27Sandkühler J. Understanding LTP in pain pathways.Mol. Pain. 2007; 3: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Considering that there are many similarities between mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in different regions of the CNS, such as the spinal dorsal horn and hippocampus (25Ji R.R. Kohno T. Moore K.A. Woolf C.J. Central sensitization and LTP. Do pain and memory share similar mechanisms?.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 696-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar), we propose that spinal central sensitization and hippocampal LTP share similar mechanisms. In this study, we investigated whether estrogen could acutely modulate spinal synaptic transmission and plasticity and further explored the molecular/cellular events and signaling pathways that promote synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated that estrogen might rapidly modulate spinal excitatory synaptic transmission and facilitate LTP by increasing NMDA transmission, presynaptic glutamate release, and dendritic branching/spine density. The activation of mERs, PKA/ERK, and NR2B is possibly involved in the process. Experiments were performed on young (2–3-week-old) Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes. Rats were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Science. All experimental procedures were approved by the Shanghai Animal Care and Use Committee, and all efforts were made to minimize animals' suffering and the number of animals used. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. 17β-estradiol (E2) and ICI 182,870 were dissolved in sesame oil or ethanol. E2-BSA was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Androstatrienedione (Steraloids) and PD98059 were prepared in DMSO. Stock solutions of the following drugs were prepared in double-distilled H2O: bicuculline methiodide (BMI), strychnine, APV, CNQX, NMDA, AMPA, Ro 25-6981, and H89. QX-314 and GDPβS was dissolved in an intracellular solution. Rat spinal cord slices were prepared as described previously (28Cheng L.Z. Lü N. Zhang Y.Q. Zhao Z.Q. Ryanodine receptors contribute to the induction of nociceptive input-evoked long-term potentiation in the rat spinal cord slice.Mol. Pain. 2010; 6: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, laminectomy was performed under diethyl ether deep anesthesia, and the lumbosacral segment of the spinal cord was rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 80 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, 75 mm sucrose, 1.3 mm ascorbate, 3.0 mm sodium pyruvate, oxygenated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.4. Transverse slices (500 μm) with attached dorsal roots (8–12 mm) were prepared and then incubated in preoxygenated recording ACSF with the following composition: 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, 25 mm d-glucose, 1.3 mm ascorbate, 3.0 mm sodium pyruvate. The slices then recovered at 32 ± 1 °C for 40 min and then at room temperature for an additional 1 h before experimental recordings. Slices were then transferred into a recording chamber and continuously perfused with recording solution at a rate of 5 ml/min prior to electrophysiological recordings at room temperature. tk;1Whole-cell recordings were obtained from neurons of the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Neurons were identified by infrared differential interference contrast video microscopy with an upright microscope (Leica DMLFSA) equipped with a ×40, 0.8 numerical aperture water immersion objective and a CCD camera (IR-1000E). Patch pipettes (5–10 megaohms) were made from borosilicate glass on a horizontal micropipette puller (P-97, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and were filled with a solution of the following composition: 120 mm potassium gluconate, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mm NaGTP, 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.28, with KOH. QX-314 (5 mm) and GDPβS (1 mm) were added when necessary. To measure EPSCs from neurons in lamina I and the outer part of lamina II, a constant current pulse (0.3–0.5 mA) at 0.05 Hz was delivered to the dorsal root by a suction electrode. EPSCs were recorded with normal ACSF (2 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+) containing BMI (10 μm) and strychnine (1 μm) to block GABAA- and glycine receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic currents, whereas low Mg2+, high Ca2+ (2.5 mm Ca2+, 0.25 mm Mg2+) ACSF was used in the NMDAR testing experiments. The membrane potential was held at −70 mV. When recording the NMDA receptor-mediated component of EPSCs (NMDA-EPSCs), a holding potential of +40 mV was used as indicated. Only 1 cell was recorded per slice to obviate contamination due to previous treatment. Data were acquired using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. The series resistance (Rs) was monitored during recording. Cells in which Rs deviated >20% or cells with Rs > 60 megaohms were excluded from analysis. Field potential recordings from the superficial spinal dorsal horn were obtained with glass microelectrodes (impedance 2–5 megaohms) filled with 135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH). A bipolar tungsten electrode was used to stimulate Lissauer's tract (LT). The low pass filter was set to 1 kHz, and the amplification was set to ×500 (Axopatch 200B amplifier, Axon Instruments). To minimize current spread to the dorsal roots and the recording site, the electrode was placed at the ventrolateral border of LT (29Terman G.W. Eastman C.L. Chavkin C. μ opiates inhibit long term potentiation induction in the spinal cord slice.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For LTP-associated experiments, recordings of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were made in the presence of BMI (10 μm) and strychnine (1 μm) to block the tonic inhibitory actions of GABAA and glycine, respectively. The current intensity of the test stimuli was set at a current strength sufficient to excite the C-fibers (0.1 ms, 0.5–0.7 mA). LTP was induced at base-line stimulus intensity using tetanic HFS. HFS consisted of three trains of 100 pulses at 100 Hz with 10-s intertrain intervals. Before HFS, test pulses of 0.1 ms were given at 120- or 300-s intervals and recorded for at least 10 min to ensure the stability of the response. Data were collected with pClamp version 10.1 software and analyzed using Clampfit version 10.1. The magnitude of LTP was estimated by comparing averaged responses at 30 or 60 min after induction with averaged base-line responses before induction. Rats were sacrificed with an overdose of chloral hydrate (80 mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with normal saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Spinal cords were then removed, postfixed in the same fixative for 6 h at 4 °C, and immersed in a 10–30% gradient of sucrose in phosphate buffer for 24–48 h at 4 °C for cryoprotection. Transverse sections (16 μm) were cut in a cryostat (Leica 1900) and processed for immunofluorescence. Cultured spinal dorsal horn neurons (14 days in vitro) grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The sections or cells were blocked with 10% donkey serum in 0.01 m PBS (pH 7.4) with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. For ERα/NeuN/MAP-2, ERβ/NeuN/MAP-2, or GPER1/NeuN/MAP-2 double immunofluorescence, the sections or cells were incubated with a mixture of rabbit anti-ERα (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., or Upstate), goat anti-ERβ (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-GPER1 (1:50; Abcam), and mouse anti-NeuN (neuronal marker, 1:1000; Millipore) or with mouse anti-MAP-2 (1:1000; Millipore) overnight at 4 °C, followed by a mixture of Rhodamine Red-X- and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. For immunohistochemical experiments on spinal cord slices, five adjacent slices (350 μm) from the same spinal segment were prepared as in the electrophysiological experiment described above. At least two slices were used for controls (non-treated and ethanol vehicle-treated) and three for E2 treatment (10 μm for 10, 30, or 60 min), and the remaining slices were used for NMDA (100 μm, 10 min). This arrangement allowed negative (untreated or ethanol-treated slice) and positive controls (NMDA-treated slice) for each animal. Subsequently, the slices were rapidly fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 60 min and then processed for immunostaining. The sections were blocked with 10% donkey serum in 0.01 m PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 4 h at room temperature. For pERK or pERK/pPKA double immunofluorescence, the sections were incubated with mouse anti-pERK (1:1000; Sigma) or a mixture of mouse anti-pERK and rabbit anti-pPKA RII (Ser-96) (1:1000; Upstate), for 48 h at 4 °C, followed by FITC-conjugated or a mixture of Rhodamine Red-X- and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C. All sections were coverslipped with a mixture of 50% glycerin in PBS and then observed with a Leica SP2 confocal laser-scanning microscope. The specificity of immunostaining was verified by omitting the primary antibodies, and immunostaining signals disappeared after the omission of primary antibodies. The specificity of primary antibodies was verified by the preabsorption experiment. Sections were first incubated with a mixture of ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 primary antibody and the corresponding blocking peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; blocking peptide/primary antibody = 3:1) overnight, followed by secondary antibody incubation. ER immunostaining signals were abolished after absorption. E2-BSA-FITC binding experiments were performed on cultured spinal dorsal horn neurons grown on glass coverslips. E2-BSA covalently coupled to FITC (E2-BSA-FITC) was resuspended at 1 mg/ml in PBS. The unfixed live cells were washed one time with ACSF and incubated with E2-BSA-FITC (10 μg/ml) in PBS with 5% BSA for 30 min in the dark at 37 °C. For E2-BSA-FITC/GluN1 or E2-BSA-FITC/GluA1 double staining, stained E2-BSA-FITC neurons were incubated with rabbit anti-GluN1 (1:500; Sigma) or rabbit anti-GluA1 (1:200; Millipore), respectively. Under urethane (1.5 g/kg, intraperitoneally) anesthesia at 10 min and 30 min after intrathecal injection of E2 or E2-BSA, the animals were rapidly sacrificed by decapitation (n = 3 or 4/group). The L4–L6 lumbar spinal cord was rapidly removed, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until use. Frozen samples were homogenized in a lysis buffer (12.5 μl/mg of tissue) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and PMSF (Sigma). Cultured spinal dorsal horn neurons (14 days in vitro) were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. After incubating in ice for 30 min, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for Western blotting. Equal amounts of protein (∼20 μg) were loaded and separated in a 10% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The resolved proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-pERK (1:2000; Sigma), rabbit anti-total ERK (1:100,000; Sigma), rabbit anti-ERα (1:50 (Upstate) or 1:100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)), rabbit anti-ERβ (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-GPER1 (1:200; Abcam), rabbit anti-PKA (1:500; Upstate), rabbit anti-phospho-NR2B (1:1000; Millipore), mouse anti-NR2B (1:2000; Neuromab), rabbit anti-GluN1 (1:2000; Sigma) and rabbit anti-GluA1 (1:500; Millipore), mouse anti-transferrin receptor (1:1000; Invitrogen), and rabbit anti-CREB (1:1000; Sigma). The blots were then incubated with the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:1000; Pierce), for 2 h at 4 °C. Signals were finally visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Pierce), and the bands were visualized with the ChemiDox XRS system (Bio-Rad). All Western blot analyses were performed at least three times, and consistent results were obtained. A Bio-Rad image analysis system was then used to measure the integrated optic density of the bands. Surface biotinylation experiments were performed in live transverse spinal dorsal horn slices and cultured dorsal horn neurons (14 days in vitro). After treatment, the slices or cultured neurons were incubated with PBS containing 0.5–1.0 mg/ml Sulfosuccinimidel-6-[biotin-amido] hexanoate (Pierce) for 45 min on ice and rinsed in ice-cold PBS containing 1 m glycine to quench the biotin reaction. The cultured neurons were lysed, and the slices were homogenized in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstain). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of NeutrAvidin-agarose (Pierce) for 4 h at 4 °C and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The total and biotinylated surface proteins were detected using quantitative Western blots as described above. Samples from the slice perfusate were collected. To compare E2 concentrations in the perfusate from spinal slices of different sexes, slices were incubated in the same volume of ACSF. For LT stimulation experiments, ACSF was added to the initial volume after each collection of perfusate to exclude the influence of volume on the measurement of E2 concentration. The E2 concentration was determined with double antibody radioimmunoassay kits according to protocols provided by the manufacturer (National Atomic Energy Research Institute, Beijing, China). The sensitivity of the kit was 1.4 pg/ml. Spinal cord neurons were prepared from rat embryos at embryonic day 15. Briefly, spinal cords were removed from each embryo, and the dura was stripped. Dorsal horn tissue was isolated according to the open book technique (30Peterson E.R. Crain S.M. Nerve growth factor attenuates neurotoxic effects of taxol on spinal cord-ganglion explants from fetal mice.Science. 1982; 217: 377-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the spinal dorsal horn was dissociated with trypsin, and cells were plated (1 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells/ml) in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) on 60-mm dishes that were precoated with poly-d-lysine (0.1 or 1 mg/ml; Sigma). After 4 h, the media (5% FBS B27 and glutamine) were changed to feeding media without 5% FBS. Cells were fed twice weekly thereafter with Neurobasal medium prepared as above but without the 5% FBS. Spinal dorsal horn neurons were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 on coverslips. Cultured neurons received transfection of GFP-lentivirus (Genechem, Shanghai) 3 days before imaging at 14 days in vitro. Three days after transfection, living transfected neurons on coverslips were transferred to a stage chamber filled with Neurobasal medium and imaged with a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) TE300 inverted microscope. Images were obtained using a Yokogawa spinning disk (Solamere Technology Group). Healthy neurons expressing GFP were identified and imaged every 5–8 min for 30 min before and 30–60 min after E2 treatment at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At each time point, Z-stacks of images were collected and analyzed using Origin (Microcal Software). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using Student's t test, paired t test, and one- or two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls test. In all cases, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Previous studies have shown that NMDAR and AMPAR function can be rapidly regulated by estrogen in hippocampal neurons (8Foy M.R. Xu J.

https://openalex.org/W2079588165,"Ciliopathies, a class of rare genetic disorders, present often with retinal degeneration caused by protein transport defects between the inner segment and the outer segment of the photoreceptors. Bardet-Biedl syndrome is one such ciliopathy, genetically heterogeneous with 17 BBS genes identified to date, presenting early onset retinitis pigmentosa. By investigating BBS12-deprived retinal explants and the Bbs12(-/-) murine model, we show that the impaired intraciliary transport results in protein retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. The protein overload activates a proapoptotic unfolded protein response leading to a specific Caspase12-mediated death of the photoreceptors. Having identified a therapeutic window in the early postnatal retinal development and through optimized pharmacological modulation of the unfolded protein response, combining three specific compounds, namely valproic acid, guanabenz, and a specific Caspase12 inhibitor, achieved efficient photoreceptor protection, thereby maintaining light detection ability in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1965403646,"Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein. Although the protein was discovered in 1997, its function and even its tissue distribution are still under debate. Here we present a quantitative analysis of mRNA and protein expression in various mice tissues, revealing that UCP2 is mainly expressed in organs and cells associated with the immune system. Although the UCP2 gene is present in the brain, as demonstrated using quantitative RT-PCR, the protein was not detectable in neurons under physiological conditions. Instead, we could detect UCP2 in microglia, which act in the immune defense of the central nervous system. In lymphocytes, activation led to a ten-fold increase of UCP2 protein expression simultaneously to the increase in levels of other mitochondrial proteins, whereas lymphocyte re-stimulation resulted in the selective increase of UCP2. The highest detected level of UCP2 expression in stimulated T-cells (0.54 ng/(µg total cellular protein)) was approximately 200 times lower than the level of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue from room temperature acclimated mice. Both the UCP2 expression pattern and the time course of up-regulation in stimulated T-cells imply UCP2's involvement in the immune response, probably by controlling the metabolism during cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2107312877,"An unknown vitamin D compound was observed in the HPLC-UV chromatogram of edible mushrooms in the course of analyzing vitamin D2 as part of a food composition study and confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to be vitamin D4 (22-dihydroergocalciferol). Vitamin D4 was quantified by HPLC with UV detection, with vitamin [3H] itamin D3 as an internal standard. White button, crimini, portabella, enoki, shiitake, maitake, oyster, morel, chanterelle, and UV-treated portabella mushrooms were analyzed, as four composites each of a total of 71 samples from U.S. retail suppliers and producers. Vitamin D4 was present (>0.1 µg/100 g) in a total of 18 composites and in at least one composite of each mushroom type except white button. The level was highest in samples with known UV exposure: vitamin D enhanced portabella, and maitake mushrooms from one supplier (0.2–7.0 and 22.5–35.4 µg/100 g, respectively). Other mushrooms had detectable vitamin D4 in some but not all samples. In one composite of oyster mushrooms the vitamin D4 content was more than twice that of D2 (6.29 vs. 2.59 µg/100 g). Vitamin D4 exceeded 2 µg/100 g in the morel and chanterelle mushroom samples that contained D4, but was undetectable in two morel samples. The vitamin D4 precursor 22,23-dihydroergosterol was found in all composites (4.49–16.5 mg/100 g). Vitamin D4 should be expected to occur in mushrooms exposed to UV light, such as commercially produced vitamin D enhanced products, wild grown mushrooms or other mushrooms receiving incidental exposure. Because vitamin D4 coeluted with D3 in the routine HPLC analysis of vitamin D2 and an alternate mobile phase was necessary for resolution, researchers analyzing vitamin D2 in mushrooms and using D3 as an internal standard should verify that the system will resolve vitamins D3 and D4."
https://openalex.org/W2120702726,"The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recently published new clinical guidelines in which hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was recommended as a diagnostic test for diabetes. The present study was to investigate the association between HbA1c and cardiovascular risk, and compare the associations with fasting glucose and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (2 h OGTT).The study samples are from a community-based health examination survey in central China. Carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and HbA1c were measured in 5,098 men and women.After adjustment for age, sex, and BMI, the levels of HbA1c were significantly associated with an increasing trend of cfPWV in a dose-dependent fashion (P for trend <0.0001). The associations remained significant after further adjustment for blood pressure, heart rate, and lipids (P = 0.004), and the difference in cfPWV between the highest and the lowest quintiles of HbA1c was 0.31 m/s. Fasting glucose and 2 h OGTT were not associated with cfPWV in the multivariate analyses. HbA1c showed additive effects with fasting glucose or 2 h OGTT on cfPWV. In addition, age and blood pressure significantly modified the associations between HbA1c and cfPWV (P for interactions <0.0001 for age; and = 0.019 for blood pressure). The associations were stronger in subjects who were older (≥60 y; P for trend = 0.004) and had higher blood pressure (≥120 [systolic blood pressure]/80 mmHg [diastolic blood pressure]; P for trend = 0.028) than those who were younger and had lower blood pressure (P for trend >0.05).HbA1c was related to high cfPWV, independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Senior age and high blood pressure might amplify the adverse effects of HbA1c on cardiovascular risk."
https://openalex.org/W1989098980,"The mosquito Aedes aegypti is one of the most important disease vectors because it transmits two major arboviruses, dengue and yellow fever, which cause significant global morbidity and mortality. Chemical insecticides form the cornerstone of vector control. The organophosphate temephos a larvicide recommended by WHO for controlling Ae. aegypti, however, resistance to this compound has been reported in many countries, including Brazil.The aim of this study was to identify genes implicated in metabolic resistance in an Ae. aegypti temephos resistant strain, named RecR, through microarray analysis. We utilized a custom 'Ae. aegypti detox chip' and validated microarray data through RT-PCR comparing susceptible and resistant individuals. In addition, we analyzed gene expression in 4(th) instar larvae from a reversed susceptible strain (RecRev), exposed and unexposed to temephos. The results obtained revealed a set of 13 and 6 genes significantly over expressed in resistant adult mosquitoes and larvae, respectively. One of these genes, the cytochrome P450 CYP6N12, was up-regulated in both stages. RT-PCR confirmed the microarray results and, additionally, showed no difference in gene expression between temephos exposed and unexposed RecRev mosquitoes. This suggested that the differences in the transcript profiles among the strains are heritable due to a selection process and are not caused by immediate insecticide exposure. Reversal of temephos resistance was demonstrated and, importantly, there was a positive correlation between a decrease in the resistance ratio and an accompanying decrease in the expression levels of previously over expressed genes. Some of the genes identified here have also been implicated in metabolic resistance in other mosquito species and insecticide resistant populations of Ae. aegypti.The identification of gene expression signatures associated to insecticide resistance and their suppression could greatly aid the development of improved strategies of vector control."
https://openalex.org/W2051681748,"Background The publicly available Laccaria bicolor genome sequence has provided a considerable genomic resource allowing systematic identification of transposable elements (TEs) in this symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungus. Using a TE-specific annotation pipeline we have characterized and analyzed TEs in the L. bicolor S238N-H82 genome. Methodology/Principal Findings TEs occupy 24% of the 60 Mb L. bicolor genome and represent 25,787 full-length and partial copy elements distributed within 171 families. The most abundant elements were the Copia-like. TEs are not randomly distributed across the genome, but are tightly nested or clustered. The majority of TEs exhibits signs of ancient transposition except some intact copies of terminal inverted repeats (TIRS), long terminal repeats (LTRs) and a large retrotransposon derivative (LARD) element. There were three main periods of TE expansion in L. bicolor: the first from 57 to 10 Mya, the second from 5 to 1 Mya and the most recent from 0.5 Mya ago until now. LTR retrotransposons are closely related to retrotransposons found in another basidiomycete, Coprinopsis cinerea. Conclusions This analysis 1) represents an initial characterization of TEs in the L. bicolor genome, 2) contributes to improve genome annotation and a greater understanding of the role TEs played in genome organization and evolution and 3) provides a valuable resource for future research on the genome evolution within the Laccaria genus."
https://openalex.org/W1999604489,"Biomarkers are needed to address overtreatment that occurs for the majority of prostate cancer patients that would not die of the disease but receive radical treatment. A possible barrier to biomarker discovery may be the polyclonal/multifocal nature of prostate tumors as well as cell-type heterogeneity between patient samples. Tumor-adjacent stroma (tumor microenvironment) is less affected by genetic alteration and might therefore yield more consistent biomarkers in response to tumor aggressiveness. To this end we compared Affymetrix gene expression profiles in stroma near tumor and identified a set of 115 probe sets for which the expression levels were significantly correlated with time-to-relapse. We also compared patients that chemically relapsed shortly after prostatectomy (<1 year), and patients that did not relapse in the first four years after prostatectomy. We identified 131 differentially expressed microarray probe sets between these two categories. 19 probe sets (15 genes overlapped between the two gene lists with p<0.0001). We developed a PAM-based classifier by training on samples containing stroma near tumor: 9 rapid relapse patient samples and 9 indolent patient samples. We then tested the classifier on 47 different samples, containing 90% or more stroma. The classifier predicted the risk status of patients with an average accuracy of 87%. This is the first general tumor microenvironment-based prognostic classifier. These results indicate that the prostate cancer microenvironment exhibits reproducible changes useful for predicting outcomes for patients."
https://openalex.org/W2035146075,"Gastric cancer is one of the most lethal types of cancer and its incidence varies worldwide, with the Andean region of South America showing high incidence rates. We evaluated the genetic structure of the population from Lima (Peru) and performed a case-control genetic association study to test the contribution of African, European, or Native American ancestry to risk for gastric cancer, controlling for the effect of non-genetic factors. A wide set of socioeconomic, dietary, and clinic information was collected for each participant in the study and ancestry was estimated based on 103 ancestry informative markers. Although the urban population from Lima is usually considered as mestizo (i.e., admixed from Africans, Europeans, and Native Americans), we observed a high fraction of Native American ancestry (78.4% for the cases and 74.6% for the controls) and a very low African ancestry (<5%). We determined that higher Native American individual ancestry is associated with gastric cancer, but socioeconomic factors associated both with gastric cancer and Native American ethnicity account for this association. Therefore, the high incidence of gastric cancer in Peru does not seem to be related to susceptibility alleles common in this population. Instead, our result suggests a predominant role for ethnic-associated socioeconomic factors and disparities in access to health services. Since Native Americans are a neglected group in genomic studies, we suggest that the population from Lima and other large cities from Western South America with high Native American ancestry background may be convenient targets for epidemiological studies focused on this ethnic group."

Treatment presents several problems, including high toxicity and many adverse effects, leading to the discontinuation of treatment and emergence of resistant strains.We evaluated the in vitro antileishmanial activity of benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derived from limonene complexed with copper, termed BenzCo, against Leishmania amazonensis. BenzCo inhibited the growth of the promastigote and axenic amastigote forms, with IC(50) concentrations of 3.8 and 9.5 µM, respectively, with 72 h of incubation. Intracellular amastigotes were inhibited by the compound, with an IC(50) of 10.7 µM. BenzCo altered the shape, size, and ultrastructure of the parasites. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization was observed in protozoa treated with BenzCo but caused no alterations in the plasma membrane. Additionally, BenzCo induced lipoperoxidation and the production of mitochondrial superoxide anion radicals in promastigotes and axenic amastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis.Our studies indicated that the antileishmania activity of BenzCo might be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage, leading to parasite death."
https://openalex.org/W2102801515,"β-Parvin is a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that localizes to focal adhesions where it interacts with integrin-linked kinase and is involved in linking integrin receptors to the cytoskeleton. It has been reported that despite high sequence similarity to α-parvin, β-parvin does not bind paxillin, suggesting distinct interactions and cellular functions for these two closely related parvins. Here, we reveal that β-parvin binds directly and specifically to leucine-aspartic acid repeat (LD) motifs in paxillin via its C-terminal calponin homology (CH2) domain. We present the co-crystal structure of β-parvin CH2 domain in complex with paxillin LD1 motif to 2.9 Å resolution and find that the interaction is similar to that previously observed between α-parvin and paxillin LD1. We also present crystal structures of unbound β-parvin CH2 domain at 2.1 Å and 2.0 Å resolution that show significant conformational flexibility in the N-terminal α-helix, suggesting an induced fit upon paxillin binding. We find that β-parvin has specificity for the LD1, LD2, and LD4 motifs of paxillin, with KD values determined to 27, 42, and 73 μm, respectively, by surface plasmon resonance. Furthermore, we show that proper localization of β-parvin to focal adhesions requires both the paxillin and integrin-linked kinase binding sites and that paxillin is important for early targeting of β-parvin.

Here, we present biochemical, biophysical, and crystallographic data that strongly support a direct interaction between β-parvin and paxillin LD motifs. We determine the co-crystal structure of the β-parvin CH2 domain in complex with the paxillin LD1 motif. We also determine crystal structures of β-parvin alone. Together, these structural data provide a detailed understanding of the β-parvin interaction with paxillin and suggest an induced fit in β-parvin upon paxillin binding. The localization of β-parvin to focal adhesions is investigated, and we dissect the impact on targeting of its interactions with both paxillin and ILK. Our results provide significant insight into the mechanism of recruitment of β-parvin to focal adhesions. Codon-optimized synthetic cDNA (GenScript; Piscataway, NJ) encoding human β-parvin (UniProt no. Q9HBI1) full-length (residues 1–364) or CH2 domain (residues 235–364) was subcloned into a modified pCDFDuet vector (Novagen). β-Parvin proteins were expressed as N-terminal hexahistidine (His6)-tagged fusions in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel affinity (HisTrap), anion exchange (MonoQ), and/or size exclusion (Superdex) chromatography. When applicable, the His tag was removed with tobacco etch virus protease. Point mutations were introduced with Quikchange mutagenesis (Agilent). Human paxillin LD motifs (LD1, residues 1–14; LD2, residues 142–155; LD3, residues 214–227; LD4, residues 263–276; LD5, residues 297–310) were generated by insertion of synthetic oligonucleotides 3′ to the GST coding and protease recognition sequence of pGEX-6p-1 (GE Healthcare) by QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent). GST-LD motifs were expressed in E. coli and purified on glutathione 4B beads (GE Healthcare), eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione, and further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200). For pulldown assays, purified β-parvin and paxillin proteins were reapplied to beads. A synthetic peptide corresponding to human paxillin LD1 (residues 1–20) was purchased from Tufts University Core Facility. GST-LD motif proteins on glutathione 4B beads were preblocked in 0.1% BSA and incubated with purified β-parvin proteins at 0.1–0.3 mg/ml in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol). Beads were washed with binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For pulldown assays from CHO cell lysates, His-tagged β-parvin proteins on nickel-NTA beads (Novagen) were preblocked in 1% BSA. CHO cell lysates were prepared in buffer X (1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 150 mm sucrose, 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8) plus 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and incubated with β-parvin-coated beads. Beads were washed in buffer X plus 0.05% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose for probing with anti-paxillin (clone 349, BD Transduction Laboratories no. 610051) or anti-ILK antibodies (Cell Signaling no. 3862). Equal amounts of β-parvin proteins on beads were verified by Coomassie staining. Anti-GST antibody (GE Healthcare; GST capture kit) was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip, and paxillin GST-LD motif fusion proteins were captured to the anti-GST surface, with GST alone captured to the reference cell. β-Parvin CH2 and α-parvin CH2 proteins were prepared as 2- or 3-fold dilution series in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA) and injected at 25C°. Binding responses were measured on a BIAcore T100 optical biosensor (GE Healthcare) and double-referenced against the signal from the GST reference cell and buffer-only injections. Three independent experiments (including duplicates) with different GST-LD surface densities were performed, and the KD was calculated with the BIAcore T100 Evaluation software. Initial crystallization hits were obtained from sparse matrix and grid screens (Qiagen).

https://openalex.org/W2005049319,"The accessory α(2)δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels are membrane-anchored proteins, which are highly glycosylated, possess multiple disulfide bonds, and are post-translationally cleaved into α(2) and δ. All α(2)δ subunits have a C-terminal hydrophobic, potentially trans-membrane domain and were described as type I transmembrane proteins, but we found evidence that they can be glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored. To probe further the function of membrane anchoring in α(2)δ subunits, we have now examined the properties of α(2)δ-1 constructs truncated at their putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor site, located before the C-terminal hydrophobic domain (α(2)δ-1ΔC-term). We find that the majority of α(2)δ-1ΔC-term is soluble and secreted into the medium, but unexpectedly, some of the protein remains associated with detergent-resistant membranes, also termed lipid rafts, and is extrinsically bound to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, heterologous co-expression of α(2)δ-1ΔC-term with Ca(V)2.1/β1b results in a substantial enhancement of the calcium channel currents, albeit less than that produced by wild-type α(2)δ-1. These results call into question the role of membrane anchoring of α(2)δ subunits for calcium current enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W2039523995,"The advent of high-throughput technologies such as ChIP-seq has made possible the study of histone modifications. A problem of particular interest is the identification of regions of the genome where different cell types from the same organism exhibit different patterns of histone enrichment. This problem turns out to be surprisingly difficult, even in simple pairwise comparisons, because of the significant level of noise in ChIP-seq data. In this paper we propose a two-stage statistical method, called ChIPnorm, to normalize ChIP-seq data, and to find differential regions in the genome, given two libraries of histone modifications of different cell types. We show that the ChIPnorm method removes most of the noise and bias in the data and outperforms other normalization methods. We correlate the histone marks with gene expression data and confirm that histone modifications H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 act as respectively a repressor and an activator of genes. Compared to what was previously reported in the literature, we find that a substantially higher fraction of bivalent marks in ES cells for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 move into a K27-only state. We find that most of the promoter regions in protein-coding genes have differential histone-modification sites. The software for this work can be downloaded from http://lcbb.epfl.ch/software.html."
https://openalex.org/W2170013728,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin critically involved in cell survival, synaptic plasticity, and memory. BDNF has recently garnered significant attention as a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), but emerging evidence suggests that BDNF may also be mechanistically involved in the pathogenesis of AD. AD patients have substantially reduced BDNF levels, which may be a result of Aβ and tau pathology. Recent evidence, however, indicates reduced BDNF levels may also serve to drive pathology in neuronal cultures, although this has not yet been established in vivo. To further investigate the mechanistic role of BDNF in AD, we generated 3xTg-AD mice with a heterozygous BDNF knockout (BDNF(+/-)) and analyzed Aβ and tau pathology. Aged 3xTg-AD/BDNF(+/-) mice have significantly reduced levels of brain BDNF, but have comparable levels of Aβ and tau pathology to 3xTg-AD/BDNF(+/+) mice. These findings indicate that chronic reduction of BDNF does not exacerbate the development of Aβ and tau pathology, and instead suggests the reduced BDNF levels found in AD patients are a consequence of these pathologies."

However, related research has been impeded by inconsistent LPS test results. Methods Specimens were obtained from HIV-infected adults enrolled in the PEARLS study (ACTG A5175) and HIV-HCV co-infected participants enrolled in a study of liver disease staging using MRI elastography. Pig-tailed macaque specimens were obtained from SIV-infected and –uninfected animals. Samples were tested for LPS using the LAL assay with diazo-coupling modifications to improve sensitive detection. Results When exogenous LPS was added to macaque plasma, >25% inhibition of LPS detection was found in 10/10 (100%) samples at 20% plasma concentration compared to control; in contrast 5/10 (50%) samples at 2% plasma concentration (p = 0.07) and 0/10 (0%) at 0.1% plasma concentration (p = 0.004) showed >25% inhibition of LPS detection. Similarly, when LPS was added to human serum, >25% inhibition of LPS detection was found in 5/12 (42%) of samples at 2% serum concentration compared to control, while 0/12 (0%) of samples in 0.1% serum showed >25% inhibition of LPS detection (p = 0.07). Likewise, LPS detection in human sera without exogenous LPS was improved by dilution: LPS was detected in 2/12 (17%) human samples in 2% serum, ranging from 3,436–4,736 pg/mL, compared to 9/12 (75%) samples in 0.1% serum, ranging from 123 pg/mL –60,131 pg/mL (p = 0.016). In a separate validation cohort of HIV-HCV co-infected participants sampled at two different times on the same day, LPS measured in 0.2% plasma and with diazo-coupling was closely correlated between the first and second samples (R = 0.66, p<0.05). Conclusions Undiluted serum and plasma mask LPS detection. The extent of MT may be substantially underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W2057349955,"Minimally invasive measurements of neuronal activity are essential for understanding how signal processing is performed by neuronal networks. While optical strategies for making such measurements hold great promise, optical sensors generally lack the speed and sensitivity necessary to record neuronal activity on a single-trial, single-neuron basis. Here we present additional biophysical characterization and practical improvements of a two-component optical voltage sensor (2cVoS), comprised of the neuronal tracer dye, DiO, and dipicrylamine (DiO/DPA). Using laser spot illumination we demonstrate that membrane potential-dependent fluorescence changes can be obtained in a wide variety of cell types within brain slices. We show a correlation between membrane labeling and the sensitivity of the magnitude of fluorescence signal, such that neurons with the brightest membrane labeling yield the largest ΔF/F values per action potential (AP; ∼40%). By substituting a blue-shifted donor for DiO we confirm that DiO/DPA works, at least in part, via a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism. We also describe a straightforward iontophoretic method for labeling multiple neurons with DiO and show that DiO/DPA is compatible with two-photon (2P) imaging. Finally, exploiting the high sensitivity of DiO/DPA, we demonstrate AP-induced fluorescence transients (fAPs) recorded from single spines of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and single-trial measurements of subthreshold synaptic inputs to granule cell dendrites. Our findings suggest that the 2cVoS, DiO/DPA, enables optical measurements of trial-to-trial voltage fluctuations with very high spatial and temporal resolution, properties well suited for monitoring electrical signals from multiple neurons within intact neuronal networks."

Through the integration of personal to community information technology platforms, we have developed a new Intelligent Comprehensive Interactive Care (ICIC) system to provide comprehensive services for elderly care. The ICIC system consists of six items, including medical care (physiological measuring system, Medication Reminder, and Dr. Ubiquitous), diet, living, transportation, education (Intelligent Watch), entertainment (Sharetouch), and safety (Fall Detection). In this study, we specifically evaluated the users' intention of using the Medication Reminder, Dr. Ubiquitous, Sharetouch, and Intelligent Watch using a modified technological acceptance model (TAM). A total of 121 elderly subjects (48 males and 73 females) were recruited. The modified TAM questionnaires were collected after they had used these products. For most of the ICIC units, the elderly subjects revealed great willingness and/or satisfaction in using this system. The elderly users of the Intelligent Watch showed the greatest willingness and satisfaction, while the elderly users of Dr. Ubiquitous revealed fair willingness in the dimension of perceived ease of use. The old-old age group revealed greater satisfaction in the dimension of result demonstrability for the users of the Medication Reminder as compared to the young-old and oldest-old age groups. The women revealed greater satisfaction in the dimension of perceived ease of use for the users of Dr. Ubiquitous as compared to the men. There were no statistically significant differences in terms of gender, age, and education level in the other dimensions. The modified TAM showed its effectiveness in evaluating the acceptance and characteristics of technologic products for the elderly user.

A significant association between MS and CCSVI was found with an odds ratio of 3.41 (95% confidence interval 1.63-7.13; p = 0.001). CCSVI was significantly more frequent among MS subjects with a disease duration longer than 144 months (26.1% versus 12.6% of patients with duration shorter than 144 months; p = 0.03) and among patients with secondary progressive (SP) and primary progressive (PP) forms (30.2% and 29.4, respectively) than in patients with relapsing remitting (RR) MS (14.3%). A stronger association was found considering SP and PP forms (age adjusted OR = 4.7; 95% CI 1.83-12.0, p = 0.001); the association was weaker with the RR patients (age adjusted OR = 2.58; 95%CI 1.12-5.92; p = 0.02) or not significant in CIS group (age adjusted OR = 2.04; 95%CI 0.40-10.3; p = 0.4).A higher frequency of CCSVI has been found in MS patients; it was more evident in patients with advanced MS, suggesting that CCSVI could be related to MS disability."
https://openalex.org/W2072536328,"Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) bind peptides generated by limited proteolysis in cells and present them at the cell surfaces for recognition by T cells. Through this antigen presentation function they control the specificity of T cell responses and thereby adaptive immune responses. Knowledge of HLA-bound peptides is thus key to understanding adaptive immunity and to the development of vaccines and other specific immune intervention strategies. To gain insight into the antigenicity of melanomas, peptides were extracted from HLA isolated from the tumor cells, separated by two-dimensional HPLC, and sequenced by mass spectrometry. The spectra were analyzed by database-dependent MASCOT searches and database-independent de novo sequencing and, where required, confirmed with synthetic peptides, which were also used to determine their immunogenicity. Comparing four different melanoma cell lines, little overlap of the HLA-bound peptides was found, suggesting a high degree of individualization of the HLA peptidomes. This notwithstanding, the peptidomes were highly immunogenic in the patients from whom the tumor cells had been established and in unrelated patients. This broad cross-patient immunogenicity was only exceptionally related to individual peptides. The majority of the identified epitopes were derived from low to medium abundance proteins, mostly involved in sensitive cellular processes such as cell cycle control, DNA replication, control of gene expression, tumor suppressor function, and protein metabolism. The peptidomes thus provide insights into processes potentially related to tumorigenesis. Furthermore, analyses of the peptide sequences yield information on the specificity of peptide selection by HLA applicable to the developing prediction algorithms for T cell epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W2089324007,"How cholesterol is sensed to maintain homeostasis has been explained by direct binding to a specific protein, Scap, or through altering the physical properties of the membrane.

This is the first study to compare ent- and nat-cholesterol directly on major molecular parameters of cholesterol homeostasis. We found that ent-cholesterol suppressed activation of the master transcriptional regulator of cholesterol metabolism, SREBP-2, almost as effectively as nat-cholesterol. Importantly, ent-cholesterol induced a conformational change in the cholesterol-sensing protein Scap in isolated membranes in vitro, even when steps were taken to eliminate potential confounding effects from endogenous cholesterol.

Cholesterol is an important lipid in human health and disease. Its unique physicochemical properties allow it to perform diverse cellular roles. Apart from being a precursor for vital classes of molecules (e.g. steroid hormones and bile acids), cholesterol itself has crucial functions within the cell. Cholesterol reinforces membranes, organizes membrane subdomains such as lipid rafts, and is an intimately associated modulator of a growing list of integral membrane proteins (1Lingwood D. Simons K.

Moreover, the conformational change switches the MELADL sorting signal in Scap to a new location with respect to the ER membrane, preventing COPII protein binding and hence blocking transport of SREBP-2 to the Golgi for activation (10Sun L.P. Seemann J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Sterol-regulated transport of SREBPs from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi: Insig renders sorting signal in Scap inaccessible to COPII proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Together, these studies provide compelling evidence that the Scap conformation is the central determinant that dictates the rate of SREBP-2 processing. Recently, we have introduced yet another player in cholesterol homeostasis, with cholesterol feeding back on a key cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, squalene monooxygenase (SM), by accelerating its proteasomal degradation (11Gill S. Stevenson J. Kristiana I. Brown A.J. Cholesterol-dependent degradation of squalene monooxygenase, a control point in cholesterol synthesis beyond HMG-CoA reductase.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 260-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, certain oxysterols and intermediates in cholesterol synthesis also participate in cholesterol homeostasis (12Gill S. Chow R. Brown A.J. Sterol regulators of cholesterol homeostasis and beyond: the oxysterol hypothesis revisited and revised.Prog. Lipid Res. 2008; 47: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), for example, by inhibiting SREBP activation (13Wong J. Quinn C.M. Gelissen I.C. Brown A.J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 700-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and by accelerating the Insig-dependent proteasomal degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), another key cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme (14Song B.L. Javitt N.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Insig-mediated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase stimulated by lanosterol, an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol.Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Lange Y.

Chem. 2008; 283: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). How sterols operate to achieve cholesterol homeostasis has been explained by two alternate models. The first and prevailing model is that the sterols are sensed directly by the homeostatic machinery. Supporting this is evidence that cholesterol directly binds Scap (8Motamed M. Zhang Y. Wang M.L. Seemann J. Kwon H.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Identification of luminal loop 1 of Scap protein as the sterol sensor that maintains cholesterol homeostasis.J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6511-6518Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The alternative view is that sterols induce a change in the physical properties of the membrane bilayer in the environs of the sensing proteins. Earlier studies on the specificity of the Scap conformational change were also consistent with this latter model, in that sterols that could induce the conformational change (5Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cholesterol addition to ER membranes alters conformation of SCAP, the SREBP escort protein that regulates cholesterol metabolism.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) most altered membrane fluidity (19Gimpl G. Cholesterol-protein interaction: methods and cholesterol reporter molecules.Subcell. Biochem. 2010; 51: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and this effect could be mimicked by particular amphiphiles known to influence membrane properties (6Adams C.M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cholesterol-induced conformational change in SCAP enhanced by Insig proteins and mimicked by cationic amphiphiles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10647-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies of the SREBP system in Drosophila cells indicated that phosphatidylethanolamine, rather than sterols, are sensed by Scap in flies, and it was suggested that cholesterol in mammals and phosphatidylethanolamine in flies may both be sensed by Scap through similar perturbations of the ER membrane (20Dobrosotskaya I.Y. Seegmiller A.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Rawson R.B. Regulation of SREBP processing and membrane lipid production by phospholipids in Drosophila.Science. 2002; 296: 879-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Employing an enantiomer of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), Gale et al. implicated oxysterol-membrane interactions in the acute regulation of sterol homeostatic responses (21Gale S.E. Westover E.J. Dudley N. Krishnan K. Merlin S. Scherrer D.E. Han X. Zhai X. Brockman H.L. Brown R.E. Covey D.F. Schaffer J.E. Schlesinger P. Ory D.S. Side chain oxygenated cholesterol regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis through direct sterol-membrane interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1755-1764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The relative importance of these two modes of sterol action in cholesterol homeostasis requires clarification. The enantiomer of cholesterol (ent-cholesterol) is the mirror image of native cholesterol (nat-cholesterol, Fig. 1A), with both molecules supporting normal growth of mammalian cells (22Xu F. Rychnovsky S.D. Belani J.D. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. Rawson R.B. Dual roles for cholesterol in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14551-14556Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and sharing major physicochemical properties and hence effects on membranes. In contrast, direct protein binding is enantioselective. Therefore, ent-cholesterol is a valuable tool to determine whether the effects of cholesterol on protein function derive from changes in membrane properties or from the direct binding of this sterol to a membrane protein (23Mickus D.E.

The enantiomer of cholesterol.J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 202: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this report, we have compared the effects of ent-cholesterol with nat-cholesterol on major measures of cholesterol homeostasis. Chinese hamster ovary-7 (CHO-7), SRD-1, SRD-13A, and CHO/pGFP-Scap cells were generous gifts of Drs. Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein (University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12) and newborn calf serum (NCS) were purchased from Invitrogen. Lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) was prepared from NCS as described previously (25Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Receptor-mediated endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein in cultured cells.Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Nat-cholesterol (Steraloids) and ent-cholesterol (synthesized according to Ref. 26Belani J.D. Rychnovsky S.D. A concise synthesis of ent-cholesterol.J. Org. Chem. 2008; 73: 2768-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were complexed to methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) as described (5Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cholesterol addition to ER membranes alters conformation of SCAP, the SREBP escort protein that regulates cholesterol metabolism.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The molar ratio of sterol to CD was ∼0.1 for nat-cholesterol and ∼0.07 for ent-cholesterol. The lower complexing efficiency for ent-cholesterol is likely due to the altered ability of the enantiomer to interact with the optically active interior of CD (27Mitchell C.R. Armstrong D.W. Cyclodextrin-based chiral stationary phases for liquid chromatography: a twenty-year overview.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 243: 61-112PubMed Google Scholar). Compactin (mevastatin), mevalonate, sodium oleate, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), bovine serum albumin (BSA), trypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, 25-HC, CD, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD), and U18666A were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The SM inhibitor GR144000X (equivalent to NB-598), was a kind gift from GlaxoSmithKline. All cells were grown in monolayer at 37 °C in 5% CO2. CHO-7, SRD-1, and CHO/pGFP-Scap cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% (v/v) LPDS. SRD-13A cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (containing 5 μg/ml cholesterol, 1 mm mevalonate, and 20 μm sodium oleate) supplemented with 5% (v/v) NCS. Before treatment, cells were pretreated overnight with statin to deplete sterols. Cells were then treated as indicated in the figure legends. Sterols were delivered to cells as CD complexes. Pretreatment and treatment media were DMEM/F12 containing 5% (v/v) LPDS, 5 μm compactin, and 50 μm mevalonate. “Enantiomer medium” was DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% (v/v) LPDS containing 3 μg/ml ent-cholesterol (complexed to CD) and 5 μm SM inhibitor to inhibit sterol synthesis.

The Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay kit (Invitrogen) contains cholesterol oxidase from Streptomyces and was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescence signal was measured using a POLARstar Omega microplate spectrofluorometer (excitation λ 544 nm, emission λ 590 nm; BMG Labtech) and was expressed relative to protein levels, measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce).

Lipids were extracted in a total aqueous volume of 1 ml, containing 2 mm EDTA and 20 μm butylated hydroxytoluene. Methanol (2.5 ml) was added, followed by 5 ml of hexane. Hexane extracts were evaporated and redissolved in the mobile phase, acetonitrile:isopropyl alcohol (30:70, v/v). Both nat-cholesterol and ent-cholesterol were analyzed by HPLC using a Supelco reverse-phase C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm, 2-cm Pelliguard column, 5-μm particle size (Sigma-Aldrich)), run at room temperature with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. UV detection was at 210 nm. All solvents were HPLC grade (Merck). Cells were labeled with 1 μCi of [1-14C]palmitate (specific activity 56.0 mCi/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) for 4 h during treatment. Lipid extracts were analyzed for cholesteryl [14C]esters by thin layer chromatography (TLC) followed by phosphorimaging, as described previously (29Kristiana I. Sharpe L.J. Catts V.S. Lutze-Mann L.H.

[3H]Cholesterol (10 μCi) was dried under nitrogen, redissolved in 2.5 μl of 20% (w/v) HPCD, vortexed for 1 min five times, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C before adding 17.5 μl of PBS. The complex was then vortexed for 1 min three times and incubated for 3 min at 37 °C. Following statin pretreatment, cells were washed twice in PBS and pulse-labeled in PBS for 10 min at room temperature with the [3H]cholesterol-HPCD complex. After washing three times with 0.5 mg/ml BSA/PBS, cells were treated for 4 h as indicated. Lipid extracts were separated by TLC as described above.

Cells were harvested in buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and 250 mm sucrose) and homogenized with a 22-gauge needle (40×). Membrane fractions were isolated (5Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Fractions were then pelleted, resuspended in buffer A, and incubated with 1 μg of trypsin for 20 min at 30 °C. Trypsin digestion was stopped by addition of 10 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Samples were subsequently treated with PNGase F (Genesearch) for 2 h at 37 °C, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were mixed with 0.25 volumes of 5× SDS loading buffer and subjected to 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with IgG-R139. Unless otherwise stated, quantitative data are presented as averages, and all error bars represent the S.E. from at least three separate experiments. Statistical differences were determined by paired t tests (two-tailed), where a p value of ≤0.05 (*) and ≤0.01 (**) were considered statistically significant. First, we confirmed that our preparation of ent-cholesterol performed as described in published assays. According to earlier reports, ent-cholesterol can serve as a substrate for bacterial cholesterol oxidase, which is routinely used in the enzymatic determination of cholesterol levels. However, the kinetics for oxidation of ent-cholesterol by this enzyme are reportedly slower and less complete than for nat-cholesterol, yielding 15 and 76% of signal after 5 and 60 min at 37 °C, respectively (36Luker G.D. Pica C.M. Kumar A.S. Covey D.F. Piwnica-Worms D. Effects of cholesterol and enantiomeric cholesterol on P-glycoprotein localization and function in low-density membrane domains.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7651-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We found that cholesterol oxidase treatment of ent-cholesterol yielded similar values at these times (22 and 79%, respectively) (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the ent-cholesterol behaves similarly to published data. Previously, we have shown that cholesterol complexed to CD rapidly and robustly produces cholesterol homeostatic responses in CHO-7 cells, a commonly used model of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (4Radhakrishnan A.

Here, we prepared CD complexes for nat- and ent-cholesterol which were then used to treat CHO-7 cells for 4 h. Using HPLC/UV analysis, we found that at equivalent cholesterol concentrations, ent-cholesterol resulted in cellular cholesterol loading comparable with that of nat-cholesterol (Fig. 1C). Cholesterol esterification by the ER resident enzyme acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) is enantioselective, in that ent-cholesterol is a very poor substrate for ACAT (37Liu J. Chang C.C.

https://openalex.org/W2021198620,"Determining the number of clusters in a data set is an essential yet difficult step in cluster analysis. Since this task involves more than one criterion, it can be modeled as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. This paper proposes a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM)-based approach to estimate the number of clusters for a given data set. In this approach, MCDM methods consider different numbers of clusters as alternatives and the outputs of any clustering algorithm on validity measures as criteria. The proposed method is examined by an experimental study using three MCDM methods, the well-known clustering algorithm--k-means, ten relative measures, and fifteen public-domain UCI machine learning data sets. The results show that MCDM methods work fairly well in estimating the number of clusters in the data and outperform the ten relative measures considered in the study."
https://openalex.org/W2042887225,"The spread of prostate cancer cells to the bone marrow microenvironment and castration resistant growth are key steps in disease progression and significant sources of morbidity. However, the biological significance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and bone marrow derived extracellular matrix (BM-ECM) in this process is not fully understood. We therefore established an in vitro engineered bone marrow tissue model that incorporates hMSCs and BM-ECM to facilitate mechanistic studies of prostate cancer cell survival in androgen-depleted media in response to paracrine factors and BM-ECM. hMSC-derived paracrine factors increased LNCaP cell survival, which was in part attributed to IGFR and IL6 signaling. In addition, BM-ECM increased LNCaP and MDA-PCa-2b cell survival in androgen-depleted conditions, and induced chemoresistance and morphological changes in LNCaPs. To determine the effect of BM-ECM on cell signaling, the phosphorylation status of 46 kinases was examined. Increases in the phosphorylation of MAPK pathway-related proteins as well as sustained Akt phosphorylation were observed in BM-ECM cultures when compared to cultures grown on plasma-treated polystyrene. Blocking MEK1/2 or the PI3K pathway led to a significant reduction in LNCaP survival when cultured on BM-ECM in androgen-depleted conditions. The clinical relevance of these observations was determined by analyzing Erk phosphorylation in human bone metastatic prostate cancer versus non-metastatic prostate cancer, and increased phosphorylation was seen in the metastatic samples. Here we describe an engineered bone marrow model that mimics many features observed in patients and provides a platform for mechanistic in vitro studies."
https://openalex.org/W2015206069,"The 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS; EC 2.5.1.19) is a key enzyme in the shikimate pathway for the production of aromatic amino acids and chorismate-derived secondary metabolites in plants, fungi, and microorganisms. It is also the target of the broad-spectrum herbicide glyphosate. Natural glyphosate resistance is generally thought to occur within microorganisms in a strong selective pressure condition. Rahnella aquatilis strain GR20, an antagonist against pathogenic agrobacterial strains of grape crown gall, was isolated from the rhizosphere of grape in glyphosate-contaminated vineyards. A novel gene encoding EPSPS was identified from the isolated bacterium by complementation of an Escherichia coli auxotrophic aroA mutant. The EPSPS, named AroAR.aquatilis, was expressed and purified from E. coli, and key kinetic values were determined. The full-length enzyme exhibited higher tolerance to glyphosate than the E. coli EPSPS (AroAE.coli), while retaining high affinity for the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate. Transgenic plants of AroAR.aquatilis were also observed to be more resistant to glyphosate at a concentration of 5 mM than that of AroAE.coli. To probe the sites contributing to increased tolerance to glyphosate, mutant R.aquatilis EPSPS enzymes were produced with the c-strand of subdomain 3 and the f-strand of subdomain 5 (Thr38Lys, Arg40Val, Arg222Gln, Ser224Val, Ile225Val, and Gln226Lys) substituted by the corresponding region of the E. coli EPSPS. The mutant enzyme exhibited greater sensitivity to glyphosate than the wild type R.aquatilis EPSPS with little change of affinity for its first substrate, shikimate-3-phosphate (S3P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). The effect of the residues on subdomain 5 on glyphosate resistance was more obvious."
https://openalex.org/W2052295209,"Nanostructuring of drug delivery systems offers many promising applications like precise control of dissolution and release kinetics, enhanced activities, flexibility in terms of surface coatings, integration into implants, designing the appropriate scaffolds or even integrating into microelectronic chips etc. for different desired applications. In general such kind of structuring is difficult due to unintentional mixing of chemical solvents used during drug formulations. We demonstrate here the successful solvent-free fabrication of micro-nanostructured pharmaceutical molecules by simple thermal evaporation (TE). The evaporation of drug molecules and their emission to a specific surface under vacuum led to controlled assembling of the molecules from vapour phase to solid phase. The most important aspects of thermal evaporation technique are: solvent-free, precise control of size, possibility of fabricating multilayer/hybrid, and free choice of substrates. This could be shown for twenty eight pharmaceutical substances of different chemical structures which were evaporated on surfaces of titanium and glass discs. Structural investigations of different TE fabricated drugs were performed by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy which revealed that these drug substances preserve their structurality after evaporation. Titanium discs coated with antimicrobial substances by thermal evaporation were subjected to tests for antibacterial or antifungal activities, respectively. A significant increase in their antimicrobial activity was observed in zones of inhibition tests compared to controls of the diluted substances on the discs made of paper for filtration. With thermal evaporation, we have successfully synthesized solvent-free nanostructured drug delivery systems in form of multilayer structures and in hybrid drug complexes respectively. Analyses of these substances consolidated that thermal evaporation opens up the possibility to convert dissoluble drug substances into the active forms by their transfer onto a specific surface without the need of their prior dissolution."

We discovered 16 InDels (insertions and deletions) but no SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) is present between the two Hassawi cp genomes. We identified 48 InDels and 26 SNPs in the two Hassawi mt genomes and a new type of sequence variation, termed reverse complementary variation (RCV) in the rice cp genomes. There are two and four RCVs identified in Hassawi-1 when compared to 93–11 (indica) and Nipponbare (japonica), respectively. Microsatellite sequence analysis showed there are more SSRs in the genic regions of both cp and mt genomes in the Hassawi rice than in the other rice varieties. There are also large repeats in the Hassawi mt genomes, with the longest length of 96,168 bp and 96,165 bp in Hassawi-1 and Hassawi-2, respectively. We believe that frequent DNA rearrangement in the Hassawi mt and cp genomes indicate ongoing dynamic processes to reach genetic stability under strong environmental pressures. Based on sequence variation analysis and the breeding history, we suggest that both Hassawi-1 and Hassawi-2 originated from the Indonesian variety Peta since genetic diversity between the two Hassawi cultivars is very low albeit an unknown historic origin of the wild-type Hassawi rice."
https://openalex.org/W2013531546,"Transglutaminases function as biological glues in animal cells, plant cells and microbes. In energy producing organelles such as chloroplasts the presence of transglutaminases was recently confirmed. Furthermore, a plastidial transglutaminase has been cloned from maize and the first plants overexpressing tgz are available (Nicotiana tabacum TGZ OE). Our hypothesis is that the overexpression of plastidal transglutaminase will alter photosynthesis via increased polyamination of the antenna of photosystem II. We have used standard analytical tools to separate the antenna from photosystem II in wild type and modified plants, 6 specific antibodies against LHCbs to confirm their presence and sensitive HPLC method to quantify the polyamination level of these proteins. We report that bound spermidine and spermine were significantly increased (∼80%) in overexpressors. Moreover, we used recent advances in in vivo probing to study simultaneously the proton and electron circuit of thylakoids. Under physiological conditions overexpressors show a 3-fold higher sensitivity of the antenna down regulation loop (qE) to the elicitor (luminal protons) which is estimated as the ΔpH component of thylakoidal proton motive force. In addition, photosystem (hyper-PSIIα) with an exceptionally high antenna (large absorption cross section), accumulate in transglutaminase over expressers doubling the rate constant of light energy utilization (Kα) and promoting thylakoid membrane stacking. Polyamination of antenna proteins is a previously unrecognized mechanism for the modulation of the size (antenna absorption cross section) and sensitivity of photosystem II to down regulation. Future research will reveal which peptides and which residues of the antenna are responsible for such effects."
https://openalex.org/W2040166816,"Pragmatic methods for dose optimization are required for the successful basal management in daily clinical practice. To derive a useful formula for calculating recommended glargine doses, we analyzed data from the Add-on Lantus® to Oral Hypoglycemic Agents (ALOHA) study, a 24-week observation of Japanese type 2 diabetes patients.The patients who initiated insulin glargine in basal-supported oral therapy (BOT) regimen (n = 3506) were analyzed. The correlations between average changes in glargine dose and HbA1c were calculated, and its regression formula was estimated from grouped data categorized by baseline HbA1c levels. Starting doses of the background-subgroup achieving the HbA1c target with a last-observed dose above the average were compared to an assumed optimal starting dose of 0.15 U/kg/day. The difference in regression lines between background-subgroups was examined. A formula for determining the optimal starting and titration doses was thereby derived. The correlation coefficient between changes in dose and HbA1c was -0.9043. The estimated regression line formula was -0.964 × change in HbA1c+2.000. A starting dose of 0.15 U/kg/day was applicable to all background-subgroups except for patients with retinopathy (0.120 U/kg/day) and/or with eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (0.114 U/kg/day). Additionally, women (0.135 U/kg/day) and patients with sulfonylureas (0.132 U/kg/day) received a slightly decreased starting dose.We suggest a simplified and pragmatic dose calculation formula for type 2 diabetes patients starting glargine BOT optimal daily dose at 24 weeks = starting dose (0.15×weight) + incremental dose (baseline HbA1c - target HbA1c+2). This formula should be further validated using other samples in a prospective follow-up, especially since several patient groups required lower starting doses."
https://openalex.org/W2058651240,"We previously showed that the time-dependent intensification (""incubation"") of cue-induced cocaine seeking after withdrawal from extended-access cocaine self-administration is accompanied by accumulation of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) in the rat nucleus accumbens (NAc). These results suggest an enduring change in Ca(2+) signaling in NAc dendritic spines. The purpose of the present study was to determine if Ca(2+) signaling via NMDA receptors (NMDARs) is also altered after incubation. Rats self-administered cocaine or saline for 10 days (6 h/day). After 45-47 days of withdrawal, NMDAR-mediated Ca(2+) entry elicited by glutamate uncaging was monitored in individual NAc dendritic spines. NMDAR currents were simultaneously recorded using whole cell patch clamp recordings. We also measured NMDAR subunit levels in a postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction prepared from the NAc of identically treated rats. NMDAR currents did not differ between groups, but a smaller percentage of spines in the cocaine group responded to glutamate uncaging with NMDAR-mediated Ca(2+) entry. No significant group differences in NMDAR subunit protein levels were found. The decrease in the proportion of spines showing NMDAR-mediated Ca(2+) entry suggests that NAc neurons in the cocaine group contain more spines which lack NMDARs (non-responding spines). The fact that cocaine and saline groups did not differ in NMDAR currents or NMDAR subunit levels suggests that the number of NMDARs on responding spines is not significantly altered by cocaine exposure. These findings are discussed in light of increases in dendritic spine density in the NAc observed after withdrawal from repeated cocaine exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2069194600,"For present-day biotas, close relationships have been documented between the number of species in a given region and the area of the region. To date, however, there have been only limited studies of these relationships in the geologic record, particularly for ancient marine biotas. The recent development of large-scale marine paleontological databases, in conjunction with enhanced geographical mapping tools, now allow for their investigation. At the same time, there has been renewed interest in comparing the environmental and paleobiological properties of two broad-scale marine settings: epicontinental seas, broad expanses of shallow water covering continental areas, and open-ocean-facing settings, shallow shelves and coastlines that rim ocean basins. Recent studies indicate that spatial distributions of taxa and the kinetics of taxon origination and extinction may have differed in these two settings. Against this backdrop, we analyze regional Genus-Area Relationships (GARs) of Late Cretaceous marine invertebrates in epicontinental sea and open-ocean settings using data from the Paleobiology Database. We present a new method for assessing GARs that is particularly appropriate for fossil data when the geographic distribution of these data is patchy and uneven. Results demonstrate clear relationships between genus richness and area for regions worldwide, but indicate that as area increases, genus richness increases more per unit area in epicontinental seas than in open-ocean settings. This difference implies a greater degree of compositional heterogeneity as a function of geographic area in epicontinental sea settings, a finding that is consistent with the emerging understanding of physical differences in the nature of water masses between the two marine settings."
https://openalex.org/W2100211004,"OX40L is an important costimulatory molecule that plays a crucial role in the regulation of T-cell-mediated immunity. The interaction of OX40-OX40L is involved in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), carotid artery disease and cancer. The genetic variants of OX40L can increase the risk of SLE, atherosclerosis, systemic sclerosis and show gender-specific effects in some studies. Accordingly, we performed a case-control study including 557 breast cancer patients and 580 age- and sex-matched healthy controls to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the OX40L gene are associated with sporadic breast cancer susceptibility and progression in Chinese Han women. Seven SNPs of OX40L (rs6661173, rs1234313, rs3850641, rs1234315, rs12039904, rs844648 and rs10912580) were genotyped with the method of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The results indicated that rs3850641G allele could increase the susceptibility to breast cancer (P = 0.009662), even in the validation study (P = 0.0001515). A significant association between rs3850641 and breast cancer risk was observed under the additive model and dominant model (P = 0.01042 and 0.01942, respectively). The haplotype analysis showed that haplotype Ars844648Ars10912580 was significantly associated with breast cancer, even after 10,000 permutations for haplotypes in block only (P = 0.0003). In clinicopathologic features analysis, the association between rs1234315 and C-erbB2 status was significant (P = 0.02541). Our data primarily indicates that rs3850641 of OX40L gene contributes to sporadic breast carcinogenesis in a northeast Chinese Han population."
https://openalex.org/W1965427186,"Introduction The expression of hundreds of genes is altered in response to left ventricular (LV) remodeling following large transmural myocardial infarction (MI). Thyroid hormone (TH) improves LV remodeling and cardiac performance after MI. However, the molecular basis is unknown. Methods MI was produced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in female SD rats. Rats were divided into the following groups: (1) Sham MI, (2) MI, and (3) MI+T4 treatment (T4 pellet 3.3 mg, 60 days release, implanted subcutaneously immediately following MI). Four weeks after surgery, total RNA was isolated from LV non-infarcted areas for microarray analysis using the Illumina RatRef-12 Expression BeadChip Platform. Results Signals were detected in 13,188 genes (out of 22,523), of which the expression of 154 genes were decreased and the expression of 200 genes were increased in MI rats compared with Sham MI rats (false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05). Compared to MI rats, T4 treatment decreased expression of 27 genes and increased expression of 28 genes. In particular, 6 genes down-regulated by MI and 12 genes up-regulated by MI were reversed by T4. Most of the 55 genes altered by T4 treatment are in the category of molecular function under binding (24) and biological processes which includes immune system process (9), multi-organism process (5) and biological regulation (19) nonexclusively. Conclusions These results suggest that altered expression of genes for molecular function and biological process may be involved in the beneficial effects of thyroid hormone treatment following MI in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2023440860,"The use of the lipid lowering agent niacin is hampered by a frequent flush response which is largely mediated by prostaglandin (PG) D2. Therefore, concomitant administration of the D-type prostanoid (DP) receptor antagonist laropiprant has been proposed to be a useful approach in preventing niacin-induced flush. However, antagonizing PGD2, which is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, might pose the risk of atherothrombotic events in cardiovascular disease. In fact, we found that in vitro treatment of platelets with laropiprant prevented the inhibitory effects of PGD2 on platelet function, i.e. platelet aggregation, Ca2+ flux, P-selectin expression, activation of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and thrombus formation. In contrast, laropiprant did not prevent the inhibitory effects of acetylsalicylic acid or niacin on thrombus formation. At higher concentrations, laropiprant by itself attenuated platelet activation induced by thromboxane (TP) and E-type prostanoid (EP)-3 receptor stimulation, as demonstrated in assays of platelet aggregation, Ca2+ flux, P-selectin expression, and activation of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Inhibition of platelet function exerted by EP4 or I-type prostanoid (IP) receptors was not affected by laropiprant. These in vitro data suggest that niacin/laropiprant for the treatment of dyslipidemias might have a beneficial profile with respect to platelet function and thrombotic events in vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2056327947,"The trophic interactions of sea urchins are known to be the agents of phase shifts in benthic marine habitats such as tropical and temperate reefs. In temperate reefs, the grazing activity of sea urchins has been responsible for the destruction of kelp forests and the formation of ‘urchin barrens’, a rocky habitat dominated by crustose algae and encrusting invertebrates. Once formed, these urchin barrens can persist for decades. Trophic plasticity in the sea urchin may contribute to the stability and resilience of this alternate stable state by increasing diet breadth in sea urchins. This plasticity promotes ecological connectivity and weakens species interactions and so increases ecosystem stability. We test the hypothesis that sea urchins exhibit trophic plasticity using an approach that controls for other typically confounding environmental and genetic factors. To do this, we exposed a genetically homogenous population of sea urchins to two very different trophic environments over a period of two years. The sea urchins exhibited a wide degree of phenotypic trophic plasticity when exposed to contrasting trophic environments. The two populations developed differences in their gross morphology and the test microstructure. In addition, when challenged with unfamiliar prey, the response of each group was different. We show that sea urchins exhibit significant morphological and behavioural phenotypic plasticity independent of their environment or their nutritional status."
https://openalex.org/W2149750842,"The production of offspring typically requires investment of resources derived from both the environment and maternal somatic reserves. As such, the availability of either of these types of resources has the potential to limit the degree to which resources are allocated to reproduction. Theory and empirical studies have argued that mothers modify reproductive performance relative to exogenous resource availability and maternal condition by adjusting size, number or sex of offspring produced. These relationships have classically been defined relative to availability of energy sources; however, in vertebrates, calcium also plays a critical role in offspring production, as a considerable amount of calcium is required to support the development of offspring skeleton(s). We tested whether the availability of calcium influences reproductive output by providing female white-footed mice with a low-calcium or standard diet from reproductive maturity to senescence. We then compared maternal skeletal condition and reproductive output, based on offspring mass, offspring number and litter sex ratio, between dietary treatments. Mothers on the low-calcium diet exhibited diminished skeletal condition at senescence and produced smaller and strongly female-biased litters. We show that skeletal condition and calcium intake can influence sex ratio and reproductive output following general theoretical models of resource partitioning during reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2029718542,"Background Filamin A (FLNa) is an actin-crosslinking protein necessary for stabilizing the cell surface, organizing protrusive activity and for promoting efficient cellular translocation. Recently, our group demonstrated the requirement of FLNa for the internalization of the chemokine receptor CCR2B. Methodology and Principal Findings In order to study the role of FLNa in vitro and in real-time, we have developed a fluorescent FLNa-EGFP construct. In this novel imaging tool, we introduced the EGFP-tag inside the flexible hinge 1 region of FLNa between two calpain cleavage sites. Our findings indicate that the FLNa-EGFP construct was correctly expressed, cleaved by calpain and colocalized with actin filaments as shown by immunostaining experiments in the human melanoma cell lines A7 (FLNa-repleted) and M2 (FLNa-deficient). In addition, scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) and micropatterning studies also provided clear evidence that the cell rigidity was restored. FLNa-EGFP allowed us to demonstrate the interaction of FLNa with the chemokine receptor CCR2B in endocytic vesicles after CCL2 ligand stimulation. Through live-cell imaging studies we show that the CCR2B receptor in Rab5-positive vesicles moves along filamin A-positive fibers. Significance Taken together, these results outline the functionality of the FLNa-EGFP and the importance of filamin A for receptor internalization and movement into endocytic vesicles."
