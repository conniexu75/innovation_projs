https://openalex.org/W2883874761,"Topological materials (TMs) showcase intriguing physical properties defying expectations based on conventional materials, and hold promise for the development of devices with new functionalities. While several theoretically proposed TMs have been experimentally confirmed, extensive experimental exploration of topological properties as well as applications in realistic devices have been held back due to the lack of excellent TMs in which interference from trivial Fermi surface states is minimized. We tackle this problem in the present work by applying our recently developed method of symmetry indicators to all non-magnetic compounds in the 230 space groups. An exhaustive database search reveals thousands of TM candidates. Of these, we highlight the excellent TMs, the 258 topological insulators and 165 topological crystalline insulators which have either noticeable full band gap or a considerable direct gap together with small trivial Fermi pockets. We also give a list of 489 topological semimetals with the band crossing points located near the Fermi level. All predictions obtained through standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA) calculations were cross-checked with the modified Becke-Johnson (MBJ) potential calculations, appropriate for narrow gap materials. With the electronic and optical behavior around the Fermi level dominated by the topologically non-trivial bands, these newly found TMs candidates open wide possibilities for realizing the promise of TMs in next-generation electronic devices."

We investigated the immunomodulatory activities of lenvatinib in the tumor microenvironment and its mechanisms of enhanced antitumor activity when combined with a programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) blockade. Antitumor activity was examined in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse tumor models. Single-cell analysis, flow cytometric analysis, and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze immune cell populations and their activation. Gene co-expression network analysis and pathway analysis using RNA sequencing data were used to identify lenvatinib-driven combined activity with anti-PD-1 antibody (anti-PD-1). Lenvatinib showed potent antitumor activity in the immunocompetent tumor microenvironment compared with the immunodeficient tumor microenvironment. Antitumor activity of lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 was greater than that of either single treatment. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that lenvatinib reduced tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and increased the percentage of activated CD8+ T cells secreting interferon (IFN)-γ+ and granzyme B (GzmB). Combination treatment further increased the percentage of T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, among CD45+ cells and increased IFN-γ+ and GzmB+ CD8+ T cells. Transcriptome analyses of tumors resected from treated mice showed that genes specifically regulated by the combination were significantly enriched for type-I IFN signaling. Pretreatment with lenvatinib followed by anti-PD-1 treatment induced significant antitumor activity compared with anti-PD-1 treatment alone. Our findings show that lenvatinib modulates cancer immunity in the tumor microenvironment by reducing TAMs and, when combined with PD-1 blockade, shows enhanced antitumor activity via the IFN signaling pathway. These findings provide a scientific rationale for combination therapy of lenvatinib with PD-1 blockade to improve cancer immunotherapy."

TDP-43 aggregation appears to be largely driven by its low-complexity domain (LCD), which also has a high propensity to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, the mechanism of TDP-43 LCD pathological aggregation and, most importantly, the relationship between the aggregation process and LLPS remains largely unknown. Here, we show that amyloid formation by the LCD is controlled by electrostatic repulsion. We also demonstrate that the liquid droplet environment strongly accelerates LCD fibrillation and that its aggregation under LLPS conditions involves several distinct events, culminating in rapid assembly of fibrillar aggregates that emanate from within mature liquid droplets. These combined results strongly suggest that LLPS may play a major role in pathological TDP-43 aggregation, contributing to pathogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases."

The goal of this study was to modulate chicken intestinal microflora by in ovo stimulation with galactooligosaccharides (GOS) prebiotic and to demonstrate the molecular responses of the host. The animal trial was performed on meat-type chickens (Ross 308). GOS was delivered by in ovo injection performed into the air cell on day 12 of egg incubation. Analysis of microbial communities and mucosal gene expression was performed at slaughter (day 42 post-hatching). Chyme (for DNA isolation) and intestinal mucosa (for RNA isolation) from four distinct intestinal segments (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and caecum) was sampled. The relative abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. in DNA isolated from chyme samples was determined using qPCR. On the host side, the mRNA expression of 13 genes grouped into two panels was analysed with RT-qPCR. Panel (1) included genes related to intestinal innate immune responses (IL-1β, IL-10 and IL-12p40, AvBD1 and CATHL2). Panel (2) contained genes involved in intestinal barrier function (MUC6, CLDN1 and TJAP1) and nutrients sensing (FFAR2 and FFAR4, GLUT1, GLUT2 and GLUT5). GOS increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in caecum (from 1.3% to 3.9%). Distinct effects of GOS on gene expression were manifested in jejunum and caecum. Cytokine genes (IL-1β, IL-10 and IL-12p40) were up-regulated in the jejunum and caecum of the GOS-treated group. Host defence peptides (AvBD1 and CATHL2) were up-regulated in the caecum of the GOS-treated group. Free fatty acid receptors (FFAR2 and FFAR4) were up-regulated in all three compartments of the intestine (except the duodenum). Glucose transporters were down-regulated in duodenum (GLUT2 and GLUT5) but up-regulated in the hindgut (GLUT1 and GLUT2). In conclusion, GOS delivered in ovo had a bifidogenic effect in adult chickens. It also modulated gene expression related to intestinal immune responses, gut barrier function, and nutrient sensing."

Gene mutations are found in some cases, but its immune pathogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we observed that the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio in patients with GPP was higher than that in healthy controls and decreased after effective treatment. Neutrophils isolated from patients with GPP induced higher expressions of inflammatory genes including IL-1β, IL-36G, IL-18, TNF-α, and C-X-C motif chemokine ligands in keratinocytes than normal neutrophils did. Moreover, neutrophils from patients with GPP secreted more exosomes than controls, which were then rapidly internalized by keratinocytes, increasing the expression of these inflammatory molecules via activating NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. The proteomic profiles in neutrophil exosomes further characterized functional proteins and identified olfactomedin 4 as the critical differentially expressed protein that mediates the autoimmune inflammatory responses of GPP. These results demonstrate that neutrophil exosomes have an immune-regulatory effect on keratinocytes, which modulates immune cell migration and autoinflammation in GPP.—Shao, S., Fang, H., Zhang, J., Jiang, M., Xue, K., Ma, J., Zhang, J., Lei, J., Zhang, Y., Li, B., Yuan, X., Dang, E., Wang, G.

https://openalex.org/W2916384455,"Amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the formation of polymorphic deposits comprising diffuse and cored plaques. Because diffuse plaques are predominantly observed in cognitively unaffected, amyloid-positive (CU-AP) individuals, pathogenic conversion into cored plaques appears to be critical to AD pathogenesis. Herein, we identified the distinct Aβ species associated with amyloid polymorphism in brain tissue from individuals with sporadic AD (s-AD) and CU-AP. To this end, we interrogated Aβ polymorphism with amyloid conformation–sensitive dyes and a novel in situ MS paradigm for chemical characterization of hyperspectrally delineated plaque morphotypes. We found that maturation of diffuse into cored plaques correlated with increased Aβ1–40 deposition. Using spatial in situ delineation with imaging MS (IMS), we show that Aβ1–40 aggregates at the core structure of mature plaques, whereas Aβ1–42 localizes to diffuse amyloid aggregates. Moreover, we observed that diffuse plaques have increased pyroglutamated Aβx-42 levels in s-AD but not CU-AP, suggesting an AD pathology–related, hydrophobic functionalization of diffuse plaques facilitating Aβ1–40 deposition. Experiments in tgAPPSwe mice verified that, similar to what has been observed in human brain pathology, diffuse deposits display higher levels of Aβ1–42 and that Aβ plaque maturation over time is associated with increases in Aβ1–40. Finally, we found that Aβ1–40 deposition is characteristic for cerebral amyloid angiopathy deposition and maturation in both humans and mice. These results indicate that N-terminal Aβx-42 pyroglutamation and Aβ1–40 deposition are critical events in priming and maturation of pathogenic Aβ from diffuse into cored plaques, underlying neurotoxic plaque development in AD.

https://openalex.org/W2917898015,"Pannexin 1 (PANX1)-mediated ATP release in vascular smooth muscle coordinates α1-adrenergic receptor (α1-AR) vasoconstriction and blood pressure homeostasis. We recently identified amino acids 198–200 (YLK) on the PANX1 intracellular loop that are critical for α1-AR–mediated vasoconstriction and PANX1 channel function. We report herein that the YLK motif is contained within an SRC homology 2 domain and is directly phosphorylated by SRC proto-oncogene, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (SRC) at Tyr198. We demonstrate that PANX1-mediated ATP release occurs independently of intracellular calcium but is sensitive to SRC family kinase (SFK) inhibition, suggestive of channel regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation. Using a PANX1 Tyr198–specific antibody, SFK inhibitors, SRC knockdown, temperature-dependent SRC cells, and kinase assays, we found that PANX1-mediated ATP release and vasoconstriction involves constitutive phosphorylation of PANX1 Tyr198 by SRC. We specifically detected SRC-mediated Tyr198 phosphorylation at the plasma membrane and observed that it is not enhanced or induced by α1-AR activation. Last, we show that PANX1 immunostaining is enriched in the smooth muscle layer of arteries from hypertensive humans and that Tyr198 phosphorylation is detectable in these samples, indicative of a role for membrane-associated PANX1 in small arteries of hypertensive humans. Our discovery adds insight into the regulation of PANX1 by post-translational modifications and connects a significant purinergic vasoconstriction pathway with a previously identified, yet unexplored, tyrosine kinase–based α1-AR constriction mechanism.

The traditional view of α1-AR activation and subsequent VSMC constriction is that they are thought to mechanistically couple heterotrimeric G-protein activation to increased intracellular calcium via the generation of inositol triphosphate. Alternatively, a number of studies have provided evidence for a secondary and, as of yet, unclear tyrosine kinase–mediated component of adrenergic constriction that might co-regulate vasoconstriction events (13Di Salvo J.

Recent evidence in the pannexin literature also suggests a regulatory role for tyrosine kinases in receptor-stimulated PANX1 activity and downstream function (i.e. channel gating and ATP release) responsible for neuronal excitotoxic cell death (18Weilinger N.L.

Similarly, in endothelial cells of peripheral veins, receptor-mediated activation of PANX1 channels and endothelial ATP release were significantly blocked using SRC family kinase (SFK) inhibitors (19Lohman A.W.

These findings suggest a common tyrosine kinase–based regulatory mechanism for PANX1 channel regulation that, until now, has not been explored in VSMCs of resistance arteries. Here, we show that SRC kinase, the archetypal SFK, is responsible for the direct phosphorylation of Tyr198 on the intracellular loop of PANX1 in VSCMs and that modulation of SRC activity and phospho-Tyr198 status is critical for supporting proper channel function. Notably, we find that Tyr198 phosphorylation is constitutive in nature and is not induced or further enhanced upon α1-AR stimulation. Moreover, inhibition of SFKs, in particular SRC kinase, and the concomitant loss of constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr198 is detrimental to channel opening, ATP release, and adrenergic vasoconstriction. We also find that increased detection of PANX1 Tyr198 phosphorylation in hypertensive human vessel biopsies correlates with PANX1 protein expression in hypertensive but not normotensive arteries. Together, our results suggest that the increased PANX1 at the plasma membrane may contribute to pathological hypertensive responses that occur in resistant hypertension. We have previously shown that α1-AR–stimulated vasoconstriction uniquely couples with PANX1-mediated ATP release from VSMCs of resistance arteries and requires the PANX1 intracellular motif (YLK) (5Billaud M.

To examine whether PANX1-mediated ATP release requires cytosolic calcium (Ca2+), we first sought to determine whether adrenergic stimulated ATP release depended on intracellular Ca2+. Isolated resistance arteries were incubated with BAPTA-AM to chelate intracellular Ca2+. Application of the α1-AR selective agonist phenylephrine (PE; 20 μm) caused a significant increase in extracellular ATP both in the presence and the absence of BAPTA-AM (Fig. 1A). These observations suggest a Ca2+-independent mechanism for α1-AR–mediated ATP release, at least after adrenergic stimulation, and agree with previous observations suggesting that Ca2+ is not always involved in PANX1-mediated ATP release (20Thompson R.J.

Next, we scanned short eukaryotic linear motif databases to analyze regions of PANX1 that might confer modifications to the channel independently of Ca2+, specifically near the intracellular loop motif (YLK). We identified a putative SRC homology 2 recognition site in both mouse and human amino acid sequences, which was contained within the YLK sequence. In the mouse sequence, this site localized near an SRC homology 3 (proline-rich) SRC-binding region, indicative of regulation by SFKs (Fig. 1B). To confirm a possible role for SFK activity in adrenergic mediated ATP release, we measured ATP release from human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells co-expressing PANX1 and the α1-AR in the presence of the SFK inhibitor PP2 and the inactive analog PP3 (Fig. S1). PE-stimulated ATP release was significantly blunted by PP2 (10 μm) treatment, but not with PP3 (10 μm). We performed similar experiments using isolated murine resistance arteries in the presence of PP2, PP3, and the more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib (Fig. 1C). Application of PP2 (10 μm) significantly blunted PE- and NE-induced ATP release as compared with control arteries or arteries treated with the inactive analog PP3 (10 μm). The same inhibitory effect was observed using dasatinib (10 nm). No increase in ATP release was observed when vessels were stimulated with nonadrenergic vasoconstrictors endothelin-1 (ET-1; 10 nm) or serotonin (5-HT; 100 nm), thus confirming the specificity of adrenergic stimuli for PANX1-mediated ATP release, as described previously (5Billaud M.

In addition to ATP release, we assessed vasoconstriction responses to cumulative doses of adrenergic and nonadrenergic agonists using pressure myography in isolated resistance arteries (Fig. 1, D–G). Pretreatment (15 min) of arteries with PP2 (10 μm) significantly blunted α1-AR constriction as compared with control arteries or arteries treated with the inactive analog PP3 (10 μm) (Fig. 1D). Application of ET-1 or 5-HT produced strong vasoconstriction responses in the presence and absence of the PP2, highlighting again a key pathway between SFK activity and adrenergic mediated vasoconstriction, but not ET-1 or 5-HT (Fig. 1, E and F). Similar inhibitory effects on α1-AR vasoconstriction were observed when vessels were pretreated (15 min) with dasatinib (10 nm) (Fig. 1G). Our previously published mutagenesis experiments (5Billaud M. Chiu Y.-H. Lohman A.W. Parpaite T. Butcher J.T. Mutchler S.M. DeLalio L.J. Artamonov M.V. Sandilos J.K. Best A.K. Somlyo A.V.

To analyze the phosphorylation status of PANX1 Tyr198 in VSMCs after adrenergic stimulation, human coronary smooth muscle cells (hCoSMCs) were differentiated to a contractile phenotype and assessed by Western blotting for PANX1 expression (Fig. 2A). Typical 48-h serum starvation up-regulated smooth muscle contractile proteins, including α-smooth muscle actin and PANX1 (Fig. 2A). We next immunoprecipitated PANX1 from differentiated hCoSMCs following PE (20 μm) stimulation using a total PANX1 antibody and magnetic bead separation. The status of PANX1 Tyr198 phosphorylation was assessed by Western blotting using a phospho-PANX1 (Tyr198) antibody (pPANX1Y198) (Fig. 2B). Our data revealed that PANX1 phosphorylation at Tyr198 was unchanged by PE stimulation. Mutagenesis of tyrosine 198 to phenylalanine abolished detectable phosphorylation, confirming PANX1 Tyr198 antibody specificity in VSMCs (Fig. S2A). We next showed that the PxIL2 peptide (composed of the PANX1 Tyr198–containing SA2 region and a TAT peptide tag (5Billaud M. Chiu Y.-H. Lohman A.W. Parpaite T. Butcher J.T. Mutchler S.M. DeLalio L.J.

Again, following adrenergic stimulation, we observed similar levels of PANX1 Tyr198 phosphorylation both in vehicle-treated and PE-stimulated samples, indicative of constitutive phosphorylation at Tyr198. We confirmed observations from immunoprecipitation experiments by probing for constitutive Tyr198 phosphorylation in differentiated hCoSMCs and tested Tyr198 phospho-status after treatment of cells with pharmacological SFK inhibitors (or vehicle control). As with our other assay, PE did not enhance PANX1 Tyr198 phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). However, treatment with PP2 (10 μm) and dasatinib (10 nm) significantly reduced PANX1 Tyr198 levels. No reduction in phosphorylation was observed with the inactive control PP3 (10 μm). These results were recapitulated in HEK293 cells expressing PANX1 (Fig. S2B). As an additional control to confirm the detection of Tyr198 as a phosphorylation residue, cell lysates were treated with λ-phosphatase, which completely removes phosphate groups (Fig. 2D). As expected, λ-phosphatase completely reduced pPANX1Y198 levels. These data suggest that SFK activity constitutively phosphorylates Tyr198 to support PANX1 channel function. Due to the significant inhibitory effects of SFK-modulating agents on adrenergic mediated vasoconstriction, ATP release, and PANX1 Tyr198 phosphorylation in VSMCs, we set out to specifically address whether SRC kinase modulates PANX1 Tyr198 phosphorylation, as was observed in other cell types (18Weilinger N.L. Lohman A.W. Rakai B.D. Ma E.M.M. Bialecki J. Maslieieva V. Rilea T. Bandet M.V. Ikuta N.T. Scott L. Colicos M.A. Teskey G.C. Winship I.R. Thompson R.J.

Commun. 2015; 6 (26242575)796510.1038/ncomms8965Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We performed knockdown of SRC kinase using SRC-specific siRNA in hCoSMCs. Similar to the effects observed using SFK inhibitors, PANX1 Tyr198 phosphorylation was equally abundant in control and PE-stimulated conditions yet significantly reduced after SRC knockdown. No reduction in PANX1 Tyr198 was observed using negative control siRNA (scramble siRNA) (Fig. 3A). To further validate the specificity of SRC kinase to phosphorylate PANX1 Tyr198, HEK cells were transfected with expression vectors for the α1-AR, PANX1, and mutant isoforms of SRC kinase that were constitutively active (cSRC) or harbored a kinase-inactivating mutation (SRC-KD) (Fig. 3B). Western blotting detection for SRC and the pSFK(Y416) autophosphorylation activation loop residue revealed an increase in total expression of SRC kinase following transfection. pSFK(Y416) was moderately increased in SRC-KD, possibly due to overexpression in a cell type containing native SRC kinase. In the presence of constitutively active cSRC, an additional increase in pSFK(Y416) was observed. Under basal transfection conditions (only empty vector, α1-AR, and PANX1), PANX1 Tyr198 phosphorylation was not different between cells treated with PE or vehicle control. However, co-transfection with the cSRC isoform, but not the SRC-KD isoform, generated intense hyperphosphorylation of PANX1 Tyr198. Thus, PANX1 Tyr198 phosphorylation is regulated by SRC kinase activity. Next, we performed a temperature-dependent SRC kinase assay using LA-25 cells transfected with α1-AR and PANX1 (Fig. 3C). LA-25 cells harbor a temperature-sensitive SRC mutation (24Solan J.L. Lampe P.D. Connexin 43 in LA-25 cells with active v-src is phosphorylated on Y247, Y265, S262, S279/282, and S368 via multiple signaling pathways.Cell Commun. Adhes. 2008; 15 (18649180): 75-8410.1080/15419060802014016Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which at the permissive temperature (35 °C) constitutively activates SRC kinase but at the nonpermissive temperature (40 °C) inactivates kinase activity (25Atkinson M.M. Menko A.S. Johnson R.G. Sheppard J.R. Sheridan J.D. Rapid and reversible reduction of junctional permeability in cells infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of avian sarcoma virus.J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91 (6273447): 573-57810.1083/jcb.91.2.573Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). After a 30-min incubation of LA-25 cells at 35 °C, SRC kinase was activated as indicated by enhanced pSFK(Y416) autophosphorylation, as well as the phosphorylation of the SRC substrate paxillin (Tyr118). pSFK(Y416) or paxillin (Tyr118) phosphorylation was not observed after 30 min at 40 °C. Analysis of PANX1 in vehicle and PE-stimulated conditions revealed constitutive phosphorylation of PANX1 (Tyr198) at 35 °C and reduced signal at 40 °C. Incubating cells with PP2 (10 μm) at the permissive temperature was also sufficient to obstruct constitutive SRC kinase activity and reduce detection of PANX1 Tyr198. Importantly, PANX1 Tyr198 signal could be rescued at the nonpermissive temperature when LA-25 cells were supplemented with the constitutive cSRC isoform. These data support the notion that SRC kinase activity modulates constitutive PANX1 Tyr198 phosphorylation. To determine whether phosphorylation of PANX1 Tyr198 is directly mediated by SRC kinase, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant PANX1 protein isolated from Sf9 cells (26Chiu Y.-H. Jin X. Medina C.B. Leonhardt S.A. Kiessling V. Bennett B.C. Shu S. Tamm L.K. Yeager M. Ravichandran K.S. Bayliss D.A. A quantized mechanism for activation of pannexin channels.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 (28134257)1432410.1038/ncomms14324Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and recombinant/active SRC kinase (Fig. 4, A and B). It was first necessary to dephosphorylate purified recombinant PANX1 protein using λ-phosphatase. Immunoblotting with antibodies for pan-phosphotyrosine or pPANX1Y198 antibodies revealed basally phosphorylated substrates that could be completely dephosphorylated using λ-phosphatase (Fig. 4A). Following dephosphorylation, PANX1 protein (lane 4) was subsequently incubated with constitutively active SRC-kinase (Fig. 4B). The addition of SRC restored detection of PANX1 Tyr198 phosphorylation (lane 5). As a confirmation of SRC activity, the SRC-dependent PANX1 Tyr308 phosphosite was also detectable, as described previously (18Weilinger N.L. Lohman A.W. Rakai B.D. Ma E.M.M. Bialecki J. Maslieieva V.

Neurosci. 2016; 19 (26854804): 432-44210.1038/nn.4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The presence of doublet patterns in our kinase assay was attributed to a glycosylation modification made in Sf9 cells during recombinant protein production. To ensure that doublets were due to glycosylation, PANX1 was treated with N-glycosidase, which resulted in a single PANX1 band (Fig. S3), as reported previously (27Bargiotas P. Krenz A. Hormuzdi S.G.

SOCS1 and SOCS3 have been associated with tumour progression and response to treatments in different kinds of cancers, including GBM. In this study, cell lines of IDH-wildtype GBM from primary cultures were obtained, and the role of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in the radiotherapy response was analysed. Fifty-two brain aspirates from GBM patients were processed, and six new cell lines of IDH-wildtype GBM were established. These new cell lines were characterized according to the WHO classification of CNS tumours. SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression levels were determined, at mRNA level by Q-PCR, at protein level by immunocytochemistry, and Western blot analysis. The results showed that SOCS1 and SOCS3 are overexpressed in GBM, as compared to a non-tumoral brain RNA pool. SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression were reduced by siRNA, and it was found that SOCS3 inhibition increases radioresistance in GBM cell lines, suggesting a key role of SOCS3 in radioresistant acquisition. In addition, radioresistant clonal populations obtained by selective pressure on these cell cultures also showed a significant decrease in SOCS3 expression, while SOCS1 remained unchanged. Furthermore, the induction of SOCS3 expression, under a heterologous promoter, in a radiotherapy resistant GBM cell line increased its radiosensitivity, supporting an important implication of SOCS3 in radiotherapy resistance acquisition. Finally, the treatment with TSA in the most radioresistant established cell line produced an increase in the effect of radiotherapy, that correlated with an increase in the expression of SOCS3. These effects of TSA disappeared if the increase in the expression of SOCS3 prevented with an siRNA against SOCS3. Thus, SOCS3 signal transduction pathway (JAK/STAT) could be useful to unmask new putative targets to improve radiotherapy response in GBM."

We compared the accuracy of the neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR) to conventional inflammatory markers in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study consisting of 276 ICU patients with sepsis and 388 ICU patients without sepsis. We compared the NLCR as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) level, procalcitonin (PCT) level, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count and lymphocyte count on ICU admission between sepsis and non-sepsis ICU patients. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity, we constructed receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Results Significant differences in NLCR values were observed between sepsis and non-sepsis patients (15.3 [10.8–38.2] (median [interquartile range] vs. 9.3 [6.2–14.5]; P<0.001), as well as for CRP level, PCT level and lymphocyte count. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of the NLCR was 0.66 (95%CI = 0.62–0.71). AUROC was significantly higher for CRP and PCT level with AUROC’s of 0.89 (95%CI 0.87–0.92) and 0.88 (95%CI 0.86–0.91) respectively. Conclusions The NLCR is less suitable than conventional inflammatory markers CRP and PCT to detect the presence of sepsis in ICU patients. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01274819."

One of the most fascinating mutualisms is the interaction between hummingbirds and the plants they visit. We conducted an exhaustive search for articles, theses, reports, and personal communications with researchers (unpublished data) documenting hummingbird visits to flowers of nectar-rewarding plants. Based on information gathered from 4532 interactions between 292 hummingbird species and 1287 plant species, we built an interaction network between nine hummingbird clades and 100 plant families used by hummingbirds as nectar resources at a continental scale. We explored the network architecture, including phylogenetic, morphological, biogeographical, and distributional information. As expected, the network between hummingbirds and their nectar plants was heterogeneous and nested, but not modular. When we incorporated ecological and historical information in the network nodes, we found a generalization gradient in hummingbird morphology and interaction patterns. The hummingbird clades that most recently diversified in North America acted as generalist nodes and visited flowers with ornithophilous, intermediate and non-ornithophilous morphologies, connecting a high diversity of plant families. This pattern was favored by intermediate morphologies (bill, wing, and body size) and by the low niche conservatism in these clades compared to the oldest clades that diversified in South America. Our work is the first effort exploring the hummingbird-plant mutualistic network at a continental scale using hummingbird clades and plant families as nodes, offering an alternative approach to exploring the ecological and evolutionary factors that explain plant-animal interactions at a large scale."

We examined the relationship between perceived ease of flavored e-cigarette use and e-cigarette use susceptibility and progression among a nationally representative sample of U.S. youth never tobacco users. Methods The wave 1 (2013–2014) and wave 2 (2014–2015) surveys of PATH Study were used. Youth never tobacco users (ages 12–17) who reported whether flavored e-cigarettes were easier to use than unflavored e-cigarettes at wave 1 (n = 6,983) were included in the study. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to examine the associations between perceived ease of using flavored e-cigarettes (wave 1) and e-cigarette use outcomes including e-cigarette use susceptibility (wave 1) and e-cigarette initiation and past-30-day use (wave 2). Results Overall, 21.2% of the sample perceived flavored e-cigarettes easier to use than unflavored e-cigarettes; and 28.9% of the sample were susceptible to using e-cigarettes at wave 1, and 7.5% and 2.0% initiated e-cigarettes and used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days at wave 2, respectively. Among those who perceived flavored e-cigarettes easier to use, 41.0% were susceptible to using e-cigarettes at wave 1, and 10.6% and 3.4% initiated and used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days at wave 2, respectively. Perceiving flavored e-cigarettes as easier to use than unflavored e-cigarettes at wave 1 was positively associated with e-cigarette use susceptibility at wave 1 (AOR = 1.43, CI = 1.21, 1.69), and e-cigarette initiation (AOR = 1.32, CI = 1.12, 1.67) and past-30-day use (AOR = 1.25, CI = 1.10, 2.47) at wave 2. Conclusions Perceiving flavored e-cigarettes as easier to use than unflavored e-cigarettes may lead to e-cigarette use progression among youth never tobacco users. Determining the factors (including e-cigarette marketing and specific e-cigarette flavors) that lead to perceived ease of using flavored e-cigarettes would inform efforts to prevent and curb youth e-cigarette use."

Here, we compare spatial and temporal patterns of colonization and succession of the benthic assemblage on settlement collectors (ceramic tiles) in a 13-mo mensurative experiment on a suspended artificial reef, a seafloor artificial reef, and two nearby natural reefs at Eilat, Gulf of Aqaba. We also conducted a concurrent 7-mo manipulative experiment on the suspended reef and one of the natural reefs, and monitored fish feeding behaviour on experimental collectors, to examine effects of large mobile consumers on these patterns. In both experiments, taxonomic composition as percent planar cover for the whole community or biomass for the invertebrate component differed between collector topsides, dominated by a filamentous algal matrix, and shaded undersides with a profuse assemblage of suspension- or filter-feeding invertebrates. In the mensurative experiment, we found differences in final community and invertebrate composition between sites, which clustered according to reef type (artificial vs. natural) for collector undersides. Invertebrate biomass was greater at both artificial reefs than at one (undersides) or both (topsides) natural reefs. In the manipulative experiment, we found similar differences in composition between sites/reef types as well as between treatments (exclusion vs. control), and the invertebrate biomass was greater on the artificial reef. Invertebrate biomass was greater in the exclusion treatment than the control on collector undersides, suggesting mobile consumers can affect community composition and abundance. Predominant fish species observed interacting with collectors differed between artificial and natural reefs, likely contributing to differences in patterns of colonization and succession between sites and reef types. Our findings suggest artificial reefs have the potential to enhance cover and biomass of certain reef-associated assemblages, particularly those occupying sheltered microhabitats."

However, the impacts of microgravity on blood lineage cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vivo are largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed peripheral blood samples from 6 astronauts who had participated in spaceflight missions and found significant changes in several cell populations at different time points. These dynamic alterations of lineage cells and the role of HSCs were further studied in a mouse model, using hindlimb unloading (HU) to simulate microgravity. Large reductions in the frequency of NK cells, B cells, and erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow of the HU mice were observed, together with an increased frequency of T cells, neutrophils, and HSCs. T cell levels recovered faster than those of B cells and erythrocyte precursors, whereas the recovery rates of NK cells and granulocytes were slow. In addition, competitive reconstitution experiments demonstrated the impaired function of HSCs, although these changes were reversible. Deep sequencing showed changes in the expression of regulatory molecules important for the differentiation of HSCs. This study provides the first determination of altered HSC function under simulated microgravity in vivo. The impairment of HSC function and differentiation provides an explanation for the immune disorders that occur under simulated microgravity. Thus, our findings demonstrated that spaceflight and simulated microgravity disrupt the homeostasis of immune system and cause dynamic alterations on both HSCs and lineage cells.—Cao, D., Song, J., Ling, S., Niu, S., Lu, L., Cui, Z., Li, Y., Hao, S., Zhong, G., Qi, Z., Sun, W., Yuan, X., Li, H., Zhao, D., Jin, X., Liu, C., Wu, X., Kan, G., Cao, H., Kang, Y., Yu, S., Li, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2916017052,"A majority of thousands of intracellular mammalian proteins are recognized by proteasome only being conjugated with ubiquitin (Ub), representing a universal degradation signal operated by the ubiquitination system. Ub-independent proteasome targeting is rationalized by the existence of 2 types of direct proteasome signals (DPSs), specific amino acid sequences or post-translational modifications, which are recognized by proteasome regulatory subunits. Historically, the first type was shown to exist in ornithine decarboxylase, whereas acetylation of core histones recently was reported as a second type of DPS. Here we declare a third type, representing charge-mediated DPS. This discovered DPS may be classified as a monopartite composition- but not sequence-dependent element of ∼70 Å in length enriched in basic and flexible amino acids. This type of degradation signal, which may be provided by cationic chemicals, is most efficiently engaged by proteasomes capped with regulator (REG)α or REGγ in an ATP-independent manner.

This was the first time that an adenovirus had been identified in orange-bellied parrots and is the first report of PsAdv-2 in Australia. To investigate the status of PsAdv-2 in the captive population of orange-bellied parrots, 102 healthy birds from five breeding facilities were examined for the presence of PsAdv-2 DNA in droppings and/or cloacal swabs using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. Additionally, eight birds released to the wild for the 2016 breeding season were similarly tested when they were recaptured prior to migration to be held in captivity for the winter. PsAdv-2 was identified in all breeding facilities as well as the birds recaptured from the wild. Prevalence of shedding ranged from 29.7 to 76.5%, demonstrating that PsAdv-2 is endemic in the captive population of orange-bellied parrots and that wild parrots may have been exposed to the virus. PsAdv-2 DNA was detected in both cloacal swabs and faeces of the orange-bellied parrots, but testing both samples from the same birds suggested that testing faeces would be more sensitive than cloacal swabs. PsAdv-2 was not found in other psittacine species housed in nearby aviaries at the Adelaide Zoo. The source of the infection in the orange-bellied parrots remains undetermined. In this study, PsAdv-2 prevalence of shedding was higher in adult birds as compared to birds less than one year old. Preliminary data also suggested a correlation between adenovirus shedding prevalence within the breeding collection and chick survival."
https://openalex.org/W2916914339,"The fetus is dependent on delivery of fatty acids (FAs) by the syncytiotrophoblast, the transporting epithelium of the human placenta. Obese pregnant women have dyslipidemia; however, whether obesity impacts placental lipid transport and metabolism remains to be fully established. Palmitoleic acid (POA), an FA with anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties, is synthesized from palmitic acid (PA) catalyzed by stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity. We hypothesized that the uptake and incorporation of FAs and POA synthesis are reduced in primary human trophoblasts (PHTs) isolated from pregnancies complicated by maternal obesity. Villous cytotrophoblasts were isolated from 7 placentas of obese [body mass index (BMI) = 37.5 ± 1.9] and 12 normal (BMI = 23.6 ± 0.6) mothers. FA uptake and incorporation were assessed using uniformly labeled (U[13C])-FA mixtures of PA, oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. Cellular [13C] FAs were quantified both in total cellular lipids and in lipid classes by GC-MS. Uptake and incorporation of [13C] FAs in total cellular lipids were not different in PHTs isolated from obese mothers compared with normal mothers. Only the concentration of OA was increased in the triglyceride fraction (P < 0.05) if the mother was obese. We found an isotopic enrichment of POA after U[13C]-PA treatment, demonstrating SCD activity in PHT cells. Labeled POA content and the POA:PA ratio were significantly lower in PHTs isolated from placentas of obese mothers compared with normal, healthy controls. Decreased syncytiotrophoblast POA synthesis may contribute to insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation in the mother, placenta, or fetus (or a combination of the 3) in pregnancies complicated by obesity.-Ferchaud-Roucher, V., Barner, K., Jansson, T., Powell, T. L. Maternal obesity results in decreased syncytiotrophoblast synthesis of palmitoleic acid, a fatty acid with anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties."
https://openalex.org/W2917529428,"Background Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation is an established treatment option to management the complications of portal hypertension. Recent data on the long-term outcomes of TIPS are scarce. Materials and methods In this single-institution retrospective study, 495 patients underwent TIPS with the Fluency stent-grafts between December 2011 and June 2015 were evaluated. The cumulative rates of TIPS dysfunction, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), survival, and variceal rebleeding were determined using the Kaplan–Meier method. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the parameters on TIPS patency, occurrence of HE and all-cause mortality. Results Technical success was 98.2%. TIPS-related complications occurred in 67 patients (13.5%) during the index hospital stay. TIPS creation resulted in an immediate decrease in mean portosystemic pressure gradient from 23.4 ± 7.1 mmHg to 7.6 ± 3.5 mmHg. The median follow-up period was 649 days. Primary TIPS patency rates were 93%, and 75.9% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Previous splenectomy was associated with a higher risk of TPS dysfunction. The cumulative survival rates were 93.4% and 77.2% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. The 1- and 3-year probability of remaining free of variceal bleeding rates were 94.2% and 71.4%, respectively. Conclusions This retrospective single-center experience with TIPS using the Fluency stent-grafts demonstrates good long-term patency and favorable good clinical results. Previous splenectomy strongly predicts shunt dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2917960742,"Background KRAS and NRAS mutations are identified resistance mutations to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. BRAF status is also routinely assessed for its poor prognosis value. In our institute, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is routinely used for gene-panel mutations detection including KRAS, NRAS and BRAF, but DNA quality is sometimes not sufficient for sequencing. In our routine practice, Idylla platform is used for the analysis of samples that don’t reach sufficient quality criteria for NGS assay. Methods In this study, data from mCRC samples analyzed from May 2017 to 2018 were retrospectively collected. All samples with a poor DNA quality for sequencing have been assessed using Idylla platform. First, KRAS Idylla assay cartridge has been used for the determination of KRAS mutational status. All KRAS wild-type samples have then been analyzed using NRAS-BRAF assay. Among 669 samples, 67 samples failed the DNA quality control and have been assessed on Idylla KRAS mutation test. Results Among 67 samples, 50 (75%) samples had a valid result with Idylla KRAS mutation test including 22 carrying a KRAS mutation. For 28 samples, NRAS and BRAF mutational statuses have been assessed using Idylla NRAS-BRAF mutation test. Among 28 samples, 27 (96%) had a valid result including 2 samples bearing a NRAS mutation and 3 samples bearing a BRAF mutation. Conclusions Our study shows that an integrated workflow using NGS and Idylla platform allows the determination of KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutational statuses of 651/669 (97.3%) samples and retrieve 49/67 (73.1%)samples that don’t reach DNA quality requirements for NGS."
https://openalex.org/W2917288245,"Background Arterial stiffness independently predicts cardiovascular disease. However, few studies have evaluated the associations of central and peripheral pulse wave velocity (PWV) with biomarkers of both myocardial stress (natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]) and damage (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-T [hs-cTnT]) among persons without cardiac disease. Methods We examined 3,348 participants (67–90 years) without prevalent cardiac disease in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (2011–13). The cross-sectional associations of PWV quartiles for central arterial segments (carotid-femoral, heart-carotid, heart-femoral) and peripheral artery (femoral-ankle) with NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT were evaluated accounting for potential confounders. Results Most PWV measures demonstrated J- or U-shaped associations with the two cardiac biomarkers. The highest (Q4) vs. second lowest (Q2) quartile of central PWV measures (carotid-femoral, heart-carotid, heart-femoral PWV) were associated with higher levels of NT-proBNP independently of demographic characteristics. The associations were less evident for hs-cTnT. These associations were attenuated after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, but the heart-carotid PWV-NT-proBNP relationship remained borderline significant (difference in log-NT-proBNP = 0.08 [-0.01, 0.17] in Q4 vs. Q2, p = 0.07). Peripheral PWV demonstrated inverse associations. Higher values of NT-proBNP were seen in the lowest vs. second lowest quartile of all PWV measures. Conclusions Central stiffness measures showed stronger associations with cardiac biomarkers (particularly NT-proBNP) than peripheral measures among older adults without cardiac disease. Our findings are consistent with the concept of ventricular-vascular coupling and suggest that central rather than peripheral arterial hemodynamics are more closely related to myocardial stress rather than damage."
https://openalex.org/W2915267792,"Overexpression of several members of the kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK) family, including KLK4, has been reported in ovarian cancer tissue, consistent with the fact that elevated levels of KLK protein are often also found in serum and in effusion fluids of ovarian cancer patients. In the present study, we quantitatively analyzed KLK4 tumor tissue mRNA expression levels in a homogeneous cohort including 138 patients of advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (FIGO stage III/IV). Age as well as ascites fluid volume were found to be significantly associated with KLK4 mRNA expression levels. In univariate Cox regression analysis, the clinical factors residual tumor mass and ascites fluid volume represented univariate predictors for both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Furthermore, elevated KLK4 mRNA expression levels were significantly linked with reduced OS (p = 0.001), but not with PFS. The results concerning the association of KLK4 mRNA expression with OS were validated in a publicly available Affymetrix-based mRNA data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 252) applying the Kaplan-Meier Plotter tool (p = 0.047). In multivariable analyses, elevated KLK4 mRNA values turned out as an additional, independent predictive marker for shortened OS (p = 0.006), whereas residual tumor mass, but not ascites fluid volume, remained an independent indicator for both OS and PFS (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). The results of the present study, obtained in a well-defined, homogenous cohort of patients afflicted with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer, are in line with previous reports describing high KLK4 levels as an unfavorable marker in ovarian cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2916248432,"The increased mortality rate among the Acoli people of northern Uganda is anecdotally blamed on excessive consumption of cheap and widely available sachet-packaged alcohol in the region. In this paper, we quantify this perceived association by determining statistically the health risks associated with ingesting 20 heavy metals in 17 popular spirits products consumed in Acoli. Thirteen of these products were industrially packaged in sachets (locally known as 'sachet,' waragi, arege or moo lyec) and four were locally produced Lira-Lira spirits from Bolo, Awere and Teso Bar in the region and Nsambya in southern Uganda. A Scottish whisky purchased in San Diego (USA) was our reference. Risk assessment was performed according to standardized protocols developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). Our results show that a strong correlation indeed exists between health risks and ingestion of spirits in Acoli. At >2.5 sachets/day for 240 day/year over a lifetime for example, the risk of developing cancer due to exposure to As, Pb and Cr alone is 1 in 102,041. This estimate excludes ethanol, a known carcinogen, and 17 heavy metals also studied due to lack of their cancer slope factors. The primary non-cancer related health risk factor in all samples tested is ethanol with unacceptably high health index of four. The Lira-Lira spirits, with 100-6000% copper above the US EPA limit for intake by oral ingestion in water, would be the 'cleanest' without copper and at par with the Scottish whisky. Collectively, we find that no amount of alcohol consumed in Acoli is safe. Preventive measures are therefore recommended to reduce mortality in Acoli in particular, and in Uganda in general. These measures should include public education, better public policies, creating productive economic activities other than brewing alcohol, and social activities that engage people away from drinking."

GDF8 strongly and negatively regulates skeletal muscle growth, and GDF11 has been implicated in various age-related pathologies such as cardiac hypertrophy. GDF8 and GDF11 signaling activities are controlled by the extracellular protein antagonists follistatin; follistatin-like 3 (FSTL3); and WAP, follistatin/kazal, immunoglobulin, Kunitz, and netrin domain–containing (WFIKKN). All of these proteins contain a follistatin domain (FSD) important for ligand binding and antagonism. Here, we investigated the structure and function of the FSD from murine WFIKKN2 and compared it with the FSDs of follistatin and FSTL3. Using native gel shift and surface plasmon resonance analyses, we determined that the WFIKKN2 FSD can interact with both GDF8 and GDF11 and block their interactions with the type II receptor activin A receptor type 2B (ActRIIB). Further, we solved the crystal structure of the WFIKKN2 FSD to 1.39 Å resolution and identified surface-exposed residues that, when substituted with alanine, reduce antagonism of GDF8 in full-length WFIKKN2. Comparison of the WFIKKN2 FSD with those of follistatin and FSTL3 revealed differences in both the FSD structure and position of residues within the domain that are important for ligand antagonism.

Over the years, structural studies have provided insight into how different antagonists can adopt different mechanisms to bind and neutralize ligands.

WFIKKN is named from the conserved multidomain architecture: whey acidic protein (WAP), follistatin domain (FSD), Immunoglobulin domain (Ig), two tandem Kunitz (K1, K2) domains, and a netrin (N) domain (Fig. 1a). Most animals have two related versions of WFIKKN, WFIKKN1 and WFIKKN2, which share 56% identity (37Monestier O. Brun C. Cocquempot O. Petit D. Blanquet V.

Differences in potency and binding stoichiometry have previously been reported, where WFIKKN2 has an IC50 of 0.26 nm for GDF8 antagonism and is nearly 100-fold more potent than WFIKKN1 (38Walker R.G.

In addition, WFIKKN2 forms a 1:1 complex with GDF8/11 (1 WFIKKN2 and 1 ligand dimer), whereas WFIKKN1 forms a 2:1 complex. Interestingly, removing the Kunitz 2 and netrin domains both reduces the potency of WFIKKN2 (IC50 = 7.2 nm) and shifts the binding stoichiometry to that of full-length WFIKKN1 (38Walker R.G.

Whereas multiple domains are thought to interact with GDF8 and GDF11, previous studies have determined that the FSD plays a significant role in antagonism (34Kondás K. Szláma G. Trexler M. Patthy L.

Follistatin domains are also functionally important for the antagonists follistatin and FSTL3. FSTL3 and follistatin contain two and three FSDs, respectively, which have been shown through multiple X-ray crystal structures to directly contact the ligand (23Cash J.N. Rejon C.A. McPherron A.C.

Interestingly, each of the FSDs (FSD1–3) within follistatin/FSTL3 adopt different molecular conformations and functions differently at the ligand interface, indicating that the FSDs are not functionally redundant. In fact, biochemical experiments showed that changing the order of the FSDs can severely alter ligand binding and specificity (27Sidis Y. Mukherjee A. Keutmann H. Delbaere A. Sadatsuki M. Schneyer A.

Whereas WFIKKN selectively inhibits GDF8 and GDF11, the molecular basis for ligand selectivity has not been established. Given that WFIKKN and follistatin/FSTL3 each have FSDs important for binding, whether they exhibit unique or common ligand mechanisms has not been determined. To investigate this, we characterized the WFIKKN FSD and contrasted the binding features of the follistatin FSDs with the WFIKKN FSD. We found that the FSD of WFIKKN blocks the type II receptor-binding interface similar to the FSD2 of follistatin and FSTL3. However, WFIKKN2 FSD displays different structural features and residues that interact with the ligand that map to a different location of the FSD, indicating a different binding mode when compared with the FSDs of follistatin and FSTL3. Recombinant murine WFIKKN2 FSD, containing residues 104–172, was produced in bacteria. WFIKKN2 FSD protein formed inclusion bodies, which were solubilized and subjected to oxidative refolding to induce disulfide bond formation. Properly folded material was purified using reverse-phase chromatography, as depicted in Fig. 1b. First, native PAGE was used to analyze the refolded WFIKKN2 FSD and to evaluate binding interactions with GDF8. FSD alone migrated as a single band, indicating the isolation of a single refolded species. Similar to previously published results, GDF8 alone does not enter the native PAGE and is not visible (25Walker R.G. Czepnik M. Goebel E.J. McCoy J.C. Vujic A. Cho M. Oh J. Aykul S. Walton K.L. Schang G. Bernard D.J. Hinck A.P. Harrison C.A. Martinez-Hackert E. Wagers A.J. et al.Structural basis for potency differences between GDF8 and GDF11.BMC Biol. 2017; 15 (28257634): 1910.1186/s12915-017-0350-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Upon mixing WFIKKN2 FSD with GDF8, an additional band appeared, indicating complex formation (Fig. 1c). Titration of GDF8 with increasing concentrations of WFIKKN2 FSD showed an increase in the complex band intensity. Analysis of the newly formed band by SDS-PAGE shows that both WFIKKN2 FSD and GDF8 are present, supporting complex formation (Fig. 1c). Similar results were observed with GDF11 where the complex band was significantly sharper (Fig. 1d). These results indicate that WFIKKN2 FSD is properly folded and can bind both GDF8 and GDF11, as previously implicated (34Kondás K. Szláma G. Trexler M. Patthy L. Both WFIKKN1 and WFIKKN2 have high affinity for growth and differentiation factors 8 and 11.J. Biol.

We next wanted to compare the WFIKKN2 FSD with full-length (FL) WFIKKN2 for their ability to bind and antagonize GDF8 and GDF11. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to measure binding affinity, where GDF8 and GDF11 were coupled to a CM5 SPR chip. Binding analysis was performed by injecting increasing concentrations of WFIKKN2 FL or WFIKKN2 FSD (Fig. 2, a–d). Similar to previous reports, WFIKKN2 FL bound GDF8 and GDF11 with a high affinity, as demonstrated by the slow dissociation rate (34Kondás K. Szláma G. Trexler M. Patthy L. Both WFIKKN1 and WFIKKN2 have high affinity for growth and differentiation factors 8 and 11.J. Biol.

Consistent with the native PAGE analysis, WFIKKN2 FSD exhibited a significant interaction with GDF8 and GDF11, albeit with a much faster dissociation rate as compared with WFIKKN2 FL. The association and dissociation rate constants and equilibrium constant, KD, are reported in Table 1. Overall, WFIKKN2 FL exhibited a high-affinity interaction with GDF8 (KD = 0.74 nm) and GDF11 (0.24 nm), whereas the WFIKKN2 FSD was ∼1000-fold weaker (KD = 0.66 μm for GDF8 and 0.12 μm for GDF11). WFIKKN2 FL and WFIKKN2 FSD were able to bind TGFβ1, albeit weakly, but have no affinity for activin A, consistent with previous studies (35Szláma G. Kondás K. Trexler M. Patthy L. WFIKKN1 and WFIKKN2 bind growth factors TGFβ1, BMP2 and BMP4 but do not inhibit their signalling activity.FEBS J. 2010; 277 (21054789): 5040-505010.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07909.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine whether the affinity of WFIKKN2 FSD for GDF8 and GDF11 was sufficient to inhibit signaling. Using a luciferase reporter assay responsive to GDF8 and GDF11, we titrated increasing concentrations of WFIKKN2 FL and WFIKKN2 FSD. Whereas WFIKKN2 FL inhibited GDF8 and GDF11 signaling with an IC50 value of 0.34 and 0.13 nm, respectively, WFIKKN2 FSD exhibited a significantly reduced inhibition of GDF8 and GDF11 with an IC50 value of 0.85 and 0.28 μm, respectively (Fig. 2d), similar to the 1000-fold difference in binding affinity determined by SPR. This demonstrates that whereas the WFIKKN2 FSD binding affinity is severely reduced compared with full-length WFIKKN2, it is still able to antagonize GDF8 and GDF11, albeit with weaker potency.Table 1Surface plasmon resonance of WFIKKN2 interactions with GDF8WFIKKN2GDF8 kaGDF8 kdGDF8 KDGDF11 kaGDF11 kdGDF11 KDm−1 s−1s−1m−1 s−1s−1WFIKKN2 FL3.37 × 1052.48 × 10−40.74 nm6.00 × 1051.34 × 10−"

The immunological roles of cathelicidin make it a putative biomarker to identify individuals at risk for reduced lung function. The objective of this study is to determine potential independent associations between low plasma cathelicidin and longitudinal lung function in current or former smokers without COPD.In a nested analysis of 308 participants from an observational cohort study, plasma cathelicidin and serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D measurements were obtained at baseline, years three and five. The independent association between lowest quartile cathelicidin (<35 ng/ml) and forced-expiratory-volume-in-1-second (FEV1) at baseline, six and 18 months from each cathelicidin measurement was assessed with generalized estimating equations after adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking status and intensity. The long-term stability of cathelicidin and relationship with vitamin D was evaluated.The cohort was 91% African-American, mean age 48.6 years, 32% female, and 81% current smokers. Participants with low cathelicidin were more likely to be female and have lower FEV1. Low cathelicidin was not independently associated with baseline FEV1. There was an independent association between low cathelicidin and reduced FEV1 at six months [-72 ml (95% CI, -140 to -8ml); p = 0.027] and 18 months [-103 ml (95% CI, -180 to -27 ml); p = 0.007]. Cathelicidin was stable over time and not correlated with vitamin D level.In current and former smokers with preserved lung function, low cathelicidin is associated with sustained lung function reductions at six and 18 months, suggesting that cathelicidin may be an informative biomarker to predict persistent lung function disparities among at-risk individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2915479994,"Na+/H+ exchangers are the most common membrane proteins involved in the regulation of intracellular pH that concurrently transport Na+ into the cells and H+ out of the cells. In this study, the full-length cDNA of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) from the Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) was cloned. The LvNHE cDNA is 3167 bp long, contains a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 74 bp and a 3'-UTR of 456 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 2637 bp, coding for a protein of 878 amino acids with 11 putative transmembrane domains and a long cytoplasmic tail. LvNHE shows high sequence homology with mud crab NHE at the amino acid level. LvNHE mRNA was detected in the hepatopancreas, gill, eyestalk, skin, heart, intestine, muscle, brain and stomach, with the highest abundance in the intestine. In the shrimp intestinal fragment cultures exposed to gradually declining pH medium (from pH 8.0 to pH 6.4), the LvNHE mRNA expression was significantly stimulated, with the highest response when incubated in pH 7.0 medium for 6 h. To investigate the functional roles of LvNHE in pH regulation at the physiological and cellular levels, the LvNHE mRNA expression was silenced by siRNA knockdown. Upon low-pH challenge, the hemolymph pH was significantly reduced in the LvNHE mRNA knockdown shrimp. In addition, knockdown of LvNHE mRNA reduced the recovery capacity of intracellular pH in intestinal fragment cultures after acidification. Altogether, this study demonstrates the role of NHE in shrimp response to low pH stress and provides new insights into the acid/base homeostasis mechanisms of crustaceans."
https://openalex.org/W2916595878,"Appalachian Kentucky (App KY) leads the nation in lung cancer incidence and mortality. Trace elements, such as As, have been associated with lung cancers in other regions of the country and we hypothesized that a population-based study would reveal higher trace element concentrations in App KY individuals with cancer compared to controls. Using toenail and drinking water trace element concentrations, this study investigated a possible association between lung cancer incidence and trace-element exposure in residents of this region. This population-based case-control study had 520 subjects, and 367 subjects provided toenail samples. Additionally, we explored the relationship between toenail and fingernail trace-element concentrations to determine if fingernails could be used as a surrogate for toenails when patients are unable to provide toenail samples. We found that, contrary to our initial hypothesis, trace element concentrations (Al, As, Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu, Se, and Pb) were not higher in cancer cases than controls with the exception of Zn where concentrations were slightly higher in cases. In fact, univariate logistic regression models showed that individuals with lower concentrations of several elements (Al, Mn, Cr, and Se) were more likely to have lung cancer, although only Mn was significant in multivariate models which controlled for confounding factors. While drinking water concentrations of Al, Cr and Co were positively related to cancer incidence in univariate models, only Co remained significant in multivariate models. However, since the drinking water concentrations were extremely low and not reflected in the toenail concentrations, the significance of this finding is unclear. We also found that fingernail concentrations were not consistently predictive of toenail concentrations, indicating that fingernails should not be used as surrogates for toenails in future studies."

Our objective was to evaluate the long-term consequences of intrauterine exposure to hyperglycemia on Developmental Defects of Enamel (DDE) in offspring.Overall, 50 children of women with GDM and 250 children of normoglycemic women participated, the latter serving as controls. Children were examined at the age between 3 and 12 years. In addition to physical examination, two independent observers examined and rated photographs to identify specific types of DDE in a blinded fashion. Among offspring of mothers with GDM, rates of DDE (all types combined) and hypoplasia (specific type) were significantly higher (p<0.001, p = 0.04), in comparison to offspring of normoglycemic mothers. Considering only the affected teeth (1060 in GDM category; 5499 in controls), rates of DDE (all types combined) were significantly higher for total teeth (p <0.001) and deciduous teeth (p<0.001), but not permanent teeth. In specific types of DDE involving deciduous teeth, rates of demarcate opacity were significantly higher (p<0.001; canine and 2nd mandibular molars) and hypoplasia (p <0.001; 2nd maxillary molars and 2nd mandibular molars). In permanent teeth, the rate of diffuse opacity in association with GDM was significantly higher (p<0.001; maxillary central incisors and 1st maxillary molars).GDM was associated with the adverse effects of DDE on offspring. This study lays the foundation for future studies to determine the impact of GDM on long-term risk of DDE."
https://openalex.org/W2917408780,"Although prostaglandins (PGs) are known to be involved in the progression of arthritis, the role of PGD2 remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the role of PGD2 in joint inflammation using genetically modified mice. Injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) increased the production of PGD2 and induced paw swelling and cartilage erosion in wild-type (WT) mice. These phenomena were accompanied with an increase in the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and matrix-degrading metalloproteinase-9. Knockdown of hematopoietic PGD synthase (H-PGDS) abolished the PGD2 production and exacerbated all of the arthritic manifestations in the inflamed paw. Immunostaining revealed that infiltrating macrophages strongly expressed H-PGDS in the CFA-injected paw. Morphologic studies revealed vascular hyperpermeability and angiogenesis in the inflamed WT paw. H-PGDS deficiency was accelerated, whereas daily administration of a PGD2 receptor D prostanoid (DP) agonist attenuated the CFA-induced hyperpermeability and angiogenesis. We further confirmed that DP deficiency exacerbated, whereas the administration of the DP agonist improved, the CFA-induced arthritic manifestations. The findings demonstrate that H-PGDS-derived PGD2 ameliorates joint inflammation by attenuating vascular permeability and subsequent angiogenesis and indicates the therapeutic potential of a DP agonist for arthritis.-Tsubosaka, Y., Maehara, T., Imai, D., Nakamura, T., Kobayashi, K., Nagata, N., Fujii, W., Murata, T.

Unresolved inflammation may result in maladaptive immune responses and lead to immune reactivity to self-antigens. We hypothesized that inflammation in CAD patients would manifest in immune reactivity to self-antigens detectable in soluble HLA-I/peptide complexes in the plasma.Soluble HLA-I/peptide complexes were immuno-precipitated from plasma of male acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients or age-matched controls and eluted peptides were subjected to mass spectrometry to generate the immunopeptidome. Self-peptides were ranked according to frequency and signal intensity, then mouse homologs of selected peptides were used to test immunologic recall in spleens of male apoE-/- mice fed either normal chow or high fat diet.

https://openalex.org/W2916184625,"The proteasome holoenzyme is a molecular machine that degrades most proteins in eukaryotes. In the holoenzyme, its heterohexameric ATPase injects protein substrates into the proteolytic core particle, where degradation occurs. The heterohexameric ATPase, referred to as 'Rpt ring', assembles through six ATPase subunits (Rpt1-Rpt6) individually binding to specific chaperones (Rpn14, Nas6, Nas2, and Hsm3). Here, our findings suggest that the onset of Rpt ring assembly can be regulated by two alternative mechanisms. Excess Rpt subunits relative to their chaperones are sequestered into multiple puncta specifically during early-stage Rpt ring assembly. Sequestration occurs during stressed conditions, for example heat, which transcriptionally induce Rpt subunits. When the free Rpt pool is limited experimentally, Rpt subunits are competent for proteasome assembly even without their cognate chaperones. These data suggest that sequestration may regulate amounts of individual Rpt subunits relative to their chaperones, allowing for proper onset of Rpt ring assembly. Indeed, Rpt subunits in the puncta can later resume their assembly into the proteasome. Intriguingly, when proteasome assembly resumes in stressed cells or is ongoing in unstressed cells, excess Rpt subunits are recognized by an alternative mechanism-degradation by the proteasome holoenzyme itself. Rpt subunits undergo proteasome assembly until the holoenzyme complex is generated at a sufficient level. The fully-formed holoenzyme can then degrade any remaining excess Rpt subunits, thereby regulating its own Rpt ring assembly. These two alternative mechanisms, degradation and sequestration of Rpt subunits, may help control the onset of chaperone-mediated Rpt ring assembly, thereby promoting proper proteasome holoenzyme formation."

We investigate the effects of cyclical intermittent hypoxia (CIH), akin to the underlying pathophysiology of OSA, on lung cancer progression and metastatic profile in a mouse model. Methods Intrathoracic injection of Ad5CMVCre virus into a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) KrasG12D+/-; p53fl/fl; myristolated-p110αfl/fl-ROSA-gfp was utilized to induce a solitary lung cancer. Male mice were then exposed to either CIH or Sham for 40–41 days until harvest. To monitor malignant progression, serial micro CT scans with respiratory gating (no contrast) was performed. To detect spontaneous metastases in distant organs, H&E and immunohistochemistry were performed. Results Eighty-eight percent of injected Ad5CMVCre virus was recovered from left lung tissue, indicating reliable and accurate injections. Serial micro CT demonstrated that CIH increases primary lung tumor volume progression compared to Sham on days 33 (p = 0.004) and 40 (p<0.001) post-injection. In addition, CIH increases variability in tumor volume on day 19 (p<0.0001), day 26 (p<0.0001), day 33 (p = 0.025) and day 40 (p = 0.004). Finally, metastases are frequently detected in heart, mediastinal lymph nodes, and right lung using H&E and immunohistochemistry. Conclusions Using a GEM mouse model of metastatic lung cancer, we report that male mice with solitary lung cancer have accelerated malignant progression and increased variability in tumor growth when exposed to cyclical intermittent hypoxia. Our results indicate that cyclical intermittent hypoxia is a pathogenic factor in non-small cell lung cancer that promotes the more rapid growth of developing tumors."

In this paper, we investigated the interaction between DNA and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Although various forms of DNA bind to TNFα with low μm dissociation constants, the interaction stabilizes the trimeric form of TNFα and enhances its cytotoxic effect. Based on this mechanism, a photoswitchable TNFα (TNFα–2-nitroveratryloxycarbonyl) has been designed whose sensitivity to DNA-mediated up-regulation of TNFα activity can be tuned by light irradiation. The mechanism described in this study represents a general model to understand the involvement of nonspecific interactions among biomolecules in regulating their biological functions.

The mechanism described in this study represents a general model to understand the involvement of nonspecific interactions among biomolecules in regulating their biological functions. Because the interaction is not DNA sequence–specific, the resulting effect should be considered for oligonucleotide-based therapeutics in general. Biomolecular noncovalent interactions are involved in all biological processes, such as activation/inhibition of enzymes, or self-assembling and self-organization at different hierarchical levels. Although most studies aim to illustrate the structural basis for specific recognition, many biomolecules in high abundance (e.g. albumin and immunoglobulin in blood, actin and tubulin in cells, or collagen and glycosaminoglycan in extracellular matrix) could be involved in many different specific or promiscuous interactions relevant under pathophysiological conditions. Some important signaling pathways between two molecules of large concentration difference could be overlooked: only a very small fraction of the abundant molecule (e.g. molecule R of mm) is directly involved in the interaction with the molecule at low concentration (e.g. molecule A of pm). It is difficult to reveal the R–A complex and the regulatory effect of R on A. In principle, a unspecific interaction between biomolecules is more ubiquitous than a specific one. For example, positively charged sequences in extracellular matrix protein laminin have been shown to promiscuously bind to multiple growth factors (1Ishihara J. Ishihara A. Fukunaga K. Sasaki K. White M.J.V. Briquez P.S. Hubbell J.A. Laminin heparin-binding peptides bind to several growth factors and enhance diabetic wound healing.Nat.

However, because it is very difficult to dissect them from each other, the biological functions of most unspecific interactions remain unknown. DNA is ubiquitous, whereas extracellular DNA is secreted from various sources, including apoptotic cells, NETotic neutrophils, and bacterial biofilms. Fluctuations of DNA concentration in blood have been observed under many pathological conditions, including some autoimmune diseases (2Nagata S. Hanayama R. Kawane K.

DNA can have biological functions independent from their roles as the medium for the storage and flow of genetic information. For example, systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease, is characterized by the expression of anti-DNA antibodies. These antibodies form immune complexes with DNA, stimulate inflammatory cytokine production, and incite inflammation and tissue damage (4Su K.-Y. Pisetsky D.S. The role of extracellular DNA in autoimmunity in SLE.Scand. J. Immunol. 2009; 70 (19703007): 175-18310.1111/j.1365-3083.2009.02300.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

Because the concentration affecting the ratio between monomeric and trimeric forms is too low for most biochemical methods, the correlation between the regulation of trimeric TNFα level and its pro-inflammatory effect remains elusive (13Bazzoni F.

To understand the regulation of TNFα activity beyond a simple function of its concentration could shed new light in its role in various autoimmune reactions (14Corti A. Fassina G. Marcucci F.

Like many cytokines and morphogens, TNFα has a heparin-binding domain, because the positively charged residues can interact with the highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan (16Kenig M. Gaberc-Porekar V.

In this work, we investigated the interaction between TNFα and negatively charged biopolymers such as DNA and heparin, to illustrate the potential mechanism in regulating this cytokine activity. tumor necrosis factor actinomycin D biolayer interferometry cycloheximide microscale thermophoresis 2-nitroveratryloxycarbonyl salmon sperm DNA single-stranded DNA ϒ-shaped DNA. We first investigated whether TNFα could interact with negatively charged biopolymer using biolayer interferometry (BLI). As shown in Fig. 1, TNFα showed strong binding to a carboxylated surface. We then investigated whether DNA can inhibit the binding of TNFα to the negatively charged surface. We analyzed the effects of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), dsDNA, ϒ-shaped DNA (ϒ-DNA), and salmon sperm DNA (S-DNA). Different forms of DNA (1 μm) reduced the binding of TNFα to the negatively charged surface. Heparin exhibited a similar effect. Interestingly, among the four different forms of DNA, ϒ-DNA has shown the strongest effect, although it is approximately three times smaller than the average size of S-DNA (Table S1). The TNFα concentration used in these experiments (1 μm) is much higher than the dissociation constant of the homotrimer (17Alzani R. Cozzi E. Corti A. Temponi M. Trizio D. Gigli M. Rizzo V. Mechanism of suramin-induced deoligomerization of tumor necrosis factor α.Biochemistry. 1995; 34 (7756262): 6344-635010.1021/bi00019a012Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The competition experiment indicates that the trimeric TNFα is in slight favor of binding to ϒ-DNA, probably because their interaction is geometrically more favorable. More remarkable effects were observed when high concentrations of DNA were used (Fig. 1C). To directly probe the interaction between DNA and TNFα, we performed band-shift assays by mixing fluorescently labeled ssDNA, dsDNA, or Y-DNA with TNFα. At a high concentration of TNFα (50 μm), the bands of DNA shifted to smears (Fig. 2A). Moreover, residue amounts of DNA could be observed in the wells in a concentration-dependent manner, which was caused by noncovalent assembly between the trimeric protein and DNA. Then we titrated DNA with different concentrations of TNFα. Although the titration experiments indicated that the Kd values between TNFα and various forms of DNA are in the low micromolar range, as expected, the ϒ-DNA showed higher affinity to TNFα than ssDNA and dsDNA (Fig. S3). Band-shift assays using DNA staining gave similar results. Interestingly, fluorescently labeled TNFα was not able to affect the mobility of DNA (Fig. S4). Labeling TNFα using an amine-reactive dye reduced the protein surface charge, thus affecting its interaction with negatively charged DNA. This principle will be explored later to generate a modified TNFα, whose responsiveness to DNA can be switched by light. Finally, we used microscale thermophoresis (MTS) to determine the binding constants between TNFα and different forms of DNA. As shown in Fig. 2B, TNFα binds to dsDNA and Y-DNA with Kd values of 10.7 α 2.0 and 4.9 α 1.1 μm, respectively. The interaction between DNA and TNFα is not stoichiometric 1:1, because both the trimeric protein and various forms of DNA can form multiple interactions, e.g. to assemble into aggregates (Fig. 2A). Nevertheless, all these binding assays have indicated their binding constants in the low micromolar range, coincident with the range of fluctuation of DNA in blood (18Tamkovich S.N. Bryzgunova O.E.

We applied CD spectroscopy to study whether the interaction with DNA could cause structural change in TNFα. The CD spectra of TNFα is stable over time (Fig. S5A). As shown on Fig. 2C, incubation of dsDNA or Y-DNA with TNFα caused a remarkable increase of ellipticity at 217 nm. It is important to note that the DNAs have very weak signal at 217 nm (Fig. S5B). Therefore, the changes could be assigned to the conformational switch in the protein, indicating an increased content of β-sheet structure. We then investigated whether binding to DNA could affect TNFα activity. Treating mouse fibrosarcoma L929 cells with TNFα and a low dose of cytotoxic agent represents a well-established model to test the biological activity of TNFα (21Humphreys D.T. Wilson M.R. Modes of L929 cell death induced by TNF-α and other cytotoxic agents.Cytokine. 1999; 11 (10525316): 773-78210.1006/cyto.1998.0492Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Co-treatment of cells using TNFα with cycloheximide (CHX, 8 μm) led to concentration-dependent decrease of cell viability (Fig. S7A). The presence of DNA increased the sensitivity to TNFα treatment in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). The TNFα concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects were measured in the presence of 5 μm of DNA of different forms (Fig. 3B). The effect is not caused by the interaction between DNA and Toll-like receptors, because randomly generated sequences as well as designed sequences excluding any potential CpG motif can up-regulate the TNFα activity (Fig. 3C). To exclude the possibility that the enhanced cytotoxicity is caused by an TNFα-independent effect of DNA, the cells were pretreated with DNA followed by removing the DNA-containing supernatant. TNFα treatment of cells after removing DNA did not exhibit the effect of TNFα and DNA co-treatment (Fig. 3D). To exclude the possibility that the effect is caused by the interaction between DNA and the protein His tag, we performed the experiment with an untagged TNFα. The untagged and His-tagged TNFα have shown similar response to 5 μm dsDNA (Fig. S6). Treating cells using CHX and DNA or heparin also did not affect cell viability (Fig. S7B). Thus, the interaction between TNFα and DNA is important for the enhanced cytotoxic effect. Like CHX, a low dose of actinomycin D (ACT-D, 1.6 μm) also induced TNFα-associated cytotoxicity (Fig. S7A). However, it is known that DNA interacts with ACT-D, thus diminishing the cytotoxicity of the drug (22Stull R.A. Zon G. Szoka F.C. Single-stranded phosphodiester and phosphorothioate oligonucleotides bind actinomycin D and interfere with tumor necrosis factor-induced lysis in the L929 cytotoxicity assay.Antisense Res. Dev. 1993; 3 (8286930): 295-30010.1089/ard.1993.3.295Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. S7B, adding DNA to ACT-D and TNFα co-treated cells did not reduce cell viability. Instead, it rescued the cells. Because ACT-D is a guanine-specific DNA intercalator and does not interact with heparin, a remarkably enhanced cytotoxic effect was observed when heparin is used. All these results indicate that the up-regulation of TNFα effect is caused by the interaction between the cytokine and a negatively charged polymer. DNA binding provides a mechanism to fine-tune its activity. We found that changing DNA concentration from high nanomolar to low micromolar can regulate cytokine activity, which is, interestingly, coincident with their binding constants. As discussed later, as well as in a simulation experiment, the Kd value limits that range of DNA concentration fluctuation where the cytokine activity can be regulated. To investigate whether the binding of DNA can influence the dynamics of TNFα homotrimer and thus affect its dissociation, we performed a homoquenching assay (Fig. 3E). The fluorescently labeled TNFα possesses low fluorescence signal because of the closely assembled homotrimeric structure, whereas dissociated monomer can be incorporated into unlabeled TNFα, resulting in enhanced fluorescent signal (23Hoffmann A. Kovermann M. Lilie H. Fiedler M. Balbach J. Rudolph R. Pfeifer S. New binding mode to TNF-α revealed by ubiquitin-based artificial binding protein.PLoS One. 2012; 7 (22363609)e31298 10.1371/journal.pone.0031298Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24He M.M.

To avoid affecting the electrostatic interaction with DNA through positively charged residues, TNFα containing free cysteine residues was used for labeling. In the absence of unlabeled TNFα, the time course of labeled TNFα is stable over time. When unlabeled TNFα was added in large excess, a gradual increase of fluorescent signal was observed. Interestingly, adding S-DNA decelerated the process (Fig. 3E), indicating that binding to DNA stabilizes the homotrimer. S-DNA inhibited the dissociation of TNFα in a concentration-dependent manner. Heparin showed a similar effect stabilizing the TNFα trimer (Fig. S8). Without adding unlabeled TNFα in large excess, neither S-DNA nor heparin affects the signal of labeled TNFα. It is important to note that the effective concentration to inhibit TNFα dissociation is in the same range as the Kd value determined previously by MTS and band-shift assays. To design a light-switchable system, which can be used to regulate TNFα activity based on its interaction with negatively charged polymer such as DNA, will not only provide further evidence for the regulatory mechanism, but also help develop therapeutics that can be fine-tuned at disease sites by light. We modified TNFα with a photocleavable 2-nitroveratryloxycarbonyl (Nvoc) group. Although neutralizing the positively charged amino acids could reduce its binding to DNA, photolysis of the Nvoc group is expected to resume the interaction. Like TNFα, in combination with a low dose of CHX, Nvoc modified light-switchable TNFα (TNFα–Nvoc) and its photolysis product have shown similar concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects (Fig. 4A). Adding 5 μm S-DNA to TNFα–Nvoc caused a minor decrease of cell viability. In contrast, a short irradiation of the sample using light of 370 nm (near UVA1) enhanced the TNFα cytotoxicity remarkably, whereas irradiation itself showed no effect on the cell viability. Photolysis of Nvoc switches TNFα–Nvoc from the DNA insensitive state (Kd ≫ [DNA]) to the DNA-sensitive state (Kd ≈ [DNA]). Biomolecular interaction is fundamental to all biological processes. Although potent and specific molecular recognition has been considered as the biochemical basis for myriads of well-orchestrated intra-cellular and intercellular events, they have also been the subject of most structural biology studies. In recent years, weak and specific interactions have also been found to underlie numerous cellular processes, including the positive selection in the thymus through the weak interaction between the T-cell receptors and self-peptide and major histocompatibility complex proteins (25Klein L. Kyewski B. Allen P.M. Hogquist K.A. Positive and negative selection of the T cell repertoire: what thymocytes see and don't see.Nat. Rev.

In contrast, weak and promiscuous binding is thought to be less relevant, because they seem not to be able to affect a biochemical process in a specific manner. In this paper, we suggest that specificity can rise through another type of mechanism, although the molecular recognition is weak and nonspecific. Interaction between two molecules is dependent not only on the dissociation constant, but also on their concentrations. The concentrations of various biomolecules in blood cover a broad range of multiple amplitudes, from high millimolar to low concentrations (e.g. low femtomolar) at the limit of detection. Considering the following scenario: A is a molecule whose activity must be subtly regulated under physiological conditions, e.g. a cytokine of low concentration. R is a highly abundant molecule that can interact with A and affect its activity. Thus, the activity of A could be influenced by its own concentration ([A]), as well as the concentration of R ([R]) (Figs. 5, A–C). If the [R] is constantly much higher than the dissociation constant between R and A (Kd), the presence of R becomes a pseudo-intrinsic feature of the biological activity of A. If the [R] is constantly much lower than Kd, it will have no effect on the activity of A. However, if [R] is in the range of the Kd, fluctuation in [R] at certain pathophysiological condition can cause a change in the biological function of A. E=[A]Kd+γ[R]Kd+[R](Eq. 1) where [R] and [A] are the concentrations of R and A, respectively; [R] ≫ [A]; Kd is the dissociation constant between R and A; and γ is a value ≥ 0. When binding of R to A has an activation effect, γ > 1. When binding of R to A has an inhibitory effect, γ < 1. E is the biological effect of A. The regulation of biological effect of A by varying the concentrations of A and R is simulated with three different Kd values of 500 nm, 5 μm, and 50 μm, assuming binding of R to A having an activation effect with γ equal to 10. As shown in Fig. 5, dependent on the Kd value, fluctuation of R concentration within a certain range can influence the biological effect of A. The potential to regulate cytokine A by altering the concentration of R is not related to the binding specificity, but the relationship between Kd and [R] (Fig. 5D). We demonstrated this type of regulatory mechanism using the nonspecific interaction between TNFα and DNA (Fig. 5E). Because circulating DNA level in blood can alter drastically in the range of low ng/ml to μg/ml and is related to various pathophysiological conditions (12Arican O. Aral M. Sasmaz S. Ciragil P.

More generally, any TNFα-binding anionic biopolymer can cause similar effect, if its concentration fluctuates in the Kd range. Even more generally, this could be applied to any soluble factors of low concentration that interact with anionic biopolymers, whereas many of them have been classified as heparin-binding morphogens. The cytotoxic effect of TNFα involves necrosis, whereas apoptosis has been suggested as a secondary mechanism in addition to necrosis (21Humphreys D.T. Wilson M.R. Modes of L929 cell death induced by TNF-α and other cytotoxic agents.Cytokine. 1999; 11 (10525316): 773-78210.1006/cyto.1998.0492Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Fulda S.

Upon necrosis, DNA fragments released by cells will interact with TNFα and cause an additional effect (as positive feedback). The maximal amount of DNA released by cells in our experiment (30,000 cells/well) is ∼1 μg/ml. This is in the concentration range at which genomic DNA starts to exhibit an effect (Fig. 3A), whereas a stronger effect was observed at much higher concentrations (e.g. 500 and 1500 μg/ml). To which extent the positive feedback associated with necrosis contributes to TNFα activity under physiological conditions remains to be investigated in the future. The long chain of DNA or heparin can interact with more than one TNFα monomer through electrostatic interactions. The multivalent interaction can thus further stabilize the trimeric protein. Our group has previously established a method called DNA-encoded dynamic combinatorial chemical libraries. In the DNA-encoded dynamic combinatorial chemical libraries setup, two DNA strands interact with each other through only 6 or 8 bp; thus, the resulting duplex is not stable and undergoes constant reshuffling. When both DNA strands are modified with chemical groups and both can bind to a protein, the multivalent interaction can stabilize the duplex and reduce the reshuffling rate of this dynamic system (Fig. S9). In this work, we have described a similar system, in which the dynamic component is the trimeric protein TNFα. A long anionic polymer chain can interact with TNFα monomers and stabilize the trimer through multivalent interaction. DNA is the medium to encode genetic information, whereas recent evidence has suggested that other forms of DNA, e.g. the I-motif structures (30Zeraati M. Langley D.B. Schofield P. Moye A.L. Rouet R. Hughes W.E. Bryan T.M. Dinger M.E. Christ D. I-motif DNA structures are formed in the nuclei of human cells.Nat.

In study 1, 11 men cycled at 40–50% of peak aerobic power for 60 min (33.2 ± 0.3°C, 45.9 ± 0.5% relative humidity, RH). In study 2, 11 men cycled for 60 min at perceived exertion (RPE) equivalent to 15 (33.9 ± 0.2°C and 42.5 ± 3.9%RH). In both studies, each trial was preceded by 30 min of CWI (~22°C), ICE or no cooling (CON). Rectal temperature (Tre), skin temperature (Tsk), thermal sensation, and sweat responses were measured. In study 1, ICE decreased Tre-Tsk gradient versus CON (p = 0.005) during first 5 min of exercise, while CWI increased Tre-Tsk gradient versus CON and ICE for up to 20 min during the exercise (p<0.05). In study 2, thermal sensation was lower in CWI versus CON and ICE for up to 35–40 min during the exercise (p<0.05). ICE reduced thermal sensation versus CON during the first 20 min of exercise (p<0.05). In study 2, CWI improved mean power output (MPO) by ~8 W, compared with CON only (p = 0.024). In both studies, CWI (p<0.001) and ICE (p = 0.019) delayed sweating by 1–5 min but did not change the body temperature sweating threshold, compared with CON (both p>0.05). Increased Tre-Tsk gradient by CWI improved MPO while ICE reduced Tre but did not confer any ergogenic effect. Both precooling treatments attenuated the thermal efferent signals until a specific body temperature threshold was reached."
https://openalex.org/W2915778045,"Introduction Difficult tracheal intubation (DTI) contributes to perioperative morbidity and mortality. There are conflicting study results about the most predictive DTI risk criteria in patients undergoing thyroid surgery. Materials and methods We conducted a prospective observational study on 500 consecutive patients aged ≥18 years to identify predictors for DTI. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), inability to prognath, head movement, mouth opening, Mallampati score, neck circumference (NC), thyromental distance (TMD), neck circumference to thyromental distance ratio (NC/TMD), tracheal deviation apparent on chest x-ray, mediastinal goiter, histology and history of DTI were measured as possible predictors of DTI. Spearman's rank correlation test and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed. Results DTI was observed in 9.6% of all patients. Compared with the group of patients without DTI, the group of patients with DTI had significantly greater median values for body weight, BMI, NC, NC/TMD, Mallampati score, el-Ganzouri score, incidence of mediastinal goiter, and had reduced TMD and mouth opening. Significant correlations between BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and the Mallampati score ≥3 (R = 0.124, p = 0.00541), Cormack-Lehane ≥3 (R = 0.128, p = 0.00409), NC ≥40 cm (R = 0.376, p<0.001), and NC/TMD ≥5 (R = 0.103, p = 0.0207) were found. The logistic regression analysis revealed that an NC ≥40 cm at the goiter level, but not an NC/TMD ratio ≥5, was the strongest predictor of DTI (p<0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for NC/TMD was better than the curve for NC. The sensitivity and specificity of NC/TMD were also greater, compared with NC. An NC of 40.00 cm and an NC/TMD of 5.85 were the estimated cut-off points. Discussion This study found that NC was a strong predictor of DTI. The results also suggested that NC/TMD could be used as a measure to stratify the risk of DTI in patients undergoing thyroid surgery."

Action of Enabled (Ena)/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a family of conserved actin-elongating proteins, is an important aspect of regulation of the actin cytoskeletal architecture at the leading edge that controls membrane protrusion and cell motility. In this study, we performed mutagenesis experiments in overexpression and knockdown–rescue settings to provide, for the first time, direct evidence of the role of the actin-binding protein profilin1 (Pfn1) in VASP-mediated regulation of cell motility. We found that VASP’s interaction with Pfn1 is promoted by cell–substrate adhesion and requires down-regulation of PKA activity. Our experimental data further suggest that PKA-mediated Ser137 phosphorylation of Pfn1 potentially negatively regulates the Pfn1–VASP interaction. Finally, Pfn1’s ability to be phosphorylated on Ser137 was partly responsible for the anti-migratory action elicited by exposing cells to a cAMP/PKA agonist. On the basis of these findings, we propose a mechanism of adhesion–protrusion coupling in cell motility that involves dynamic regulation of Pfn1 by PKA activity.

https://openalex.org/W2915701680,"An undetectable serum HIV-1 load is key to effectiveness of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, which depends on adherence to treatment. We evaluated factors possibly associated with ARV adherence and virologic response in HIV-infected heterosexual individuals.A cross-sectional study was conducted in 200 HIV-1 serodiscordant couples and 100 unpartnered individuals receiving ARV treatment at a tertiary hospital in southern Brazil. All subjects provided written informed consent, answered demographic/behavioral questionnaires through audio computer-assisted self-interviews (ACASI), and collected blood and vaginal samples for biological markers and assessment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). HIV-negative partners were counseled and tested for HIV-1.The study population mean age was 39.9 years, 53.6% were female, 62.5% were Caucasian, 52.6% had incomplete or complete elementary education, 63.1% resided in Porto Alegre. Demographic, behavioral and biological marker characteristics were similar between couples and single individuals. There was an association between adherence reported on ACASI and an undetectable serum viral load (P<0.0001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that single-tablet ARV-regimens were independently associated with adherence (OR = 2.3; 95CI%: 1.2-4.4; P = 0.011) after controlling for age, gender, education, marital status, personal income, ARV regimen, and median time of ARV use. A positive correlation between genital secretion PCR results and serum viral load was significant in the presence of STIs (r = 0.359; P = 0.017). Although HIV PCR detection in vaginal secretions was more frequent in women with detectable viremia (9/51, 17.6%), it was also present in 7 of 157 women with undetectable serum viral loads (4.5%), p = 0.005.ARV single tablet regimens are associated with adherence. Detectable HIV-1 may be present in the genital secretions of women with undetectable viremia which means there is potential for HIV transmission in adherent individuals with serologic suppression."

The fauna includes seven species of shark: Nebrius blankenhorni, Brachycarcharias koerti, Galeocerdo eaglesomei, two species of Carcharhinus (one of which is described as a new species), Physogaleus, Rhizoprionodon and Sphyrna. Three species of rays were also recovered: Pristis, Myliobatis and an undetermined dasyatid ray. This fauna represents the first Cenozoic neoselachian fossil record from the Eocene of Madagascar and broadens our understanding of their evolutionary and biogeographic history in the southern hemisphere during this time. Although the diversity of the genera and species of the fauna is very low, the age and similarity of genera to those in Congo, west Africa, Arabia, Asia, Europe, and North, Central, and South America suggests that these genera were broadly distributed and diverse within the shallow marine settings of the Tethyan and southern provinces during middle and late Eocene."
https://openalex.org/W2916560976,"In this paper, we propose an efficient method for authenticating the absolute moment block truncation coding (AMBTC) compressed images with the capability to recover tampered blocks. The existing methods may not be able to detect some types of intentional tampering. Meanwhile, the tampered blocks are only recovered by their means, causing an unpleasant mosaic-like appearance. The proposed method classifies image blocks into groups according to their similarities, and the group information is recorded for the recovery purpose. The multiple copies of the group information are scrambled and embedded into the bitmap of smooth blocks. The dominant portions of quantization levels are adjusted to generate a set of authentication code candidates. The codes with the minimal distortion are embedded into the least significant bits (LSBs) of the quantization levels. The tampered blocks can be recovered by averaging those untampered ones with the same index. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only achieves an excellent marked image quality and detectability, but also offers a satisfactory recovered result."
https://openalex.org/W2916616886,"Background High-quality chest compressions are imperative for Cardio-Pulmonary-Resuscitation (CPR). International CPR guidelines advocate, that chest compressions should not be interrupted for ventilation once a patient’s trachea is intubated or a supraglottic-airway-device positioned. Supraglottic-airway-devices offer limited protection against pulmonary aspiration. Simultaneous chest compressions and positive pressure ventilation both increase intrathoracic pressure and potentially enhances the risk of pulmonary aspiration. The hypothesis was, that regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration is more common during continuous versus interrupted chest compressions in human cadavers ventilated with a laryngeal tube airway. Methods Twenty suitable cadavers were included, and were positioned supine, the stomach was emptied, 500 ml of methylene-blue-solution instilled and laryngeal tube inserted. Cadavers were randomly assigned to: 1) continuous chest compressions; or, 2) interrupted chest compressions for ventilation breaths. After 14 minutes of the initial designated CPR strategy, pulmonary aspiration was assessed with a flexible bronchoscope. The methylene-blue-solution was replaced by 500 ml barium-sulfate radiopaque suspension. 14 minutes of CPR with the second designated ventilation strategy was performed. Pulmonary aspiration was then assessed with a conventional chest X-ray. Results Two cadavers were excluded for technical reasons, leaving 18 cadavers for statistical analysis. Pulmonary aspiration was observed in 9 (50%) cadavers with continuous chest compressions, and 7 (39%) with interrupted chest compressions (P = 0.75). Conclusion Our pilot study indicate, that incidence of pulmonary aspiration is generally high in patients undergoing CPR when a laryngeal tube is used for ventilation. Our study was not powered to identify potentially important differences in regurgitation or aspiration between ongoing vs. interrupted chest compression. Our results nonetheless suggest that interrupted chest compressions might better protect against pulmonary aspiration when a laryngeal tube is used for ventilation."

To better characterize NGF and retina impairments at the Reeler retina, vitreous and retina were investigated by means of protein expression and glial cell activation. Reeler (n = 9; RELN-/-) and WT (n = 9; wild-type RELN+/+, B6C3Fe) mice were analyzed at 14, 21 and 28 postnatal days (p). Retinas and vitreous were subjected to confocal analysis and protein array, followed by conventional analysis. A significant increase of NGF, IL33 and TIMP1, a trend to a decrease of IL12 and IL6, as well as a significant decrease of NT3 were detected in Reeler vitreous, particularly at p28 (p<0.05). MIP3β mRNA was decreased while IL33mRNA was significantly upregulated in Reeler retina. Increased number of GFAP+ and Nestin+ cells as well as upregulation of Glutamine Synthetase and Nestin mRNAs were observed in Reeler retinas (p<0.05). These findings extend our previous studies on Reeler retina showing a selective Müller cell activation. NGF and IL33 release into vitreous would suggest a local activation of Müller cells, in addition to retinal ganglion and accessory cells. Overall, the data from this experimental study would strength the potential neuroprotective role played by activated Muller cells through NGF release."
https://openalex.org/W2768996576,"The prior probabilities of true outcomes for scientific replication have to be uniform by definition. This is because for replication, a study's observations are regarded as samples taken from the set of possible outcomes of an ideally large continuation of that study. (The sampling is not done directly from some source population.) Therefore, each possible outcome is based on the same ideally large number of observations so that all possible outcomes for that study have the same prior probability. The calculation methods were demonstrated on a spreadsheet with simulated data on the distribution of people with an imaginary genetic marker. Binomial distributions are used to illustrate the concepts to avoid the effects of potentially misleading assumptions. Uniform prior probabilities allow a frequentist posterior probability distribution of a study result's replication to be calculated conditional solely on the study's observations. However, they can be combined with prior data or Bayesian prior distributions. If the probability distributions are symmetrical then the frequentist posterior probability of a true result that is equal to or more extreme than a null hypothesis will be the same as the one-sided P-value. This is an idealistic probability of replication within a specified range based on an assumption of perfect study method reproducibility. It can be used to estimate a realistic probability of replication by taking into account the probability of non-reproducible methods or subjects. A probability of replication will be lower if the subsequent outcome is a narrower range corresponding to a specified statistical significance, this being a more severe test. The frequentist posterior probability of replication may be easier than the P-value for non-statisticians to understand and to interpret."
https://openalex.org/W2915496964,"Kenya has the world's 4th largest HIV burden. Various strategies to control the epidemic have been implemented, including the implementation of viral load (VL) testing to monitor HIV patients on ARVs. Like many resource limited settings, Kenya's healthcare system faces serious challenges in effectively providing quality health services to its population. Increased investments to strengthen the country's capacity to diagnose, monitor and treat diseases, particularly HIV and TB, continue to be made but are still inadequate in the face of global health goals like the UNAIDS 90:90:90 which require scaling up of VL tests amid existing constraints. In Kenya, there is an increase in the demand for VL tests amidst these existing constraints. The GeneXpert system is a diagnostic point-of-care technology that can quantify, amongst others, HIV VL. Currently, GeneXpert technology is widely distributed in Kenya for testing of tuberculosis. This study aimed to determine the economic and public health impact of incorporating VL test modules on the existing GeneXpert infrastructure. Markov models were constructed for different populations (non-pregnant adults, pregnant women and children). The scenarios analysed were 100% centralized VL testing compared to 50% GeneXpert plus 50% centralized VL testing, with time horizons of 5 years for the adult and child populations, and 31 months for the pregnant population. Incremental effectiveness was measured in terms of the number of HIV transmissions or opportunistic infections avoided when implementing the GeneXpert scenario compared to a 100% centralized scenario. The model indicated that, for all three populations combined, the GeneXpert scenario resulted in 117 less HIV transmissions and 393 less opportunistic infections. The cost decreased by $21,978,755 for the non-pregnant and pregnant adults and $22,808,533 for non-pregnant adults, pregnant adults and children. The model showed that GeneXpert would cost less and be more effective in terms of total cost per HIV transmission avoided and the total cost per opportunistic infection avoided, except for the pregnant population, when considered separately."

As part of our on-going screening for novel isolates, we herein report the bioinformatics analysis of CRB2, a mycobacteriophage belonging into the Siphoviridae family that propagates at 30°C. CRB2 has a 72,217 bp genome with a 69.78% GC content that belongs to Cluster B; nucleotide comparison with other B cluster members positions CRB2 as the sole member of a new subcluster, B9, being mycobacteriophage Saguaro (belonging into subcluster B7) its closest relative. Sequencing and annotation of 14 mycobacteriophages isolated by our group has yielded six cluster A members, a singleton, four of the five members of subcluster B6, one of the three reported members of subcluster G4, and CRB2 which defines subcluster B9. Considering the massive mycobacteriophage search performed in USA and the relatively rarity of our phages, we propose that factors other than size of the sampling determine the variability of mycobacteriophage distribution, and thus a world-wide concerted mining would most likely bring extremely rare and yet undiscovered mycobacteriophages."

The minimum average partial rule was also used to identify the number of components.The original factor model was not confirmed by CFA in this sample. Six components (Psychological Well-being, Stigmatization, Anticipation Anxiety, Weakness, Vitality, and Vulnerability) were extracted by PCA, with 69.11% of the total variance explained. In this process, one component present in the original factor model (Transmission) was not found, while another component (Weakness) was extracted.This study revealed the psychometric characteristics of the Korean version of the HBQOL for patients with hepatitis B. We suggest a study with a larger sample is needed to evaluate validity and reliability of the K-HBQOL for other Korean populations."

However, evidence suggests that previous studies have not aligned resistance exercise prescription to muscle function when walking. The main aim of this study was to determine whether a training seminar for clinicians could improve knowledge of gait and align resistance exercise prescription to the biomechanics of gait and muscle function for walking. A training seminar was conducted at 12 rehabilitation facilities with 178 clinicians. Current practice, knowledge and barriers to exercise were assessed by observation and questionnaire prior to and immediately after the seminar, and at three-month follow-up. Additionally, post-seminar support and mentoring was randomly provided to half of the rehabilitation facilities using a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. The seminar led to significant improvements in clinician knowledge of the biomechanics of gait and resistance training, the amount of ballistic (t = -2.38; p = .04) and conventional (t = -2.30; p = .04) resistance training being prescribed. However, ongoing post-seminar support and mentoring was not associated with any additional benefits F(1, 9) = .05, p = .83, partial eta squared = .01. Further, improved exercise prescription occurred in the absence of any change to perceived barriers. The training seminar led to significant improvements in the time spent in ballistic and conventional resistance training. There was no further benefit obtained from the additional post-seminar support. The seminar led to improved knowledge and significantly greater time spent prescribing task-specific resistance exercises."
https://openalex.org/W2917554653,"Does economic globalization influence the positioning of parties and, as a consequence, the ideological characteristics of party systems? Answering this question is important because we need to understand the constraints that parties face in formulating policies from which voters have to choose. In our paper, we take a systemic perspective and conceptualize a party system’s ideological center of gravity as the outcome of interest. We define the center of gravity as the weighted mean position of all parliamentary parties in a country that represents the position to which parties gravitate. We start by formulating static hypotheses on the effect of imports and exports on the center of gravity and derive their underlying mechanisms. We further derive dynamic hypotheses stipulating varying effects over time based on the premise that partisan attitudes toward globalization have undergone multiple changes over the last decades. A time-series cross-section analysis of 129 elections in 15 Western European countries from 1974 to 2015 finds evidence for opposite effects of exports and imports in the pooled data. Additionally, a moving-window analysis indicates that the relationship between globalization and the center of gravity varies over time. This is a significant finding because it suggests that economic globalization has an influence on party systems and that it is important to test for time-varying effects."

The janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) pathway mediates inflammatory signaling and is tightly regulated by the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins, especially SOCS3. SOCS3 expression is altered in the muscle of aged animals and may contribute to the persistent inflammation and impaired regeneration. To test this hypothesis, we performed myotoxic injuries on mice with a tamoxifen-inducible deletion of SOCS3 specifically within the muscle stem cell compartment. Muscle stem cell-specific SOCS3 deletion reduced muscle mass at 14 days post-injury (-14%, P < 0.01), altered the myogenic transcriptional program, and reduced myogenic fusion based on the number of centrally-located nuclei per muscle fiber. Despite the delay in myogenesis, muscles with a muscle stem cell-specific deletion of SOCS3 were still able to regenerate after a single bout or multiple bouts of myotoxic injury. A reduction in SOCS3 expression in muscle stem cells is unlikely to be responsible for the incomplete muscle repair in aged animals."
