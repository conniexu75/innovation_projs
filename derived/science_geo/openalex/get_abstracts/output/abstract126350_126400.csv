https://openalex.org/W1992762478,"In order to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms by which the universal cyclin kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 regulates cell cycle progression in human breast cancer cells, a recombinant adenovirus expressing human p27 was constructed (Adp27). Upon infection of human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 with Adp27, a high level of p27 expression was observed, and this resulted in a marked decrease in the proportion of cells in S-phase. In multiple cell lines, comparison of the cytotoxicity of Adp27 with another adenovirus vector expressing the related universal cyclin kinase inhibitor WAF1/Cip1 (AdWAF1), showed Adp27 to be markedly more (up to 56-fold) toxic than AdWAF1. DNA histograms showed Adp27 to cause a G1/S arrest at lower viral doses than AdWAF1. Analysis of cyclin dependent kinase activity following Adp27 infections showed decreased Cdk2 and cyclin B1-Cdc2 activity at lower viral doses when compared with AdWAF1. Adp27 is therefore potentially useful for studies of growth regulation and for gene therapy when growth inhibition is desired."

https://openalex.org/W2314308884,"Two ets family members, namely erg and Fli-1 are fused with two EWS family members namely EWS and TLS/FUS as a result of chromosome translocation in human solid tumors and leukemias. EWS-erg and EWS-Fli-1, which are involved in greater than 95% of Ewing family of tumors, were shown to function as transcriptional activators. TLS/FUS-erg, which is involved in human myeloid leukemias also functions as a transcriptional activator. Expression of these fusion proteins (EWS-erg and EWS-Fli-1) are shown to be essential for maintaining the oncogenic and tumorigenic properties of tumor cells. Cancer is thought to be caused not only by uncontrolled cell proliferation but also by deregulation of programmed cell death. Therefore, we have studied the role of normal (Fli-1 and erg) and aberrant fusion proteins (EWS-erg, EWS-Fli-1 and TLS/FUS-erg) in apoptosis. We have found that expression of normal (Fli-1 and erg) and aberrant fusion proteins inhibit the apoptosis of NIH3T3 cells induced by either serum deprivation or by treatment with calcium ionophore. We have also observed similar suppression of apoptosis in Ewing's sarcoma cells expressing EWS-Fli-1 and EWS-erg proteins suggesting that these fusion proteins may be responsible for the decreased ability of these tumor cells to undergo apoptosis. Inhibition of the expression of these aberrant fusion proteins by antisense RNA technique resulted in increased susceptibility to apoptosis leading to the death of tumor cells. Therefore, our results suggest that one can use therapeutic agents which can down regulate the expression of fusion proteins in combination with chemotherapeutic agents as an effective treatment for these human solid tumors and leukemias."
https://openalex.org/W2333639574,"We previously isolated and characterized a coding region determinant-binding protein (CRD-BP) that might regulate c-myc mRNA post-transcriptionally. CRD-BP binds specifically to the coding region of c-myc mRNA and might stabilize c-myc mRNA in vitro by protecting it from endonucleolytic cleavage. Since c-myc abundance is regulated during embryonic development and cell replication, we investigated whether CRD-BP is also regulated in animal tissues. We focused on CRD-BP expression during rat liver development and liver regeneration, because c-myc mRNA is regulated post-transcriptionally in both cases. CRD-BP expression parallels c-myc expression during liver development; the protein is present in fetal and neonatal liver but is absent or in low abundance in adult liver. In contrast, the up-regulation of c-myc mRNA following partial hepatectomy is not accompanied by up-regulation of CRD-BP. To our knowledge, CRD-BP is the first example of a putative mammalian mRNA-binding protein that is abundant in a fetal tissue but either absent from or scarce in adult tissues. Its expression in fetal liver and in transformed cell lines suggests CRD-BP is an oncofetal protein."

https://openalex.org/W1979922465,"Tec/Btk tyrosine kinases are members of a subgroup of Src tyrosine kinase family. They are reported to be activated in response to cytokines, such as IL-3 and IL-6. Janus kinases (JAKs) are known to associate with certain cytokine receptors, e.g. gp130, the signal transducing subunit of IL-6 receptor, and the common β chain of IL-3 receptor, which can be activated upon receptor dimerization in response to cytokines. Here we show the association between Jak1/Jak2 and Tec or Jak1 and Btk. Furthermore, Jak1 but not Jak2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk, but not Tec. These observations suggest that upon cytokine stimulation JAKs activate Tec/Btk or induce their dimerization resulting in endogenous tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore using a yeast two-hybrid system we have identified the target molecules for Tec, the p85 and p55PIK subunits of PI-3 kinase, and Vav. Tec associated with Vav through its SH2 domain independently of its kinase activity. In contrast the p85 and p55PIK subunits of PI-3 kinase associated with the SH2-kinase domain of Tec, dependent on Tec kinase activity. Consistent with these, IL-6 or IL-3 induced the association between Tec and the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase in mammalian cells. These findings suggest that Tec tyrosine kinase links cytokine receptors to PI-3 kinase probably through JAKs."

https://openalex.org/W2068451954,"The c-Cbl proto-oncogene encodes a multidomain phosphoprotein that has been demonstrated to interact with a wide range of signalling proteins. The biochemical function of c-Cbl in these complexes is, however, unclear. Recent studies with the C. elegans Cbl homologue, sli-1, have suggested that Cbl proteins may act as negative regulators of EGF receptor (EGFR) signalling. As the EGFR and other protein tyrosine kinase receptor signalling pathways are highly conserved between insects and vertebrates, we sought a Drosophila homologue of c-Cbl for a detailed genetic analysis. We report here that Drosophila melanogaster has a single gene, D-cbl, that is homologous to c-cbl. We find that D-cbl encodes a 52 kDa protein that has a high degree of similarity to c-Cbl and SLI-1 across novel phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) and RING finger domains. Surprisingly, however, D-Cbl is C-terminally truncated relative to c-Cbl and SLI-1 and consequently is unable to bind SH3-domain containing adaptor proteins, including the Drosophila Grb2 homologue, Drk. Although the D-Cbl protein lacks Drk binding sites it can nevertheless associate with a tyrosine phosphorylated protein, or is itself tyrosine phosphorylated in an DER dependent manner and associates with activated Drosophila EGF receptors (DER) in vivo. Consistent with a role for D-Cbl in DER dependent patterning in the embryo and adult, D-Cbl is expressed at a high level in early embryos and throughout the imaginal discs in third instar larvae. This study forms the basis for future genetic analysis of D-Cbl, aimed at gaining insights into the role of Cbl proteins in signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W2330983839,"PAX2 is a member of the paired box family of genes with an important role in kidney, genital tract and eye development. Another gene essential for kidney and genital tract development is the Wilms tumour gene, WT1. PAX2 and WT1 encode transcription factors expressed during fetal kidney development in patterns that overlap both spatially and temporally. The overlap of PAX2 and WT1 expression in fetal kidney prompted us to determine whether PAX2 regulates the WT1 gene. To investigate this possibility, the WT1 promoter and a series of WT1 promoter deletion fragments were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector, and used in co-transfection experiments with PAX2 expression constructs. PAX2 transactivated the WT1 promoter up to 35-fold in CHO-K1 cells, and from four- to sevenfold in 293 cells. Two regions of the WT1 promoter were required in the same promoter construct for efficient transactivation by PAX2 in CHO-K1 cells, and purified recombinant PAX2 protein was found to bind to two sites in the WT1 promoter, at −205/−230 and +377/+402. Removal of WT1 promoter sequences containing the −205/−230, or +377/+402 binding sites abolished transactivation of the WT1 promoter by PAX2 in CHO-K1 cells, and had a differential effect on transactivation of the WT1 promoter in 293 cells, depending on the PAX2 isoform used. A fragment containing the −205/−230 site alone could be transactivated by PAX2. These findings suggest that PAX2 is a tissue-specific modulator of WT1 expression, and is involved in cell growth control via WT1."

https://openalex.org/W2322655955,"A yeast two-hybrid screen has identified HBP1 as a transcription factor capable of interacting with the pocket protein family. We show that HBP1 can interact with one of these, RB, both in vitro and in mammalian cells. Two distinct RB binding sites are present within HBP1 – a high affinity binding site, mediated by an LXCXE motif and a separate low affinity binding site present within an activation domain. GAL4-fusion experiments indicate that HBP1 contains a masked activation domain. Deletion of two independent N- and C-terminal inhibitor domains unmasks an activation domain which is 100-fold more active than the full length protein. The released activation capacity is repressed by RB, p130 and p107. In addition, E1A can repress the activity of HBP1 via conserved region 1 sequences in a manner independent of the CBP co-activator. We show by stable expression in NIH3T3 cells that HBP1 has the capacity to induce morphological transformation of cells in culture."
https://openalex.org/W2320699773,"We have used the human leukemia cell line K562 as a model to study the role of c-myc in differentiation and apoptosis. We have generated stable transfectants of K562 constitutively expressing two c-Myc inhibitory mutants: D106-143, that carries a deletion in the transactivation domain of the protein, and In373, that carries an insertion in the DNA-interacting region. We show here that In373 is able to compete with c-Myc for Max binding and to inhibit the transformation activity of c-Myc. K562 cells can differentiate towards erythroid or myelomonocytic lineages. K562 transfected with c-myc mutants showed a higher expression of erythroid differentiation markers, without any detectable effects in the myelomonocytic differentiation. We also transfected K562 cells with a zinc-inducible max gene. Ectopic Max overexpression resulted in an increased erythroid differentiation, thus reproducing the effects of c-myc inhibitory mutants. We also studied the role of c-myc mutants and max in apoptosis of K562 induced by okadaic acid, a protein phosphatases inhibitor. The expression of D106-143 and In373 c-myc mutants and the overexpression of max reduced the apoptosis mediated by okadaic acid. The common biochemical activity of D106-143 and In373 is to bind Max and hence to titrate out c-Myc to form non-functional Myc/Max dimers. Similarly, Max overexpression would decrease the relative levels of c-Myc/Max with respect to Max/Max. The results support a model where a threshold of functional c-Myc/Max is required to maintain K562 cells in an undifferentiated state and to undergo drug-mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2321619351,"A novel oncogene, rsc (rabbit squamous cell carcinoma), has been identified from a DMBA-induced rabbit squamous cell carcinoma using gene transfer and the nude mouse tumorigenesis assay. A full-length cDNA has been isolated and sequenced. rsc has potent tumorigenic activity in nude mice (latency <4 weeks), but does not induce focus formation or anchorage independent growth. The oncogene resulted from the fusion of rHR 23A (a rabbit homologue of yeast Rad 23) with a member of the ral-GDS family which we named rgr (ral-GDS related). Deletion analysis demonstrated that the oncogenic potential resides in the Rgr portion of the gene. Rgr is 40% identical overall to Ral-GDS, with identity increasing to 72% over a 100 amino acid region of the catalytic domain. Biochemical experiments indicate that Rgr has GTP/GDP exchange activity for Ral, providing evidence that this pathway is associated with tumorigenesis. The linkage between the Ral pathway and tumorigenesis by a molecule in the Ral-GDS gene family (Ral-GDS being a known effector for Ras) will open the way for the characterization of this pathway and provide an important tool to understand its biological function."
https://openalex.org/W2095816043,"To investigate the possibility of differing roles for cyclins D1 and D2 in breast epithelial cells, we examined the expression, cell cycle regulation and activity of these two G1 cyclins in both 184 normal breast epithelial cells and T-47D breast cancer cells. Synchronisation studies in 184 cells demonstrated that cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 were differentially regulated during G1, with cyclin D2 abundance increasing by 3.7-fold but only small changes in cyclin D1 abundance observed. The functional consequences of increased cyclin D2 expression were examined in T-47D cells, which express no detectable cyclin D2. Induced expression of cyclin D2 resulted in increases in cyclin E expression, pRB phosphorylation and the percentage of cells in S-phase, while constitutive expression resulted in a consistent trend toward reduced dependence on serum for continued proliferation. Thus, cyclin D2 is a positive regulator of G1 progression in breast cells analogous to the well-documented effects of cyclin D1. Indeed, equimolar concentrations of inducible cyclin D1 and D2 resulted in quantitatively similar cell cycle effects. Marked divergence was found, however, in the CDKs activated by the two cyclins in breast epithelial cells. Cyclin D2 complexes contained a higher Cdk2/Cdk4 ratio than cyclin D1 complexes. The cyclin D2-associated kinase activity was largely inhibited by Cdk2-specific inhibitors and could phosphorylate histone H1, a substrate for Cdk2 but not for Cdk4 and Cdk6. Therefore, cyclin D2 preferentially activated Cdk2 in breast epithelial cells. In contrast, Cdk4 and Cdk6 were predominantly responsible for cyclin D1-associated kinase activity as previously reported. Thus, although cyclins D1 and D2 elicited similar effects on breast epithelial cell cycle progression they appeared to achieve this end via activation of different CDKs. This is the first evidence of cyclin D2 activating Cdk2 in mammalian cells thus providing further evidence that D-type cyclins are not necessarily redundant."

https://openalex.org/W2334323026,"A cDNA encoding a novel human extracellularly-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphatase, designated B59, was isolated from a B5/589 human mammary epithelial cell cDNA library. The 1104 nucleotide open reading frame encodes 368 amino acids including the highly conserved catalytic site sequence of protein phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), VXVHCXXGXXR, at amino acid position 276 – 287. The predicted 70 amino acid stretch surrounding the HC motif shares significant sequence identity with other human dual specificity PTPs (dsPTPs), including the known ERK PTPs CL100, PAC1, B23, as well as the dsPTPs VH-1 and VHR. B59 protein synthesized in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate dephosphorylated rat ERK1 and ERK2 proteins whose phosphorylation had been stimulated by v-mos kinase added to the lysate. Ectopic expression of B59 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts inhibited the induction of an oncogene-responsive promoter by the dominant-activating raf mutant, raf-BXB. Moreover, cotransfection of NIH3T3 cells with B59 inhibited morphological transformation by H-ras and v-raf oncogenes. These results suggest that B59 suppresses the transforming activity of H-ras or v-raf oncogenes through ERK dephosphorylation and inactivation."

https://openalex.org/W2316567643,"The Gli family of DNA binding proteins has been implicated in multiple neoplasias and developmental abnormalities, suggesting a primary involvement in cell development and differentiation. However, to date their specific roles and mechanisms of action remain obscure, and a drawback has been the lack of a model system in which to study their normal function. Here we demonstrate that Gli family members are differentially expressed during spermatogenesis in mice. Specifically, Gli and Gli3 mRNAs were detected in mouse germ cells, while Gli2 was not. Further, both Gli and Gli3 exhibited stage-dependent patterns of expression selectively in type A and B spermatogonia. Gli expression was somewhat higher in type B spermatogonia while the abundance of Gli3 transcripts was similar in type A and B cells. Gel-shift analyses also demonstrated the enrichment of DNA binding activity specific for the Gli target sequence in spermatogonial cells. These results indicate a selective role for Gli and Gli3 during mitotic stages of male germ cell development. Spermatogenesis may thus provide a unique opportunity to identify downstream targets and explore the normal function of Gli family proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2026282121,"Transgenic mice carrying either a 1.008 or a 4.225 kb of the mouse c-kit 5′-flanking sequences linked to the oncogenic large T antigen (TAg) region of the simian virus 40 (SV40) genome were generated to test if the c-kit promoter could be used to develop useful mouse models. Both constructs promote tumourigenesis in the pituitary and the thyroid with high efficiency. The cell types from which each of these tumours derives were identified. Tumours of the pituitary derive from α-MSH-expressing cells located in the intermediate lobe. Transformed cells of the thyroid were calcitonin-positive, implying that the tumours derive from C cells or their precursors. Chromogranin A and neuron-specific enolase, general neuroendocrine cell markers, were expressed in both tumour types. Furthermore a variety of tumours appeared in the transgenic mice. Several of them stained positively for chromogranin A and/or neuron-specific enolase. This suggests a previously unsuspected tissue-specificity of the c-kit 5′ flanking sequences for neuroendocrine cells. The Kit-TAg transgenic mouse lines may represent a valuable model for the study of the development and the biology of neuroendocrine tumours."

https://openalex.org/W2314686705,"The mdm2 gene encodes a family of proteins, a subset of which bind p53 and negatively regulate its function as a transcription factor. We now show that an anti-mdm-2 monoclonal antibody, 2A10, recognises a protein present in rabbit reticulocyte lysate which binds murine p53 translated in vitro. Deletion of p53 residues 10 – 35, which encompass the mdm-2 binding site, abolished binding of this 2A10-reactive protein. Binding was also dependent upon p53 protein conformation and may require nascent p53 polypeptide since binding was lost following conformational shifting of the temperature-sensitive mutant A135V. Previous studies have shown that mdm-2-p53 complexes fail to exhibit detectable sequence-specific DNA binding. However, our present results demonstrate that p53 in complex with an mdm-2-related protein in vitro retained sequence-specific DNA binding capacity. Non-transformed (but not transformed) 3T3 cells were also found to express a similar 2A10-reactive protein, detectable by gel shift analysis of cellular p53 in complex with a specific DNA target. Mdm-2 in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and in normal, non-transformed 3T3 cells may represent constitutively expressed protein. Our results raise the possibility that constitutive mdm-2 may enhance and/or suppress functions of p53 as yet unidentified."

https://openalex.org/W2334188704,"A cascade of signal transduction events is initiated when cells make contact with each other or with a substrate. The nature of these signal transduction pathways is beginning to be elucidated. In particular, adhesive interactions between cells and their substrate, mediated by cell-surface integrins and extracellular matrix proteins, appears to activate the MAP kinase pathway. Here we show that in mouse fibroblasts and rat epithelial cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of a 62 kilodalton rasGAP-associated protein (GAPa-p62) is decreased upon cell-substrate interaction. Interaction between fibroblasts and various extracellular matrices such as fibronectin, vitronectin and collagen IV, but not laminin, results in tyrosine dephosphorylation of GAPa-p62. Cell-substrate mediated tyrosine dephosphorylation of GAPa-p62 is defective in transformed cell lines, suggesting a possible role for p62 in tumorigenic transformation. These studies suggest that in fibroblasts, and perhaps even in epithelial cells, the signal transduction pathway(s) triggered by different integrin engagement events converge on the rasGAP protein and alter the tyrosine phosphorylation and/or association of GAPa-p62."
