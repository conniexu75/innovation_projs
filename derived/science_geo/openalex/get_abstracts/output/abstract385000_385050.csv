https://openalex.org/W2086648828,"Background Obesity induced by high fat (HF) diet is associated with inflammation which contributes to development of insulin resistance. Most prior studies have focused on adipose tissue as the source of obesity-associated inflammation. Increasing evidence links intestinal bacteria to development of diet-induced obesity (DIO). This study tested the hypothesis that HF western diet and gut bacteria interact to promote intestinal inflammation, which contributes to the progression of obesity and insulin resistance. Methodology/Principal Findings Conventionally raised specific-pathogen free (CONV) and germ-free (GF) mice were given HF or low fat (LF) diet for 2–16 weeks. Body weight and adiposity were measured. Intestinal inflammation was assessed by evaluation of TNF-α mRNA and activation of a NF-κBEGFP reporter gene. In CONV but not GF mice, HF diet induced increases in body weight and adiposity. HF diet induced ileal TNF-α mRNA in CONV but not GF mice and this increase preceded obesity and strongly and significantly correlated with diet induced weight gain, adiposity, plasma insulin and glucose. In CONV mice HF diet also resulted in activation of NF-κBEGFP in epithelial cells, immune cells and endothelial cells of small intestine. Further experiments demonstrated that fecal slurries from CONV mice fed HF diet are sufficient to activate NF-κBEGFP in GF NF-κBEGFP mice. Conclusions/Significance Bacteria and HF diet interact to promote proinflammatory changes in the small intestine, which precede weight gain and obesity and show strong and significant associations with progression of obesity and development of insulin resistance. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that intestinal inflammation is an early consequence of HF diet which may contribute to obesity and associated insulin resistance. Interventions which limit intestinal inflammation induced by HF diet and bacteria may protect against obesity and insulin resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2151396264,"Background Prenatal and early postnatal exposure to maternal depression may “program” childhood behavior via epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation. Methylenetetrahydro-folate reductase (MTHFR) is an important enzyme in the generation of methyl groups for DNA methylation. The common MTHFR C677T variant is associated with depression in men and non-pregnant women, and with global changes in DNA methylation. This study investigated the effect of maternal MTHFR C677T genotype on antenatal maternal mood, and their impact on the gene-specific methylation in pregnant women and their newborn infants. The methylation status of SLC6A4, which encodes the transmembrane serotonin transporter, and BDNF, which encodes brain derived neurotrophic factor, were assessed because of their potential role in behaviour. Methods/Principal Findings Depressed mood was assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) in women (n = 82, all taking folate) during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. The methylation status of SLC6A4 and BDNF were assessed in 3rd trimester maternal peripheral leukocytes and in umbilical cord leukocytes collected from their infants at birth. Women with the MTHFR 677TT genotype had greater 2nd trimester depressed mood (p<0.05). Increased 2nd trimester maternal depressed mood (EPDS scores) was associated with decreased maternal and infant SLC6A4 promoter methylation (p<0.05), but had no effect on BDNF promoter methylation. Conclusions These findings show that the MTHFR C677T variant is associated with greater depressed mood during pregnancy. We further showed that prenatal exposure to maternal depressed mood affects gene-specific DNA methylation patterns. These findings support the concept that alterations in epigenetic processes may contribute to developmental programming of behaviour by maternal depression."
https://openalex.org/W2077716286,"Recent developments in network theory have allowed for the study of the structure and function of the human brain in terms of a network of interconnected components. Among the many nodes that form a network, some play a crucial role and are said to be central within the network structure. Central nodes may be identified via centrality metrics, with degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality being three of the most popular measures. Degree identifies the most connected nodes, whereas betweenness centrality identifies those located on the most traveled paths. Eigenvector centrality considers nodes connected to other high degree nodes as highly central. In the work presented here, we propose a new centrality metric called leverage centrality that considers the extent of connectivity of a node relative to the connectivity of its neighbors. The leverage centrality of a node in a network is determined by the extent to which its immediate neighbors rely on that node for information. Although similar in concept, there are essential differences between eigenvector and leverage centrality that are discussed in this manuscript. Degree, betweenness, eigenvector, and leverage centrality were compared using functional brain networks generated from healthy volunteers. Functional cartography was also used to identify neighborhood hubs (nodes with high degree within a network neighborhood). Provincial hubs provide structure within the local community, and connector hubs mediate connections between multiple communities. Leverage proved to yield information that was not captured by degree, betweenness, or eigenvector centrality and was more accurate at identifying neighborhood hubs. We propose that this metric may be able to identify critical nodes that are highly influential within the network."
https://openalex.org/W2106430772,"Naproxen ((S)-6-methoxy-α-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid) is a powerful non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is extensively used as a prescription and over-the-counter medication. Naproxen exhibits gastrointestinal toxicity, but its cardiovascular toxicity may be reduced compared with other drugs in its class. Despite the fact that naproxen has been marketed for many years, the molecular basis of its interaction with cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes is unknown. We performed a detailed study of naproxen-COX-2 interactions using site-directed mutagenesis, structure-activity analysis, and x-ray crystallography. The results indicate that each of the pendant groups of the naphthyl scaffold are essential for COX inhibition, and only minimal substitutions are tolerated. Mutation of Trp-387 to Phe significantly reduced inhibition by naproxen, a result that appears unique to this inhibitor. Substitution of S or CH(2) for the O atom of the p-methoxy group yielded analogs that were not affected by the W387F substitution and that exhibited increased COX-2 selectivity relative to naproxen. Crystallization and x-ray analysis yielded structures of COX-2 complexed to naproxen and its methylthio analog at 1.7 and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively. The combination of mutagenesis, structure analysis, and x-ray crystallography provided comprehensive information on the unique interactions responsible for naproxen binding to COX-2."
https://openalex.org/W2043416876,"Introduction Normal and malignant breast tissue contains a rare population of multi-potent cells with the capacity to self-renew, referred to as stem cells, or tumor initiating cells (TIC). These cells can be enriched by growth as “mammospheres” in three-dimensional cultures. Objective We tested the hypothesis that human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which are known to support tumor growth and metastasis, increase mammosphere formation. Results We found that MSC increased human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) mammosphere formation in a dose-dependent manner. A similar increase in sphere formation was seen in human inflammatory (SUM149) and non-inflammatory breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) but not in primary inflammatory breast cancer cells (MDA-IBC-3). We determined that increased mammosphere formation can be mediated by secreted factors as MSC conditioned media from MSC spheroids significantly increased HMEC, MCF-7 and SUM149 mammosphere formation by 6.4 to 21-fold. Mammospheres grown in MSC conditioned media had lower levels of the cell adhesion protein, E-cadherin, and increased expression of N-cadherin in SUM149 and HMEC cells, characteristic of a pro-invasive mesenchymal phenotype. Co-injection with MSC in vivo resulted in a reduced latency time to develop detectable MCF-7 and MDA-IBC-3 tumors and increased the growth of MDA-IBC-3 tumors. Furthermore, E-cadherin expression was decreased in MDA-IBC-3 xenografts with co-injection of MSC. Conclusions MSC increase the efficiency of primary mammosphere formation in normal and malignant breast cells and decrease E-cadherin expression, a biologic event associated with breast cancer progression and resistance to therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1993453452,"Background One of the central physiological functions of the lungs is to transfer inhaled gases from the alveoli to pulmonary capillary blood. However, current measures of alveolar gas uptake provide only global information and thus lack the sensitivity and specificity needed to account for regional variations in gas exchange. Methods and Principal Findings Here we exploit the solubility, high magnetic resonance (MR) signal intensity, and large chemical shift of hyperpolarized (HP) 129Xe to probe the regional uptake of alveolar gases by directly imaging HP 129Xe dissolved in the gas exchange tissues and pulmonary capillary blood of human subjects. The resulting single breath-hold, three-dimensional MR images are optimized using millisecond repetition times and high flip angle radio-frequency pulses, because the dissolved HP 129Xe magnetization is rapidly replenished by diffusive exchange with alveolar 129Xe. The dissolved HP 129Xe MR images display significant, directional heterogeneity, with increased signal intensity observed from the gravity-dependent portions of the lungs. Conclusions The features observed in dissolved-phase 129Xe MR images are consistent with gravity-dependent lung deformation, which produces increased ventilation, reduced alveolar size (i.e., higher surface-to-volume ratios), higher tissue densities, and increased perfusion in the dependent portions of the lungs. Thus, these results suggest that dissolved HP 129Xe imaging reports on pulmonary function at a fundamental level."

The identification and characterization of biomarkers for lSSc-PAH should lead to less invasive screening, a better understanding of pathogenesis, and improved treatment.Forty-nine PBMC samples were obtained from 21 lSSc subjects without PAH (lSSc-noPAH), 15 lSSc subjects with PAH (lSSc-PAH), and 10 healthy controls; three subjects provided PBMCs one year later. Genome-wide gene expression was measured for each sample. The levels of 89 cytokines were measured in serum from a subset of subjects by Multi-Analyte Profiling (MAP) immunoassays. Gene expression clearly distinguished lSSc samples from healthy controls, and separated lSSc-PAH from lSSc-NoPAH patients. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed increased expression of 9 genes (ICAM1, IFNGR1, IL1B, IL13Ra1, JAK2, AIF1, CCR1, ALAS2, TIMP2) in lSSc-PAH patients. Increased circulating cytokine levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha, IL1-beta, ICAM-1, and IL-6, and markers of vascular injury such as VCAM-1, VEGF, and von Willebrand Factor were found in lSSc-PAH subjects.The gene expression and cytokine profiles of lSSc-PAH patients suggest the presence of activated monocytes, and show markers of vascular injury and inflammation. These genes and factors could serve as biomarkers of PAH involvement in lSSc."
https://openalex.org/W2007189383,"The evolutionary loss of hepatic urate oxidase (uricase) has resulted in humans with elevated serum uric acid (urate). Uricase loss may have been beneficial to early primate survival. However, an elevated serum urate has predisposed man to hyperuricemia, a metabolic disturbance leading to gout, hypertension, and various cardiovascular diseases. Human serum urate levels are largely determined by urate reabsorption and secretion in the kidney. Renal urate reabsorption is controlled via two proximal tubular urate transporters: apical URAT1 (SLC22A12) and basolateral URATv1/GLUT9 (SLC2A9). In contrast, the molecular mechanism(s) for renal urate secretion remain unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that an orphan transporter hNPT4 (human sodium phosphate transporter 4; SLC17A3) was a multispecific organic anion efflux transporter expressed in the kidneys and liver. hNPT4 was localized at the apical side of renal tubules and functioned as a voltage-driven urate transporter. Furthermore, loop diuretics, such as furosemide and bumetanide, substantially interacted with hNPT4. Thus, this protein is likely to act as a common secretion route for both drugs and may play an important role in diuretics-induced hyperuricemia. The in vivo role of hNPT4 was suggested by two hyperuricemia patients with missense mutations in SLC17A3. These mutated versions of hNPT4 exhibited reduced urate efflux when they were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Our findings will complete a model of urate secretion in the renal tubular cell, where intracellular urate taken up via OAT1 and/or OAT3 from the blood exits from the cell into the lumen via hNPT4.

Urate is the end product of purine metabolism in humans and certain primates as a result of uricase genetic loss (urate oxidase degrades urate to allantoin) (1Hediger M.A. Johnson R.J. Miyazaki H. Endou H. Physiology. 2005; 20: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Two independent nonsense mutations in this gene, found in human, chimpanzee, and orangutan but not in the gibbon, indicate that this loss had evolutionary advantages for early primates (2Wu X.W. Muzny D.M. Lee C.C. Caskey C.T. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Because urate has powerful antioxidant properties, uricase loss resulting in elevated serum urate may have been beneficial to early primate survival (1Hediger M.A. Johnson R.J. Miyazaki H. Endou H. Physiology. 2005; 20: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In addition, Watanabe et al. (3Watanabe S. Kang D.H. Feng L. Nakagawa T. Kanellis J. Lan H. Mazzali M. Johnson R.J. Hypertension. 2002; 40: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) hypothesized that elevated serum urate levels provided a survival advantage by helping to maintain blood pressure under the low salt dietary conditions that prevailed during the middle to late Miocene period. Despite its beneficial role and given the fact that more than half of uricase-deficient mice die from urate nephropathy within 4 weeks of age, elevation in serum urate level produces a burden on the body (4Wu X.

To circumvent this problem, the human body had to develop a urate excretion system. The kidney plays a dominant role in maintaining serum urate levels (1Hediger M.A. Johnson R.J. Miyazaki H. Endou H.

NPT4_L showed transport activities for PAH (Fig. 2C) as well as several organic anions such as estrone sulfate, estradiol-17-β-glucuronide, bumetanide, and ochratoxin A (Fig. 3), which was enhanced by the replacement of extracellular NaCl with KCl. Thus, hNPT4_L seems to be a multispecific organic anion transporter. Immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded human kidney sections revealed that NPT4 immunoreactivities, absorbed by antigen peptide, were detected in proximal tubules in renal cortex as well as some tubules and glomeruli (Fig. 4A). Strong immunoreactivities of hNPT4 were observed at the apical side of proximal tubules. Proximal tubular staining of hNPT4 was confirmed by the co-localization of proximal tubular marker, L. tetragonolobus lectin (Fig. 4B). Consequently, we used hNPT4_L for further characterization.FIGURE 3Transport substrates of hNPT4_L tested for potential-driven property. The transport of [3H]estrone sulfate (50 nm), [3H]estradiol-17-β-glucuronide (E217βG, 50 nm), [3H]bumetanide (50 nm), [3H]prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, 5.0 nm), [3H]taurocholate (250 nm), and [3H]ochratoxin A (200 nm) was performed in water- and hNPT4_L-injected oocytes. The 1.0-h uptake was tested in basal (NaCl) uptake solution compared with the uptake in high potassium (KCl) solution and mimicked depolarization in the cells. Estrone sulfate, bumetanide, ochratoxin A, and estradiol-17-β-glucuronide showed enhanced uptake in extracellular high potassium solution (pH 7.4), respectively. The transport of taurocholate is not dependent on depolarization, n = 7–8. ***, p < 0.001 versus the uptake in the basal NaCl uptake solution.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Localization of hNPT4 protein in human kidney.

Xenopus oocytes expressing hNPT4_L exhibited time-dependent and concentration-dependent transport of [14C]PAH (Fig. 5, A and B). The Eadie-Hofstee plot yielded a Km of 9.56 ± 0.51 mm (mean ± S.E. of four separate experiments), demonstrating that hNPT4 had low affinity for PAH (Fig. 5B). Removal of extracellular Na+ and Cl− did not affect PAH transport by hNPT4_L, whereas replacement of external Na+ with K+ (which depolarizes oocyte plasma membrane) facilitated PAH uptake, indicating that hNPT4_L activity was sensitive to membrane potential (Fig. 5C). Because of inside-negative cell potential, this voltage sensitivity should favor the efflux of PAH from tubular cells. Consistent with the idea that hNPT4 acts as an efflux transporter under physiological conditions, hNPT4_L-expressing oocytes preloaded with [14C]PAH showed a time-dependent efflux of radioactivity when incubated in the standard uptake solution (Fig. 5D). PAH efflux via NPT4 is depressed by replacement of external Na+ with K+ (Fig. 5E) and dependent on concentration gradient (Fig. 5F). To confirm the voltage dependence of PAH transport by hNPT4, we performed electrophysiological studies via voltage clamp methods. In an I-V curve obtained by a ramping voltage command (Fig. 6A), hNPT4-expressing oocytes showed a large leak conductance compared with water-injected, control oocytes. The leak current seemed to be an increase in Cl− conductance because the reversal potential was approximately −20 mV, which was closed to the equilibrium potential of Cl− in oocytes (22Kusano K. Miledi R. Stinnakre J. J. Physiol. 1982; 328: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). When PAH (5 mm) was added, the slope conductance was greatly potentiated, indicating the increase in Cl− conductance. In addition, there was an outwardly rectifying component at positive potentials, suggesting that influx of PAH caused outward current component increasing with depolarization. To isolate the PAH-mediated current, we removed Cl− from external solution and measured the PAH-induced current at −60 and −20 mV (Fig. 6B). The PAH-evoked outward current was more prominent at −20 mV, suggesting the voltage-driven, inward transport of PAH. Based on these data, we conclude that hNPT4_L functions as a voltage-driven organic anion transporter. Given its apical membrane localization in proximal tubular cells (Fig. 4), we propose that hNPT4_L is responsible for transferring PAH from the cell into the lumen, the final step in secretion, following the initial step mediated by OAT1 and OAT3 (10Eraly S.A. Vallon V. Rieg T. Gangoiti J.A. Wikoff W.R. Siuzdak G. Barshop B.A. Nigam S.K. Physiol. Genomics. 2008; 33: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). The cis-inhibitory effect of various compounds at 1.0 mm (except for some compounds) on hNPT4-mediated [14C]PAH (10 μm) uptake was examined to investigate its substrate selectivity (Table 4). hNPT4 interacted with chemically heterogenous anionic compounds, such as probenecid, diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroid sulfates. In particular, we found that PAH transport via hNPT4_L was strongly inhibited by loop diuretics such as bumetanide and furosemide. The IC50 values for bumetanide and furosemide were 391.6 ± 1.5 and 433.5 ± 1.5 μm, respectively (Fig. 8, A and B). Saturable uptake of [3H]bumetanide was observed in hNPT4-expressing oocytes (Km = 288.4 ± 41.3 μm) (Fig. 8C). Bumetanide currents were also observed under the voltage clamp experiments (Fig. 6C). These data also support the notion that hNPT4_L transports diuretics from the cell into the lumen.TABLE 4Inhibition of hNPT4_L-mediated [14C]PAH (10 μm) uptake by various compoundsSubstratesUptake% of controlControl (no inhibitor)100.0 ± 6.61.0 mm PAH84.1 ± 7.5ap < 0.05 versus the uptake in control.5.0 mm PAH68.1 ± 8.6ap < 0.05 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm urate110.0 ± 11.05.0 mm urate98.9 ± 8.58.0 mm urate71.6 ± 5.8ap < 0.05 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm probenecid38.5 ± 6.0bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm amiloride94.1 ± 19.31.0 mm hydrochlorothiazide66.5 ± 5.2cp < 0.01 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm chlorothiazide54.9 ± 8.2cp < 0.01 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm trichlormethiazide40.6 ± 3.8bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm ethacrynic acid15.4 ± 6.7bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm methazolamide79.7 ± 6.2ap < 0.05 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm acetazolamide88.6 ± 5.41.0 mm spironolactone15.5 ± 2.1bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm bumetanide12.5 ± 1.7bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm furosemide5.8 ± 1.5bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm nicotinate107.0 ± 14.91.0 mm xanthine102.5 ± 6.01.0 mm hypoxanthine106.6 ± 6.41.0 mm d-lactate106.6 ± 12.31.0 mm l-lactate92.2 ± 4.71.0 mm estrone60.8 ± 6.3cp < 0.01 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm β-estradiol-3-sulfate5.7 ± 0.2bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm estriol72.3 ± 12.8ap < 0.05 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm estrone sulfate14.6 ± 2.2bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate18.9 ± 2.8bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm succinate106.8 ± 10.91.0 mm α-ketoglutarate93.7 ± 8.21.0 mm salicylate85.4 ± 5.21.0 mm penicillin G103.1 ± 7.41.0 mm cholate104.1 ± 9.71.0 mm taurocholate101.7 ± 8.11.0 mm sulfobromophthalein12.5 ± 1.3bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm diclofenac17.3 ± 7.8bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm ibuprofen59.7 ± 4.5bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.0.5 mm indomethacin9.9 ± 1.3bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm ochratoxin A41.0 ± 5.2bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm corticosterone8.0 ± 2.1bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm ouabain116.6 ± 7.21.0 mm cimetidine89.6 ± 13.21.0 mm quinidine54.3 ± 3.5bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.1.0 mm histamine108.8 ± 10.51.0 mm tetraethylammonium107.5 ± 3.71.0 mm DIDS97.9 ± 10.71.0 mm SITS97.0 ± 10.11.0 mm NPPB4.9 ± 0.6bp < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.a p < 0.05 versus the uptake in control.b p < 0.001 versus the uptake in control.c p < 0.01 versus the uptake in control. Open table in a new tab It is clinically well known that diuretic administration leads to hyperuricemia, caused not only by the reduction of extracellular fluid but also by sharing the renal tubular secretion pathway with urate (23Ellison D.H. Wilcox C.S. Brenner & Rector's The Kidney. 8th Ed. Saunders Elsevier, Philadelphia2008: 1646-1678Google Scholar). Because hNPT4 interacted strongly with loop diuretics, we examined urate transport via hNPT4_L in oocytes to identify the mechanism responsible for diuretic-induced hyperuricemia. We observed KCl-enhanced urate uptake (Fig. 9A) in hNPT4_L-expressing oocytes. Similar to PAH, time-dependent [14C]urate uptake and efflux was observed (Fig. 9, B and C); however, because of its low water solubility, we could not determine the Km for urate. Applying urate to the bath solution induced currents under the voltage clamp conditions (Fig. 9D). Urate efflux via NPT4 is depressed by replacement of external Na+ with K+ (Fig. 9E). Dose-dependent inhibitory effects of loop diuretics on hNPT4-mediated urate uptake were observed (IC50 was 223.5 ± 1.5 μm for bumetanide and 73.5 ± 1.5 μm for furosemide) (Fig. 8, D and E). These results suggest that hNPT4 functions as a luminal voltage-dependent exit pathway for urate as well as other anionic substrates in the proximal tubule. It is known that the majority of hyperuricemia patients have impaired renal urate excretion (24Mount D.B. Kwon C.Y. Zandi-Nejad K. Rheum. Dis. Clin. North Am. 2006; 32: 313-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Underexcretion-type hyperuricemia is caused by the enhancement of renal urate reabsorption and/or the reduction of renal urate secretion. As a component of the secretion pathway, alteration of urate efflux function by hNPT4 may affect the serum urate level in vivo. Furthermore, as described above, a recent GWAS indicated that some single nucleotide polymorphisms near the SLC17A3 gene showed association with uric acid concentration and risk of gout (11Dehghan A. Köttgen A. Yang Q. Hwang S.J. Kao W.L. Rivadeneira F. Boerwinkle E. Levy D. Hofman A. Astor B.C. Benjamin E.J. van Duijn C.M. Witteman J.C. Coresh J. Fox C.S.

Therefore, we sequenced the coding region of SLC17A3 gene in underexcretion-type hyperuricemia patients without any polymorphisms known to influence urate transport activity, such as Q141K in ABCG2 (25Woodward O.M. Köttgen A. Coresh J. Boerwinkle E. Guggino W.B. Köttgen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10338-10342Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). One of these patients (a 68-year-old Japanese male) had a plasma urate level of 7.5 mg/dl. His urate clearance was 5.1 ml/min, urate excretion was 636 mg/day, and the fractional excretion of urate was 5.93%. Analysis of the NPT4-coding region from the genomic DNA of this patient revealed the presence of a heterozygous T to C alteration at nucleotide 1021 within exon 8 of SLC17A3 (Fig. 10A), changing phenylalanine 304 (TTC) to a serine (TCC). This residue (Phe304) is located in the middle of the sixth transmembrane domain (Fig. 11). We also detected another heterozygous mutation, A to C at nucleotide 312 (in exon 3), which led to the substitution of asparagine by histidine (N68H); this residue (Asn68) is located in the putative N-glycosylation site in an unrelated subject (67-year-old Japanese male) with gout (Fig. 10A). None of these mutations were identified in 55 randomly chosen control Japanese individuals.FIGURE 11Proposed topological model of SLC17A3 (NPT4) and position of mutati"
https://openalex.org/W2106801987,"Plants release volatile chemicals upon attack by herbivorous arthropods. They do so commonly in a dose-dependent manner: the more herbivores, the more volatiles released. The volatiles attract predatory arthropods and the amount determines the probability of predator response. We show that seedlings of a cabbage variety (Brassica oleracea var. capitata, cv Shikidori) also show such a response to the density of cabbage white (Pieris rapae) larvae and attract more (naive) parasitoids (Cotesia glomerata) when there are more herbivores on the plant. However, when attacked by diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) larvae, seedlings of the same variety (cv Shikidori) release volatiles, the total amount of which is high and constant and thus independent of caterpillar density, and naive parasitoids (Cotesia vestalis) of diamondback moth larvae fail to discriminate herbivore-rich from herbivore-poor plants. In contrast, seedlings of another cabbage variety of B. oleracea (var. acephala: kale) respond in a dose-dependent manner to the density of diamondback moth larvae and attract more parasitoids when there are more herbivores. Assuming these responses of the cabbage cultivars reflect behaviour of at least some genotypes of wild plants, we provide arguments why the behaviour of kale (B. oleracea var acephala) is best interpreted as an honest signaling strategy and that of cabbage cv Shikidori (B. oleracea var capitata) as a “cry wolf” signaling strategy, implying a conflict of interest between the plant and the enemies of its herbivores: the plant profits from being visited by the herbivore's enemies, but the latter would be better off by visiting other plants with more herbivores. If so, evolutionary theory on alarm signaling predicts consequences of major interest to students of plant protection, tritrophic systems and communication alike."
https://openalex.org/W2079079774,"Fibroblast proliferation and migration play important roles in wound healing. bFGF is known to promote both fibroblast proliferation and migration during the process of wound healing. However, the signal transduction of bFGF-induced fibroblast migration is still unclear, because bFGF can affect both proliferation and migration. Herein, we investigated the effect of bFGF on fibroblast migration regardless of its effect on fibroblast proliferation. We noticed involvement of the small GTPases of the Rho family, PI3-kinase, and JNK. bFGF activated RhoA, Rac1, PI3-kinase, and JNK in cultured fibroblasts. Inhibition of RhoA did not block bFGF-induced fibroblast migration, whereas inhibition of Rac1, PI3-kinase, or JNK blocked the fibroblast migration significantly. PI3-kinase-inhibited cells down-regulated the activities of Rac1 and JNK, and Rac1-inhibited cells down-regulated JNK activity, suggesting that PI3-kinase is upstream of Rac1 and that JNK is downstream of Rac1. Thus, we concluded that PI3-kinase, Rac1, and JNK were essential for bFGF-induced fibroblast migration, which is a novel pathway of bFGF-induced cell migration."

The protein is predicted to contain a hydrophobic N terminus and a C-terminal CBM20 glycan binding domain. Here, we show that Stbd1 binds to glycogen in vitro and that endogenous Stbd1 locates to perinuclear compartments in cultured mouse FL83B or Rat1 cells. When overexpressed in COSM9 cells, Stbd1 concentrated at enlarged perinuclear structures, co-localized with glycogen, the late endosomal/lysosomal marker LAMP1 and the autophagy protein GABARAPL1. Mutant Stbd1 lacking the N-terminal hydrophobic segment had a diffuse distribution throughout the cell. Point mutations in the CBM20 domain did not change the perinuclear localization of Stbd1, but glycogen was no longer concentrated in this compartment. Stable overexpression of glycogen synthase in Rat1WT4 cells resulted in accumulation of glycogen as massive perinuclear deposits, where a large fraction of the detectable Stbd1 co-localized. Starvation of Rat1WT4 cells for glucose resulted in dissipation of the massive glycogen stores into numerous and much smaller glycogen deposits that retained Stbd1. In vitro, in cells, and in animal models, Stbd1 consistently tracked with glycogen.

Glycogen metabolism and its regulation have been studied for decades, with most focus on its cytosolic synthesis and degradation in relation to mechanisms of enzyme regulation, intracellular energy metabolism, and whole body glucose homeostasis. Glycogen biosynthesis is initiated by a specialized self-glucosylating protein, called glycogenin, followed by bulk synthesis mediated by glycogen synthase and the branching enzyme. Regulated breakdown of glycogen, to fuel contractile activity in muscle or to generate free glucose in the liver for blood glucose homeostasis, is mediated by glycogen phosphorylase and debranching enzyme. Although glycogen metabolism is usually considered cytosolic, electron microscopy studies generally place glycogen in relative proximity to membranous structures, like the endoplasmic reticulum in liver (4Cardell Jr., R.R. Michaels J.E. Hung J.T. Cardell E.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle (5Shearer J. Graham T.E. Exerc. Sport Sci. Rev. 2004; 32: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In several disease states and some genetically modified mouse models, aberrant glycogen metabolism results in the accumulation of abnormal glycogen deposits. Glycogen is also transported to lysosomes where it is directly hydrolyzed to glucose by a lysosomal α-glucosidase (acid maltase) (6Rosenfeld E.L. Pathol. Biol. 1975; 23: 71-84PubMed Google Scholar). Although probably not the major degradative mechanism under normal circumstances, the significance of this pathway is emphasized by the symptoms of patients with Pompe disease in which the α-glycosidase gene is mutated (7Raben N.

The severity of the phenotype varies with the degree of impairment of glycosidase activity, in the worst cases leading to death within the 1st year after birth. In the disease, undegraded glycogen accumulates in the lysosomes, resulting in potentially fatal tissue damage. The molecular mechanism by which glycogen is transferred to the lysosome is poorly understood but could involve an autophagy-like pathway. Autophagy describes a set of processes whereby cellular materials are transported to the lysosome for recycling (10Nakatogawa H. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol.

In macroautophagy, cytosolic materials are engulfed by a lipid bilayer in structures called autophagosomes that are ultimately delivered to the lysosome. The first genetic link between autophagy and glycogen came from genetic screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that linked glycogen accumulation with mutations of Atg1 and Atg13, two proteins implicated in the regulation of autophagy (13Wang Z. Wilson W.A. Fujino M.A. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5742-5752Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that, in Pompe disease, the inability to dispose of lysosomal glycogen results in a build up of autophagic and late endosomal vesicles (14Raben N. Roberts A. Plotz P.H. Acta Myol. 2007; 26: 45-48PubMed Google Scholar). In a mouse model of Pompe disease, additional disruption of Atg7, another gene involved in macroautophagy, results in decreased accumulation of lysosomal glycogen (15Raben N. Schreiner C. Baum R.

The particles result from the ability of associating proteins to bind to glycogen, sometimes to each other, and sometimes to membranes (Fig. 1B). Known glycogen-associated proteins are glycogenin, the metabolic enzymes glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, and the debranching enzyme and several regulatory proteins, including phosphorylase kinase and members of the PP1G family of type 1 protein phosphatases (PP1s). PP1G enzymes exist as a PP1 catalytic subunit associated with a glycogen-targeting regulatory subunit (20Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol.

Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) identified the same protein, which he referred to as genethonin, in a bioinformatics analysis directed at conserved starch binding domains. Stbd1 is one of a small number of proteins in mammalian genomes that contain highly conserved putative CBM20 carbohydrate binding domains (26Christiansen C. Abou Hachem M. Janecek S. Viksø-Nielsen A. Blennow A. Svensson B. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 5006-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Stbd1 has been little studied until recently. During the preparation of this manuscript, Stapleton et al. (27Stapleton D. Nelson C. Parsawar K. McClain D. Gilbert-Wilson R. Barker E. Rudd B. Brown K. Hendrix W. O'Donnell P. Parker G. Proteomics. 2010; 10: 2320-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) described a proteomic analysis that identified Stbd1 as a protein associated with glycogen in the liver. Our data also show that Stbd1 binds to glycogen and related polysaccharides in vitro and that in different cell and animal models Stbd1 is linked to glycogen metabolism. Our hypothesis is that Stbd1 functions to tether glycogen to membranes, thereby affecting its localization and possibly its intracellular trafficking to lysosomes. Mammalian expression vectors containing HA-tagged hStbd1 (hStbd1-HA) and different truncation mutants thereof (ΔN24-HA, ΔN90-HA, and ΔC96-HA) for mammalian expression were made by PCR amplification of a human cDNA with addition of an HA tag at the C terminus. The products were subcloned into BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3 vector. Plasmids with point mutations in the carbohydrate binding domain (W293G-HA and W293L-HA) were constructed by site-directed mutation using pcDNA3-hStbd1-HA as template. The primers containing the mutated sequences were designed using the on-line service of PrimerX and were synthesized by Invitrogen. The Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used for the PCR. The PCR product was digested with DpnI (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 2–3 h to remove the parental DNA. The PCR product was transformed into competent cells to generate pcDNA3-W293G and pcDNA3-W293L. cDNA encoding GABARAP and GABARAPL1 were respectively subcloned into NotI/XbaI and EcoRI/XbaI sites of pFLAGCMV-2 vectors. His-tagged or GST fusion hStbd1 (human Stbd1) and mStbd1 (mouse Stbd1) vectors for bacterial expression were constructed by subcloning into pET28a or pGEX vectors. Sequences of all constructs were verified by the DNA Sequencing Core Facility, Indiana University School of Medicine. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells transformed with pET28a-hStbd1, pET28a-mStbd1, and pGEX-mStbd1 vectors were grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.4. Protein expression was induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at 18 °C overnight. The His-tagged hStbd1 and mStbd1 were purified by Ni2+-NTA-agarose chromatography (Qiagen). The proteins were eluted stepwise with 40–200 mm imidazole. hStbd1 and mStbd1 were eluted primarily in fractions with 100 and 200 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions were dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and stored at −80 °C with 15% glycerol. The His-tagged mStbd1 was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and bound to Affi-Gel 15 for antibody affinity purification. The GST fusion mStbd1 for antibody generation was purified using glutathione-agarose (Sigma). The recombinant protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione and dialyzed against PBS. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against GST-mStbd1 by Cocalico Biologicals. The antibody was affinity-purified by Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) coupled with His-tagged mStbd1. Rabbit polyclonal anti-HA epitope tag antibodies were from Rockland (Gilbertsville). Mouse monoclonal anti-HA epitope tag antibodies were from Covance (Emeryville). Mouse monoclonal LAMP1 and β-tubulin antibodies were from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa. Mouse monoclonal HDEL antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit monoclonal Syntaxin 6 and glycogen synthase antibodies were from Cell Signaling. Mouse monoclonal glycogen synthase antibodies were from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-hStbd1 antibodies (anti-GENX-3414) used in Fig. 2, A, B, and C were from Protein Tech Group. Rabbit polyclonal GABARAPL1 antibodies were from Protein Tech Group, and mouse monoclonal LC3 antibodies were from NanoTools. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibodies were from Sigma. COS M9 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Mediatech or Sigma) with 25 mm glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atalanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA). Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Glucose-starved COS M9 cells were incubated in DMEM without glucose and supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) and 10% FBS. The normal “fed” condition had 25 mm d-glucose (Sigma). Rat1Neo5 and Rat1WT4 cells (28Skurat A.V. Dietrich A.D. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were grown in DMEM with 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.25 mg/ml geneticin. Rat1WT4 is a stably transfected cell line overexpressing wild type rabbit muscle glycogen synthase. Rat1Neo5 cells are a control line transfected with vector. FL83B cells (ATCC) were grown in F-12K medium (ATCC) and supplemented with 10% FBS. C2C12, Hepa1c1c, HepG2, HII4EC3, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were grown in DMEM with 25 mm glucose with 10% FBS. C2C12 cells were differentiated in DMEM with 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 1% bovine calf serum. All cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. COSM9 cells co-transfected with pcDNA3-hStbd1-HA and pCMVFLAG-GABARAP or with pcDNA3-hStbd1-HA and pCMVFLAG-GABARAPL1 were lysed and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. EZview red anti-FLAG gel or EZview red anti-HA affinity gel (Sigma) was equilibrated with lysis buffer before use. The supernatant from cell lysates was mixed with affinity gel and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The samples were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 30 s to pellet the agarose. The agarose was washed by lysis buffer three times, and loading buffer was added for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cells were grown on glass coverslips for 24 or 48 h before fixation. Cells were fixed in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then quenched and permeabilized in PBS with 100 mm glycine and 0.2% Triton X-100. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) in PBS before addition of primary antibodies diluted in PBS with 2% BSA. Antibody dilutions were as follows: anti-mStbd1, 1:200; anti-HA, 1:1000; anti-LAMP1, 1:50; anti-FLAG, 1:1000; anti-GABARAPL1, 1:100; anti-LC3, 1:100; and anti-glycogen synthase, 1:200. Cells were then washed in PBS with 2% BSA and developed with secondary antibodies (1:400, Invitrogen), conjugated with either Texas Red or Alexa488 fluorophores. Nuclei were visualized by staining with 1 μg/ml Hoechst (Invitrogen). The specimens were imaged using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope with a Plan Apochromat ×63 oil immersion objective (Zeiss) as structured light acquired via an Apotome (Zeiss). Images were processed with Zeiss Axiovision 4.7. Fixed cells were rinsed with H2O and oxidized with 0.5% periodic acid for 5 min, stained with Schiff reagent for 15 min, and then counterstained in Harris' hematoxylin for 1 min. Negative controls without periodic acid treatment were processed at the same time to ensure staining specificity. The PAS 3The abbreviations used are: PASperiodic acid-SchiffTLCKN-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone.-stained samples were viewed on a Leica DM3000 microscope (Leica). Images were processed with Leica Application Suite version 3.5.0. When immunofluorescence staining was applied following by PAS staining, the counterstaining step was omitted. The method for the combined PAS and immunofluorescence staining was adapted from Ref. 29Schaart G. Hesselink R.P. Keizer H.A. van Kranenburg G. Drost M.R. Hesselink M.K. Histochem.

Glycogen was purified from mouse muscle as described previously (21Tagliabracci V.S. Turnbull J. Wang W. Girard J.M. Zhao X. Skurat A.V. Delgado-Escueta A.V. Minassian B.A. Depaoli-Roach A.A.

Briefly, tissues were boiled in 30% KOH, and lipids were removed by methanol/chloroform extraction. Glycogen precipitated in cold ethanol and redissolved in water was treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). After centrifugation, glycogen recovered from the supernatant by ethanol precipitation was subjected to extensive dialysis. Recombinant hStbd1 was diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100 and subjected to 10,000 × g centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed with the supernatant of glycogen/amylopectin centrifuged under the same conditions. The final concentration of protein was 2.5 μg/ml and glycogen/amylopectin was 0.25 mg/ml. hStbd1 without polysaccharide was used as a negative control. The samples were mixed well, incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, and then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 90 min. The pellets were resuspended by sonication. The supernatant and pellets were subjected to Western blotting for hStbd1. MGSKO mice (30Pederson B.A. Chen H. Schroeder J.M. Shou W. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell.

They carry disruptions of the glycogen synthase genes Gys1 or Gys2, respectively. Animals were maintained in AALAAC approved facilities of the Indiana University School of Medicine Laboratory Animal Research Center, with all experimental protocols approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine IACUC. The exercise protocol followed a previous study (32Pederson B.A. Cope C.R. Schroeder J.M. Smith M.W. Irimia J.M. Thurberg B.L. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol.

Tissues were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Frozen tissues were powdered and homogenized in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm N-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), 2 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, with or without 0.5% Triton X-100. Tissue homogenates were used for Western blotting analysis. For analysis of mStbd1 and glycogen fractionation, tissue homogenates were first subjected to low speed centrifugation 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to generate a low speed pellet (LSP), and the supernatant (LSS) was subjected to further centrifugation. Centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 90 min generated a high speed supernatant (HSS) and glycogen was collected in the high speed pellet fraction (HSP). The HSP was resuspended in the starting volume of homogenization buffer. All fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-mStbd1 antibodies. Cultured cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm TLCK, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet insoluble materials. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using BSA as standard (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL (Thermo Scientific). Fixed mouse liver sections were deparaffinized and then incubated with anti-mStbd1 and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The staining was developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine reagent in the presence of HRP. The samples were rehydrated before mounting. The data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test, and significance was assigned at p < 0.05. The architecture of Stbd1 includes an N-terminal hydrophobic segment, a putative leucine zipper domain, and a CBM20 domain at the C terminus (supplemental Fig. S1). Human Stbd1 (hStbd1; 358 residues) is 20 amino acids longer than the mouse protein (mStbd1) with overall 60% identity. Rat Stbd1 is 88 and 63% identical to the mouse and human proteins respectively. Orthologs of Stbd1 are present in mammals but, from bioinformatic analysis, appear to be absent in other vertebrates such as fish and birds, even though the CBM20 domain itself is ancient and can be found in bacteria and archaea. There is a very high degree of conservation in the hydrophobic N terminus and CBM20 domains of Stbd1 (supplemental Fig. S2). A yeast two-hybrid screen using as bait Stbd1 lacking the first 171 residues picked four Stbd1 clones of varying length, with the shortest, identified twice, containing little more than the CBM20 domain (supplemental Fig. S1). It is therefore likely that Stbd1 is a dimer formed by interactions between the CBM20 domains. If the putative leucine zipper has any functional role, it does not appear to be related to oligomerization. Antibodies raised against recombinant mouse Stbd1 identified a single protein species of ∼36 kDa in extracts of most mouse tissues tested (Fig. 1A), with especially prominent signals in muscle and liver, the main glycogen-accumulating organs, consistent with the earlier report (24Bouju S. Lignon M.F. Piétu G. Le Cunff M. Léger J.J. Auffray C. Dechesne C.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Overexposure of the autoradiogram revealed trace signals in brain, kidney, and pancreas. By Western blotting, we also detected endogenous Stbd1 in several cultured cell lines, including mouse C2C12, Hepa1c1c, embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), and FL83B cells and rat H4IIEC3 and Rat1 cells (Fig. 1B). This anti-mouse Stbd1 antibody, however, did not recognize Stbd1 in human HepG2 or simian COS M9 cells, presumably because of relatively low sequence similarities. Muscle glycogen synthase knock-out (MGSKO) mice (30Pederson B.A. Chen H. Schroeder J.M. Shou W. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7179-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have a disruption of the glycogen synthase gene, Gys1, which is expressed in skeletal muscle and most tissues that produce glycogen other than liver. The MGSKO mice have undetectable glycogen in all tissues analyzed except for liver. Western analysis of muscle extracts from MGSKO mice indicated virtually undetectable Stbd1 protein compared with controls (Fig. 1C). Muscle glycogen can be acutely depleted to ∼10% of the starting level by exercising mice to exhaustion on a treadmill (32Pederson B.A. Cope C.R. Schroeder J.M. Smith M.W. Irimia J.M. Thurberg B.L. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17260-17265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Such an exercise regimen did not affect muscle Stbd1 levels in wild type mice as judged by Western blotting (Fig. 1D). Liver glycogen synthase knock-out (LGSKO) mice (31Irimia J.M. Meyer C.M. Peper C.L. Zhai L. Bock C.B. Previs S.F. McGuinness O.P. DePaoli-Roach A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12851-12861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have the second glycogen synthase gene, Gys2, disrupted in the liver so that the liver glycogen content in the fed state is decreased by 95% compared with the wild type. In extracts of livers from fed LGSKO mice, there was a concomitant 40% reduction in Stbd1 protein compared with control mice (Fig. 1E). A reduction in Stbd1 was also observed by immunohistochemical staining of liver sections (Fig. 1F). Liver glycogen can be depleted in wild type mice by overnight fasting, which reduces the level to ∼5% of the fed state, comparable with that of the fed LGSKO liver (31Irimia J.M. Meyer C.M. Peper C.L. Zhai L. Bock C.B. Previs S.F. McGuinness O.P. DePaoli-Roach A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12851-12861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fasting did not significantly reduce the liver Stbd1 levels in either wild type or LGSKO mice (Fig. 1E). The data with MGSKO and LGSKO mice indicate a genetic link between glycogen and Stbd1, demonstrating that severely reduced or absent glycogen over the long term correlates with decreased Stbd1 protein. However, short term decreases in either liver or muscle glycogen in wild type mice do not have major effects on Stbd1 protein level. Glycogen in muscle extracts can be fractionated by centrifugation, typically by first removing gross cellular debris, including contractile proteins and associated structures, with low speed centrifugation followed by ultracentrifugation of the supernatant to sediment the glycogen particles. About half of the Stbd1 was recovered in the low speed pellet (Fig. 2A, LSP). Recovery of Stbd1 in the low speed pellet is most likely due to association with membranous components because inclusion of Triton X-100 in the homogenization buffer greatly increased the fraction of Stbd1 that remained in the supernatant (Fig. 2A, LSS).

Inhibition of the selenoen-zyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is a suggested mechanism of toxicity. Here, we demonstrated enhanced inhibition of activity by inorganic and organic mercury compounds in NADPH-reduced TrxR, consistent with binding of mercury also to the active site selenolthiol. On treatment with 5 µM selenite and NADPH’ TrxR inactivated by HgCl2 displayed almost full recovery of activity. Structural analysis indicated that mercury was complexed with TrxR’ but enzyme-generated selenide removed mercury as mercury selenide’ regenerating the active site selenocysteine and cysteine residues required for activity.

https://openalex.org/W2114366647,"Background Aberrant promoter DNA methylation has been shown to play a role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) pathophysiology. However, further studies to discuss the prognostic value and the relationship of the epigenetic signatures with defined genomic rearrangements in acute myeloid leukemia are required. Methodology/Principal Findings We carried out high-throughput methylation profiling on 116 de novo AML cases and we validated the significant biomarkers in an independent cohort of 244 AML cases. Methylation signatures were associated with the presence of a specific cytogenetic status. In normal karyotype cases, aberrant methylation of the promoter of DBC1 was validated as a predictor of the disease-free and overall survival. Furthermore, DBC1 expression was significantly silenced in the aberrantly methylated samples. Patients with chromosome rearrangements showed distinct methylation signatures. To establish the role of fusion proteins in the epigenetic profiles, 20 additional samples of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) transduced with common fusion genes were studied and compared with patient samples carrying the same rearrangements. The presence of MLL rearrangements in HSPC induced the methylation profile observed in the MLL-positive primary samples. In contrast, fusion genes such as AML1/ETO or CBFB/MYH11 failed to reproduce the epigenetic signature observed in the patients. Conclusions/Significance Our study provides a comprehensive epigenetic profiling of AML, identifies new clinical markers for cases with a normal karyotype, and reveals relevant biological information related to the role of fusion proteins on the methylation signature."

Although the physiological roles of <i>RASSF1</i> have been studied in some detail, the exact functions of <i>RASSF5</i> are not well understood. Here, we show that <i>RASSF5</i> plays an important role in mediating apoptosis in response to death receptor ligands, TNF-α and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Depletion of <i>RASSF5</i> by siRNA significantly reduced TNF-α-mediated apoptosis, likely through its interaction with proapoptotic kinase MST1, a mammalian homolog of <i>Hippo</i>. Consistent with this, siRNA knockdown of <i>MST1</i> also resulted in resistance to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. To further study the role of <i>Rassf5 in vivo</i>, we generated <i>Rassf5</i>-deficient mouse. Inactivation of <i>Rassf5</i> in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resulted in resistance to TNF-α- and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-mediated apoptosis. Importantly, <i>Rassf5</i>-null mice were significantly more resistant to TNF-α-induced apoptosis and failed to activate Mst1. Loss of <i>Rassf5</i> also resulted in spontaneous immortalization of MEFs at earlier passages than the control MEFs, and <i>Rassf5</i>-null immortalized MEFs, but not the immortalized wild type MEFs, were fully transformed by <i>K-RasG12V</i>. Together, our results demonstrate a direct role for <i>RASSF5</i> in death receptor ligand-mediated apoptosis and provide further evidence for <i>RASSF5</i> as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2061600637,"Protein aggregation is under intense scrutiny because of its role in human disease. Although increasing evidence indicates that protein native states are highly protected against aggregation, the specific protection mechanisms are poorly understood. Insight into such mechanisms can be gained through study of the relatively few proteins that aggregate under native conditions. Ataxin-3, the protein responsible for Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, a polyglutamine expansion disease, represents one of such examples. Polyglutamine expansion is central for determining solubility and aggregation rates of ataxin-3, but these properties are profoundly modulated by its N-terminal Josephin domain. This work aims at identifying the regions that promote Josephin fibrillogenesis and rationalizing the mechanisms that protect Josephin and nonexpanded ataxin-3 from aberrant aggregation. Using different biophysical techniques, aggregation propensity predictions and rational design of amino acid substitutions, we show that Josephin has an intrinsic tendency to fibrillize under native conditions and that fibrillization is promoted by two solvent-exposed patches, which are also involved in recognition of natural substrates, such as ubiquitin. Indeed, designed mutations at these patches or substrate binding significantly reduce Josephin aggregation kinetics. Our results provide evidence that protein nonpathologic function can play an active role in preventing aberrant fibrillization and suggest the molecular mechanism whereby this occurs in ataxin-3."
https://openalex.org/W1995981837,"During vascular injury, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and fibroblasts/myofibroblasts (FBs/MFBs) are exposed to altered luminal blood flow or transmural interstitial flow. We investigate the effects of these two types of fluid flows on the phenotypes of SMCs and MFBs and the underlying mechanotransduction mechanisms.Exposure to 8 dyn/cm(2) laminar flow shear stress (2-dimensional, 2-D) for 15 h significantly reduced expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), smooth muscle protein 22 (SM22), SM myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), smoothelin, and calponin. Cells suspended in collagen gels were exposed to interstitial flow (1 cmH(2)O, approximately 0.05 dyn/cm(2), 3-D), and after 6 h of exposure, expression of SM-MHC, smoothelin, and calponin were significantly reduced, while expression of alpha-SMA and SM22 were markedly enhanced. PD98059 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor) and heparinase III (an enzyme to cleave heparan sulfate) significantly blocked the effects of laminar flow on gene expression, and also reversed the effects of interstitial flow on SM-MHC, smoothelin, and calponin, but enhanced interstitial flow-induced expression of alpha-SMA and SM22. SMCs and MFBs have similar responses to fluid flow. Silencing ERK1/2 completely blocked the effects of both laminar flow and interstitial flow on SMC marker gene expression. Western blotting showed that both types of flows induced ERK1/2 activation that was inhibited by disruption of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs).The results suggest that HSPG-mediated ERK1/2 activation is an important mechanotransduction pathway modulating SMC marker gene expression when SMCs and MFBs are exposed to flow. Fluid flow may be involved in vascular remodeling and lesion formation by affecting phenotypes of vascular wall cells. This study has implications in understanding the flow-related mechanobiology in vascular lesion formation, tumor cell invasion, and stem cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1895935492,"Several mammalian forkhead transcription factors have been shown to impact on cell cycle regulation and are themselves linked to cell cycle control systems. Here we have investigated the little studied mammalian forkhead transcription factor FOXK2 and demonstrate that it is subject to control by cell cycle-regulated protein kinases. FOXK2 exhibits a periodic rise in its phosphorylation levels during the cell cycle, with hyperphosphorylation occurring in mitotic cells. Hyperphosphorylation occurs in a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)·cyclin-dependent manner with CDK1·cyclin B as the major kinase complex, although CDK2 and cyclin A also appear to be important. We have mapped two CDK phosphorylation sites, serines 368 and 423, which play a role in defining FOXK2 function through regulating its stability and its activity as a transcriptional repressor protein. These two CDK sites appear vital for FOXK2 function because expression of a mutant lacking these sites cannot be tolerated and causes apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1990534862,"The Notch signaling pathway is important for cell fate decisions in embryonic development and adult life. Defining the functional importance of the Notch pathway in these contexts requires the elucidation of essential signal transduction components that have not been fully characterized. Here, we show that Rabconnectin-3B is required for the Notch pathway in mammalian cells. siRNA-mediated silencing of Rabconnectin-3B in mammalian cells attenuated Notch signaling and disrupted the activation and nuclear accumulation of the Notch target Hes1. Rabconnectin-3B knockdown also disrupted V-ATPase activity in mammalian cells, consistent with previous observations in Drosophila. Pharmacological inhibition of the V-ATPase complex significantly reduced Notch signaling in mammalian cells. Finally, Rabconnectin-3B knockdown phenocopied functional disruption of Notch signaling during osteoclast differentiation. Collectively, these findings define an important role for Rabconnectin-3 and V-ATPase activity in the Notch signaling pathway in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1971213794,"Predicting off-targets by computational methods is getting increasing importance in early drug discovery stages. We herewith present a computational method based on binding site three-dimensional comparisons, which prompted us to investigate the cross-reaction of protein kinase inhibitors with synapsin I, an ATP-binding protein regulating neurotransmitter release in the synapse. Systematic pair-wise comparison of the staurosporine-binding site of the proto-oncogene Pim-1 kinase with 6,412 druggable protein-ligand binding sites suggested that the ATP-binding site of synapsin I may recognize the pan-kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Biochemical validation of this hypothesis was realized by competition experiments of staurosporine with ATP-γ35S for binding to synapsin I. Staurosporine, as well as three other inhibitors of protein kinases (cdk2, Pim-1 and casein kinase type 2), effectively bound to synapsin I with nanomolar affinities and promoted synapsin-induced F-actin bundling. The selective Pim-1 kinase inhibitor quercetagetin was shown to be the most potent synapsin I binder (IC50 = 0.15 µM), in agreement with the predicted binding site similarities between synapsin I and various protein kinases. Other protein kinase inhibitors (protein kinase A and chk1 inhibitor), kinase inhibitors (diacylglycerolkinase inhibitor) and various other ATP-competitors (DNA topoisomerase II and HSP-90α inhibitors) did not bind to synapsin I, as predicted from a lower similarity of their respective ATP-binding sites to that of synapsin I. The present data suggest that the observed downregulation of neurotransmitter release by some but not all protein kinase inhibitors may also be contributed by a direct binding to synapsin I and phosphorylation-independent perturbation of synapsin I function. More generally, the data also demonstrate that cross-reactivity with various targets may be detected by systematic pair-wise similarity measurement of ligand-annotated binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1999822725,"Positive selection is known to occur when the environment that an organism inhabits is suddenly altered, as is the case across recent human history. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully illuminated disease-associated variation. However, whether human evolution is heading towards or away from disease susceptibility in general remains an open question. The genetic-basis of common complex disease may partially be caused by positive selection events, which simultaneously increased fitness and susceptibility to disease. We analyze seven diseases studied by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium to compare evidence for selection at every locus associated with disease. We take a large set of the most strongly associated SNPs in each GWA study in order to capture more hidden associations at the cost of introducing false positives into our analysis. We then search for signs of positive selection in this inclusive set of SNPs. There are striking differences between the seven studied diseases. We find alleles increasing susceptibility to Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and Crohn's Disease (CD) underwent recent positive selection. There is more selection in alleles increasing, rather than decreasing, susceptibility to T1D. In the 80 SNPs most associated with T1D (p-value <7.01 x 10(-5)) showing strong signs of positive selection, 58 alleles associated with disease susceptibility show signs of positive selection, while only 22 associated with disease protection show signs of positive selection. Alleles increasing susceptibility to RA are under selection as well. In contrast, selection in SNPs associated with CD favors protective alleles. These results inform the current understanding of disease etiology, shed light on potential benefits associated with the genetic-basis of disease, and aid in the efforts to identify causal genetic factors underlying complex disease."

Iron limitation is especially apparent in bacterial pathogens of mammalian hosts where free iron concentrations are physiologically negligible. A common strategy is to secrete low molecular weight iron chelators, termed siderophores, and express high affinity receptors for the siderophore-iron complex. Staphylococcus aureus, a widespread pathogen, produces two siderophores, staphyloferrin A (SA) and staphyloferrin B (SB). We have determined the crystal structure of the staphyloferrin B receptor, SirA, at high resolution in both the apo and Fe(III)-SB (FeSB)-bound forms. SirA, a member of the class III binding protein family of metal receptors, has N- and C-terminal domains, each composed of mainly a β-stranded core and α-helical periphery. The domains are bridged by a single α-helix and together form the FeSB binding site. SB coordinates Fe(III) through five oxygen atoms and one nitrogen atom in distorted octahedral geometry. SirA undergoes conformational change upon siderophore binding, largely securing two loops from the C-terminal domain to enclose FeSB with a low nanomolar dissociation constant. The staphyloferrin A receptor, HtsA, homologous to SirA, also encloses its cognate siderophore (FeSA); however, the largest conformational rearrangements involve a different region of the C-terminal domain. FeSB is uniquely situated in the binding pocket of SirA with few of the contacting residues being conserved with those of HtsA interacting with FeSA. Although both SirA and HtsA bind siderophores from the same α-hydroxycarboxylate class, the unique structural features of each receptor provides an explanation for their distinct specificity.

https://openalex.org/W2038117878,"Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA; Morquio A syndrome) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS), an enzyme that degrades keratan sulfate (KS). Currently no therapy for MPS IVA is available. We produced recombinant human (rh)GALNS as a potential enzyme replacement therapy for MPS IVA. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably overexpressing GALNS and sulfatase modifying factor-1 were used to produce active (∼2 U/mg) and pure (≥97%) rhGALNS. The recombinant enzyme was phosphorylated and was dose-dependently taken up by mannose-6-phosphate receptor (Kuptake = 2.5 nM), thereby restoring enzyme activity in MPS IVA fibroblasts. In the absence of an animal model with a skeletal phenotype, we established chondrocytes isolated from two MPS IVA patients as a disease model in vitro. MPS IVA chondrocyte GALNS activity was not detectable and the cells exhibited KS storage up to 11-fold higher than unaffected chondrocytes. MPS IVA chondrocytes internalized rhGALNS into lysosomes, resulting in normalization of enzyme activity and decrease in KS storage. rhGALNS treatment also modulated gene expression, increasing expression of chondrogenic genes Collagen II, Collagen X, Aggrecan and Sox9 and decreasing abnormal expression of Collagen I. Intravenous administration of rhGALNS resulted in biodistribution throughout all layers of the heart valve and the entire thickness of the growth plate in wild-type mice. We show that enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human GALNS results in clearance of keratan sulfate accumulation, and that such treatment ameliorates aberrant gene expression in human chondrocytes in vitro. Penetration of the therapeutic enzyme throughout poorly vascularized, but clinically relevant tissues, including growth plate cartilage and heart valve, as well as macrophages and hepatocytes in wild-type mouse, further supports development of rhGALNS as enzyme replacement therapy for MPS IVA."
https://openalex.org/W2081603294,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are extremely potent toxins that are capable of causing respiratory failure leading to long-term intensive care or death. The best treatment for botulism includes serotype-specific antitoxins, which are most effective when administered early in the course of the intoxication. Early confirmation of human exposure to any serotype of BoNT is an important public health goal. In previous work, we focused on developing Endopep-MS, a mass spectrometry-based endopeptidase method for detecting and differentiating the seven serotypes (BoNT/A-G) in buffer and BoNT/A, /B, /E, and /F (the four serotypes that commonly affect humans) in clinical samples. We have previously reported the success of antibody-capture to purify and concentrate BoNTs from complex matrices, such as clinical samples. However, to check for any one of the four serotypes of BoNT/A, /B, /E, or /F, each sample is split into 4 aliquots, and tested for the specific serotypes separately. The discovery of a unique monoclonal antibody that recognizes all four serotypes of BoNT/A, /B, /E and /F allows us to perform simultaneous detection of all of them. When applied in conjunction with the Endopep-MS assay, the detection limit for each serotype of BoNT with this multi-specific monoclonal antibody is similar to that obtained when using other serotype-specific antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2137558208,"Background Elevated serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E is a diagnostic marker of immediate-type allergic reactions. We hypothesize that serum IgE does not necessarily reflect total body IgE because in vivo IgE can be bound to cell surface receptors such as FcεRI and FcεRII (CD23). The aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between levels of serum IgE, cell-bound IgE, and IgE-receptors on peripheral blood cells in a pediatric population. Methodology Whole blood samples from 48 children (26 boys, 22 girls, mean age 10,3±5,4 years) were analyzed by flow cytometry for FcεRI, CD23, and cell-bound IgE on dendritic cells (CD11c+MHC class II+), monocytes (CD14+), basophils (CD123+MHC class II-) and neutrophils (myeloperoxidase+). Total serum IgE was measured by ELISA and converted into z-units to account for age-dependent normal ranges. Correlations were calculated using Spearman rank correlation test. Principal Findings Dendritic cells, monocytes, basophils, and neutrophils expressed the high affinity IgE-receptor FcεRI. Dendritic cells and monocytes also expressed the low affinity receptor CD23. The majority of IgE-receptor positive cells carried IgE on their surface. Expression of both IgE receptors was tightly correlated with cell-bound IgE. In general, cell-bound IgE on FcεRI+ cells correlated well with serum IgE. However, some patients carried high amounts of cell-bound IgE despite low total serum IgE levels. Conclusion/Significance In pediatric patients, levels of age-adjusted serum IgE, cell-bound IgE, and FcεRI correlate. Even in the absence of elevated levels of serum IgE, cell-bound IgE can be detected on peripheral blood cells in a subgroup of patients."

If an ICP0(-) mutant of herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) exhibited similar properties, such a virus might be used to vaccinate against genital herpes. The current study was initiated to explore this possibility. Several HSV-2 ICP0(-) mutant viruses were constructed and evaluated in terms of three parameters: i. interferon-sensitivity; ii. virulence in mice; and iii. capacity to elicit protective immunity against HSV-2. One ICP0(-) mutant virus in particular, HSV-2 0DeltaNLS, achieved an optimal balance between avirulence and immunogenicity. HSV-2 0DeltaNLS was interferon-sensitive in cultured cells. HSV-2 0DeltaNLS replicated to low levels in the eyes of inoculated mice, but was rapidly repressed by an innate, Stat 1-dependent host immune response. HSV-2 0DeltaNLS failed to spread from sites of inoculation, and hence produced only inapparent infections. Mice inoculated with HSV-2 0DeltaNLS consistently mounted an HSV-specific IgG antibody response, and were consistently protected against lethal challenge with wild-type HSV-2. Based on their avirulence and immunogenicity, we propose that HSV-2 ICP0(-) mutant viruses merit consideration for their potential to prevent the spread of HSV-2 and genital herpes."
https://openalex.org/W1978592443,"The Slit-Robo GTPase-activating proteins (srGAPs) are critical for neuronal migration through inactivation of Rho GTPases Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA. Here we report that srGAP2 physically interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). srGAP2 localizes to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane protrusion. srGAP2 knockdown reduces cell adhesion spreading and increases cell migration, but has no effect on cell proliferation. PRMT5 binds to the N terminus of srGAP2 (225-538 aa) and methylates its C-terminal arginine residue Arg-927. The methylation mutant srGAP2-R927A fails to rescue the cell spreading rate, is unable to localize to the plasma membrane leading edge, and perturbs srGAP2 homodimer formation mediated by the F-BAR domain. These results suggest that srGAP2 arginine methylation plays important roles in cell spreading and cell migration through influencing membrane protrusion."
https://openalex.org/W1993358333,"Background The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome encodes two peptide transporters encoded by Rv3665c-Rv3662c and Rv1280c-Rv1283c. Both belong to the family of ABC transporters containing two nucleotide-binding subunits, two integral membrane proteins and one substrate-binding polypeptide. However, little is known about their functions in M. tuberculosis. Here we report functional characterization of the Rv1280c-Rv1283c-encoded transporter and its substrate-binding polypeptide OppAMTB. Methodology/Principal Findings OppAMTB was capable of binding the tripeptide glutathione and the nonapeptide bradykinin, indicative of a somewhat broad substrate specificity. Amino acid residues G109, N110, N230, D494 and F496, situated at the interface between domains I and III of OppA, were required for optimal peptide binding. Complementaton of an oppA knockout mutant of M. smegmatis with OppAMTB confirmed the role of this transporter in importing glutathione and the importance of the aforesaid amino acid residues in peptide transport. Interestingly, this transporter regulated the ability of M. tuberculosis to lower glutathione levels in infected compared to uninfected macrophages. This ability was partly offset by inactivation of oppD. Concomitantly, inactivation of oppD was associated with lowered levels of methyl glyoxal in infected macrophages and reduced apoptosis-inducing ability of the mutant. The ability to induce the production of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α was also compromised after inactivation of oppD. Conclusions Taken together, these studies uncover the novel observations that this peptide transporter modulates the innate immune response of macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis."

Little is known on the effects of sound cues on visually-guided hand movements.We recorded the sound produced by the fingers upon contact as participants grasped stimulus objects which were covered with different materials. Then, in a further session the pre-recorded contact sounds were delivered to participants via headphones before or following the initiation of reach-to-grasp movements towards the stimulus objects. Reach-to-grasp movement kinematics were measured under the following conditions: (i) congruent, in which the presented contact sound and the contact sound elicited by the to-be-grasped stimulus corresponded; (ii) incongruent, in which the presented contact sound was different to that generated by the stimulus upon contact; (iii) control, in which a synthetic sound, not associated with a real event, was presented. Facilitation effects were found for congruent trials; interference effects were found for incongruent trials. In a second experiment, the upper and the lower parts of the stimulus were covered with different materials. The presented sound was always congruent with the material covering either the upper or the lower half of the stimulus. Participants consistently placed their fingers on the half of the stimulus that corresponded to the presented contact sound.Altogether these findings offer a substantial contribution to the current debate about the type of object representations elicited by auditory stimuli and on the multisensory nature of the sensorimotor transformations underlying action."
https://openalex.org/W2036189836,"Background Chemoresistance is the principal reason for poor survival and disease recurrence in osteosarcoma patients. Inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase type II (IMPDH2) encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis and has been linked to cell growth, differentiation, and malignant transformation. In a previous study we identified IMPDH2 as an independent prognostic factor and observed frequent IMPDH2 overexpression in osteosarcoma patients with poor response to chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to provide evidence for direct involvement of IMPDH2 in the development of chemoresistance. Methodology/Principal Findings Stable cell lines overexpressing IMPDH2 and IMPDH2 knock-down cells were generated using the osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 as parental cell line. Chemosensitivity, proliferation, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins were analyzed by flow cytometry, WST-1-assay, and western blot analysis. Overexpression of IMPDH2 in Saos-2 cells induced strong chemoresistance against cisplatin and methotrexate. The observed chemoresistance was mediated at least in part by increased expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and XIAP, reduced activation of caspase-9, and, consequently, reduced cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP. Pharmacological inhibition of IMPDH induced a moderate reduction of cell viability and a strong decrease of cell proliferation, but no increase in chemosensitivity. However, chemoresistant IMPDH2-overexpressing cells could be resensitized by RNA interference-mediated downregulation of IMPDH2. Conclusions IMPDH2 is directly involved in the development of chemoresistance in osteosarcoma cells, suggesting that targeting of IMPDH2 by RNAi or more effective pharmacological inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy might be a promising means of overcoming chemoresistance in osteosarcomas with high IMPDH2 expression."

We surmise that hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) within the intervillous space due to abnormal placentation is the mechanism and hypothesize that concomitant administration of aforementioned vitamin antioxidants detrimentally affects trophoblast cells during HR.Using villous explants, concomitant administration of 50 microM of vitamins C and E was observed to reduce apoptotic and autophagic changes in the trophoblast layer at normoxia (8% oxygen) but to cause more prominent apoptosis and autophagy during HR. Furthermore, increased levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in association with a decrease in the autophagy-related protein LC3-II were noted in cytotrophoblastic cells treated with vitamins C and E under standard culture conditions. In contrast, vitamin treatment decreased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as well as increased mitochondrial Bak and cytosolic LC3-II in cytotrophoblasts subjected to HR.Our results indicate that concomitant administration of vitamins C and E has differential effects on the changes of apoptosis, autophagy and the expression of Bcl-2 family of proteins in the trophoblasts between normoxia and HR. These changes may probably lead to the impairment of placental function and suboptimal growth of the fetus."

It is important to determine the costs associated with IPTc delivery via community based volunteers and also the potential savings to health care providers and caretakers due to malaria episodes averted as a consequence of IPTc.Two thousand four hundred and fifty-one children aged 3-59 months were randomly allocated to four groups to receive: three days of artesunate plus amodiaquine (AS+AQ) monthly, three days of AS+AQ bimonthly, one dose of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) bi-monthly or placebo. This paper focuses on incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the three IPTc drug regimens as delivered by community based volunteers (CBV) in Hohoe, Ghana compared to current practice, i.e. case management in the absence of IPTc. Financial and economic costs from the publicly funded health system perspective are presented. Treatment costs borne by patients and their caretakers are also estimated to present societal costs. The costs and effects of IPTc during the intervention period were considered with and without a one year follow up. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for uncertainty.Economic costs per child receiving at least the first dose of each course of IPTc show SP bimonthly, at US$8.19, is the cheapest to deliver, followed by AS+AQ bimonthly at US$10.67 and then by AS+AQ monthly at US$14.79. Training, drug delivery and supervision accounted for approximately 20-30% each of total unit costs. During the intervention period AS & AQ monthly was the most cost effective IPTc drug regimen at US$67.77 (61.71-74.75, CI 95%) per malaria case averted based on intervention costs only, US$64.93 (58.92-71.92, CI 95%) per malaria case averted once the provider cost savings are included and US$61.00 (54.98, 67.99, CI 95%) when direct household cost savings are also taken into account. SP bimonthly was US$105.35 (75.01-157.31, CI 95%) and AS & AQ bimonthly US$211.80 (127.05-399.14, CI 95%) per malaria case averted based on intervention costs only. The incidence of malaria in the post intervention period was higher in children who were <1 year old when they received AS+AQ monthly compared to the placebo group leading to higher cost effectiveness ratios when one year follow up is included. The cost per child enrolled fell considerably when modelled to district level as compared to those encountered under trial conditions.We demonstrate how cost-effective IPTc is using three different drug regimens and the possibilities for reducing costs further if the intervention was to be scaled up to the district level. The need for effective training, drug delivery channels and supervision to support a strong network of community based volunteers is emphasised."
https://openalex.org/W1997601431,"Human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is a key DNA repair enzyme involved in both base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide incision repair (NIR) pathways. In the BER pathway, APE1 cleaves DNA at AP sites and 3'-blocking moieties generated by DNA glycosylases. In the NIR pathway, APE1 incises DNA 5' to a number of oxidatively damaged bases. At present, physiological relevance of the NIR pathway is fairly well established in E. coli, but has yet to be elucidated in human cells.We identified amino acid residues in the APE1 protein that affect its function in either the BER or NIR pathway. Biochemical characterization of APE1 carrying single K98A, R185A, D308A and double K98A/R185A amino acid substitutions revealed that all mutants exhibited greatly reduced NIR and 3'-->5' exonuclease activities, but were capable of performing BER functions to some extent. Expression of the APE1 mutants deficient in the NIR and exonuclease activities reduced the sensitivity of AP endonuclease-deficient E. coli xth nfo strain to an alkylating agent, methylmethanesulfonate, suggesting that our APE1 mutants are able to repair AP sites. Finally, the human NIR pathway was fully reconstituted in vitro using the purified APE1, human flap endonuclease 1, DNA polymerase beta and DNA ligase I proteins, thus establishing the minimal set of proteins required for a functional NIR pathway in human cells.Taken together, these data further substantiate the role of NIR as a distinct and separable function of APE1 that is essential for processing of potentially lethal oxidative DNA lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1964308902,"Cells in mechanically active tissues undergo constant plasma membrane damage that must be repaired to allow survival. To identify wound-associated proteins, a cell-impermeant, thiol-reactive biotinylation reagent was used to label and subsequently isolate intracellular proteins that become exposed on the surface of cultured cells after plasma membrane damage induced by scraping from substratum or crushing with glass beads. Scrape-damaged cells survived injury and were capable of forming viable colonies. Proteins that were exposed to the cell surface were degraded or internalized a few seconds to several minutes after damage, except for vimentin, which was detectable on the cell surface for at least an hour after injury. Seven major biotinylated protein bands were identified on SDS-PAGE gels. Mass spectrometric studies identified cytoskeletal proteins (caldesmon-1 and vimentin), endoplasmic reticulum proteins (ERp57, ERp5, and HSP47), and nuclear proteins (lamin C, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F, and nucleophosmin-1) as major proteins exposed after injury. Although caldesmon was a major wound-associated protein in calpain small subunit knock-out fibroblasts, it was rapidly degraded in wild-type cells, probably by calpains. Lamin C exposure after wounding was most likely the consequence of nuclear envelope damage. These studies document major intracellular proteins associated with the cell surface of reversibly damaged somatic cells. The studies also show that externalization of some proteins reported to have physiologic or pathologic roles on the cell surface can occur in cells undergoing plasma membrane damage and subsequent repair."
https://openalex.org/W2080376890,"Genomic integrity is maintained by the coordinated interaction of many DNA damage response pathways, including checkpoints, DNA repair processes, and cell cycle restart. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the BRCA1 C-terminal domain-containing protein Rtt107/Esc4 is required for restart of DNA replication after successful repair of DNA damage and for cellular resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Rtt107 and its interaction partner Slx4 are phosphorylated during the initial phase of DNA damage response by the checkpoint kinases Mec1 and Tel1. Because the natural chromatin template plays an important role during the DNA damage response, we tested whether chromatin modifications affected the requirement for Rtt107 and Slx4 during DNA damage repair. Here, we report that the sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents of rtt107Δ and slx4Δ mutants was rescued by inactivation of the chromatin regulatory pathway leading to H3 K79 trimethylation. Further analysis revealed that lack of Dot1, the H3 K79 methyltransferase, led to activation of the translesion synthesis pathway, thereby allowing the survival in the presence of DNA damage. The DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Rtt107 and Slx4, which was mutually dependent, was not restored in the absence of Dot1. The antagonistic relationship between Rtt107 and Dot1 was specific for DNA damage-induced phenotypes, whereas the genomic instability caused by loss of Rtt107 was not rescued.

Moreover, rtt107Δ mutants have a chromosome instability phenotype and an increased incidence of Rad52 foci, indicative of homologous recombination occurring because of stalled DNA replication forks (15Alvaro D. Lisby M. Rothstein R. PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: e228Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 16Yuen K.W. Warren C.D. Chen O. Kwok T. Hieter P. Spencer F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3925-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Aside from these roles in genome integrity, Rtt107 functions to repress the mobility of Ty1 transposons and to establish silent chromatin (17Scholes D.T. Banerjee M. Bowen B. Curcio M.J. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Andrulis E.D. Zappulla D.C. Alexieva-Botcheva K. Evangelista C. Sternglanz R. Genetics. 2004; 166: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Rtt107 contains several BRCA1 C-terminal homology domains, which often serve as phospho-binding modules to recruit signaling complexes and repair factors to DNA damage-induced lesions (12Rouse J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1188-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Mohammad D.H. Yaffe M.B. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions during the DNA damage response, Rtt107 interacts with a number of DNA repair and recombination proteins (13Roberts T.M. Kobor M.S. Bastin-Shanower S.A. Ii M. Horte S.A. Gin J.W. Emili A. Rine J. Brill S.J. Brown G.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Roberts T.M.

DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Of these, the interaction of Rtt107 with the structure-specific endonuclease Slx4 is best characterized and indicative of a close functional relationship between the two proteins. Slx4 is required for Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of four (S/T)Q motifs in the C-terminal half of Rtt107 and, like Rtt107, facilitates resumption of DNA replication after DNA damage (12Rouse J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1188-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Roberts T.M. Kobor M.S. Bastin-Shanower S.A. Ii M. Horte S.A. Gin J.W. Emili A. Rine J. Brill S.J. Brown G.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition to the complex regulation of the DNA damage response by signaling cascades, chromatin structures in the cell also play many roles in regulating access to DNA during the repair process. One example of the emerging interface between chromatin and the DNA damage response pathways is the DNA damage-induced recruitment of Rtt107 to chromatin by the H3 K56 acetyltransferase Rtt109 and the cullin Rtt101 (20Roberts T.M. Zaidi I.W. Vaisica J.A. Peter M. Brown G.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There are many other chromatin modifications involved in the DNA damage response, such as the well studied H2A phosphorylation and H3 K79 methylation pathways (22van Attikum H. Gasser S.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). H2A S129 is phosphorylated by Mec1 in response to DNA damage, triggering the assembly of many repair proteins and chromatin modifiers acting at subsequent steps (22van Attikum H. Gasser S.M.

To allow resumption of the cell cycle and DNA replication after successful completion of DNA repair, H2A S129 needs to be dephosphorylated by either Pph3 or Glc7, depending on the exact nature of the initial damage (26Keogh M.C.

Dot1-mediated H3 K79 methylation, which is regulated by Bre1-mediated H2B K123 ubiquitination, is required for G1 and S phase checkpoints (28Dover J. Schneider J. Tawiah-Boateng M.A. Wood A. Dean K.

In part, this requirement is mediated through a functional linkage to the Rad9 adaptor protein (31Wysocki R. Javaheri A. Allard S. Sha F. Côté J. Kron S.J. Mol. Cell.

Several lines of evidence suggest that Dot1 plays an additional role in DNA repair pathways, such as nucleotide excision repair, sister chromatid recombination, and repair of ionizing radiation damage (34Chaudhuri S. Wyrick J.J. Smerdon M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1690-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Conde F. Refolio E. Cordón-Preciado V. Cortés-Ledesma F. Aragón L. Aguilera A.

In contrast, Dot1 negatively regulates the error-prone TLS pathway through an unknown mechanism, thereby allowing bypass of DNA replication blocks (7Conde F. San-Segundo P.A. Genetics. 2008; 179: 1197-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Aside from the function of Dot1 in DNA damage, it is also involved in gene silencing as well as differential H3 K79 methylation during the cell cycle (37Singer M.S. Kahana A. Wolf A.J. Meisinger L.L. Peterson S.E. Goggin C. Mahowald M. Gottschling D.E. Genetics. 1998; 150: 613-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Schulze J.M. Jackson J. Nakanishi S. Gardner J.M. Hentrich T. Haug J. Johnston M.

This study established a close connection between Rtt107 and the pathway resulting in a specific chromatin modification, H3 K79 trimethylation. Specifically, loss of H3 K79 trimethylation suppressed the DNA damage sensitivity of rtt107Δ and slx4Δ mutants. This suppression was not linked to restoration of Rtt107 or Slx4 phosphorylation but instead was dependent on the presence of a functional TLS pathway. Moreover, deletion of DOT1 partially suppressed the cell cycle delay and the defect in resuming DNA replication of rtt107Δ mutants during the recovery from MMS-induced DNA damage. In contrast, deletion of DOT1 rescued neither the chromosome instability phenotype nor the increased incidence of spontaneous Rad52 foci caused by loss of Rtt107. All yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1 and were created using standard yeast genetic techniques (39Amberg D.C. Burke D.J. Strathern J.N. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2005: 155-160Google Scholar). Complete gene deletions and integration of a triple FLAG tag at the 3′ end of genes (40Gelbart M.E. Rechsteiner T. Richmond T.J. Tsukiyama T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2098-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) were achieved using one-step gene integration of PCR-amplified modules (41Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd., A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar). Plasmid shuffling experiments were performed using 5-fluoroorotic acid as a counter-selecting agent for the URA3 plasmid (pRS316, HHT2-HHF2) and shuffling in plasmids containing histone H3 K79 mutations (pRS314, hht2-HHF2) (42Yang B. Britton J. Kirchmaier A.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 826-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Catalytically inactive Dot1 mutants were expressed from pRS315 plasmids (43van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), and a nonphosphorylatable mutant of Rtt107 (four Ser-Gln motifs substituted by Ala-Gln) was expressed from a plasmid (pRS315, rtt107–4AQ) that was a generous gift from Grant Brown and Tania Roberts (University of Toronto). BrdU-Incorporating (BrdU-Inc) wild-type and mutant strains containing constitutively expressed herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase and human equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1) were generated by genetic crosses with a previously published parental strain (44Viggiani C.J. Aparicio O.M. Yeast. 2006; 23: 1045-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures grown in YPD or SC-Leu at 30 °C were diluted to 0.3 A600. The cells were 10-fold serially diluted and spotted onto solid YPD plates or SC-Leu plates with MMS (Sigma) at various concentrations. The plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days. Overnight cultures were diluted to 0.3 A600, grown in YPD to 0.8 A600, and then treated with 0.03% MMS for 1 h. The FLAG-tagged Slx4 protein was extracted by an alkaline method using 0.2 m NaOH (45Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Slx4-FLAG proteins were visualized using anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Sigma) and SuperSignal-enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The procedure for analytical scale immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged Rtt107 protein was adapted from a previous report (46Kobor M.S. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Meneghini M.D. Gin J.W. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Madhani H.D. Rine J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E131Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were harvested and lysed in TAP-IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgAc, 0.15% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaPPi, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture) using acid-washed glass beads and mechanically disrupted using a bead beater (BioSpec Products). Rtt107-FLAG fusion proteins were captured using anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) and subsequently washed in TAP-IP buffer. Captured material was analyzed by protein blotting with anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor). Cells were prepared under the same conditions for flow cytometric analysis and BrdU incorporation experiment. For the latter, we used wild-type and mutant strains containing the BrdU-Inc cassette (44Viggiani C.J. Aparicio O.M. Yeast. 2006; 23: 1045-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to allow for BrdU uptake in yeast. Briefly, cells were arrested in G1 by addition of 2 μg/ml α-factor for 2 h at 30 °C in YPD, then washed with sterile 1× PBS, and resuspended in YPD containing 0.03% MMS for 1 h. MMS was removed by treating with 2% sodium thiosulfate and washing with sterile 1× PBS. The cells were resuspended in YPD and incubated at 30 °C during the recovery phase. For the BrdU incorporation experiment, 400 μg/ml of BrdU was added to the cultures during the recovery phase. Aliquots were removed at the indicated times and processed further for flow cytometric analysis or measurement of BrdU incorporation. For flow cytometric analysis, cells were collected in 70% ethanol with 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and prepared as described previously (47Haase S.B. Lew D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed using the BD FACSCalibur instrument and the Flow Jo software (Tree Star Inc., OR). For the BrdU incorporation experiments, cells were collected in buffer containing 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1% NaH3. Total genomic DNA was extracted by bead beating and use of the DNeasy kit (Qiagen) and sonicated using Bioruptor (Diagenode). The DNA concentration was adjusted to 20 ng/μl, then heat-denatured, and snap-cooled. 1 μg of DNA was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) pre-soaked with 2× SSC using the Convertible Filtration Manifold System (Invitrogen) and subjected to ultraviolet cross-linking in a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Subsequently, the membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TTBS, probed with an anti-BrdU antibody (GE Healthcare), and visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor). The procedure for the bimater assay was modified from a previous method to allow quantification (16Yuen K.W. Warren C.D. Chen O. Kwok T. Hieter P. Spencer F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3925-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, 12 independent colonies from each homozygous diploid strain were grown in YPD overnight at 30 °C and diluted to 2.0 A600. Cells were plated on to solid YPD at appropriate dilutions to determine the total number of cells. Equal volumes of MATa mating tester cultures (10.0 A600) and the homozygous diploid strain cultures (2.0 A600) were plated onto solid media containing no amino acids and incubated at 30 °C for 3–4 days. Mating rates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated with the Ma-Sandri-Sarkar Maximum Likelihood Estimator method using the on-line Fluctuation Analysis Calculator (48Hall B.M. Ma C.X. Liang P. Singh K.K. Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1564-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Nuclear morphology was determined by treating cells as for flow cytometric analysis, except α-factor incubation was omitted, and SC-complete medium was used to minimize autofluorescence. Aliquots were removed at the indicated times and treated with 4% formaldehyde solution (Sigma) for 10 min. Cells were immobilized on a glass slide with a solution of 1 mg/ml polylysine (Sigma) and then stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma). Cells with medium to large buds were counted as being in G2/M phase. Ambiguous cases where cells with separate nuclei were insufficiently spread were considered to be in G1 phase. To visualize Rad52-GFP foci, cells were grown at 30 °C in SC-complete medium to logarithmic phase and then immobilized on a glass slide with a solution of 1.0% agarose in double distilled H2O. Multiple images were obtained at 0.3-μm intervals along the z axis, and Rad52-GFP foci were counted by inspection of all focal planes. At least 300 cells were counted for each time point. All imaging was done with the Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope using the Metamorph software. Statistical significance was assessed using Student's t test. Forward mutation rates were measured by mutations at the CAN1 locus, which when mutated renders cells sensitive to canavanine (49Grenson M. Mousset M. Wiame J.M. Bechet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Cells from 12 independent colonies for each strain were grown in YPD to logarithmic phase; 0.005% MMS was added to half of each culture, and cells were further incubated at 30 °C for 20 h. Cells plated on SC-Arg were diluted 1:200,000, and cells plated on SC-Arg containing 50 μg/ml canavanine (Sigma) were diluted by a factor of 2. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days, and colonies were counted. The mutation rates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated with the Ma-Sandri-Sarkar Maximum Likelihood Estimator method using the on-line Fluctuation Analysis Calculator (48Hall B.M. Ma C.X. Liang P. Singh K.K. Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1564-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Rtt107 and its interaction partner Slx4 are required for yeast cells to survive exposure to DNA damage conditions, such as those caused by the alkylating agent MMS (13Roberts T.M. Kobor M.S. Bastin-Shanower S.A. Ii M. Horte S.A. Gin J.W. Emili A. Rine J. Brill S.J. Brown G.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Chang M. Bellaoui M. Boone C. Brown G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16934-16939Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Given the importance of the natural chromatin template during the DNA damage response, and the existing link between Rtt107 and the histone acetyltransferase Rtt109 (20Roberts T.M. Zaidi I.W. Vaisica J.A. Peter M. Brown G.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Giannattasio M. Lazzaro F. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9879-9886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 50Bassal S. El-Osta A. Hum. Mutat. 2005; 25: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that chromatin modifications might affect the requirement for Rtt107 and Slx4 during DNA damage repair. For this purpose, we created strains that, in addition to deletion of either RTT107 or SLX4, lacked genes encoding several chromatin modifiers with roles in the DNA damage response to test whether their absence enhanced or suppressed the sensitivity of rtt107Δ or slx4Δ mutants to MMS. Although the majority of double mutants grew equally well as rtt107Δ or slx4Δ mutants, we found that deletion of DOT1, a nonessential gene encoding a histone methyltransferase catalyzing mono-, di-, and trimethylation of histone H3 K79, almost completely rescued the MMS sensitivity of rtt107Δ and slx4Δ mutants (Fig. 1A). To determine whether this effect was dependent on the catalytic activity of Dot1, alleles encoding catalytically inactive Dot1 proteins were compared with the complete loss of Dot1 and with the presence of wild-type Dot1. The strains carrying dot1G401R and dot1G401A alleles, encoding for catalytically inactive forms of Dot1, suppressed the MMS sensitivity phenotype similar to the complete deletion (Fig. 1B). As expected, re-introducing wild-type DOT1 in rtt107Δdot1Δ double mutants restored MMS sensitivity to levels similar to that of rtt107Δ single mutants. These data suggested that eliminating the catalytic activity of Dot1 enabled cells lacking Rtt107 to survive otherwise detrimental conditions during exposure to MMS. The same results were obtained for slx4Δ mutants, except that slx4Δ mutants were less sensitive to MMS than rtt107Δ mutants (supplemental Fig. S1A). The only known target of Dot1 methyltransferase activity to date is the Lys-79 residue located in the core of histone H3, but formally it is possible that Dot1, similar to other chromatin modifiers, has other enzymatic targets not yet identified. To examine whether the suppression of the MMS sensitivity of rtt107Δ mutants by loss of Dot1 was due to lack of H3 K79 methylation, strains with mutated forms of H3 K79, which cannot be methylated, were tested for their ability to survive chronic MMS exposure in the absence of Rtt107. Changing lysine 79 to either alanine or arginine rescued the DNA damage sensitivity of the rtt107Δ mutants, analogous to the DOT1 deletion (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we concluded that the reversal of the MMS sensitivity of rtt107Δ mutants was due to the loss of Dot1-mediated H3 K79 methylation. Similarly, H3 K79A and H3 K79R mutants also suppressed the MMS sensitivity of the slx4Δ strain (supplemental Fig. S1B). Methylation of H3 K79 by Dot1 is regulated through cross-talk with another histone modification, mono-ubiquitination of H2B K123, which is catalyzed by the Bre1/Rad6 enzyme complex (28Dover J.

Thus, we wanted to test whether upstream regulators of H3 K79 methylation would have a similar effect on the MMS sensitivity of rtt107Δ and slx4Δ mutants. Indeed, deletion of BRE1 also rescued the MMS sensitivity of the strains lacking Rtt107 or Slx4 (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S1C). To learn more about the biochemical nature underlying the observed effects, we assessed the total levels of mono-, di-, or trimethylated H3 K79 in whole cell extracts. Interestingly, although Dot1 broadly catalyzes mono-, di-, and trimethylation of H3 K79 (43van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 54Ng H.H. Feng Q. Wang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Struhl K.

These results suggested that specifically a lack of H3 K79 trimethylation caused the suppression of the MMS sensitivity of rtt107Δ and slx4Δ mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1997241045,"Background The development of novel influenza vaccines inducing a broad immune response is an important objective. The aim of this study was to evaluate live vaccines which induce both strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against the novel human pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, and to show protection in a lethal animal challenge model. Methodology/Principal Findings For this purpose, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) strain (CA/07) were inserted into the replication-deficient modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus - a safe poxviral live vector – resulting in MVA-H1-Ca and MVA-N1-Ca vectors. These live vaccines, together with an inactivated whole virus vaccine, were assessed in a lung infection model using immune competent Balb/c mice, and in a lethal challenge model using severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice after passive serum transfer from immunized mice. Balb/c mice vaccinated with the MVA-H1-Ca virus or the inactivated vaccine were fully protected from lung infection after challenge with the influenza H1N1 wild-type strain, while the neuraminidase virus MVA-N1-Ca induced only partial protection. The live vaccines were already protective after a single dose and induced substantial amounts of neutralizing antibodies and of interferon-γ-secreting (IFN-γ) CD4- and CD8 T-cells in lungs and spleens. In the lungs, a rapid increase of HA-specific CD4- and CD8 T cells was observed in vaccinated mice shortly after challenge with influenza swine flu virus, which probably contributes to the strong inhibition of pulmonary viral replication observed. In addition, passive transfer of antisera raised in MVA-H1-Ca vaccinated immune-competent mice protected SCID mice from lethal challenge with the CA/07 wild-type virus.

In order to address the recent globalization of scientific research, we also focused on four key indicators of research activities: research and development (R&D) funding, total science and engineering doctoral degrees, patents, and scientific publications. We compared these indicators across three major population and economic regions: the US, the European Union (EU) and the People's Republic of China (China) over the past decade. We discovered a number of interesting trends with direct relevance for science policy. The level of US FRF has varied between 0.2% and 0.6% of the GDP during the last six decades. Since the 1960s, the US FRF contribution has fallen from twice that of industrial research funding to roughly equal. Also, in the last two decades, the portion of the US government R&D spending devoted to research has increased. Although well below the US and the EU in overall funding, the current growth rate for R&D funding in China greatly exceeds that of both. Finally, the EU currently produces more science and engineering doctoral graduates and scientific publications than the US in absolute terms, but not per capita. This study's aim is to facilitate a serious discussion of key questions by the research community and federal policy makers. In particular, our results raise two questions with respect to: a) the increasing globalization of science: ""What role is the US playing now, and what role will it play in the future of international science?""; and b) the ability to produce beneficial innovations for society: ""How will the US continue to foster its strengths?"""
https://openalex.org/W2045607430,"Most mammalian cell types depend on multiple Src family kinases (SFKs) to regulate diverse signaling pathways. Strict control of SFK activity is essential for normal cellular function, and loss of kinase regulation contributes to several forms of cancer and other diseases. Previous x-ray crystal structures of the SFKs c-Src and Hck revealed that intramolecular association of their Src homology (SH) 3 domains and SH2 kinase linker regions has a key role in down-regulation of kinase activity. However, the amino acid sequence of the Hck linker represents a suboptimal ligand for the isolated SH3 domain, suggesting that it may form the polyproline type II helical conformation required for SH3 docking only in the context of the intact structure. To test this hypothesis directly, we determined the crystal structure of a truncated Hck protein consisting of the SH2 and SH3 domains plus the linker. Despite the absence of the kinase domain, the structures and relative orientations of the SH2 and SH3 domains in this shorter protein were very similar to those observed in near full-length, down-regulated Hck. However, the SH2 kinase linker adopted a modified topology and failed to engage the SH3 domain. This new structure supports the idea that these noncatalytic regions work together as a ""conformational switch"" that modulates kinase activity in a manner unique to the SH3 domain and linker topologies present in the intact Hck protein. Our results also provide fresh structural insight into the facile induction of Hck activity by HIV-1 Nef and other Hck SH3 domain binding proteins and implicate the existence of innate conformational states unique to individual Src family members that ""fine-tune"" their sensitivities to activation by SH3-based ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2056150379,"Background The control of vascular tissue development in plants is influenced by diverse hormonal signals, but their interactions during this process are not well understood. Wild-type sterol profiles are essential for growth, tissue patterning and signalling processes in plant development, and are required for regulated vascular patterning. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we investigate the roles of sterols in vascular tissue development, through an analysis of the Arabidopsis mutants hydra1 and fackel/hydra2, which are defective in the enzymes sterol isomerase and sterol C-14 reductase respectively. We show that defective vascular patterning in the shoot is associated with ectopic cell divisions. Expression of the auxin-regulated AtHB8 homeobox gene is disrupted in mutant embryos and seedlings, associated with variably incomplete vascular strand formation and duplication of the longitudinal axis. Misexpression of the auxin reporter proIAA2∶GUS and mislocalization of PIN proteins occurs in the mutants. Introduction of the ethylene-insensitive ein2 mutation partially rescues defective cell division, localization of PIN proteins, and vascular strand development. Conclusions The results support a model in which sterols are required for correct auxin and ethylene crosstalk to regulate PIN localization, auxin distribution and AtHB8 expression, necessary for correct vascular development."
https://openalex.org/W2158183887,"A meta-cleavage pathway for the aerobic degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons is catalyzed by extradiol dioxygenases via a two-step mechanism: catechol substrate binding and dioxygen incorporation. The binding of substrate triggers the release of water, thereby opening a coordination site for molecular oxygen. The crystal structures of AkbC, a type I extradiol dioxygenase, and the enzyme substrate (3-methylcatechol) complex revealed the substrate binding process of extradiol dioxygenase. AkbC is composed of an N-domain and an active C-domain, which contains iron coordinated by a 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad motif. The C-domain includes a β-hairpin structure and a C-terminal tail. In substrate-bound AkbC, 3-methylcatechol interacts with the iron via a single hydroxyl group, which represents an intermediate stage in the substrate binding process. Structure-based mutagenesis revealed that the C-terminal tail and β-hairpin form part of the substrate binding pocket that is responsible for substrate specificity by blocking substrate entry. Once a substrate enters the active site, these structural elements also play a role in the correct positioning of the substrate.

Once a substrate enters the active site, these structural elements also play a role in the correct positioning of the substrate. Based on the results presented here, a putative substrate binding mechanism is proposed. A general comparison of the major pathways for the aerobic degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons in bacteria has revealed that the initial conversion steps are carried out by different enzymes, but that the compounds are transformed into a limited number of central intermediates, including (substituted) catechols (1Fritsche W. Hofrichter M. Environmental Biotechnology. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2005Google Scholar). These dihydroxylated intermediates are channeled into one of two possible pathways: an ortho-cleavage pathway or a meta-cleavage pathway (2Broderick J.B. Essays Biochem. 1999; 34: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The former pathway is catalyzed by intradiol dioxygenases, which utilize a non-heme ferric iron to cleave the aromatic ring ortho to the hydroxyl substituents, while the latter pathway is catalyzed by extradiol dioxygenases, which utilize a non-heme ferrous iron or other divalent metal ion to cleave the aromatic ring meta to the hydroxyl substituents. Additionally, it is generally understood that extradiol dioxygenase is more versatile than its intradiol counterpart (3Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 241-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Two decade-long research on the reaction mechanism of extradiol dioxygenases has revealed that the catalytic process occurs via a two-step mechanism: binding of catechol substrates and incorporation of the dioxygen atoms of molecular oxygen into the substrate (3Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 241-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 4Bugg T.D. Ramaswamy S. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Biochem. 2004; 135: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 1, the iron atom in the active site is coordinated by the so-called 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad motif (two histidines and one glutamate (or aspartate)), which occupies only one face of the coordination sphere. The opposite face is occupied by a displaceable water molecule and the hydroxyl oxygens of the catechol substrate. The binding of the substrate triggers the release of the water, thereby opening a coordination site for molecular oxygen, which is then apparently activated by an electron transferred from the substrate through the iron. Several conserved amino acid residues at the active site, including tyrosine and histidine, are known to play important roles in oxygen activation by deprotonating the substrate. Both substrate deprotonation and oxygen activation allow recombination to form an alkylperoxo intermediate, which then undergoes a Criegee rearrangement to yield a seven-membered lactone. The extradiol cleavage is completed as the lactone is hydrolyzed by the second oxygen atom of O2. Rhodococcus sp. strain DK17 is able to grow on various alkylbenzenes (o-xylene, toluene, ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, and n-propyl to n-hexylbenzenes) (8Kim D. Kim Y.S. Kim S.K. Kim S.W. Zylstra G.J. Kim Y.M. Kim E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 3270-3278Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We previously reported that a single extradiol dioxygenase (methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase encoded by akbC) is involved in alkylbenzene metabolism by DK17 (9Kim D. Chae J.C. Zylstra G.J. Kim Y.S.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Extradiol dioxygenases can be grouped into at least three evolutionarily independent families based on structure (3Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 241-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Type I extradiol dioxygenases, belonging to the vicinal oxygen chelate superfamily, include two-domain and one-domain enzymes. Type II extradiol dioxygenases include enzymes consisting of one or two different subunits. Type III extradiol dioxygenases belong to the cupin superfamily. Amino acid sequence comparisons of AkbC and other related enzymes indicate that AkbC belongs to the type I extradiol dioxygenase group, which is representatively exemplified by 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase (DHBD) 5The abbreviations used are: DHBD2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase3-MC3-methylcatecholDHB2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. from Burkholderia cepacia LB400. In fact, AkbC is closely related (e.g. 70% identity and 80% similarity) to DHBDs from Sphingomonas strains. Interestingly, however, despite high sequence conservation, including important residues for activity, AkbC is able to cleave 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (DHB) only at a significantly lower rate (e.g. 15% of that for 3-methylcatechol (3-MC)). Even more interesting is that 3-MC acts as a potent suicide inhibitor of the DHBD enzyme from B. cepacia LB400 (11Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that the DK17 AkbC and the DHBPs have critical differences in their substrate recognition properties. This hypothesis led us to investigate the structural basis of substrate binding and the underlying mechanism of AkbC catalysis. During the past two decades, much research has centered on elucidating the ring cleavage mechanism of extradiol dioxygenases, and many of its details have been well documented (5Lipscomb J.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12Bugg T.D. Tetrahedron. 2003; 59: 7075-7101Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In contrast, there has been little in-depth work examining the substrate binding process. Here, based on the crystal structure and functional studies of AkbC, we propose a substrate binding process for type I extradiol dioxygenases. 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. The akbC gene was amplified from DK17 genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with forward and reverse primers carrying NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites (5-CATGCCATGGCAAAAGTGACCG-3 and 5-CCGGAATTCTTATGCGGGGATGTCG-3), respectively. The thermocycler program used for PCR was as follows: 95 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles (95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1.5 min, 72 °C for 1 min), and 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was cloned into a pGST-parallel vector (13Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), a GST fusion protein expression vector containing a recombinant TEV protease (rTEV) cleavage site. Recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Transformants were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until an A600 between 0.6 and 0.8 was reached. After induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 2% ethanol, cultures were grown for a further 20 h at 18 °C. The expressed protein was purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), and subsequently digested with rTEV at 21 °C. After complete digestion, the GST tag was removed using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. The purified protein was then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and concentrated to 15 mg/ml using a vivaspin 20 (30,000 MWCO) for crystallization. The SeMet-substituted protein was expressed using the E. coli methionine auxotroph strain B834 in M9 medium supplemented with 50 mg/ml SeMet a 25 °C. The purification procedure for the SeMet-substituted protein was identical to that of the native protein. Crystallization of the purified protein was initially performed using commercially available, sparse-matrix screens (Hampton Research and Emerald Biostructures) and the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 21 °C. Crystals were observed after an overnight incubation in a drop containing 28% (v/v) PEG 400 and 0.2 m calcium chloride. After an optimization procedure, the best crystals were obtained under conditions of 30% (v/v) PEG 400 in 0.1 m HEPES pH 7.5 containing 0.2 m calcium chloride. SeMet-labeled AkbC was crystallized under the same conditions by the microseeding method using crushed native crystals as the crystal seeds. The crystals were grown to ∼0.2 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm of maximum size within several days. Before mounting, the crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution consisting of the crystallization solution and 10% glycerol. To obtain a substrate-bound complex, the crystallization solution containing 3-MC was added to the drop containing the native crystals and the cryoprotectant solution at a final concentration of 20 mg/ml. After a fluorescence scan, single anomalous x-ray dispersion data for a SeMet crystal were collected at a wavelength corresponding to the Se absorption peak (0.9796 Å) using an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD detector on the beam line 4A at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (Pohang, Korea). The data for native AkbC containing 3-MC were collected at Argonne Advanced Photon Source (Chicago, IL) at a wavelength of 1.0000 Å. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 package (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The SeMet crystal belongs to the space group P4 with unit cell parameters of a = b = 102.4 Å and c = 142.4 Å. There are four AkbC molecules in the asymmetric unit with a packing density of 2.74 Å3/Da, corresponding to an estimated solvent content of 55%. The native crystal containing 3-MC also belongs to a P4 space group and shows similar unit cell size to the SeMet crystal.

Open table in a new tab The structure of SeMet-substituted AkbC was determined by the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) method at a resolution of 2.2 Å. Twenty-nine Se atoms were identified in the asymmetric unit using SOLVE (15Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta. Crystallogr. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), and the initial phase had a figure of merit (FOM) of 0.252. Density modification and subsequent automated model building were performed with RESOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Acta. Crystallogr. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar), increasing FOM to 0.642 with 57% of the residues built. The initial RESOLVE model was used as a guide to build the remainder of the protein manually into density-modified electron density maps with the program COOT (17Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta. Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar). Refinement with isotropic displacement parameters was performed initially with Refmac5 in the CCP4 suite (18Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). Because AkbC crystals were revealed as twined crystals by analyzing the intensity statistics of the diffraction data, further refinement of the twined model was continued with a new version of the CCP4 Refmac5 program (Version 5.5.0088), which can handle the twining problem. Twining fraction of the AkbC crystal was 0.492. Atomic displacement parameters were refined in Refmac5 by the TLS (translation, libration, screw) method, with each of the four monomers in the asymmetric unit treated as a single TLS group. The Rwork and Rfree values of the refined structure were 0.155 and 0.178, respectively. The native AkbC structure was solved by molecular replacement using the refined model of the SeMet-AkbC with the program MOLREP (19Navaza J. Acta. Crytallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). The crystallographic data statistics are summarized in Table 1. The atomic coordinates and structure factor amplitudes of the SeMet proteins and the native protein-bound 3-MC were deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession codes 2WL3 and 2WL9, respectively. All mutagenesis was performed using PCR-based techniques. The same thermocycler program as described above was used, and PCR primers used in the experiments are listed in supplemental Table S1. The coding sequence of akbC was amplified by PCR using primers akbC-F and akbC-R with DK17 genomic DNA as a template. Site-directed substitution mutagenesis was performed at Tyr-175, Phe-177, His-244, Tyr-253, and Asp-281 via overlap extension PCR as described by Sakamoto et al. (20Sakamoto T. Joern J.M. Arisawa A. Arnold F.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 3882-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The two halves of akbC were amplified in two separate reactions: 1) using the akbC-F primer and either Y175-R, F177-R, H244-R, Y253-R, or D281-R primers to amplify the 5′ portion of the akbC gene and 2) using the akbC-R primer and either Y175-F, F177-F, H244-F, Y253-F, or D281-F primers to amplify the 3′ portion of the gene. One microliter of each reaction was combined for a second reaction using the akbC-F-akbC-R primer pair. The overlap-extension PCR technique was also employed to generate two deletion mutants of the β-hairpin structure (β11–β12). The first round of PCR was performed using the akbC-F primer and either Δβ-1-R or Δβ-2-R primers and the akbC-R primer and either Δβ-1-F or Δβ-2-F primers, followed by the second round of PCR using the akbC-F-akbC-R primer pair. Eight C-terminal truncation mutants were constructed by PCR with the akbC-F primer and either G291*-R, L294*-R, D295*-R, I296*-R, P297*-R, L298*-R, K299*-R, or G300*-R primers. The final PCR products were cloned using the pCRT7/CT-TOPO TA expression kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen) competent cells for propagation. The insertional orientation of the cloned fragment was confirmed by PCR, and the properly oriented clones were then sequenced for the confirmation of each mutation. Sequence-confirmed clones were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for expression. E. coli strains were grown on LB medium at 37 °C. Preculture of E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the akbC gene was prepared by inoculating three or four colonies into 4 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. All of the overnight culture was transferred to 200 ml LB supplemented with ampicillin and further incubated at 37 °C. To overexpress akbC in the E. coli host system, 1.0 mm (final concentration) IPTG was added when bacterial cells reached the exponential phase (A600 = 0.5–0.8). The incubation was prolonged at 37 °C for 2.5 h, and the induced cells were harvested and washed in one-half volume of 1× PBS (phosphate-buffered saline; 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm NaHPO4, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4)). Cells were chemically homogenized in Bugbuster Master Mix (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was used as the crude enzyme solution. The extradiol dioxygenase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically by measuring, at the corresponding wavelength, the increase in absorbance of each meta-cleavage product formed from the following substrates: 3-MC, λmax = 388 nm and ϵ = 13,800 cm−1 m−1 (21Bayly R.C. Dagley S. Gibson D.T. Biochem. J. 1966; 101: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); 2,3-DHB, λmax = 434 nm and ϵ = 22,000 cm−1 m−1 (22Furukawa K. Simon J.R. Chakrabarty A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1356-1362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and an appropriate substrate at a final concentration of 0.4 mm. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to form 1 μmol product per minute. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Substrates were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Korea. The crystal structure of selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted AkbC from Rhodococcus sp. strain DK17 was determined at a resolution of 2.2 Å (Table 1). A three-dimensional native structure of the enzyme-substrate (3-MC) complex was also determined at a resolution of 1.9 Å. In both structures, four AkbC molecules (A, B, C, and D) form the asymmetric unit. By the 4-fold rotational symmetry in the P4 space group, 16 AkbC molecules were arranged as two octameric complexes in a unit cell. Molecules A and B formed one octamer (supplemental Fig. S1), while molecules C and D completed the other octamer. Two molecules in each pair were related to each other by 2-fold symmetry in which the axis was perpendicular to the 4-fold symmetrical axis. Thus, an octameric complex is a stack of two ring structures composed of four subunits. The subunits in a ring structure are connected by hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions while a binding of two ring structures are maintained by hydrophobic interactions and ionic bonds. Because the conceptually calculated molecular weight of this complex matches that of the native AkbC protein in the solution, as estimated by gel filtration, one can reasonably speculate that AkbC exists in vivo as an octameric complex as assembled in the crystal structure. In addition, it is worth noting that all eight active sites face the surface of the octameric complex, although a large cavity (∼45-Å width at the center) exists inside the octameric globular complex with two large openings (∼23-Å diameter) at each end of the complex. In the native AkbC structure, residues from M1 to G300 were determined in molecule A (Fig. 2). No electron density for the last five residues of the C terminus (LDIPA) was visible, suggesting that this region is flexible. A monomeric AkbC molecule is composed of two topologically similar domains, an N-domain (residues Met-1—Gly-138) and a C-domain (Lys-139—Gly-300), including the C-terminal tail (His-285—Gly-300). Each domain contains two similar sequence motifs (β-α-β-β-β) joined together by a loop to make an eight-stranded mixed β-sheet with α-helices at each end. The two motifs are positioned as an inverted mirror image to each other. In the C-domain, two long loops that connect strands β18 and β19 and strands β16 and β17, respectively, are positioned between the two end strands (β10 and β16) of the C-domain β-sheet, and thereby cover the bottom side of the C-domain half-barrel to complete a bowl structure. A β-hairpin structure (β11–β12) is inserted between strands β10 and β13 in the C-domain, while in the N-domain, a helix (α3) is incorporated between the corresponding strands β6 and β7, covering the open side of the N-domain half-barrel. The C-terminal tail region (in blue) is antiparallel to strand β16 and makes a turn to come back to strand β11 (Fig. 2C). The C-terminal tail and inserted β-hairpin motif of β11–β12 cover the open side of the C-domain bowl structure whose inside forms the substrate binding site. The hydrophobic side chain of Leu-298 is in close contact with Phe-177 from the β-hairpin structure and with Leu-239 from the β18 strand. Together with Leu-294 and Ile-296, these C-terminal hydrophobic residues contribute to the hydrophobic environment of the substrate binding site. The crystal structure clearly shows that AkbC possesses the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad motif for iron binding at the active site (His-149, His-212, and Glu-263), which resides in the C-domain (Fig. 3). However, an additional amino acid residue (Tyr-253) is apparently involved in binding the iron, as indicated by the short distance (2.79–2.95 Å) from the hydroxyl oxygen atom of Tyr-253 to the iron. This tyrosine is also conserved in DHBDs from Pseudomonas sp. strain KKS102 and B. xenovorans strain LB400 at equivalent positions, but they are not close enough to coordinate the iron (3.7–3.9 Å and 3.8–3.9 Å for the KKS102 and the LB400 DHBDs, respectively). Thus, to determine whether Tyr-253 of AkbC is dispensable for iron binding in AkbC, we introduced a point mutation by substituting a phenylalanine for Tyr-253 and found that the mutant enzyme Y253F possesses ∼15% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme. This result shows that the iron can still function without binding to Tyr-253, suggesting that Tyr-253 could retract from the iron. In general, in type I extradiol dioxygenases, this conserved tyrosine is known to be involved in the deprotonation of the hydroxyl group of a substrate (23Sato N. Uragami Y. Nishizaki T. Takahashi Y. Sazaki G. Sugimoto K. Nonaka T. Masai E. Fukuda M. Senda T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 621-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Vaillancourt F.H. Barbosa C.J. Spiro T.G. Bolin J.T. Blades M.W. Turner R.F. Eltis L.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that a water molecule can functionally replace the tyrosine (25Siegbahn P.E. Haeffner F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8919-8932Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). One can thus speculate that Tyr-253 contributes to the deprotonation of the substrate hydroxyl group. Catalysis of ring cleavage by extradiol dioxygenases is accomplished primarily through an acid-base catalysis mechanism, in which suitably positioned histidine residues in the second shell of the iron (i.e. His-197 and His-244 in AkbC) play important roles (26Bugg T.D. Bioorg. Chem. 2004; 32: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In fact, in AkbC, there is a hydrogen bond network from the carboxyl group of Asp-281 to the hydroxyl group of Tyr-253 via the imidazole ring of His-244. Subsequently, seven mutant enzymes (H197F, H197I, H244L, H244N, H244Q, D281S, and D281V) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Since all seven mutant enzymes were found to completely lose their activities, these residues were deemed essential for enzyme activity, possibly as acid/base catalysts, although the possibility cannot be excluded that the loss of activity results simply from iron loss. To address this issue, attempts were made to measure iron contents in the wild-type and selected mutant (H197F, H244N, and D281S) enzymes. Atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis revealed that the mutant enzymes contain approximately half as much iron as the wild-type one. Our previous molecular modeling studies suggested that the overall structure of AkbC is similar to those of DHBDs from KKS102 and LB400 except that AkbC has a longer C-terminal tail and shorter α4 helix and β18–β19 loop than the other two enzymes (10Kim D. Chae J.C. Jang J.Y. Zylstra G.J. Kim Y.M. Kang B.S. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Indeed, the room mean square deviation values of the Cα atoms of AkbC to the KKS102 and LB400 DHBDs were determined to be 1.02 and 1.14 Å, respectively. Superimposition of the active site of AkbC on those of the KKS102 and LB400 DHBDs revealed that 1) residues surrounding the active site of AkbC are primarily located in the conserved regions and 2) the size and shape of the substrate binding cavity of AkbC are similar to those of the other two enzymes (supplemental Fig. S2). Because these results mean that the substrate binding site of AkbC can accommodate a bulky substrate DHB, the question is why AkbC shows a much lower activity against DHB than 3-MC. As explained above, the C-terminal tail (His-285—Gly-300) was determined to be positioned over the substrate binding pocket. Considering that the C-terminal regions of DHBDs from KKS102 and LB400 are relatively short compared with that from AkbC and some C-terminal residues were not visible in their previously determined structures, it is possible that this topography results in a smaller entrance to the active site in AkbC compared with the DHBDs (Fig. 4). To address this hypothesis, a series of truncated mutants were generated by introducing stop codons at various positions after residue Gly-291, which is the hinge of the C-terminal tail (Fig. 2B). We first truncated five residues (LDIPA) from the C-terminal end, which is invisible in the crystal structure of AkbC. Interestingly, the G300* mutation caused an approximate 9- and 7-fold increase in the activity of AkbC against DHB and 3-MC respectively, and as a result there is an increase in the preference of AkbC for DHB (Fig. 5). It is even more interesting to see that further sequential deletions (K299*, L298*, P297*, I296*, D295*, L294*, and G291*) lead to a dramatic change in the enzyme activity profile because these mutant AkbC enzymes show maximal activity against DHB. This finding suggests that the C-terminal tail determines the substrate specificity of AkbC by restricting the access of large substrates, such as DHB, to the active site.FIGURE 5Comparison of enzyme activities of wild-type AkbC and its truncated mutant enzymes.

Recent studies have identified the presence of new HIV-1 recombinants in Hong Kong and their complexity continues to increase. This study aims to characterize the HIV-1 genetic diversity in Hong Kong. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by using HIV-1 pol sequences including protease and partial reverse transcriptase isolated from 1045 local patients in Hong Kong from 2003 to 2008. For the pol sequences with unassigned genotype, the evidence of recombination was determined by using sliding-window based bootscan plots and their env C2V3 region were also sequenced. Epidemiological background of these patients was further collected. The pol phylogenetic analyses highlighted the extent of HIV-1 genetic diversity in Hong Kong. Subtype B (450/1045; 43.1%) and CRF01_AE (469/1045; 44.9%) variants were clearly predominant. Other genotypes (126/1045; 12.1%) including 3 defined subtypes, 10 CRFs, 1 unassigned subtype and 33 recombinants with 11 different mosaic patterns were observed. Recombinants of subtype B and CRF01_AE were mainly found among local Chinese MSM throughout 2004 to 2008, while the CRF02_AG and subtype G recombinants were circulating among non-Chinese Asian population in Hong Kong through heterosexual transmission starting from 2008. Our study demonstrated the complex recombination of HIV-1 in Hong Kong and the need in developing surveillance system for tracking the distribution of new HIV-1 genetic variants."
https://openalex.org/W2020617840,"Background Leptin, a cytokine-like protein, plays an important role in the regulation of body weight through inhibition of food intake and stimulation of energy expenditure. Leptin circulates in blood and acts on the brain, which sends downstream signals to regulate body weight. Leptin therapy has been successful in treating leptin deficient obese patients. However, high levels of leptin have been observed in more common forms of obesity indicating a state of leptin resistance which limits the application of leptin in the treatment of obesity. If the central effect of leptin could be by-passed and genes which respond to leptin treatment could be regulated directly, new therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity may be possible. The purpose of this study was to identify genes and subsequent pathways correlated with leptin-mediated weight loss. Methodology/Principal Findings We utilized microarray technology to compare hepatic gene expression changes after two types of leptin administration: one involving a direct stimulatory effect when administered peripherally (subcutaneous: SQ) and another that is indirect, involving a hypothalamic relay that suppresses food intake when leptin is administered centrally (intracerebroventricular: ICV). We identified 214 genes that correlate with leptin mediated weight loss. Several biological processes such as mitochondrial metabolic pathways, lipid metabolic and catabolic processes, lipid biosynthetic processes, carboxylic acid metabolic processes, iron ion binding and glutathione S-transferases were downregulated after leptin administration. In contrast, genes involved in the immune system inflammatory response and lysosomal activity were found to be upregulated. Among the cellular compartments mitochondrion (32 genes), endoplasmic reticulum (22 genes) and vacuole (8 genes) were significantly over represented. Conclusions/Significance In this study we have identified key molecular pathways and downstream genes which respond to leptin treatment and are involved in leptin-mediated weight loss. Many of these genes have previously been shown to be associated with obesity; however, we have also identified a number of other novel target genes. Further investigation will be required to assess the possible use of these genes and their associated protein products as therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity."

https://openalex.org/W2024259821,"In polygynous mating systems, males often increase their fecundity via aggressive defense of mates and/or resources necessary for successful mating. Here we show that both male and female reproductive behavior during the breeding season (June-August) affect female fecundity, a vital rate that is an important determinant of population growth rate and viability. By using 4 years of data on behavior and demography of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), we found that male behavior and spatial dynamics--aggression and territory size--are significantly related to female fecundity. Higher rates of male aggression and larger territory sizes were associated with lower estimates of female fecundity within the same year. Female aggression was significantly and positively related to fecundity both within the same year as the behavior was measured and in the following year. These results indicate that while male aggression and defense of territories may increase male fecundity, such interactions may cause a reduction in the overall population growth rate by lowering female fecundity. Females may attempt to offset male-related reductions in female fecundity by increasing their own aggression-perhaps to defend pups from incidental injury or mortality. Thus in polygynous mating systems, male aggression may increase male fitness at the cost of female fitness and overall population viability."
https://openalex.org/W2073749797,"Background Studies have shown that Notch is essential for the maintenance of a T cell Th2 phenotype in vivo. It has also been shown that Notch ligands have diverse functions during T cell activation. We chose to investigate the role of Notch ligands during the Th2 response. Principal Findings We studied the relationship of two Notch ligands, delta-like 4 and jagged-1, to T cell proliferation in C57 Bl/6 mice. Our findings indicate that jagged-1 does not affect the rate of T cell proliferation in any subset examined. However, delta-like 4 causes an increase in the expansion of Th2 memory cells and a decrease in effector cell proliferation. Our in vivo studies indicate that the Notch system is dynamically regulated, and that blocking one Notch ligand increases the effective concentration of other Notch ligands, thus altering the response. Examination of genes related to the Notch pathway revealed that the Notch receptors were increased in memory T cells. Expression of BMI1, a gene involved in T cell proliferation, was also higher in memory T cells. Further experiments demonstrated that Notch directly regulates the expression of the BMI1 gene in T cells and may govern T cell proliferation through this pathway. Conclusions From these experiments we can make several novel conclusions about the role of Notch ligands in T cell biology. The first is that delta-like 4 suppresses effector cell proliferation and enhances Th2 memory cell proliferation. The second is that blocking one Notch ligand in vivo effectively increases the concentration of other Notch ligands, which can then alter the response."

SHIP1 can be phosphorylated by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), resulting in an increase in SHIP1 activity (Zhang, J., Walk, S. F., Ravichandran, K. S., and Garrison, J. C. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 20070–20078). Using a combination of approaches, we identified the serine residue regulating SHIP1 activity. After mass spectrometric identification of 17 serine and threonine residues on SHIP1 as being phosphorylated by PKA in vitro, studies with truncation mutants of SHIP1 narrowed the phosphorylation site to the catalytic region between residues 400 and 866. Of the two candidate phosphorylation sites located in this region (Ser440 and Ser774), only mutation of Ser440 to Ala abolished the ability of PKA to phosphorylate the purified, catalytic domain of SHIP1 (residues 401–866). Mutation of Ser440 to Ala in full-length SHIP1 abrogated the ability of PKA to increase the activity of SHIP1 in mammalian cells. Using flow cytometry, we found that the PKA activator, Sp-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate triethylammonium salt hydrate (Sp-cAMPS) blunted the phosphorylation of Akt downstream of B cell antigen receptor engagement in SHIP1-null DT40 B lymphocytes expressing native mouse SHIP1.

Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 is produced in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane by a family of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases that are activated by receptor tyrosine kinases or G protein-coupled receptors (2Okkenhaug K. Vanhaesebroeck B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 localized at the plasma membrane forms a docking site to attract and regulate downstream signaling molecules containing pleckstrin homology domains, such as the serine kinase, Akt (PKB), that has an essential role in stimulating cell proliferation, growth, survival, and metabolism (2Okkenhaug K. Vanhaesebroeck B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 3Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4596) Google Scholar). The level of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 in the membrane is opposed by two inositol lipid phosphatases, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) and SHIP (SH2 domain-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase) (4Sly L.M. Rauh M.J. Kalesnikoff J. Büchse T. Krystal G. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 1170-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). SHIP opposes the effects of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases by dephosphorylating the 5′-position on the inositol ring of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and producing phophatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (5Krystal G. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).There are two major members of the SHIP family, SHIP1 and SHIP2, that share a highly homologous catalytic region with less similarity in their C-terminal regions (6Sly L.M. Ho V. Antignano F. Ruschmann J. Hamilton M. Lam V. Rauh M.J. Krystal G. Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 2836-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SHIP2 is widely expressed, whereas SHIP1 is only expressed in hematopoietic cells (7Backers K. Blero D. Paternotte N. Zhang J. Erneux C. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2003; 43: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). SHIP1 was originally identified based on its ability to bind to cytoplasmic adaptor proteins, such as Shc, Dab-1, and Dok-3 (8Liu L. Damen J.E. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6926-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). SHIP1 contains an N-terminal SH2 domain that leads to interactions with immune receptors, such as FcγRIIB and FcϵRI (9Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), a central inositol 5′-phosphatase domain, and two tyrosines within NPXY motifs in the C-terminal proline-rich region (10Harris S.J. Parry R.V. Westwick J. Ward S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2465-2469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Genetic manipulations of SHIP1 in mice have shown that SHIP1 plays important roles in functions of myeloid cells and B lymphocytes; for example, in mature neutrophils and mast cells, PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 levels and the phosphorylation of Akt activity are significantly elevated in the absence of SHIP1 (11Liu Q. Sasaki T. Kozieradzki I. Wakeham A. Itie A. Dumont D.J. Penninger J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Similarly, B lymphocytes lacking SHIP1 are insensitive to inhibitory signaling via the FcγRIIB receptor (9Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Moreover, SHIP1−/− mice have a decreased viability due to an increased infiltration of myeloid cells into the lungs, perhaps due to activation of migration pathways because of the elevated levels of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (12Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Rosten P. Grewal R. Sorensen P. Chappel S.M. Borowski A. Jirik F. Krystal G. Humphries R.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1610-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar).Due to its importance in hematopoietic cells, the activity of SHIP1 is tightly regulated. One model for regulation of SHIP1 function envisions translocation of SHIP1 from the cytosol to the membrane (13Giuriato S. Payrastre B. Drayer A.L. Plantavid M. Woscholski R. Parker P. Erneux C. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26857-26863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by growth factors, cytokine receptors, or specific signaling receptors on lymphocytes, SHIP1 is recruited via its N-terminal SH2 domain to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in receptor kinases and degrades the elevated levels of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 near the activated receptor (14Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19090-19097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was also reported that the catalytic activity of SHIP1 can be allosterically enhanced by the binding of its lipid product phophatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate or a small molecule to its C2 domain (15Ong C.J. Ming-Lum A. Nodwell M. Ghanipour A. Yang L. Williams D.E. Kim J. Demirjian L. Qasimi P. Ruschmann J. Cao L.P. Ma K. Chung S.W. Duronio V. Andersen R.J. Krystal G. Mui A.L.

SHIP1 has also been found to undergo phosphorylation on two tyrosine residues by tyrosine kinases (14Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Biol.

Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19090-19097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that SHIP1 can be phosphorylated and activated by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) both in vitro and in cells, highlighting a new mode of SHIP1 regulation (18Zhang J. Walk S.F. Ravichandran K.S. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20070-20078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Although the activation of SHIP1 by PKA is a potentially important regulatory event, the site(s) of phosphorylation within the SHIP1 molecule have not been identified. In the present study, through mass spectrometry and site-specific mutations, we identified and characterized the potential PKA-mediated phosphorylation sites within SHIP1. We also created SHIP1−/− DT40 cell lines stably expressing native and mutated SHIP1 molecules to evaluate the importance of selected phosphorylation sites in the regulation of SHIP1 by PKA. These results demonstrate that Ser440 within the catalytic region of the molecule is the site phosphorylated by PKA to activate SHIP1 and that the phosphorylation event is functionally relevant in B lymphocytes.DISCUSSIONThe two major isoforms of the SH2 domain containing phosphatidylinositol phosphatase, SHIP1 and SHIP2, are important enzymes that lower the level of the PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 signal (5Krystal G.

Because of the biological and therapeutic significance of SHIP1 (5Krystal G. Semin.

In the present study, we have identified and characterized the amino acid residues responsible for the regulation of SHIP1 by PKA. Using a combination of HPLC and MS/MS analysis of the purified protein phosphorylated in vitro by PKA, a phosphorylation map containing 17 potential phosphorylation sites was established for SHIP1. Further mutational analysis of full-length and truncation mutants of SHIP1 showed that Ser440 is the site phosphorylated by PKA that increases its activity.The initial step in determining which of the 17 serine or threonine residues might be important in the activation of SHIP1 was to measure the effect of PKA phosphorylation on three active but truncated SHIP1 proteins, designed to contain the known regulatory regions of the molecule. One protein contained the catalytic domain (residues 401–866) flanked by the N-terminal region (residues 1–866), another contained the catalytic domain flanked by the C-terminal region (residues 401–1190), and the third contained only the catalytic core of the protein (residues 401–866). All three truncated SHIP1 molecules were phosphorylated in vitro by PKA (Fig. 2A), but only the catalytic domain of the molecule (amino acid residues 401–866) was activated significantly by phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that this region is of primary importance for activation of SHIP1 by PKA. Using in vitro studies with pure proteins, cell-based approaches, and point mutations of potential serine residues, we identified Ser440 in the catalytic domain as the amino acid responsible for most of the functional activation of SHIP1 by PKA.This conclusion is based on six lines of evidence. First, the phosphopeptide containing Ser440 that was identified by mass spectrometry (TRDDSADYIPHDIYVIGTQEDPLGEK) harbors the RXX(S/T) consensus motif for phosphorylation by PKA (24Bruce J.I.

Gagnon C. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 10: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the KTRDDSAD sequence is conserved among all five known SHIP1 homologues in Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Xenopus laevis, and Salmo salar (Fig. 8). Second, mutation of Ser440 to Ala in the truncated, catalytic domain of the molecule (residues 401–866) abolished the phosphorylation of SHIP1 by PKA in vitro (Fig. 3B). Third, mutation of Ser440 to Ala in the full-length molecule (residues 1–1190) greatly reduced the ability of PKA to activate SHIP1 in vitro (Fig. 4A). Fourth, overexpression of the PKA catalytic subunit with the full-length wild type SHIP1 protein in HEK-293 cells results in an activated SHIP1 (Fig. 4B); the full-length protein containing an S440A point mutation is not activated in this protocol. Fifth, flow cytometry analysis demonstrates that transfection of a full-length S440A mutant protein into SHIP−/− DT40 cells yields a cell in which the phospho-Akt response is not inhibited by activation of PKA (Fig. 6D). This finding suggests that the phosphorylation of SHIP1 is a physiologically relevant process in hematopoietic cells. Finally, when SHIP−/− DT40 cells expressing the wild type SHIP1 protein are treated with Sp-cAMPS to activate PKA, the enzyme is activated. If a full-length S440A point mutation is expressed in the cells, treatment with Sp-cAMPS does not activate SHIP1 (Fig. 7). Taken together, these data identify Ser440 as the site in the molecule that is phosphorylated by PKA to activate SHIP1.The phosphorylation site identified, Ser440, is not in one of the domains in SHIP1 previously thought to be involved in its regulation (6Sly L.M. Ho V. Antignano F. Ruschmann J. Hamilton M. Lam V. Rauh M.J. Krystal G. Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 2836-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The major regulatory domains of SHIP1 include an SH2 domain in its N-terminal region, a C2 domain located at the C-terminal end of its phosphatase domain, and a C terminus containing a proline-rich region and two NPXY amino acid sequences. These domains have been shown to act as important docking sites for signaling molecules, adaptor proteins, allosteric ligands, and immunoreceptors (8Liu L. Damen J.E. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. Mol.

The proline-rich region of the C terminus of SHIP1 interacts with the SH3 domain of Grb2 or PLCγ following activation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing FcϵRI in RBL-2H3 cells (29Osborne M.A. Zenner G.

The two NPXY sequences, when phosphorylated following stimulation with antibodies, bind proteins such as Shc and Dok2, which have phosphotyrosine binding domains (17Lamkin T.D. Walk S.F. Liu L.

Biochem. 1997; 67: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). No phosphorylation or direct regulation of the central catalytic core (the 5′-phosphatase region itself) has been previously reported. The current model for SHIP1 regulation in various physiological situations is primarily based on the translocation of SHIP1 from the cytosol to the membrane following activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (growth factors, cytokine receptors, or immunoreceptors). In this translocation model, no significant change has been detected in the 5′-phosphatase activity of SHIP1 (13Giuriato S. Payrastre B. Drayer A.L. Plantavid M. Woscholski R. Parker P. Erneux C. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26857-26863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that SHIP1 activity can be regulated by PKA phosphorylation on Ser440 in the catalytic core and highlight a new mode of SHIP1 regulation.Although Ser440 may be a primary phosphorylation site involved in SHIP1 regulation, the possibility remains that other serine/threonine residues (Ser30, Ser36, Thr1091, Ser1113, and Ser1160) identified by mass spectrometry may also be involved in the overall regulation. As shown in Fig, 2B, two of the truncated constructs (mutants 401–1190 and 1–866) were not activated by phosphorylation with PKA despite the presence of Ser440. Perhaps more importantly, the SHIP1 molecule lacking its C terminus (truncation mutant 1–866) is activated about 8–10-fold (see Fig. 2B). In this regard, it is most interesting that truncation of the homologous SHIP2 molecule by removal of the C-terminal region (truncation mutant 1–822) has also been shown to activate the enzyme (27Prasad N.K. Werner M.E. Decker S.J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6285-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The finding that the C-terminal region of SHIP2 seems to inhibit its catalytic activity is very similar to our finding with an analogous mutant of SHIP1 (Fig. 2B). Thus, besides directly affecting the catalytic activity of the enzyme, Ser440 phosphorylation could direct a conformational change in the protein, which relieves an inhibitory effect of the molecule's C-terminal tail. The N terminus may also play a role in regulating the activity of SHIP1 (see Fig. 2B), but more information is needed to clarify this possibility. Taken together, the data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser440 initiates events that activate the catalytic domain and may also relieve an inhibitory constraint by the C terminus of the molecule.SHIP2 is a 142-kDa protein that contains a catalytic core structure similar to SHIP1 (7Backers K. Blero D. Paternotte N. Zhang J. Erneux C. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2003; 43: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Unlike the case with SHIP1, the phosphorylation of certain tyrosines in SHIP2 can enhance its 5′-phosphatase activity as measured in immunoprecipitates (27Prasad N.K. Werner M.E. Decker S.J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6285-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 31Batty I.H. van der Kaay J. Gray A. Telfer J.F. Dixon M.J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For example, if HeLa cells are transfected with SHIP2 and treated with EGF or H2O2, there is a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation state of SHIP2 and a 2-fold increase in the activity of the enzyme (27Prasad N.K. Werner M.E. Decker S.J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6285-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 31Batty I.H. van der Kaay J. Gray A. Telfer J.F. Dixon M.J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of tyrosines in SHIP2 showed that Tyr986/Tyr987 and Tyr1135 were the most likely sites phosphorylated in response to EGF (27Prasad N.K. Werner M.E. Decker S.J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6285-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Importantly, there are three potential regulatory serine/threonine residues (Thr958, Ser1003, and Ser982) in the C-terminal region of SHIP2 (32Artemenko Y. Gagnon A. Ibrahim S. Sorisky A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 211: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 33Salomon A.R. Ficarro S.B. Brill L.M. Brinker A. Phung Q.T. Ericson C. Sauer K. Brock A. Horn D.M. Schultz P.G. Peters E.C.

Kimura I. Kobayashi M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 2911-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These three residues are located near Tyr986, a well known tyrosine phosphorylation site in the NPXY motif of the molecule. Therefore, it has been suggested that the phosphorylation of Thr958, Ser1003, or Ser982 could affect the affinity of Tyr986 for its tyrosine kinase (32Artemenko Y. Gagnon A. Ibrahim S. Sorisky A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 211: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although there are a number of serine or threonine residues in the corresponding NPXY region of SHIP1 (see Fig. 1), based on our mutational analysis, they do not appear to be involved in the regulation of SHIP1 activity.There is recent genetic and structural evidence that modification of amino acid residues in the catalytic region of the inositol phosphatase can markedly alter their activity. Genetic studies with the type IV 5′-phosphatase (INPP5E), a lipid phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphate at the 5′-position from PtdIns-3,5-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, hint at how regulation of 5′-phosphatase activity could be modified by alteration of the residues in the 5′-phosphatase catalytic domain (28Bielas S.L. Silhavy J.L. Brancati F. Kisseleva M.V. Al-Gazali L. Sztriha L. Bayoumi R.A. Zaki M.S. Abdel-Aleem A. Rosti R.O. Kayserili H. Swistun D. Scott L.C. Bertini E. Boltshauser E. Fazzi E. Travaglini L.

INPP5E is a highly active 5′-phosphatase of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 that is widely expressed and found in brain, testis, breast, hemopoietic, and other cell types (35Kisseleva M.V. Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20110-20116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Patients with human ciliary diseases were found to have single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the INPP5E gene in the region of the molecule corresponding to the catalytic core of SHIP1 (28Bielas S.L.

These single-nucleotide polymorphisms mutated arginine or lysine residues centered in the phosphatase domain and greatly impaired the 5′-phosphatase activity of the enzyme. Study of primary fibroblasts cultured from individual patients showed altered cellular phosphatidylinositol lipid ratios and transfection of the mutated proteins into HEK-293 cells resulted in phenotypes with high basal levels of phospho-Akt and an exaggerated response to PDGF (28Bielas S.L.

These data suggest that modification of the amino acids in the 5′-phosphatase catalytic region of SHIP1 is capable of inducing meaningful changes in the enzyme's activity and provide additional support for our hypothesis that phosphorylation of Ser440 in the catalytic core of SHIP1 is important for regulation of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 signaling.In conclusion, although tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of SHIP1 and SHIP2 is a highly studied area, there are few comprehensive reports on the regulation of SHIP1 or SHIP2 by serine/threonine kinases. PKA is the best characterized member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family, and phosphorylation of its substrates is important for regulating many cellular processes. Our previous observation that phosphorylation of SHIP1 with PKA markedly activates its function provided insight into an important new mode of SHIP1 regulation. In the present study, we have identified the Ser440 residue in SHIP1 as a major PKA phosphorylation site with functional implications. These results outline a new role for G protein-coupled receptors and PKA in regulating PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 levels and inflammatory signals via the activation of SHIP1.

The effect of L-dopa has been demonstrated in language studies, suggesting restriction of the semantic network. In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of L-dopa on language processing with fMRI using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Two types of language tasks (phonological and semantic categorization tasks) were tested under two drug conditions (placebo and L-dopa) in 16 healthy subjects. Probabilistic ICA (PICA), part of FSL, was implemented to generate Independent Components (IC) for each subject for the four conditions and the ICs were classified into task-relevant source groups by a correlation threshold criterion. Our key findings include: (i) The highly task-relevant brain regions including the Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (LIFG), Left Fusiform Gyrus (LFUS), Left Parietal lobe (LPAR) and Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG) were activated with both L-dopa and placebo for both tasks, and (ii) as compared to placebo, L-dopa was associated with increased activity in posterior regions, including the superior temporal area (BA 22), and decreased activity in the thalamus (pulvinar) and inferior frontal gyrus (BA 11/47) for both tasks. These results raise the possibility that L-dopa may exert an indirect effect on posterior regions mediated by the thalamus (pulvinar)."
https://openalex.org/W2085673043,"Mitochondrial mRNA editing in Trypanosoma brucei requires the specific interaction of a guide RNA with its cognate mRNA. Hundreds of gRNAs are involved in the editing process, each needing to target their specific editing domain within the target message. We hypothesized that the structure surrounding the mRNA target may be a limiting factor and involved in the regulation process. In this study, we selected four mRNAs with distinct target structures and investigated how sequence and structure affected efficient gRNA targeting. Two of the mRNAs, including the ATPase subunit 6 and ND7-550 (5′ end of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 7) that have open, accessible anchor binding sites show very efficient gRNA targeting. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that the cognate gRNA for ND7-550 had 10-fold higher affinity for its mRNA than the A6 pair. Surface plasmon resonance studies indicate that the difference in affinity was due to a four-fold faster association rate. As expected, mRNAs with considerable structure surrounding the anchor binding sites were less accessible and had very low affinity for their cognate gRNAs. In vitro editing assays indicate that efficient pairing is crucial for gRNA directed cleavage. However, only the A6 substrate showed gRNA-directed cleavage at the correct editing site. This suggests that different gRNA/mRNA pairs may require different “sets” of accessory factors for efficient editing. By characterizing a number of different gRNA/mRNA interactions, we may be able to define a “bank” of RNA editing substrates with different putative chaperone and other co-factor requirements. This will allow the more efficient identification and characterization of transcript specific RNA editing accessory proteins."

In addition to this well characterized antiviral activity, TRIM5αrh has another antiviral activity to block the late phase of the HIV-1 life cycle (15Zhang X. Kondo M. Chen J. Miyoshi H. Suzuki H.

Although the late restriction activity of endogenous TRIM5αrh remains controversial, transient expression of TRIM5αrh potently blocks HIV-1 production in 293T cells by reducing the levels of HIV-1 Gag polyproteins in producer cells (16Sakuma R. Noser J.A. Ohmine S. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Zhang F. Perez-Caballero D. Hatziioannou T. Bieniasz P.D. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast to the post-entry restriction, this late restriction is dependent on the N-terminal RING, B-box 2, and coiled-coil domains rather than the B30.2(PRYSPRY) of TRIM5αrh (16Sakuma R. Noser J.A. Ohmine S. Ikeda Y. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both TRIM5αrh and human TRIM5α (TRIM5αhu) proteins typically display a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution marked by discrete cytoplasmic bodies and have the tendency to form larger cytoplasmic aggregates when overexpressed (4Stremlau M.

Disruptions in the coiled-coil and adjacent linker 2 region, located between the coiled-coil and B30.2(PRYSPRY) domains of TRIM5αrh, result in diffuse TRIM5αrh distribution devoid of cytoplasmic bodies (11Javanbakht H.

Although cytidine deaminase enzyme APOBEC3G also forms cytoplasmic bodies, which co-localize with processing bodies (p-bodies) (22Gallois-Montbrun S. Kramer B. Swanson C.M. Byers H. Lynham S. Ward M. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), TRIM5α cytoplasmic bodies are considered separate entities (23Campbell E.M. Dodding M.P. Yap M.W. Wu X. Gallois-Montbrun S. Malim M.H. Stoye J.P. Hope T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2102-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic bodies are also independent of actin, early endosomes, trans-Golgi, lysosomes, or aggresomes (23Campbell E.M. Dodding M.P. Yap M.W. Wu X. Gallois-Montbrun S. Malim M.H. Stoye J.P. Hope T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2102-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Initial studies suggest that TRIM5α cytoplasmic body formation may not be required for HIV-1 post-entry restriction (5Perez-Caballero D. Hatziioannou T. Zhang F. Cowan S. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 15567-15572Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 12Song B. Diaz-Griffero F. Park D.H. Rogers T. Stremlau M. Sodroski J. Virology. 2005; 343: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the dynamic interaction between TRIM5αrh and cytoplasmic HIV-1 preintegration complexes, including the rapid de novo formation of TRIM5αrh cytoplasmic body-like structures around viral complexes, indicates a role for TRIM5αrh cytoplasmic bodies in the TRIM5α-mediated HIV-1 restriction (13Campbell E.M. Perez O. Anderson J.L. Hope T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Sastri J. O'Connor C. Danielson C.M. McRaven M. Perez P. Diaz-Griffero F. Campbell E.M. Virology. 2010; 405: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, the observation that higher order self-association through the TRIM5α B-box 2 domain increases TRIM5α avidity against the incoming retroviral core implies the importance of self-associated TRIM5αrh protein in the post-entry restriction activity (24Li X. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 11495-11502Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the identity and constituents of TRIM5α cytoplasmic bodies remain elusive. Here, to better understand the identity of TRIM5α cytoplasmic bodies, we sought cellular binding partners of TRIM5αrh. We found that lipid microdomain protein flotillin-1/Reggie-2 co-immunoprecipitated with TRIM5αrh. Immunostaining revealed the co-localization of the TRIM5αrh cytoplasmic bodies with flotillin-1/Reggie-2, as well as caveolin-1, another lipid microdomain-associated protein. Flotillin-1/Reggie-2 knockdown did not have remarkable effects on TRIM5αrh-mediated cellular restriction; however, depletion of cellular lipids and cholesterol disrupted TRIM5α cytoplasmic body formation and impaired the TRIM5αrh-mediated post-entry restriction. Subsequent lipid repletion completely restored the TRIM5αrh-mediated post-entry restriction of HIV-1. Similar effects were observed in the late restriction upon lipid depletion. Thus, our results demonstrate that target cell lipids play a critical role in the cytoplasmic body formation and antiviral activities of TRIM5α. 293T, FRhK4, TE671, and GHOST(3)R3/X4/R5 (25Mörner A.

For generation of rhesus monkey FRhK4 cells stably expressing HA- or mCherry-tagged TRIM5αrh, FRhK4 cells were transduced by a retroviral vector and selected under the presence of puromycin. Resulting puromycin-resistant cells were named FRhK4T5αHA and FRhK4T5αCh cells, respectively.

FRhK4T5αCh cells were seeded into LabTek II 8-well chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY) at ∼1.5 × 105 cells/ml. 48 h later, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized on ice using 0.1% saponin, and then blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies (rat anti-HA, 1:250, Roche Applied Science; mouse anti-caveolin-1, 1:250, BD Transduction Laboratories; rabbit anti-EEA1, 1:250, Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); mouse anti-flotillin-1/Reggie-2, 1:250, BD Transduction Laboratories; mouse anti-HSP70, 1:250, Cell Signaling Technology; rabbit anti-Rab7, 1:250, Cell Signaling Technology; and mouse anti-tubulin, 1:250, Sigma) and secondary FITC-conjugated antibodies were used (Texas red-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG, 1:250, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA; FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:250, Roche Applied Science; and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG 1:250, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Images were obtained using the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Generation of co-localization coefficients were performed with the Zeiss LSM 510 META software. Co-localization coefficients were calculated as the sum of intensities of co-localizing pixels in channels 1 and 2, as compared with the overall sum of pixel intensities in the channel. A value of 0 corresponds to no co-localization, and 1 indicates all pixels to be co-localized. Scale bars of 20 μm were also generated by the Zeiss LSM 510 META software. 293T cells were co-transfected with 4.0 μg of pRhT5α and 0.5 μg of pNL4-3 in 15-cm culture plates. 40 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 40 μm MG115 for 6 h (Sigma). Producer cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and cell lysates were harvested in 1.0 ml of RIPA lysis buffer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was kept for analysis. Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged TRIM5α proteins was performed using agarose beads conjugated with mouse anti-HA antibody (Sigma) and were incubated at 4 °C overnight with rotation. The beads were washed at least 20 times with RIPA buffer and pelleted. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted off the HA-agarose beads through a 30-min room temperature incubation with 100 μg of HA peptide (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation of flotillin-1/Reggie-2 was performed using monoclonal antibody against human flotillin-1/Reggie-2 protein (BD Transduction Laboratories). To remove any nonspecific binding of proteins, the antibody against flotillin-1/Reggie-2 was added to the supernatant at a 1:250 concentration after a 30 min rotation with protein G beads (Sigma) and rotated overnight at 4 °C. After more than 20 washes with RIPA buffer, the protein-antibody complex was pulled down using protein G beads. Laemmli sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol was directly added to the beads, and protein samples were heat-denatured for immunoblot analysis. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 4–15% Tris-HCl gel and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane at 0.7 mA/cm2 for 40 min. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk PBS overnight prior to application of antibodies. Antibodies were used in the following concentrations: rat anti-HA (1:1000, Roche Applied Science), mouse anti-flotillin-1/Reggie-2 (1:1000), and mouse anti-β-actin (1:3000, Sigma). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rat IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG, and goat anti-rabbit IgG, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) were used at a 1:2000 concentration. Lentiviral vectors were generated by transfecting pLKO.1-based lentiviral vectors carrying shRNA sequences against flotillin-1/Reggie-2 (RHS4533NM-005803, Open Biosystems) or TRIM5αrh-specific shRNA pLKO-H4 (RHS3979-9574739, Open Biosystems), along with an HIV-1 packaging plasmid, pCMV-R8.91, and a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G) expressing plasmid, pMD.G (29Zufferey R.

Following infection, stably transduced cells were selected in the presence of 3 μg/ml puromycin. Total cellular RNA was harvested with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 5 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize the first strand DNA with an oligo(dT) primer (SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system, Invitrogen). One-tenth of the reverse transcription products was used to amplify TRIM5αrh-specific cDNA with primers 5′-GCAGGTACCATGCTCATGGAGGAGGTTGCCCA-3′ and 5′-ACGCTCGAGTCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGATAAGAGCTTGGTGAGCACAGAGTCATG-3′. Flotillin-1/Reggie-2 primers used were 5′-GTTTACACTCGCCATGGGGTCCCCATCTCAG-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCTTCTTCAGTTCGTAATCTCTCTGTGC-3′. α-Tubulin primer set used in these experiments was described previously (30Noser J.A.

The vector-containing culture supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter 48–72 h post-transfection. GFP virus vectors were centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C, washed, and resuspended in PBS. FRhK4 cells were infected with increasing volumes of viral vector. 48–72 h post-infection, GFP-expressing cells were assayed by flow cytometry. Cells were transfected with pNL4-3 or pSIVmac1A11 using FuGENE 6. 48 h post-transfection, viral supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter and infected onto GHOST(3)R3X4R5 indicator cells. GFP-positive cells were quantified 48 h post-infection, and titers were determined as infectious units/ml (IU/ml). FRhK4 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS, Intracel, Frederick, MD) for 48 h. Cell monolayer was washed twice with PBS and was treated with 10 mm 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2OHpβCD) for 45 min at 37 °C. 2OHpβCD was chosen for cholesterol depletion due to its higher solubility and lower toxicity in comparison with other available cyclodextrins (33Gould S. Scott R.C. Food Chem. Toxicol. 2005; 43: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Following treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS, and 5% LPDS McCoy's media were replenished. 24 h later; FRhK4 cells were then infected with HIV-1 or SIV GFP vector. For repletion studies, cells were incubated in 10% FBS McCoy's media for 24 h prior to infection. For the late restriction studies, 293T cells in a 24-well plate were co-transfected with 250 ng of pRhT5α and 25 ng of pNL4-3 or pSIVMAC1A11 using FuGENE 6. FRhK4 cells were co-transfected with 250 ng of control plasmid and 25 ng of pNL4-3 or pSIVMAC1A11, using FuGENE 6. 36 h post-transfection, cell monolayer was washed twice using serum-free cell culture media. Cells were then treated with 2OHpβCD (0, 0.4, 2.0, or 10.0 mm) for 45 min at 37 °C and then washed once with culture medium. At 2-, 4-, and 10 h after 2OHpβCD removal, virus-containing supernatant was filtered and infected onto GHOST(3)R3X4R5 indicator cells. GFP-positive cells were quantified 48 h post-infection, and titers were determined as infectious units/ml (IU/ml). To gain an insight into the identity of TRIM5α cytoplasmic bodies where TRIM5αrh appears to interact with incoming HIV-1 capsid (13Campbell E.M. Perez O. Anderson J.L. Hope T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 23Campbell E.M. Dodding M.P. Yap M.W. Wu X. Gallois-Montbrun S. Malim M.H. Stoye J.P. Hope T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2102-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we examined cellular factors that may associate with TRIM5α. 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing a C-terminally HA-tagged TRIM5α with or without pNL4-3. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Eluted proteins were then separated in a 4–15% Tris-HCl gradient gel and silver-stained for protein visualization. A representative silver stain is shown (Fig. 1A). Prominent bands and the corresponding areas in the control lane were excised and analyzed using tandem MS. Bands B, F, and H appeared more prominently following longer development times (data not shown). Peptide assignments from the tandem MS spectra were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.9% probability as specified by the PeptideProphet algorithm. Keratin was excluded as it is known as a common contaminant in proteomic analysis. The identified proteins are listed in Fig. 1B. Of the several proteins identified, flotillin-1/Reggie-2, α-tubulin, and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) were further analyzed as their peptides were identified at least nine times (Fig. 1B). HIV-1 p24 was not detected upon TRIM5αrh immunoprecipitation (data not shown). To verify the HA immunoprecipitation results, we used an anti-flotillin-1/Reggie-2 monoclonal antibody to immunoprecipitate endogenous flotillin-1/Reggie-2 in TRIM5αrh- and/or NL4-3-expressing 293T cells. Although endogenous flotillin-1/Reggie-2 was below detectable levels via immunoblot analysis, flotillin-1/Reggie-2 immunoprecipitation enriched flotillin-1/Reggie-2 signals (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we were able to detect co-immunoprecipitated TRIM5αrh-HA upon flotillin-1/Reggie-2 pulldown (Fig. 1C). We could not confirm the bindings of TRIM5αrh with α-tubulin or HSP70 by using antibodies against respective proteins (data not shown). First, we retrovirally transduced rhesus monkey FRhK4 cells to express C-terminally mCherry-tagged TRIM5αrh (TRIM5αCh, Fig. 2A). After selection in the presence of puromycin, we obtained the bulk population of FRhK4 cells that stably express mCherry-tagged TRIM5αrh, termed FRhK4T5αCh cells. TRIM5αrh-mCherry signals were observed predominantly as discrete cytoplasmic bodies in FRhK4T5αCh cells (Fig. 2, B and D--G). To test whether flotillin-1/Reggie-2 co-localizes with TRIM5αrh in rhesus monkey FRhK4 cells, FRhK4T5αCh cells were immunostained for endogenous flotillin-1/Reggie-2 and analyzed under confocal microscope. Flotillin-1/Reggie-2 signals were found on the cell membrane as well as in cytosol as discrete cytoplasmic bodies. Cytoplasmic flotillin-1/Reggie-2 signals frequently co-localized with the TRIM5αrh-mCherry signals (co-localization coefficient = 0.593) (Fig. 2B). To rule out the possibility that the C-terminal mCherry tag affects the TRIM5αrh subcellular localization, FRhK4T5αHA cells, stably expressing C-terminally HA-tagged TRIM5αrh, were also generated. FRhK4T5αHA cells were immunostained with anti-HA and anti-flotillin-1 primary antibodies and visualized using secondary antibodies conjugated with Texas Red and FITC, respectively. Both TRIM5αrh and flotillin-1/Reggie-2 formed cytoplasmic bodies, and the co-localization coefficients between the signals were nearly identical to those observed in the FRhK4T5αCh cells (Fig. 2C, co-localization coefficient = 0.598). Because flotillin-1/Reggie-2 is a well established lipid microdomain marker, we further assessed the possible localization of TRIM5αrh in lipid microdomains. We used another lipid microdomain marker caveolin-1, a protein that is the primary constituent of cellular caveolae (34Pol A. Luetterforst R. Lindsay M. Heino S. Ikonen E. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), for the co-localization study. When FRhK4T5αCh cells were stained with anti-caveolin-1 antibody (Fig. 2D), prominent co-localization signals were observed between TRIM5αrh-mCherry and caveolin-1 at cytoplasmic bodies (co-localization coefficient = 0.267). TRIM5αrh was not co-localized to the cell membrane with flotillin-1/Reggie-2 (Fig. 2B) or caveolin-1 (data not shown) signals. Untransduced parental FRhK4 cells showed similar flotillin-1/Reggie-2 and caveolin-1 staining patterns, suggesting that overexpression of TRIM5αrh did not affect endogenous flotillin-1/Reggie-2 or caveolin-1 subcellular localization (data not shown). When antibodies against early (EEA1) and late endosomes (Rab7) were used, both signals did not prominently co-localize with TRIM5αrh-mCherry in FRhK4 cells (Fig. 2, E and F, co-localization coefficient = 0.091 and 0.099, respectively). α-Tubulin and HSP70, which were co-immunoprecipitated with TRIM5αrh (Fig. 1B), did not show clear co-localization signals with TRIM5αrh-mCherry in FRhK4T5αCh cells (Fig. 2, G and H). Our results therefore suggest the localization of TRIM5αrh cytoplasmic bodies with proteins associated with subcellular lipid microdomains. Flotillin-1/Reggie-2 is a lipid-associated protein that has been identified in many subcellular microdomains, including endosomes, phagosomes, plasma membrane, trans-Golgi network, and lipid droplets (35Bickel P.E.

The presence of stratified multilayered corneal endothelial cells with abnormal patterns of cytokeratin expression are remarkably similar to those observed in human posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) and the sporadic condition, iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. Affected eyes exhibit epithelialized corneal endothelial cells, with inappropriate cytokeratin expression and proliferation over the iridocorneal angle and posterior cornea. We have termed this the “mouse PPCD1” phenotype and mapped the mouse locus for this phenotype, designated “Ppcd1”, to a 6.1 Mbp interval on Chromosome 2, which is syntenic to the human Chromosome 20 PPCD1 interval. Inheritance of the mouse PPCD1 phenotype is autosomal dominant, with complete penetrance on the sensitive DBA/2J background and decreased penetrance on the C57BL/6J background. Comparative genome hybridization has identified a hemizygous 78 Kbp duplication in the mapped interval. The endpoints of the duplication are located in positions that disrupt the genes Csrp2bp and 6330439K17Rik and lead to duplication of the pseudogene LOC100043552. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR indicates that expression levels of Csrp2bp and 6330439K17Rik are decreased in eyes of PPCD1 mice. Based on the observations of decreased gene expression levels, association with ZEB1-related pathways, and the report of corneal opacities in Csrp2bptm1a(KOMP)Wtsi heterozygotes and embryonic lethality in nulls, we postulate that duplication of the 78 Kbp segment leading to haploinsufficiency of Csrp2bp is responsible for the mouse PPCD1 phenotype. Similarly, CSRP2BP haploinsufficiency may lead to human PPCD."
