https://openalex.org/W2009826707,"Lysine Acetylation Catalog Covalent posttranslational modification is an essential cellular regulatory mechanism by which the activity of proteins can be controlled. Advances in mass spectrometry made it possible for Choudhary et al. (p. 834 , published online 16 July) to assess the prevalence of lysine acetylation throughout the whole proteome. Acetylation is much more widespread than previously appreciated and occurs on proteins participating in all sorts of biological functions. Acetylation can influence susceptibility of proteins to phosphorylation and occurs frequently on enzymes that control the modification of other proteins by covalent ubiquitination and on proteins that form large macromolecular complexes. The findings also help to characterize the actions of lysine deacetylase inhibitors, which have shown clinical promise in treatments for cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2146604395,"T Follicular Helper Cell Differentiation When B cells respond to an infection, they often require help from CD4 + T cells to mount a proper response. It is thought that a subset of CD4 + effector T cells, called T follicular helper cells (T FH ), performs this function. Several subsets of effector CD4 + T cells arise, depending on the type of infection, which have distinct transcriptional programs driving their differentiation. Whether this is also the case for T FH cells has not been clear (see the Perspective by Awasthi and Kuchroo ). Nurieva et al. (p. 1001 , published online 23 July) and Johnston et al. (p. 1006 ; published online 16 July) now demonstrate that the transcription factor Bcl6 is both necessary and sufficient for T FH differentiation and subsequent B cell–mediated immunity, suggesting that it is a master regulator of this lineage. Johnston et al. also show that expression of Bcl6 and the transcription factor, Blimp-1, are reciprocally regulated in T FH cells and that, when ectopically expressed, Blimp-1 inhibits T FH development."

To date, the most detailed simulations used models of intermediate complexity, not with more sophisticated Coupled Global Climate Models (CGCMs) that can synchronously couple both oceanic and the atmospheric components. Overcoming practical and technical challenges, Liu et al. (p. 310 ; see the Perspective by Timmermann and Menviel ) performed such a simulation using CCSM3, a state-of-the-art ocean-atmosphere CGCM. In contrast to previous studies, which indicated that the Bølling-Allerød was triggered by a nonlinear bifurcation between modes of deep ocean circulation in the Atlantic, the results suggest that the event was a transient response caused by the cessation of meltwater input into the surface ocean in the North Atlantic region."
https://openalex.org/W2085332084,"Living on the Edge Topological insulators are a recently described state of matter in which the bulk material is an insulator but with a metallic surface state that is protected by the topology of the Fermi surface. Roth et al. (p. 294 ; see the Perspective by Büttiker ) now show that the current flow on the surface takes place in edge states around the boundary of the sample. These are similar to the current transport in high-quality two-dimensional electron gases in high magnetic field, which confirms theoretical work on these materials."
https://openalex.org/W2100214887,"Diverting Asperger Deficit Placement of Asperger syndrome within the family of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has always been a bit uneasy; although people with Asperger syndrome do exhibit the core impairments in social interaction and communication that are characteristic of ASD, they nevertheless perform well on tests that are thought to assess the ability to mentalize or to possess Theory of Mind skills. One of the classic tests of mentalizing ability is the false-belief task, in which subjects must be able to represent their own beliefs (true) and another's beliefs, which are false because they have not been given complete information, such as not having seen the transfer of a piece of candy from one drawer to another. People with Asperger syndrome succeed at the verbal form of the false-belief task, yet Senju et al. (p. 883 , published online 16 July) show that this is owing entirely to their having learned how to cope with an existing and still demonstrable deficit in an implicit version of the false-belief task. That is, the core impairment is present, but conscious and explicit learning allows them to compensate."
https://openalex.org/W2061837724,"Analysis of Neandertal DNA holds great potential for investigating the population history of this group of hominins, but progress has been limited due to the rarity of samples and damaged state of the DNA. We present a method of targeted ancient DNA sequence retrieval that greatly reduces sample destruction and sequencing demands and use this method to reconstruct the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes of five Neandertals from across their geographic range. We find that mtDNA genetic diversity in Neandertals that lived 38,000 to 70,000 years ago was approximately one-third of that in contemporary modern humans. Together with analyses of mtDNA protein evolution, these data suggest that the long-term effective population size of Neandertals was smaller than that of modern humans and extant great apes."
https://openalex.org/W2167125619,"The desire to know what the future holds is a powerful motivator in everyday life, but it is unknown how this desire is created by neurons in the brain. Here we show that when macaque monkeys are offered a water reward of variable magnitude, they seek advance information about its size. Furthermore, the same midbrain dopamine neurons that signal the expected amount of water also signal the expectation of information, in a manner that is correlated with the strength of the animal's preference. Our data show that single dopamine neurons process both primitive and cognitive rewards, and suggest that current theories of reward-seeking must be revised to include information-seeking."
https://openalex.org/W2084091637,"Genomic expansions of simple tandem repeats can give rise to toxic RNAs that contain expanded repeats. In myotonic dystrophy, the expression of expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) causes abnormal regulation of alternative splicing and neuromuscular dysfunction. We used a transgenic mouse model to show that derangements of myotonic dystrophy are reversed by a morpholino antisense oligonucleotide, CAG25, that binds to CUGexp RNA and blocks its interaction with muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1), a CUGexp-binding protein. CAG25 disperses nuclear foci of CUGexp RNA and reduces the overall burden of this toxic RNA. As MBNL1 is released from sequestration, the defect of alternative splicing regulation is corrected, thereby restoring ion channel function. These findings suggest an alternative use of antisense methods, to inhibit deleterious interactions of proteins with pathogenic RNAs."

Would you use your arms and legs for propulsion or would you make your body as compact as possible and try to wiggle and slither your way through? Maladen et al. (p. 314 ) used x-ray imaging to study the motion of sandfish lizards as they burrowed into sand. The sandfish lizard does not use its limbs, but instead flattens them against its body and uses large-amplitude traveling wave oscillation of its body to propel itself. Modeling can explain the motion the lizard uses to propel itself through a medium that is neither liquid nor solid."
https://openalex.org/W1981244256,"Going Retro In a year celebrating Darwin, the question of how new functional genes arise during evolution is of particular interest. Through a multibreed genetic analysis of the domestic dog, Parker et al. (p. 995 , published online 16 July; see the Perspective by Kaessmann ) find that the short-legged phenotype that characterizes at least 19 common dog breeds, including the corgi, dachshund, and basset hound, is specifically associated with the expression in developing bone of a gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 4 ( fgf4 ), a member of a gene family previously implicated in dwarfism in humans. Interestingly, the culprit fgf4 gene in dogs has the hallmarks of a “retrogene,” a gene that arises when a parental gene is duplicated through an RNA-based copying mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2074274532,"APC Transporter Structure Amino acid, polyamine, and organocation (APC) transporters that move a range of organic molecules across the cell membrane are important in many cellular processes. Shaffer et al. (p. 1010 ; published online 16 July) report the crystal structure of apoApcT, a proton-dependent APC transporter. The structure shows similarity to the sodium-coupled amino acid transporter LeuT and has an amino group from a lysine in an equivalent position to a sodium ion in LeuT. This suggests common principles between proton- and sodium-coupled transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2031835386,"Our ability to multitask is severely limited: task performance deteriorates when we attempt to undertake two or more tasks simultaneously. Remarkably, extensive training can greatly reduce such multitasking costs. While it is not known how training alters the brain to solve the multitasking problem, it likely involves the prefrontal cortex given this brain region's purported role in limiting multitasking performance. Here, we show that the reduction of multitasking interference with training is not achieved by diverting the flow of information processing away from the prefrontal cortex or by segregating prefrontal cells into independent task-specific neuronal ensembles, but rather by increasing the speed of information processing in this brain region, thereby allowing multiple tasks to be processed in rapid succession. These results not only reveal how training leads to efficient multitasking, they also provide a mechanistic account of multitasking limitations, namely the poor speed of information processing in human prefrontal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1974227389,"Earth has undergone profound changes since the late Pliocene, which led to the development [approximately 2.7 million years ago (Ma)] and intensification (approximately 0.9 Ma) of large-scale Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, recorded as transitions in the benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope (delta18Ob) record. Here we present an orbitally resolved record of deep ocean temperature derived from benthic foraminiferal magnesium/calcium ratios from the North Atlantic, which shows that temperature variations are a substantial portion of the global delta18Ob signal. The record shows two distinct cooling events associated with the late Pliocene (LPT, 2.5 to 3 Ma) and mid-Pleistocene (MPT, 1.2 to 0.85 Ma) climate transitions. Whereas the LPT increase in ice volume is attributed directly to global cooling, the shift to 100,000-year cycles at the MPT is more likely to be a response to an additional change in ice-sheet dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2044233644,"Normal tissue homeostasis is maintained by dynamic interactions between epithelial cells and their microenvironment. Disrupting this homeostasis can induce aberrant cell proliferation, adhesion, function and migration that might promote malignant behavior. Indeed, aberrant stromal-epithelial interactions contribute to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) spread and metastasis, and this raises the possibility that novel stroma-targeted therapies represent additional approaches for combating this malignant disease. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of human stromal cells derived from adipose tissue (ADSC) on pancreatic tumor cell proliferation.Co-culturing pancreatic tumor cells with ADSC and ADSC-conditioned medium sampled from different donors inhibited cancer cell viability and proliferation. ADSC-mediated inhibitory effect was further extended to other epithelial cancer-derived cell lines (liver, colon, prostate). ADSC conditioned medium induced cancer cell necrosis following G1-phase arrest, without evidence of apoptosis. In vivo, a single intra-tumoral injection of ADSC in a model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma induced a strong and long-lasting inhibition of tumor growth.These data indicate that ADSC strongly inhibit PDAC proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo and induce tumor cell death by altering cell cycle progression. Therefore, ADSC may constitute a potential cell-based therapeutic alternative for the treatment of PDAC for which no effective cure is available."
https://openalex.org/W2072667869,"Most studies of the impact of vibrational excitation on molecular reactivity have focused on reactions with a late barrier (that is, a transition state resembling the products). For an early barrier reaction, conventional wisdom predicts that a reactant's vibration should not couple efficiently to the reaction coordinate and thus should have little impact on the outcome. We report here an in-depth experimental study of the reactivity effects exerted by reactant C-H stretching excitation in a prototypical early-barrier reaction, F + CHD3. Rather counterintuitively, we find that the vibration hinders the overall reaction rate, inhibits scission of the excited bond itself (favoring the DF + CHD2 product channel), and influences the coproduct vibrational distribution despite being conserved in the CHD2 product. The results highlight substantial gaps in our predictive framework for state-selective polyatomic reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1997449629,"Ecology of Diarrhea Rotavirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and, although the infection takes a terrible toll on infant lives, its epidemiology is rather poorly known. New vaccines have become available and are being introduced in the United States prior to global rollout, but they may have some unexpected effects on disease dynamics. Pitzer et al. (p. 290 ; see the Perspective by Medley and Nokes ) analyzed data and developed models describing the epidemiology of rotavirus before and during adoption of the vaccine. Ecological analysis showed that the birth rate predicted the timing of epidemics much better than climatic variables and that shifts in birth rates explained changes over the years. But as increasing numbers of infants are vaccinated, the pool of susceptible individuals in the population will be reduced, which will affect the annual waves of geographic spread of rotavirus."
https://openalex.org/W1986282059,"Storage triacylglycerols (TAG) and membrane phospholipids share common precursors, i.e. phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol, in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition to providing a biophysically rather inert storage pool for fatty acids, TAG synthesis plays an important role to buffer excess fatty acids (FA). The inability to incorporate exogenous oleic acid into TAG in a yeast mutant lacking the acyltransferases Lro1p, Dga1p, Are1p, and Are2p contributing to TAG synthesis results in dysregulation of lipid synthesis, massive proliferation of intracellular membranes, and ultimately cell death. Carboxypeptidase Y trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the vacuole is severely impaired, but the unfolded protein response is only moderately up-regulated, and dispensable for membrane proliferation, upon exposure to oleic acid. FA-induced toxicity is specific to oleic acid and much less pronounced with palmitoleic acid and is not detectable with the saturated fatty acids, palmitic and stearic acid. Palmitic acid supplementation partially suppresses oleic acid-induced lipotoxicity and restores carboxypeptidase Y trafficking to the vacuole. These data show the following: (i) FA uptake is not regulated by the cellular lipid requirements; (ii) TAG synthesis functions as a crucial intracellular buffer for detoxifying excess unsaturated fatty acids; (iii) membrane lipid synthesis and proliferation are responsive to and controlled by a balanced fatty acid composition.

https://openalex.org/W2141884227,"Functional neural circuits are formed by eliminating early-formed redundant synapses and strengthening necessary connections during development. In newborn mouse cerebellum, each Purkinje cell (PC) is innervated by multiple climbing fibers (CFs) with similar strengths. Subsequently, a single CF is selectively strengthened by postnatal day 7 (P7). We find that this competition among multiple CFs occurs on the soma before CFs form synapses along dendrites. Notably, in most PCs, the single CF that has been functionally strengthened (the ""winner"" CF) undergoes translocation to dendrites while keeping its synapses on the soma. Synapses of the weaker CFs (the ""loser"" CFs) remain around the soma and form ""pericellular nests"" with synapses of the winner CFs. Then most perisomatic synapses are eliminated nonselectively by P15. Thus, our results suggest that the selective translocation of the winner CF to dendrites in each PC determines the single CF that survives subsequent synapse elimination and persistently innervates the PC."
https://openalex.org/W2026269323,"The entry pathway of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major human pathogen, into the cell is incompletely defined. To better characterize this viral life cycle stage, we screened a small interfering RNA library dedicated to the membrane trafficking and remodeling with the infection model of Huh-7.5.1 cells by HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp). Results showed that the down-regulation of different factors implied in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) inhibits HCVpp cell infection. In addition, knockdown of the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type III-α (PI4KIIIα) prevented infection by HCVpp or by cell-culture grown JFH-1-based HCV. Moreover, the replication activity of an HCV replicon was also affected by the PI4KIIIα knockdown. Additional investigations on the different members of the PI4K family revealed that the presence of PI4KIIIβ in the host cells influenced their susceptibility to HCVpp infection and their capacity to sustain the HCV replication. The PI4KIII involvement during the HCV life cycle seemed to occur by other ways than the control of the CME or of the membranous expression of HCV receptors. Finally, our library screening completed data on the CME-dependant entry route of HCV and identified 2 kinases, PI4KIIIα and β,as relevant potential therapeutic targets.—Trotard, M., Lepère-Douard, C., Régeard, M., Piquet-Pellorce, C., Lavillette, D., Cosset, F.-L., Gripon, P., Le Seyec, J.

The process involves mischarging of tRNA sec with serine, phosphorylation of the serine, and then conversion of the phosphoserine into selenocysteine by the enzyme SepSecS using selenophosphate as the selenium donor. Palioura et al. (p. 321 ) now provide insight into the mechanism of selenocysteine formation, based on the crystal structure of human tRNA sec complexed with SepSecS, phosphoserine, and thiophosphate, together with in vivo and in vitro activity assays. Binding of tRNA sec to SepSecS is required to properly orient phosphoserine attached to tRNA sec for pyroxidal phosphate–based catalysis."

Lobo-Checa et al. (p. 300 ) show that the electronic surface-state of copper can be converted into a regular array of quantum dots. An organic overlayer that is created on the copper surface has pores 1.6 nanometers in diameter that trap the surface states. The coupling of these trapped states is revealed in photoemission experiments, in which a shallow dispersive electronic band is formed."
https://openalex.org/W2020310458,"Moths Battling Bats Many night-flying insects hear the sonar sounds of attacking bats and take evasive action. Among moths, evasive flight is often accompanied by the production of ultrasonic sounds. Three functions of these sounds have been proposed: to startle the bat, to warn of distastefulness, or to “jam” the bat's sonar system. Corcoran et al. (p. 325 ) studied a species of tiger moth ( Bertholdia trigona ) that emits a particularly dense series of ultrasonic clicks and the interception behavior of big brown bats ( Eptesicus fuscus ) presented with silenced or sound-producing tethered moths. If the moth sounds evoke startle, naïve bats should initially break off their attacks, but then the bats should habituate to the sounds and complete subsequent attacks. In contrast, if the moth sounds have a warning effect, naïve bats should initially complete their attacks on sound-emitting moths, discover that the moths are distasteful, and refuse to capture them in future trials. Most of the bats in the tests reliably caught the silenced moths but avoided completing attacks on sound-producing moths, with no evidence of increasing or decreasing probability of capture from the first to the last trial, which suggests that the moths effectively jammed the bats' sonar."
https://openalex.org/W2089666322,"The structural and catalytic requirements for neutrophil MMP-9 proenzyme (proMMP-9) to induce angiogenesis were investigated using a quantitative angiogenesis model based on grafting of collagen onplants onto the chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryos. Both physiological activation of neutrophil proMMP-9 and proteolytic activity of the generated MMP-9 enzyme were critically dependent on the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-free status of the zymogen. The presence of an intact active site and hemopexin domain were required for full angiogenesis-inducing activity of the MMP-9 enzyme. Timed additions of TIMP-1 to the onplants containing TIMP-free neutrophil proMMP-9 indicated that in vivo activation of the zymogen occurred during the first 24 h after grafting. Within the onplant tissue, MMP-9 activation was accompanied by proteolytic modifications of fibrillar collagen and an influx of host proteins, the rate of which depended on the TIMP-free status of the zymogen. By quantifying the levels of host angiogenic factors, we demonstrated that basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) was a major cytokine becoming bioavailable in the onplant tissue undergoing a neutrophil proMMP-9-mediated angiogenic switch. Inhibition of angiogenesis with specific function-blocking antibodies further indicated an involvement of a FGF-2/FGFR-2 pathway in neutrophil proMMP-9-induced angiogenesis. The enhanced angiogenesis catalyzed by neutrophil MMP-9 appears to evoke also a localized, low threshold level vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGFR-2 pathway, likely functioning in the formation and/or stabilization of blood vessels. That neutrophil proMMP-9, unencumbered by TIMP-1, directly mediates FGF-2-dependent angiogenesis was also demonstrated in our quantitative mouse angiogenesis model employing subcutaneous collagen implants, thus implicating the novel TIMP-free MMP-9/FGF-2/FGFR-2 pathway in proMMP-9-induced angiogenesis in a mammalian setting."

https://openalex.org/W2005573148,"Mutualistic interactions between plants and animals promote integration of invasive species into native communities. In turn, the integrated invaders may alter existing patterns of mutualistic interactions. Here we simultaneously map in detail effects of invaders on parameters describing the topology of both plant-pollinator (bi-modal) and plant-plant (uni-modal) networks. We focus on the invader Opuntia spp., a cosmopolitan alien cactus. We compare two island systems: Tenerife (Canary Islands) and Menorca (Balearic Islands). Opuntia was found to modify the number of links between plants and pollinators, and was integrated into the new communities via the most generalist pollinators, but did not affect the general network pattern. The plant uni-modal networks showed disassortative linkage, i.e. species with many links tended to connect to species with few links. Thus, by linking to generalist natives, Opuntia remained peripheral to network topology, and this is probably why native network properties were not affected at least in one of the islands. We conclude that the network analytical approach is indeed a valuable tool to evaluate the effect of invaders on native communities."

https://openalex.org/W2119709720,"MicroRNAs (miRs) are 21- to 23-nucleo-tide RNA molecules that regulate the stability or trans-lational efficiency of target messenger RNAs of proteins involved in cell growth and apoptosis. miR-92 is part of the mir-17-92 cluster, which comprises members with an effect on cell proliferation. However, the role of miR-92 is unknown, and its targets have not been identified. Here, we describe a mechanism through which miR-92 contributes to regulate cell proliferation. Using a miR-92 synthetic double-strand oligonucleotide, we demonstrate that miR-92 increases 32D myeloid cell proliferation and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and inhibits cell death. The effect is miR-92 specific since the miR-92 antagomir inhibits cell proliferation. Moreover, we show that miR-92 acts by modulating p63-isoform abundance through down-regulatation of endogenous ΔNp6β. Using luciferase reporters containing p63 3'UTR fragments with wild-type or mutant miR-92 complementary sites, we demonstrate that the wild-type 3'UTR is a direct target of miR-92. Finally, we observed that a miR-92-resistant ΔNp63β isoform (without 3'UTR) inhibits cell proliferation and parallels the effect of the antagomir. We conclude that one of the molecular mechanisms through which miR-92 increases cell proliferation is by negative regulation of an isoform of the cell-cycle regulator p63.—Manni, I., Artuso, S., Careccia, S., Rizzo, M.

https://openalex.org/W2142122443,"In heme enzymes belonging to the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily the proximal histidine is in close interaction with a fully conserved asparagine. The crystal structure of a mixture of glycoforms of myeloperoxidase (MPO) purified from granules of human leukocytes prompted us to revise the orientation of this asparagine and the protonation status of the proximal histidine. The data we present contrast with previous MPO structures, but are strongly supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, comprehensive analysis of published lactoperoxidase structures suggest that the described proximal heme architecture is a general structural feature of animal heme peroxidases. Its importance is underlined by the fact that the MPO variant N421D, recombinantly expressed in mammalian cell lines, exhibited modified spectral properties and diminished catalytic activity compared with wild-type recombinant MPO. It completely lost its ability to oxidize chloride to hypochlorous acid, which is a characteristic feature of MPO and essential for its role in host defense. The presented crystal structure of MPO revealed further important differences compared with the published structures including the extent of glycosylation, interaction between light and heavy polypeptides, as well as heme to protein covalent bonds. These data are discussed with respect to biosynthesis and post-translational maturation of MPO as well as to its peculiar biochemical and biophysical properties."

Activation of PKA results in enhanced Ca(2+) release in cells that express predominantly InsP(3)R2. PKA is known to phosphorylate InsP(3)R2, but the molecular determinants of this effect are not known. We have expressed mouse InsP(3)R2 in DT40-3KO cells that are devoid of endogenous InsP(3)R and examined the effects of PKA phosphorylation on this isoform in unambiguous isolation. Activation of PKA increased Ca(2+) signals and augmented the single channel open probability of InsP(3)R2. A PKA phosphorylation site unique to the InsP(3)R2 was identified at Ser(937). The enhancing effects of PKA activation on this isoform required the phosphorylation of Ser(937), since replacing this residue with alanine eliminated the positive effects of PKA activation. These results provide a mechanism responsible for the enhanced Ca(2+) signaling following PKA activation in cells that express predominantly InsP(3)R2."

To maintain their genomic integrity, cells must ensure complete and accurate DNA replication once per cell cycle. Consequently, DNA replication is a highly regulated and orchestrated series of molecular events. Multiprotein complexes assembled at origins of replication lead to assembly of additional proteins that unwind chromosomal DNA and synthesize nascent strands. The first event is the formation of a pre-replicative complex, which is composed of the origin recognition complex, Cdc6, Cdt1, and Mcm2–7 (for review, see Ref. 1.Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 497-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Initiation of replication at the onset of S-phase involves the activity of cyclin- and Dbf4-dependent kinases concurrent with recruitment of key factors to the origin. Among these, Mcm10 (2.Solomon N.A. Wright M.B. Chang S. Buckley A.M. Dumas L.B. Gaber R.F. Yeast. 1992; 8: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3.Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y.

Mcm10 is exclusive to eukaryotes and is essential to both initiation and elongation phases of chromosomal DNA replication (6.Pacek M. Tutter A.V. Kubota Y. Takisawa H. Walter J.C. Mol.

Mutations in Mcm10 in yeast result in stalled replication, cell cycle arrest, and cell death (2.Solomon N.A. Wright M.B. Chang S. Buckley A.M. Dumas L.B. Gaber R.F.

These defects can be explained by the number of genetic and physical interactions between Mcm10 and many essential replication proteins, including origin recognition complex, Mcm2–7, and PCNA (3.Merchant A.M.

Biol. 2006; 26: 4806-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, Mcm10 has been shown to stimulate the phosphorylation of Mcm2–7 by Dbf4-dependent kinase in vitro (25.Lee J.K. Seo Y.S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2334-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, Mcm10 is an integral component of the replication machinery. Importantly, Mcm10 physically interacts with and stabilizes pol α and helps to maintain its association with chromatin (16.Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 26.Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. J. Biol.

Cell. 2007; 18: 4085-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This is a critical interaction during replication because pol α is the only enzyme in eukaryotic cells that is capable of initiating DNA synthesis de novo. Indeed, Mcm10 stimulates the polymerase activity of pol α in vitro (28.Fien K. Cho Y.S. Lee J.K. Raychaudhuri S. Tappin I. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16144-16153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and interestingly, the fission yeast Mcm10, but not Xenopus Mcm10, has been shown to exhibit primase activity (29.Robertson P.D. Warren E.M. Zhang H. Friedman D.B. Lary J.W. Cole J.L. Tutter A.V. Walter J.C. Fanning E. Eichman B.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 22248-22260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mcm10 is composed of three domains, the N-terminal (NTD), internal (ID), and C-terminal (CTD) domains (29.Robertson P.D. Warren E.M. Zhang H. Friedman D.B. Lary J.W. Cole J.L. Tutter A.V. Walter J.C. Fanning E. Eichman B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3338-3348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The NTD is presumably an oligomerization domain, whereas the ID and CTD both interact with DNA and pol α (29.Robertson P.D. Warren E.M. Zhang H. Friedman D.B. Lary J.W. Cole J.L. Tutter A.V. Walter J.C. Fanning E. Eichman B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3338-3348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The CTD is not found in yeast, whereas the ID is highly conserved among all eukaryotes. The crystal structure of Mcm10-ID showed that this domain is composed of an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB)-fold and a zinc finger motif, which form a unified DNA binding platform (31.Warren E.M.

An Hsp10-like motif important for the interaction with pol α has been identified in the sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mcm10-ID (16.Ricke R.M. Bielinsky A.K. Mol.

The p180 subunit possesses the catalytic DNA polymerase activity, and disruption of this gene is lethal (32.D'Urso G. Grallert B. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3109-3118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.LaRocque J.R. Dougherty D.L. Hussain S.K. Sekelsky J. Genetics. 2007; 176: 1441-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). p58 and p48 form the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (primase) activity (34.Wang T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 35.Arezi B. Kuchta R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 572-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas the p68 subunit has no known catalytic activity but serves a regulatory role (36.Foiani M. Marini F. Gamba D. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Ott R.D. Rehfuess C. Podust V.N. Clark J.E. Fanning E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5669-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Pol α plays an essential role in lagging strand synthesis by first creating short (7–12 nucleotide) RNA primers followed by DNA extension. At the critical length of ∼30 nucleotides, replication factor C binds to the nascent strand to displace pol α and loads PCNA with pols δ and ϵ (for review, see Ref. 38.Kunkel T.A. Burgers P.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 521-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The interaction between Mcm10 and pol α has led to the suggestion that Mcm10 may help recruit the polymerase to the emerging replisome. However, the molecular details of this interaction and the mechanism by which Mcm10 may recruit and stabilize the pol α complex on DNA has not been investigated. Presented here is the high resolution structure of the conserved Mcm10-ID bound to ssDNA together with NMR chemical shift perturbation competition data for pol α binding in the presence of ssDNA. Collectively, these data demonstrate a shared binding site for DNA and pol α in the OB-fold cleft of Mcm10-ID, with a preference for ssDNA over pol α. In addition, we have mapped the Mcm10-ID binding site on pol α to a 24-residue segment of the N-terminal domain of p180. Based on these results, we propose Mcm10 helps to recruit pol α to origins of replication by a molecular hand-off mechanism. Mcm10-ID was prepared as described previously (31.Warren E.M. Vaithiyalingam S. Haworth J. Greer B. Bielinsky A.K. Chazin W.J. Eichman B.F. Structure. 2008; 16: 1892-1901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was overexpressed from a modified pET-32a vector (Novagen) in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells for 16 h at 16 °C and isolated using nickel affinity chromatography. After cleavage of the thioredoxin-His6 tag, Mcm10-ID was purified using ssDNA affinity and size exclusion chromatography. An Mcm10 construct spanning amino acid residues 230–860 (Mcm10-ID+CTD) was cloned and expressed similarly to Mcm10-ID, except protein expression was induced at 21 °C for 4 h. Mcm10-ID+CTD protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen) followed by S-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) ion exchange chromatography and cleavage of the affinity tag. The cleaved protein was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 preparative column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol (buffer A). The DNA encoding amino acids 189–323 of human p180 was ligated into a modified pET-27 vector (Novagen) to produce an N-terminal His6 fusion protein (pBG100, Vanderbilt Center for Structural Biology). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the p180189–323/pBG100 plasmid were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and protein was overexpressed by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. For NMR experiments, protein was uniformly enriched with 15N by propagating cells in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as the sole source of nitrogen. The cells were harvested in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol and lysed under pressure (25,000 p.s.i.) using an Avestin EmulsiFlex C3 homogenizer. p180189–323 was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen) followed by cleavage of the affinity tag. The cleaved protein was further purified by Q-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) ion exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 preparative column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A. p180243–256 and p180286–310 peptides used for NMR titrations were synthesized and purified by Genescript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). Crystals were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion by mixing 2 μl of protein/DNA solution containing 300 μm Mcm10-ID and 360 μm dC9 ssDNA with 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 100 mm TAPS, pH 9.0, and 17% polyethylene glycol 3350. Crystals appeared overnight and grew to ∼50 × 50 × 200 μm3 after 2–3 days. Crystals were soaked for 5 min in mother liquor containing 10% (v/v) butanediol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Preliminary x-ray diffraction data (Table 1) were collected at beamline 21-ID at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL) and processed with HKL2000 (39.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

A clear rotation/translation solution was verified by the quality of the resulting composite annealed 2Fo − Fc omit electron density maps generated using CNS (41.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

Several iterative rounds of restrained atomic and temperature factor refinement against a maximum likelihood crystallographic target in Phenix (42.Afonine P.V. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) together with manual model adjustment and building the L12 loop in Coot (43.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) resulted in R and Rfree values of 21.7 and 26.1%, respectively. Strong Fo − Fc difference Fourier density was observed within the OB-fold cleft (residues 292–360). Three nucleotides of ssDNA were fit into this density using Coot and refined, which lowered R and Rfree by 0.8 and 1.61%, respectively. The polarity of the DNA was established by parallel refinement of both orientations of DNA, which differed from each other by 1% in Rfree. Translation/libration/screw refinement was used to model anisotropic motion of 6 groups, defined by protein residues 235–241, 242–260, 261–300, 301–371, 372–500, and DNA as determined by the TLSMD server (44.Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Individual anisotropic B-factors were derived from the refined translation/libration/screw parameters and held fixed during subsequent rounds of refinement, which resulted in a noticeable improvement of the electron density maps (supplemental Fig. S1) and a 1% decrease in both R and Rfree. No additional electron density was discerned corresponding to the six remaining nucleotides or for residues 230–231 and 416–427 at the extreme N and C termini. Analysis of the final structure using PROCHECK (45.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed 80.5 and 19.5% of the total of 154 non-glycine and non-proline residues to be within the most favored and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively, with no residues in the disallowed region. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number 3H15. Gradient-enhanced 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a Bruker DRX 800 NMR spectrometer equipped with single axis z-gradient cryoprobe. All spectra were acquired with 1024 complex points over a sweep width of 15 ppm in the 1H dimension and 128 complex points over 37 ppm in the 15N dimension. The center of the 15N spectral width was set to 117.5 ppm, and the 1H carrier was placed on the water signal at 4.7 ppm from the respective base spectrometer frequencies. All spectra were processed and analyzed using Topspin v1.3 (Bruker, Billerica, MA) and Sparky version 3.1 (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Data were treated with shifted sine-bell functions and zero-filled to twice the number of data points in both dimensions. Chemical shift perturbation data were collected by titrating 1.8 mm unlabeled p180189–323 into 400 μm15N-labeled Mcm10-ID in 20 mm Tris-d11, pH 7.0, 75 mm NaCl, and 5% D2O. Additionally, unlabeled Mcm10-ID was titrated into 400 μm15N-labeled p180189–323 in the same buffer. Both the salt concentration and temperature for the NMR experiment were optimized in all cases to be as close as possible to physiological conditions, within the limit of ensuring acceptable sensitivity. Spectra were recorded at Mcm10-ID:p180189–323 ratios of 1:0, 1:0.25, 1:0.63, 1:1, and 1:2. The 15-mer oligonucleotide d(GGCGCATTGTCGCAA) was used for ssDNA titrations and was previously verified by UV spectroscopy to be single-stranded under the conditions tested (31.Warren E.M. Vaithiyalingam S. Haworth J. Greer B. Bielinsky A.K. Chazin W.J. Eichman B.F. Structure. 2008; 16: 1892-1901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The observation of chemical shift perturbations in the fast-to-intermediate exchange regime (on the NMR time scale) enabled most of the peaks in the free protein and complexes to be correlated. In cases where the peaks disappeared, the last titration point where the peak was observed was used for determining chemical shift perturbations. The magnitudes of the average chemical shift (δ) perturbations shown in Fig. 3B and supplemental Figs. S7B and S8A were calculated from contributions of both 15N and 1H dimensions in the HSQC spectrum by using the equation, Δδave = (((Δδ1H)2 + (Δδ15N/5)2)/2)1/2. Mcm10-ID and Mcm10-ID+CTD binding to p180 and DNA was measured by following an increase in fluorescence anisotropy as unlabeled Mcm10 domains were added to fluorescein labeled p180 fragments and oligonucleotides. Fluorescein-p180189–323 was prepared by incubating purified p180189–323 with a 20-fold molar excess of MTS-fluorescein (2-[(5-fluoreceinyl) aminocarbonyl]ethyl methanethiosulfonate, Toronto Research Chemicals) at 25 °C for 6 h followed by purification on a 1-ml Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated p180286–310 was synthesized and purified by Genescript Corp., and oligonucleotides containing 3′-labeled 6-carboxyfluorescein were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. All binding and competition reactions were carried out at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. Polarized fluorescence intensities were measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 538 nm, respectively. For binding measurements, unlabeled Mcm10 protein was added over a concentration range of 0.1–50 μm to solutions containing either 50 nm fluorescein-p180 fragment or 50 nm fluorescein-DNA. Dissociation constants (Kd) were derived by fitting a two-state binding model to data from three experiments using Kaleidagraph 3.6 (Synergy Software) according to the equation r = ro + (rmax − ro) ([Mcm10]/(Kd+[Mcm10]), where r is the fluorescence anisotropy, and ro and rmax are the anisotropy values of unbound and fully bound DNA, respectively. For competition reactions, 15 μm Mcm10-ID was preincubated for 30 min with 50 nm fluorescein-p180189–323 or 50 nm fluorescein-ssDNA 25-mer (nucleotide sequence shown in Table 2). Under these conditions, both fluorescein-labeled molecules are >80% saturated (Fig. 2B and Ref. 31.Warren E.M. Vaithiyalingam S. Haworth J. Greer B. Bielinsky A.K. Chazin W.J. Eichman B.F. Structure. 2008; 16: 1892-1901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The presence of free fluorescein-labeled ssDNA and p180189–323 does not interfere with the measurement because p180189–323 and ssDNA do not interact (Fig. 2B). Unlabeled ssDNA-25-mer or p180189–323 was added over a concentration range of 1–250 μm, and the decay in anisotropy was monitored. EC50 value was determined by fitting the equation r = −ro − (rmax − ro) ([competitor]/(EC50 + [competitor]), and the Ki were determined according to the equation Ki = EC50/(1 + ([Mcm10]/Kd)).TABLE 2Mcm10-ID+CTD binding to DNA and pol α-p180189–323KdaValues were determined by fluorescence anisotropy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values in parentheses were recorded at 300 mm NaCl; all others were at 150 mm NaCl.Relative affinitybBinding affinities relative to ssDNA 25-mer.DNA sequencecssDNA regions of ss/dsDNA hybrids are in boldface.μmssDNA 25-mer0.22 ± 0.051.05′-ATGGTAGGCAACCATGTAGTAGTCA*dsDNA 25-mer0.91 ± 0.100.25′-ATGGTAGGCAACCATGTAGTAGTCA*TACCATCCGTTGGTACATCATCAGT-5′ssDNA 45-mer0.12 ± 0.02 (4.30 ± 1.12)1.8 (0.05)5′-GGTAGGCACGAACCATGTAGTAGTAGGCAATCAGCATTTGATAGC*dsDNA 45-mer0.40 ± 0.08 (34.86 ± 8.70)0.6 (0.01)5′-GGTAGGCACGAACCATGTAGTAGTAGGCAATCAGCATTTGATAGC*CCATCCGTGCTTGGTACATCATCATCCGTTAGTCGTAAACTATCG-5′Fork0.11 ± 0.012.05′-GGTAGGCACGAACCATGTAGTAGTA*CCATCCGTGCATGATGATGTACCAA-5′Bubble0.06 ± 0.0033.75′-GGTAGGCACGAACCATGTAGTAGTAGGCAATCAGC*CCATCCGTGCATGATGATGTACCAACCGTTAGTCG-5′5′-overhang0.11 ± 0.012.05′-TGACTACTACATGGT*ACTGATGATGTACCAACGGATGGTA-5′3′-overhang0.05 ± 0.0044.45′-ATGGTTGCCTACCAT*ACTGATGATGTACCAACGGATGGTA-5′p180189–3230.19 ± 0.031.2a Values were determined by fluorescence anisotropy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values in parentheses were recorded at 300 mm NaCl; all others were at 150 mm NaCl.b Binding affinities relative to ssDNA 25-mer.c ssDNA regions of ss/dsDNA hybrids are in boldface.

Data were collected at 25 °C using a MicroCal VP-isothermal titration calorimetry and analyzed using the accompanying Origin software (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA). Thermodynamic parameters were calculated from fitting the data to the best binding model using Origin according to the Gibbs free energy equation, ΔG = ΔH − TΔS = −RTln Ka. The highly conserved internal domain of Xenopus laevis Mcm10 (Mcm10-ID) has previously been suggested to bind DNA along the surface formed by the concave OB-fold β-barrel and the extended zinc finger loop (31.Warren E.M.

To elucidate the details of the Mcm10-ID·ssDNA interaction at high resolution, we determined the crystal structure of Mcm10-ID in complex with ssDNA using the unliganded Mcm10-ID structure as a molecular replacement search model (Fig. 1). Strong electron density corresponding to three consecutive cytidine nucleotides of ssDNA was clearly visible inside the OB-fold cleft (Fig. 1A), similar to the location of bound ssDNA in OB-fold structures of RPA, Rho, RecG, and RumA (46.Bochkarev A.

Because AGPs are very complex molecules, glycoside hydrolases capable of degrading AGPs are powerful tools for analyses of the AGPs. We previously reported such enzymes from Streptomyces avermitilis. Recently, a β-l-arabinopyranosidase was purified from the culture supernatant of the bacterium, and its corresponding gene was identified. The primary structure of the protein revealed that the catalytic module was highly similar to that of glycoside hydrolase family 27 (GH27) α-d-galactosidases. The recombinant protein was successfully expressed as a secreted 64-kDa protein using a Streptomyces expression system. The specific activity toward p-nitrophenyl-β-l-arabinopyranoside was 18 μmol of arabinose/min/mg, which was 67 times higher than that toward p- nitrophenyl-α-d-galactopyranoside. The enzyme could remove 0.1 and 45% l-arabinose from gum arabic or larch arabinogalactan, respectively. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that the protein had a GH27 catalytic domain, an antiparallel β-domain containing Greek key motifs, another antiparallel β-domain forming a jellyroll structure, and a carbohydrate-binding module family 13 domain. Comparison of the structure of this protein with that of α-d-galactosidase showed a single amino acid substitution (aspartic acid to glutamic acid) in the catalytic pocket of β-l-arabinopyranosidase, and a space for the hydroxymethyl group on the C-5 carbon of d-galactose bound to α-galactosidase was changed in β-l-arabinopyranosidase. Mutagenesis study revealed that the residue is critical for modulating the enzyme activity. This is the first report in which β-l-arabinopyranosidase is classified as a new member of the GH27 family.

Biol. 2001; 47: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). AGPs are also found in tree exudate gums and coniferous woods (3Aspinall G.O. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1969; 24: 333-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and are characterized by the presence of large amounts of carbohydrate components rich in galactose (all the sugars in the present study are in the d-configuration unless otherwise specified) and l-arabinose and by protein components rich in hydroxyproline, serine, threonine, alanine, and glycine (4Knox J.P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Type II arabinogalactans and short oligosaccharides are the two types of carbohydrates attached to the AGP backbone. Type II arabinogalactans have β-1,3-linked galactosyl backbones in mono- or oligo-β-1,6-galactosyl and/or l-arabinosyl side chains (2Gaspar Y. Johnson K.L. McKenna J.A. Bacic A. Schultz C.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 5Goodrum L.J. Patel A. Leykam J.F. Kieliszewski M.J. Phytochemistry. 2000; 54: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). l-Arabinose and lesser amounts of other auxiliary sugars such as glucuronic acid, l-rhamnose, and l-fucose are attached to the side chains primarily at nonreducing termini (2Gaspar Y. Johnson K.L. McKenna J.A. Bacic A. Schultz C.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Molecular and biochemical evidence indicates that AGPs have specific functions during root formation, promotion of somatic embryogenesis, and attraction of pollen tubes to the style (6Seifert G.J. Roberts K. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). However, because many putative protein cores exist and the structures of the carbohydrate moieties are complex, it has been difficult to differentiate one AGP species from another in plant tissues. This, in turn, has made it difficult to assign specific roles to individual AGPs. Despite significant physiological interest in AGPs, there are few studies on glycoside hydrolases that cleave the sugar moieties of these proteins. It is important to study such enzymes because hydrolytic enzymes specific to particular sugar residues or to a type of glycosidic linkage would be useful tools in the structural analysis of AGPs. arabinogalactan protein p-nitrophenyl high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection Protein data bank. So far, we have focused on the β-1,3-β-1,6-galactan backbone, which is the common structure of heterogeneous AGPs, to identify glycoside hydrolases acting on AGPs. Galactanases that hydrolyze β-1,3- or β-1,6-galactosyl linkages are useful tools because the enzymes hydrolyze AGPs and produce the constituent carbohydrate moieties of AGPs. We cloned two kinds of galactanases: exo-β-1,3-galactanase (EC 3.2.1.145) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium and endo-β-1,6-galactanase (EC 3.2.1.164) from Trichoderma viride, and demonstrated that the enzymes were novel and could be classified as glycoside hydrolase family 43 (GH43) and family 5 (GH5), respectively (7Ichinose H. Yoshida M. Kotake T. Kuno A. Igarashi K. Tsumuraya Y. Samejima M. Hirabayashi J. Kobayashi H. Kaneko S. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4139) Google Scholar) (see the CAZy website). Genes encoding proteins similar to such enzymes were also identified in the Streptomyces avermitilis genome (10Ichinose H. Kotake T. Tsumuraya Y. Kaneko S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2006; 70: 2745-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Ichinose H. Kotake T. Tsumuraya Y. Kaneko S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 2379-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because S. avermitilis has two different kinds of galactanases, we focused on finding novel AGP-degrading enzymes. We have cultivated the actinomycete using gum arabic as a carbon source, and isolated a novel β-l-arabinopyranosidase. To the best of our knowledge, the only report on β-l-arabinosidase (EC 3.2.1.88) has been on its purification from Cajanus indicus (12Dey P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 302: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The amino acid composition of the enzyme was investigated (13Dey P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 746: 8-13Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but its sequence remains unknown. In this article, we cloned β-l-arabinopyranosidase from S. avermitilis (SaArap27A), analyzed its catalytic properties, and analyzed the crystal structure of the recombinant enzyme. The results clearly showed that this enzyme is β-l-arabinopyranosidase and is a novel member of the glycoside hydrolase family 27 (GH27). This is the first detailed report on β-l-arabinopyranosidase. p-Nitrophenyl glycosides (PNP glycosides) (such as PNP-β-l-arabinopyranoside (PNP-β-l-Arap), PNP-α-l-arabinopyranoside, PNP-α-l-arabinofuranoside, PNP-α-galactopyranoside (PNP-α-Galp), PNP-β-galactopyranoside, PNP-α-glucopyranoside, PNP-β-glucopyranoside, PNP-α-mannopyranoside, PNP-β-mannopyranoside, PNP-α-xylopyranoside, PNP-β-xylopyranoside, PNP-α-l-fucopyranoside, PNP-β-fucopyranoside, PNP-α-l-rhamnopyranoside, PNP-β-galacturonide, PNP-β-glucuronide, PNP-α-N-acetylgalactosaminide, PNP-β-N-acetylgalactosaminide, PNP-α-N-acetylglucosaminide, and PNP-β-N-acetylglucosaminide), larch arabinogalactan, guar gum, and locust bean gum were purchased from Sigma. Debranched arabinan and wheat arabinoxylan were from Megazyme International (Wicklow, Ireland). Gum arabic was obtained from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Corn hull arabinoxylan was from Nihon Syokuhin Kakoh (Fuji, Japan). Arabinan was prepared as previously (7Ichinose H. Yoshida M. Kotake T. Kuno A. Igarashi K. Tsumuraya Y. Samejima M. Hirabayashi J. Kobayashi H. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25820-25829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The sugar composition of the polysaccharides was analyzed as described previously (14Yang H. Ichinose H. Nakajima M. Kobayashi H. Kaneko S. Food Sci. Technol. Res. 2006; 12: 43-49Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 15Yoshida M. Liu Y. Uchida S. Kawarada K. Ukagami Y. Ichinose H. Kaneko S. Fukuda K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2008; 72: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Briefly, the substrate was hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid by incubating at 121 °C for 1 h, and the acid was evaporated under a stream of N2 gas. The sugar composition of the sample was analyzed by high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) using a CarboPacTM PA20 column (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, as reported earlier (15Yoshida M. Liu Y. Uchida S. Kawarada K. Ukagami Y. Ichinose H. Kaneko S. Fukuda K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2008; 72: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). S. avermitilis NBRC14893 was obtained from the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (Kazusa, Japan). The strain was grown on liquid medium containing 1% gum arabic, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% peptone, 0.5% potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and 0.05% magnesium sulfate (11Ichinose H. Kotake T. Tsumuraya Y. Kaneko S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 2379-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) in a baffle flask at 28 °C for 6 days. The culture was filtered, and the supernatant was used as the crude enzyme. The crude enzyme was concentrated 10-fold using a 100-kDa polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane (Biomax, Millipore Corp.). Ammonium sulfate was added with stirring to the concentrated fraction to 70% saturation. The precipitated protein was redissolved in 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 2 mm CaCl2 and dialyzed against the same buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare UK Ltd.; HR16/10 column, 0.8 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 2 mm CaCl2. β-l-Arabinopyranosidase activity was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m sodium chloride. The active fractions were combined, dialyzed against 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 2 mm CaCl2, and loaded onto a Mono S HR 5/5 cation-exchange column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the same buffer. β-l-Arabinopyranosidase activity was eluted by a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m sodium chloride. The pooled active fractions were assayed for total protein and β-l-arabinopyranosidase activity, and protein purity was determined by SDS-PAGE, according to the method of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). The pooled fractions from Mono S cation-exchange chromatography were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The N-terminal amino acid sequence was analyzed on an HP G105A protein sequencer (Hewlett Packard). The gene encoding a putative β-l-arabinopyranosidase (SAV_2186; GenBankTM accession number BAC69897) was cloned and expressed as a mature protein using the Streptomyces expression system as described previously (17Fujimoto Z. Ichinose H. Harazono K. Honda M. Uzura A. Kaneko S. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2009; 65: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, the full-length gene amplified from S. avermitilis genomic DNA by PCR was cloned into a Streptomyces expression vector (18Hatanaka T. Onaka H. Arima J. Uraji M. Uesugi Y. Usuki H. Nishimoto Y. Iwabuchi M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 62: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the plasmid was transformed into Streptomyces lividans 1326, which served as the host. The recombinant protein SaArap27A was secreted at high levels in the culture broth and was purified on lactosyl-Sepharose as described previously (19Ito S. Kuno A. Suzuki R. Kaneko S. Kawabata Y. Kusakabe I. Hasegawa T. J. Biotechnol. 2004; 110: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The protein was detected by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The final preparation thus obtained was used as the purified enzyme. The E99D mutant of SaArap27A was generated by PCR using appropriate primers (supplemental Table S1). Mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of the mutant were carried out in the same way as for the wild-type enzyme. β-l-Arabinopyranosidase activity was determined using a mixture containing 25 μl of 2 mm PNP-β-l-Arap, 20 μl of McIlvaine buffer (0.2 m Na2HPO4 and 0.1 m citric acid, pH 4.0), and 5 μl of enzyme solution. The reactions were carried out at 40 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 0.2 m Na2CO3. The amount of PNP released was detected at 400 nm (extinction coefficient = 19,200 m−1 cm−1). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 μmol of PNP per minute. The protein amounts were determined by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The effects of pH and temperature on enzyme activity were investigated as described previously (7Ichinose H. Yoshida M. Kotake T. Kuno A. Igarashi K. Tsumuraya Y. Samejima M. Hirabayashi J.

Biotechnol. 2008; 80: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The following buffers were used to study the effect of pH on β-l-arabinopyranosidase activity: McIlvaine buffer (pH 2.6–7.6), Atkins-Pantin buffer (pH 7.6–11.0), and glycine-HCl buffer (pH 1–2.6). The activity of β-l-arabinopyranosidase was assayed under the conditions described above. The effects of metal ions and chemicals on enzyme activity were also examined by treatment with 2 mm solutions of metal ions, including Ca2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Hg2+, and Ag2+, and with 2 mm solutions of chemicals such as EDTA, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, and SDS. The substrate specificity of SaArap27A toward various PNP glycosides was determined. The assay method was identical to that described for PNP-β-l-Arap. The kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutants of SaArap27A were determined as follows. The reactions were performed in McIlvaine buffer (pH 4.0) containing 0.5–5 mm substrates, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 2.6–260 nm enzyme at 37 °C for up to 15 min. The amount of PNP released was determined from the absorbance at 400 nm. The assay was performed in triplicate. The substrate specificity of SaArap27A toward polysaccharides was also determined at 40 °C in McIlvaine buffer (pH 4.0) with 0.5% (w/v) polysaccharide as the substrate and 2.6 μm enzyme. After incubation for the appropriate reaction time, the initial hydrolysis rate was determined by the Somogyi-Nelson method (21Somogyi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 19-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for 24 h, the amount of released arabinose was quantified by the HPAEC-PAD system using a CarboPac™ PA1 column (Dionex Corp.) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, as described previously (20Ichinose H. Yoshida M. Fujimoto Z. Kaneko S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 80: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The substrate hydrolysis rate was estimated by assuming that 100% l-arabinose was released from the substrate. Crystallization procedures and native data collection have been reported elsewhere (17Fujimoto Z. Ichinose H. Harazono K. Honda M. Uzura A. Kaneko S. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2009; 65: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 22Yao M. Yasutake Y. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The data collection statistics are summarized in Table 3. The Matthews coefficient was calculated to be 2.38 Å3 Da−1 (23Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar), and this indicated that the asymmetric unit of the crystal contained two SaArap27A molecules corresponding to a solvent content of 48.3% in the crystal. Crystals complexed with l-arabinose or galactose were prepared by adding the same volume of the reservoir solution containing 10% sugar into the crystal drop one night prior to x-ray exposure. The data for the sugar complexes were collected at beamline BL-6A at the Photon Factory, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan. The crystals were mounted in a 0.3-mm quartz glass capillary and flash cooled under a nitrogen stream at 95 K. Diffraction data were collected with 20-s exposures for 1° oscillations for a total of 360° at a wavelength of 0.978 Å with a Quantum R4 CCD detector (ADSC, CA). Data were integrated and scaled using the DENZO and Scalepack programs in the HKL2000 program suite (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar) up to a resolution of 1.9 Å. The crystal structure was first analyzed by the molecular replacement method using the 1.5-Å resolution ligand-free data. Homology models of the first two domains and the C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module family 13 (CBM13) of SaArap27A were built with the MODELER program (Accelrys Software Inc., San Diego, CA) using the known crystal structures of rice α-galactosidase and CBM13 of Streptomyces olivaceoviridis β-xylanase (SoCBM13), respectively, as reference models (25Fujimoto Z.

Kusakabe I. Mizuno H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The first run of the MOLREP program (27Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 program suite (28Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr... 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) using the α-galactosidase-derived model as the reference against the native data resulted in two prominent solutions yielding an R factor of 0.553. This was followed by restrained refinement of the resultant models with the REFMAC5 program (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). With the refined models fixed, the second run of MOLREP using the CBM13-derived model as the reference yielded two solutions resulting in an R factor of 0.501. The second run of restrained refinement yielded an R factor of 0.433 and figure of merit of 0.521, and the resultant electron density map was sufficient for tracing the overall structure of two β-l-arabinopyranosidase molecules. The model was initially built using the automodeling program ARP/wARP (30Cohen S.X. Morris R.J. Fernandez F.J. Ben Jelloul M. Kakaris M. Parthasarathy V. Lamzin V.S. Kleywegt G.J. Perrakis A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2222-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and several cycles of manual rebuilding and refinement followed using COOT (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23387) Google Scholar) and REFMAC5 programs. In addition to the protein, models of water, glycerol, polyethylene glycol, sulfate ion, and HEPES were included. Structural analyses of the l-arabinose and galactose complexes were performed by isomorphous replacement, and the bound sugar molecules were identified by the Fobs − Fcalc electron density map. The structure refinement statistics are shown in Table 3. The stereochemistry of the models was analyzed by the PROCHECK program (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Figures were prepared using MOLSCRIPT (33Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER3D (34Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). S. avermitilis was cultivated in liquid medium using gum arabic as the sole carbon source. The enzyme activities of the culture supernatant were tested using various PNP glycosides (see supplemental Fig. S1A). Interestingly, the culture supernatant showed the highest activity toward PNP-β-l-Arap among all tested substrates. To analyze the enzymatic activity, we partially purified β-l-arabinopyranosidase from the culture supernatant of S. avermitilis (Table 1). After cation-exchange chromatography, the enzyme appeared as a major band of a 64-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S2, lane 2, indicated by the arrow). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein was determined to be AVTTRQITVPSA. A BLASTP search against the S. avermitilis NBRC14893 sequence data base revealed that the determined amino acid sequence corresponded to the open reading frame SAV_2186. The open reading frame SAV_2186 of S. avermitilis (1977 bp) encoded a putative β-l-arabinopyranosidase (658 amino acids) (Fig. 1, SaArap27A). The N-terminal 12-amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme corresponds to amino acid residues 45–56 of the deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. 1, underlined). The N terminus (amino acids 1–44) was consistent with the signal sequence predicted by SignalP.TABLE 1Purification of native SaArap27A from the culture supernatant of S. avermitilisPurification stepTotal volumeTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmlmgunitsunits/mg-fold%Crude enzyme400034401690.0491100Ammonium sulfate precipitation281001081.12264SP-Sepharose Fast Flow193.2247.615414Mono S51232142912 Open table in a new tab Similar investigations of the deduced amino acids indicated that this enzyme has a modular architecture. Residues 45–430 of the protein showed high sequence similarity to GH27 enzymes, whereas residues 532–658 showed similarity to CBM13 (Fig. 1). Among the proteins whose three-dimensional structures have been determined, the deduced amino acid sequence corresponding to the catalytic module of SaArap27A (residues 45–345) resembled the sequences of the following proteins: rice α-galactosidase (41% identity and 56% similarity; Protein Data Bank entry 1UAS), chicken α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (34% identity and 47% similarity; PDB entry 1KTC), human α-galactosidase (33% identity and 47% similarity; PDB entry 1R47), α-galactosidase from Hypocrea jecorina (32% identity and 45% similarity; PDB entry 1SZN), and a putative α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from Bacillus halodurans (22% identity and 36% similarity; PDB entry 3CC1). In SaArap27A, two aspartic acids that are the catalytic residues of the GH27 enzymes are conserved (Fig. 1, indicated by the asterisk). Based on the crystal structures, almost all of the amino acids involved in sugar binding were conserved, but only one aspartic acid, which coordinates to the O6 atom of the bound sugar, was replaced by glutamic acid (Glu99) in SaArap27A. On the other hand, CBM13 of SaArap27A (SaCBM13) was similar to certain structural elements in the following proteins whose three-dimensional structures have been elucidated: the xylan-binding domain chain A from S. olivaceoviridis (SoCBM13, 55% identity and 67% similarity; PDB entry 1XYF_A), xylan-binding domain chain A from S. lividans (SlCBM13, 51% identity and 67% similarity; PDB entry 1KNL_A), ebulin chain B1 from Sambucus ebulus (34% identity and 54% similarity; PDB entry 1HWM_B), agglutinin chain B from Abrus precatorius (35% identity and 49% similarity; PDB entry 2Q3N_B), and ricin chain B from Ricinus communis (34% identity and 48% similarity; PDB entry 2AAI_B). The DNA fragment encoding the full-length protein was cloned. Recombinant protein SaArap27A was successfully expressed in S. lividans in the secreted form and purified as a single band with an apparent molecular size of 64 kDa on SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S2, lane 3); this was in agreement with the size of the native enzyme (supplemental Fig. S2, lane 2, indicated by the arrow). Using PNP-β-l-Arap as the substrate, maximal enzyme activity was detected at pH 4.0 and 40 °C. The enzyme was stable between pH 4.0 and 8.0 at 30 °C for 1 h and was also stable below 45 °C for 1 h (supplemental Fig. S3). Some metal ions and chemicals did not affect the enzyme activity, but Hg2+, Ag2+, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, and SDS completely inhibited the enzyme activity (data not shown). The specific activity of SaArap27A with PNP-β-l-Arap as the substrate was 18 units/mg, which is almost the same as that of the native enzyme (21 units/mg, see Table 1). The activities of SaArap27A toward various PNP glycosides were tested (supplemental Table S2). The enzyme was active on PNP-β-l-Arap. It also showed weak activity toward PNP-α-Galp and 1.5% activity toward PNP-β-l-Arap but did not hydrolyze any other PNP glycosides, including PNP-α-N-acetylgalactosaminide. Because the structure of β-l-arabinose and α-galactose are similar, kinetic study was performed using PNP-β-l-Arap and PNP-α-d-Galp. β-l-Arabinopyranose and α-galactopyranose have similar orientations of hydrogen and hydroxyl groups at C-2, C-3, and C-4. The only difference is the presence of the hydroxymethyl group at C-5 in α-galactopyranose (supplemental Fig. S1B, see also Fig. 3). The Km and kcat values of SaArap27A for PNP-β-l-Arap were 3.6 ± 0.4 mm and 317 ± 10 min−1, respectively (see Table 4). In contrast, a significant difference in the kcat value was observed when PNP-α-d-Galp was used as the substrate. The Km and kcat values of SaArap27A for PNP-α-d-Galp were 5.1 ± 0.3 mm and 2.3 ± 0.1 min−1, respectively (see Table 4). The substrate specificities of the enzyme toward polysaccharides were investigated. The enzyme hydrolyzed gum arabic and larch arabinogalactan but not guar gum, locust bean gum, arabinan, debranched arabinan, wheat arabinoxylan, or corn hull arabinoxylan. SaArap27A removed 0.1% l-arabinose from gum arabic or 45% l-arabinose from larch arabinogalactan (Table 2). The reaction products of gum arabic by SaArap27A were analyzed by HPAEC-PAD, and the only l-arabinose was detected (supplemental Fig. S4). These data suggest that SaArap27A is a β-l-arabinopyranosidase.TABLE 2Substrate specificity of SaArap27A toward polysaccharidesSubstrateSugar compositionHydrolysis ratemol%Gum arabicRha:Ara:Gal:GlcA = 40:56:11:100.1aThe l-arabinose content in the residue after the enzymatic reaction was determined, and the hydrolysis rate was estimated by assuming that 100% arabinose was released from the substrate.Larch arabinogalactanAra:Gal = 10:5145aThe l-arabinose content in the residue after the enzymatic reaction was determined, and the hydrolysis rate was estimated by assuming that 100% arabinose was released from the substrate.a The l-arabinose content in the residue after the enzymatic reaction was determined, and the hydrolysis rate was estimated by assuming that 100% arabinose was released from the substrate.

The identities of these glycans, however, and how they are harvested is presently unknown. The biochemical and high resolution x-ray crystallographic analysis of two family 98 glycoside hydrolases (GH98s) from distinctive forms of the fucose utilization operon that originate from different S. pneumoniae strains reveal that one enzyme, the predominant type among pneumococcal isolates, has a unique endo-beta-galactosidase activity on the LewisY antigen. Altered active site topography in the other species of GH98 enzyme tune its endo-beta-galactosidase activity to the blood group A and B antigens. Despite their different specificities, these enzymes, and by extension all family 98 glycoside hydrolases, use an inverting catalytic mechanism. Many bacterial and viral pathogens exploit host carbohydrate antigens for adherence as a precursor to colonization or infection. However, this is the first evidence of bacterial endoglycosidase enzymes that are known to play a role in virulence and are specific for distinct host carbohydrate antigens. The strain-specific distribution of two distinct types of GH98 enzymes further suggests that S. pneumoniae strains may specialize to exploit host-specific antigens that vary from host to host, a factor that may feature in whether a strain is capable of colonizing a host or establishing an invasive infection."

Here, we demonstrated that chicken microRNA-26a (gga-mir-26a) is a key posttranscriptional regulator of photoreceptor L-type voltage-gated calcium channel α1C subunit (L-VGCCα1C) expression, and its own expression has a diurnal rhythm, thereby explaining the rhythmic nature of L-VGCCα1Cs.

In photoreceptors, L-VGCC activities are under circadian control, which are higher at night and lower during the day. Interestingly, the mRNA level of VGCCα1D oscillates, but those for VGCCα1C do not. However, the protein expression of both VGCCα1C and α1D are higher at night in cone photoreceptors. The underlying mechanism regulating L-VGCCα1C protein expression was not clear until now. In vitro targeting reporter assays verified that gga-mir-26a specifically targeted the L-VGCCα1C 3′-untranslated region, and gga-mir-26a expression in the retina peaked during the day. After transfection with gga-mir-26a, L-VGCCα1C protein expression and L-VGCC current density decreased. Therefore, the rhythmic expression of gga-mir-26a regulated the protein expression of the L-VGCCα1C subunit. Additionally, both CLOCK (circadian locomoter output cycles kaput) and CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein-1) activated gga-mir-26a expression in vitro.

MicroRNA-219 and mir-132 influence the core oscillator in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master clock.

Other miRNAs, such as mir-181a, mir-125b, mir-26a, mir-124a, mir-204, and mir-30c are expressed in different retina neurons, including photoreceptors (5Xu S. Witmer P.D. Lumayag S. Kovacs B. Valle D.

We previously brought to light how two ion channels are regulated by the circadian oscillators in chicken cone photoreceptors (18Ko G.Y. Ko M.L. Dryer S.E.

The cGMP-gated cation channels (CNGCs) and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs) are both more active during the subjective night; however, the means by which the circadian oscillators control them are different. For CNGCs (18Ko G.Y. Ko M.L. Dryer S.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Ko G.Y. Ko M.L. Dryer S.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3145-3153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the apparent affinity for cGMP, the activating ligand, is higher during the subjective night than the subjective day, in which the ERK-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway plays a key role (18Ko G.Y. Ko M.L. Dryer S.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Ko G.Y. Ko M.L. Dryer S.E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Maximum CNGC current is constant throughout the day, implying channel density remains constant. For L-VGCCs, current amplitudes are higher at night, and indeed channel expression in the cell membrane is higher at this time (19Ko M.L. Liu Y. Dryer S.E. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Ko M.L. Jian K. Shi L. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1607-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As with CNGCs, the ERK pathway plays a key role in the circadian regulation of L-VGCCs. However, in addition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway plays an equally important role in the circadian modulation of L-VGCCs (26Ko M.L. Jian K. Shi L. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1607-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The L-type VGCC is composed of four polypeptide subunits (α1(c, d, f), α2δ1, β, and γ), and the channel opens upon membrane depolarization, which allows calcium to enter neurons or muscle cells (27Bodi I. Mikala G. Koch S.E. Akhter S.A. Schwartz A. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 3306-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The L-VGCCα1 subunits contain four transmembrane motifs and a long C-terminal regulatory domain, through which channel gating properties can be regulated by direct binding of calmodulin, phosphorylation, and other modifications (28Barnes S. Kelly M.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 514: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Morgans C.W. Bayley P.R. Oesch N.W. Ren G. Akileswaran L. Taylor W.R. Vis.

Chem. 2005; 280: 29612-29619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In chicken photoreceptors, the protein expression of the L-VGCCα1D subunit is higher during the subjective night with its mRNA levels peaking a few hours ahead (19Ko M.L. Liu Y. Dryer S.E. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the mRNA levels of L-VGCCα1C, as detected by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), do not change significantly throughout the day, the distribution of the L-VGCCα1C subunit in the cell membrane of cone photoreceptors shows a circadian rhythm (19Ko M.L. Liu Y. Dryer S.E. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism underlying the circadian regulation of L-VGCCα1C in photoreceptors was not clear. To address this question, we investigated whether there were posttranscriptional regulation mechanisms that could affect L-VGCCα1C protein expression. In our study detailed below, we showed that in the chicken retina, chicken mir-26a (gga-mir-26a) specifically targeted the L-VGCCα1C 3′-untranslated region (UTR) and inhibited L-VGCC channel activities in cone photoreceptors. The expression of gga-mir-26a was under circadian control, with levels higher during the day. As a result, gga-mir-26a modulated the protein expression of L-VGCCα1C in a circadian manner. Interestingly, both CLOCK (circadian locomoter output cycles kaput) and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) were able to induce gga-mir26a expression in vitro. Hence, the circadian regulation of L-VGCCα1C subunit expression was through gga-mir-26a in the chicken retina. Fertilized eggs (Gallus gallus) were obtained from the Poultry Science Department, Texas A&M University (College Station, TX). Chicken embryos from embryonic day 11 (E11) were entrained to 12:12 h light-dark (LD) cycles at 39 °C in ovo. Zeitgeber time 0 (ZT 0) was designated as the time when the lights came on, and ZT 12 was the time when the lights went off. After LD entrainment for 6 days in ovo, retinas were dissected out for biochemistry or molecular biology analysis at various Zeitgeber times of the day. Chicken genomic DNA was prepared from the retina by homogenization in 500 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 500 μg/ml proteinase K. Protein digestion was carried out at 50 °C overnight. The DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform and precipitated by 70% ethanol (31Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 6.4-6.12Google Scholar). The genomic DNA was used for PCR amplification of the gga-mir-26a and gga-mir-124a precursor sequences, the L-VGCCα1C 3′-UTR fragment, and the gga-mir-26a promoter. All PCR products were purified by a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and cloned into pGEM Teasy (gga-mir-26a precursor and gga-mir-26a promoter; Promega, Madison, WI) or pBluescript II (L-VGCCα1C 3′-UTR; Stratagene, La Jolla, Ca) cloning vectors for sequence analysis. The gga-mir-26a precursor sequence was later ligated into a small RNA expression vector pSilencer 2.1-U6 neo (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), whereas the gga-mir-26a promoter was ligated into a pGL3b vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The point mutation for the L-VGCCα1C 3′-UTR was prepared using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The multimer 3′-UTR fragment was constructed by repeated ligation of the same fragment into the SpeI/XbaI site of a pBSII vector. The final four repeat fragment was cut out and ligated into pGL3-TK-Luc (XbaI; Promega). The 2-kb gga-mir-26a promoter region, the −150 to +1 promoter fragment (Δ-2kb−150), and the −2kb−300 promoter fragment (Δ−300-+1) were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGL3b. The E box region-specific deletion mutation of the gga-mir-26a promoter was constructed by direct ligation of the −150–+1 and −2kb−300 promoter fragments into pGL3b (SacI/NheI/XhoI). Mouse Clock (MGC-190424) and CREB (MGC-14010) clones were purchased from Invitrogen and constructed into each expression vector.

Transfections were carried out using the TransIT®-COS transfection kit (Mirus, Madison, WI). For miRNA targeting assays, cells were cultured in 24-well plates and transfected with control or gga-mir-26a expression vector in combination with a reporter construct, TK-Luc4XWT (wild type) or TK-luc4Xmt (mutated) (150 ng each). TK-Luc4XWT contains a thymidine kinase (TK) minimum promoter that triggers luciferase (Luc) expression. Four copies of the control wild type (WT) gga-mir-26a target region from the chicken L-VGCCα1C 3′-UTR were inserted between the Luc coding sequence and SV40 poly(A) tail. TK-Luc4Xmt was similarly constructed except that it contained four repeats of a point-mutated mir-26a target sequence. The luciferase reporter assays (Promega) were performed 48 h after transfection, and relative luciferase activity was determined by luminosity (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All luciferase activities were normalized against protein content. For promoter reporter assays, cells were cultured in 24-well plates and co-transfected with a promoter construct (I, II, III, or IV, as indicated in Fig. 5 and under “Results”) plus pCMV-CREB or pSG5-CLOCK (150 ng each). pCDNA3.1 empty vector served as the control. Luciferase activity was determined as above. The Q-PCR primers for the chicken L-VGCCα1C subunit were the same as previously described (19Ko M.L. Liu Y. Dryer S.E. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The forward and reverse primers for chicken Bmal1 were 5′-ATACAGAAGCCAACTATAAGCCTGCT-3′ and 5′-CTGTAGTTGAGGATCTTGAAGACAGA-3′, respectively. The sequence for the 5′ fluorescent labeled oligonucleotide probe was 5′-AAATCCATCTGCTGCCCTGAG-3′ (Applied Biosystems). The QuantiMir Kit from SBI System Bioscience (Mountain View, CA) was used for Q-PCR detection of gga-mir-26a. Chicken E11 embryos were entrained in ovo under LD cycles for 6 days, and whole retinas were harvested at ZT 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20. Total RNA was prepared by the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The 3′ universal primer for Q-PCR was provided by the manufacturer. The 5′ primer for gga-mir-26a was 5′-TTCAAGTAATCCAGGATAGGC-3′. SYBR-green based Q-PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) was used for PCR amplification (40 cycles). Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR amplification of the gga-mir-26a precursor was done at two time points, ZT 5 and ZT 17. The PCR primers were as follows: forward, 5′-GTCACCTGGTTCAAGTAATC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGTTACTTGCACTGGGAGGC-3′. The PCR fragments were separated on a 2.0% agarose gel, and band intensity was analyzed by Scion Image software. Chicken retinas from E11 were dissociated, cultured, and entrained under LD cycles for 6 days and then kept in constant darkness (DD) in the presence of 40 ng/ml ciliary neurotrophic factor (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, as described previously (32Shi L. Jian K. Ko M.L. Trump D. Ko G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3966-3975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the last day of LD, cells were transfected using a biolistic particle delivery system (Helium Gene Gun; Bio-Rad) according to previous descriptions (26Ko M.L. Jian K. Shi L. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1607-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Shi L. Jian K. Ko M.L. Trump D. Ko G.Y. J. Biol.

The plasmid encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) is commercially available (Vitality® hrGFPII-1 mammalian expression vector; Stratagene). In these experiments, gga-mir-26a or the empty vector was co-transfected with the GFP plasmid. After transfection, cells remained in culture under DD for a day before electrophysiological recordings were performed at night (ZT 16–19). Cardiomyocytes were dissociated and cultured from E12 embryos. The culture medium for cardiomyocytes contained Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum. Conditions for transfection were the same for photoreceptors and cardiomyocytes. The antagomir specifically targeting mature gga-mir-26a (anti-mir-26a) was purchased from Dharmacon (Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO). The sequence was 5′-GsCsCsUsAsUsCsCsUsGsGsAsUsUsAsCsUsUsGsA-3′. The subscript “s” represents a phosphorothioate linkage. Each nucleotide was modified by 2′-O-methylation, which allows the antagomir to function as an irreversible, stoichiometric inhibitor of targeted microRNAs (33Berger E.M. Dubrovsky E.B. Appleby L. Dubrovskaya V. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 2005; 41: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Transfections of anti-mir-26a were done by the same biolistic particle delivery system as described above with a molecular ratio of 20:1 to the phrGFPII-1 vector. In these experiments, chicken retina cells (E11) were cultured and LD entrained for 6 days as described earlier. Electrophysiological recordings were performed the day after transfection at ZT 4–8. For retina electrophysiological recordings, perforated patch recordings of L-VGCCs were carried out as described previously (19Ko M.L. Liu Y. Dryer S.E. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Shi L. Jian K. Ko M.L. Trump D. Ko G.Y. J. Biol.

The external solution contained the following: 110 mm NaCl, 10 mm BaCl2, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 5.3 mm KCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm HEPES, and 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. The pipette solution was: 135 mm cesium acetate, 10 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH. β-Escin was prepared as a 50 mm stock solution in water and added to the pipette solution to yield a final concentration of 30–50 μm. Recordings were made from cone photoreceptors characterized morphologically as cells with elongated cell bodies with one or more prominent oil droplets. Recordings of cardiomyocyte L-VGCCs were performed using suction-formed whole cell patch configuration. The cardiomyocyte recording solutions were modified from Tohse et al. (34Tohse N. Mészáros J. Sperelakis N. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The external solution was 145 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 9 mm BaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.1 mm NiCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with CsOH or tetraethylammonium hydroxide. The pipette solution was 125 mm cesium acetate, 20 mm CsCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH. The current density (Idensity) was obtained by dividing the current amplitude by the membrane capacitance. Each group contained 9–18 cells. All of the data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test for unbalanced n were used for statistical analysis. *, p < 0.05 was regarded as significant throughout. Retina cells after transfection on glass coverslips were fixed with Zamboni's fixative in phosphate buffer (PB; 0.1 mol/liter, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 22–24 °C and methanol at −20 °C for 20 min. Cells were washed in PB containing 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100/PB containing 3% normal goat serum for 1 h, and then incubated overnight with a primary antibody against VGCCα1C (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) at a dilution of 1:100. The next day, cells were washed with PB and incubated with a fluorescent conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa 594 nm goat anti-rabbit; Molecular Probes, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) in PB containing 1.5% normal goat serum for 1 h in the dark. After several washes in PB, the coverslips were mounted on a glass slide and stored at 4 °C for later observation on a Zeiss microscope with epifluorescence to determine the localization of L-VGCCα1C. The average fluorescence intensities per pixel (F) of the outlined structures were analyzed without any modification using the luminosity channel of the histogram function in Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (19Ko M.L. Liu Y. Dryer S.E. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Ko M.L. Jian K. Shi L. Ko G.Y. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1607-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Three cells (F1, F2, and F3) from each experiment were measured. The background fluorescence intensity was acquired from an adjacent area without any cells (B). The relative fluorescence intensity from one single image of a particular condition was converted as ((F1 − B) + (F2 − B) + (F3 − B))/3. There were four repetitions for each condition, statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was regarded as significant. All fluorescence intensity analyses were carried out blind. To investigate the potential involvement of retinal miRNAs in the posttranscriptional regulation of the L-VGCCα1C subunit, several miRNA target prediction algorithms were applied for the primary screening process (available from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center microRNA, PicTar, and TargetScan Human web sites). We established several criteria to eliminate false positives. First, the miRNAs and the target site in the 3′-UTR must be highly conserved among humans, mice, and chickens. Second, the fist eight bases from the 5′-end of the miRNAs must perfectly complement the sequence of the target. Third, the free energy, ΔG, for the miRNA approach toward the target site cannot exceed −15 kcal/mol. Concurrently, ΔG from the flanking sequences of the target site (∼40 bp) must be lower than miRNA targeting free energy (35Bengert P. Dandekar T. Brief Bioinform. 2005; 6: 72-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 36Zhao Y. Samal E. Srivastava D. Nature. 2005; 436: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). This criterion reduced the possibility of mistakenly choosing miRNA whose binding to the target site could be impeded by the secondary structure of the flanking regions. Based on these criteria, we were able to narrow down our choices to nine miRNAs (mir-19a, mir-19b, mir-26a, mir-26b/mir-1297, mir-33, mir-96/mir-1271, and mir-155) of 150 predicted candidate miRNAs. Our last elimination criterion was that the candidate miRNA must be highly expressed in the retina. Recently, several miRNAs have been shown to b"
https://openalex.org/W2116910123,"The objective of this study was to determine whether surface-modified nanoparticles enhance permeability across nasal mucosa, while retaining the effectiveness of the payload. The uptake and permeability of polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs; FluoSpheres) was evaluated across the various regions of the bovine nasal epithelia following conjugation with deslorelin and transferrin. Uptake and transport of PS-NPs, deslorelin-PS-NPs, and transferrin-PS-NPs exhibited regional differences in the order: inferior turbinate posterior (ITP) > medium turbinate posterior (MTP) > medium turbinate anterior (MTA). Uptake and transport also exhibited directionality and temperature dependence in these tissues. Further, uptake as well as transport of functionalized nanoparticles could be inhibited by excess free functionalizing ligand. Confocal microscopy indicated the presence of functionalized nanoparticles in respiratory epithelial cells, as well as other cell types of the nasal tissue. We chose the ITP region for further studies with deslorelin or transferrin-conjugated poly-l-lactide-co-glycolide nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) encapsulating an anti-VEGF intraceptor (Flt23k) plasmid. Transport of the nanoparticles, as well as the plasmid from the nanoparticles, exhibited the following order: transferrin-PLGA-NPs > deslorelin-PLGA-NPs > PLGA-NPs >> plasmid. The ability of the nanoparticles transported across the nasal tissue to retain the effectiveness of the Flt23k plasmid was evaluated by measuring transfection efficiency (percentage of cells expressing GFP) and VEGF inhibition in LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Transfection efficiencies and VEGF inhibition in LNCaP and PC-3 cells exhibited the following trend: transferrin-PLGA-NPs >or= deslorelin-PLGA-NPs > PLGA-NPs >> plasmid. Further, functionalized nanoparticles exhibited transfection efficiencies and VEGF inhibition significantly superior compared with the routinely used transfecting agent, lipofectamine. Formulating plasmids into nanoparticulate delivery systems enhances the transnasal delivery and gene therapy at remote target cancer cells, which can be further enhanced by nanoparticle functionalization with deslorelin or transferrin."
https://openalex.org/W1968619706,"Clostridium perfringens type A food poisoning (FP) is usually caused by C. perfringens type A strains that carry a chromosomal enterotoxin gene (cpe) and produce spores with exceptional resistance against heat and nitrites. Previous studies showed that the extreme resistance of spores made by most FP strains is mediated, in large part, by a variant of small acid soluble protein 4 (Ssp4) that has Asp at residue 36; in contrast, the sensitive spores made by other C. perfringens type A isolates contain an Ssp4 variant with Gly at residue 36.The current study has further characterized Ssp4 properties and expression. Spores made by cpe-positive type C and D strains were found to contain the Ssp4 variant with Gly at residue 36 and were shown to be heat- and nitrite-sensitive; this finding may help to explain why cpe-positive type C and D isolates rarely cause food poisoning. Saturation mutagenesis indicated that both amino acid size and charge at Ssp4 residue 36 are important for DNA binding and for spore resistance. C. perfringens Ssp2 was shown to bind preferentially to GC-rich DNA on gel-shift assays, while Ssp4 preferred binding to AT-rich DNA sequences. Maximal spore heat and nitrite resistance required production of all four C. perfringens Ssps, indicating that these Ssps act cooperatively to protect the spore's DNA, perhaps by binding to different chromosomal sequences. The Ssp4 variant with Asp at residue 36 was also shown to facilitate exceptional spore survival at freezer and refrigerator temperatures. Finally, Ssp4 expression was shown to be dependent upon Spo0A, a master regulator.Collectively, these results provide additional support for the importance of Ssps, particularly the Ssp4 variant with Asp at residue 36, for the extreme spore resistance phenotype that likely contributes to C. perfringens type A food poisoning transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2076551678,"Akt, an essential component of the insulin pathway, is a potent inducer of tissue growth. One of Akt's phosphorylation targets is Tsc2, an inhibitor of the anabolic kinase TOR. This could account for part of Akt's growth promoting activity. Although phosphorylation of Tsc2 by Akt does occur in vivo, and under certain circumstances can lead to reduced Tsc2 activity, the functional significance of this event is unclear since flies lacking Akt phosphorylation sites on Tsc2 are viable and normal in size and growth rate. Since Drosophila Tsc1, the obligate partner of Tsc2, has an Akt phosphorylation motif that is not conserved in mammals, we investigate here whether Akt redundantly phosphorylates the Tsc complex on Tsc1 and Tsc2. We provide evidence that Akt phosphorylates Tsc1 at Ser533. We show that flies lacking Akt phosphorylation sites on Tsc1 alone, or on both Tsc1 and Tsc2 concurrently, are viable and normal in size. This shows that phosphorylation of the Tsc1/2 complex by Akt is not required for Akt to activate TORC1 and to promote tissue growth in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2031663156,"Binding of the host complement regulator, factor H (FH), by some pathogenic microbes constitutes an important virulence mechanism, whereby complement is broken down to help microbes survive in the host. Although it has been hypothesized for the past two decades that GBS type III binds FH via sialic acid present on its capsule, neither the binding of FH to GBS has been demonstrated nor the mechanism of interaction identified. We observed that FH bound to both wild-type and capsule or sialic acid-deficient GBS that were used as negative controls. Wild-type and acapsular GBS were incubated with serum or pure FH degraded almost 90% of C3b, suggesting that the GBS-bound FH maintained cofactor activity. In addition, dot-blot analysis showed approximately 5-10% of C5 and C9 formation, as compared to an Escherichia coli control, suggesting breakdown at the C3b level. Protease treatment of the bacteria completely abolished binding of FH. Using overlay assays and mass spectroscopic analysis, we identified the FH receptor as the streptococcal histidine triad (SHT) surface protein. The ability of binding FH to SHT was further confirmed by using recombinant SHT. This report describes the identification of the SHT as an FH-binding protein on the surface of GBS type III, revealing a novel mechanism by which the bacterium acquires FH to evade complement opsonization."
https://openalex.org/W2092880174,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common hereditary disease in humans. Recent studies have shown an increasing number of ciliary genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of PKD. In this study, the Gli-similar3 (glis3) gene was identified as the causal gene of the medaka pc mutant, a model of PKD. In the pc mutant, a transposon was found to be inserted into the fourth intron of the pc/glis3 gene, causing aberrant splicing of the pc/glis3 mRNA and thus a putatively truncated protein with a defective zinc finger domain. pc/glis3 mRNA is expressed in the epithelial cells of the renal tubules and ducts of the pronephros and mesonephros, and also in the pancreas. Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of pc/glis3 resulted in cyst formation in the pronephric tubules of medaka fry. Although three other glis family members, glis1a, glis1b and glis2, were found in the medaka genome, none were expressed in the embryonic or larval kidney. In the pc mutant, the urine flow rate in the pronephros was significantly reduced, which was considered to be a direct cause of renal cyst formation. The cilia on the surface of the renal tubular epithelium were significantly shorter in the pc mutant than in wild-type, suggesting that shortened cilia resulted in a decrease in driving force and, in turn, a reduction in urine flow rate. Most importantly, EGFP-tagged pc/glis3 protein localized in primary cilia as well as in the nucleus when expressed in mouse renal epithelial cells, indicating a strong connection between pc/glis3 and ciliary function. Unlike human patients with GLIS3 mutations, the medaka pc mutant shows none of the symptoms of a pancreatic phenotype, such as impaired insulin expression and/or diabetes, suggesting that the pc mutant may be suitable for use as a kidney-specific model for human GLIS3 patients."

Chagas disease is one of the leading causes of heart failure in Latin America and remains without an effective treatment other than cardiac transplantation. C57BL/6 mice were infected with 103 trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi, and chronic chagasic mice were treated with G-CSF or saline (control). Evaluations following treatment were functional, immunological, and histopathological. Comparing hearts of G-CSF-treated mice showed reduced inflammation and fibrosis compared to saline-treated chagasic mice. G-CSF treatment did not alter the parasite load but caused an increase in the number of apoptotic inflammatory cells in the heart. Cardiac conductance disturbances in all infected animals improved or remained stable due to the G-CSF treatment, whereas all of the saline-treated mice deteriorated. The distance run on a treadmill and the exercise time were significantly greater in G-CSF-treated mice when compared to chagasic controls, as well as oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), and respiratory exchange ration (RER) during exercise. Administration of G-CSF in experimental cardiac ischemia had beneficial effects on cardiac structure, which were well correlated with improvements in cardiac function and whole animal performance.—Macambira, S.

https://openalex.org/W2041555783,"Jacob is a recently identified plasticity-related protein that couples N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activity to nuclear gene expression. An expression analysis by Northern blot and in situ hybridization shows that Jacob is almost exclusively present in brain, in particular in the cortex and the limbic system. Alternative splicing gives rise to multiple mRNA variants, all of which exhibit a prominent dendritic localization in the hippocampus. Functional analysis in primary hippocampal neurons revealed that a predominant cis-acting dendritic targeting element in the 3′-untranslated region of Jacob mRNAs is responsible for dendritic mRNA localization. In the mouse brain, Jacob transcripts are associated with both the fragile X mental retardation protein, a well described trans-acting factor regulating dendritic mRNA targeting and translation, and the kinesin family member 5C motor complex, which is known to mediate dendritic mRNA transport. Jacob is susceptible to rapid protein degradation in a Ca2+- and Calpain-dependent manner, and Calpain-mediated clipping of the myristoylated N terminus of Jacob is required for its nuclear translocation after N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation.

Following activation of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, Jacob is recruited to neuronal nuclei, and this in turn results in a rapid stripping of synaptic contacts and in a drastically altered morphology of the dendritic tree (6Dieterich D.C. Karpova A. Mikhaylova M. Zdobnova I. König I. Landwehr M. Kreutz M. Smalla K.H. Richter K. Landgraf P. Reissner C. Boeckers T.M. Zuschratter W. Spilker C. Seidenbecher C.I. Garner C.C.

Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e34Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, Jacob can trigger dephosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB and gene expression that destabilizes synaptic contacts. These events may be part of homoeostatic plasticity, i.e. the constant optimization of synaptic input of a given neuron (6Dieterich D.C. Karpova A. Mikhaylova M. Zdobnova I. König I. Landwehr M.

Thus, it seems likely that the balance between the nuclear and extra-nuclear pool of Jacob is highly dynamic and tightly controlled.

In the present study, we have investigated the local expression and turnover of Jacob in more detail. We identified a number of alternative splice products, all of which are largely restricted to the limbic system and cortex. In the hippocampus, all Jacob mRNAs exhibit a prominent dendritic localization, which is mediated by a dendritic targeting element (DTE) residing in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR). Jacob transcripts are associated both with KIF5c, a motor implicated in cytoplasmic transport of several dendritic mRNAs, and the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is thought to play a central role in both dendritic trafficking (9Kanai Y.

Interestingly, Jacob is a very unstable protein that is rapidly degraded in a Ca2+- and Calpain-sensitive manner. In conjunction with its dynamic translocation from dendrites to the nucleus, this might impose the necessity of replenishing the cytoplasmic protein pool by the local translation of dendritic mRNAs. Northern blot analysis was performed with a multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) according to published procedures (15Seidenbecher C.I. Langnaese K. Sanmartí-Vila L. Boeckers T.M. Smalla K.H.

Control experiments included hybridization with a sense probe and prior RNase treatment. Antisense oligonucleotides were deduced from the Jacob cDNA (accession number AJ293697): 5′-CAG GGC TGG CTC TCT AGA GAT GGT GTA CAC ACG GGG CTG G-3′ (Jacob-pan); 5′-TCT CCC GTT TCC GAC GCT TCC TCT CCG CGT AGC C-3′ (Jacob+exon6); 5′-GGA GTC GTG GGA GGT GTC GGC TTT CAT AGG GGT G-3′ (Jacob+exon8); 5′-AGG TGT TTG CGG AAG TTC GAT ATG GCT TGC ATA G-3′ (Jacob-exon6); 5′-GCT CTG TAG GTC ACT GCT CTG GGC CTT CAC CCG C-3′ (Jacob-exon8); and 5′-CCC ACG ACT CCC GAG ACA CTA ATC TCC TCC AAG GTG-3′ (Jacob-exon 9). The oligonucleotide sequence for tubulin-α probe was 5′-GGA CCA GAA TAA ACA TCC CTG TGA AAG CAG CAC CTT GTG AC-3′. Corresponding sense oligonucleotides were used as controls. Plasmids pNEu2432–3071 and pNEtub have been previously described (11Grossman A.W. Aldridge G.M. Weiler I.J. Greenough W.T. J Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7151-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).

In vivo time lapse imaging was done with a plasmid where EGFP is downstream of the coding region of Jacob (6Dieterich D.C. Karpova A. Mikhaylova M. Zdobnova I. König I. Landwehr M. Kreutz M.

PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e34Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For bacterial protein production the first 230 amino acids (nucleotides 134–824) of Jacob were cloned into pMALC2X. Wistar rats, Fmr1−/− mice (knock-out; B6.129P2-Fmr1tm1Cgr strain; Jackson Laboratory) and congenic C57BL/6J wild type mice were raised in the animal facility of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf or the Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology. Primary neurons were essentially prepared and transfected as described (17Blichenberg A. Schwanke B. Rehbein M. Garner C.C. Richter D. Kindler S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8818-8829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the neurons were grown in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) without glial feeder layer. Rat hippocampal neurons were transfected 8 days after plating (days in vitro (DIV) and fixed 6 days after transfection. Immunocytochemical analysis, synthesis of digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes, in situ hybridization analysis, and scoring of recombinant dendritic transcripts was performed as described (17Blichenberg A. Schwanke B. Rehbein M. Garner C.C. Richter D. Kindler S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8818-8829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Combined fluorescent in situ hybridization/immunocytochemical approaches were performed with Cy3-coupled mouse monoclonal anti-digoxigenin (Roche Applied Science) and rabbit polyclonal anti-MAP2 antibodies (generous gift from Craig C. Garner, Stanford University) and rabbit polyclonal Jacob antibodies (6Dieterich D.C. Karpova A. Mikhaylova M. Zdobnova I. König I. Landwehr M. Kreutz M. Smalla K.H. Richter K. Landgraf P. Reissner C.

Jacob RNA probes comprise full-length coding and 3′-untranslated regions. Images captured with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) and Openlab software (Improvision) or a laser-scanning microscope (TCS-SP2 Leica) were mounted using Adobe Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems) and Freehand (Macromedia) software. For stimulation, primary hippocampal neurons (DIV16 for calpeptin and DIV21 for E64d) were incubated with 60 μm calpeptin and 50 μm E64d for 30 min at 37 °C. NMDA (100 μm) was applied for 5 min in stimulation buffer (Neurobasal medium with 7.5 μm anisomycin) either in the absence or presence of inhibitors. After stimulation, the cells were washed twice with stimulation buffer and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) for 10 min at 37 °C and then incubated in permeabilization solution (0.25% Triton X-100 in 1× phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently, they were incubated in blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin, 2% glycine, 0.2% gelatin, 50 mm NH4Cl) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The primary antibody (Jacob JB150) (6Dieterich D.C. Karpova A. Mikhaylova M. Zdobnova I. König I. Landwehr M. Kreutz M. Smalla K.H. Richter K. Landgraf P. Reissner C. Boeckers T.M. Zuschratter W.

After washing (3 × 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.3% Triton X-100) the cells were incubated with AlexaFluor-coupled secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000 in blocking solution; Molecular Probes-Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature, washed as described above, and embedded in Mowiol (Calbiochem). Utilizing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, the nuclei were identified, and nuclear Jacob levels were determined by calculating the mean pixel intensity from two or three nuclear planes. The differences between groups are described as relative deviations from the control. The nuclear membrane was excluded from the analysis. Images were taken using a Leica DMRXE microscope equipped with a Krypton-Argon-Ion laser (488/568/647 nm) and an acousto-optic-tunable filter for selection and intensity adaptation of laser lines. The images were analyzed with ImageJ software. In vivo time lapse imaging and transfection of hippocampal primary neurons with Jacob-EGFP was performed as described (6Dieterich D.C. Karpova A.

Western blotting was done as described previously (15Seidenbecher C.I. Langnaese K. Sanmartí-Vila L. Boeckers T.M. Smalla K.H. Sabel B.A. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. J. Biol.

GST and the fusion protein GST-KIF5c containing the cargo binding domain of mouse KIF5c (amino acid residues 826–920, accession number NP_032475) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using GSH-Sepharose (GE Biotech). GST-KIF5C-coated Sepharose beads were used to affinity purify KIF5C-associated cargos from mouse brain homogenates as described (10Dictenberg J.B. Swanger S.A. Antar L.N. Singer R.H. Bassell G.J.

Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with antibodies directed against fragile X mental retardation protein (rabbit polyclonal antibody H-120; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (18Brendel C. Rehbein M. Kreienkamp H.J. Buck F. Richter D. Kindler S. Biochem.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). From brain homogenates and immuno- and GST-precipitates, RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by RT-PCR and quantitative real time RT-PCR with a Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett, Wasserburg, Germany) using the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) as described (19Iacoangeli A.

The PCR conditions were according to the standard protocol of the manufacturer with an annealing temperature of 58 °C (40 cycles) and the following gene-specific primers: BC1, BC1-Fw (5′-GTT GGG GAT TTA GCT CAG TGG-3′) and BC1-Rev (5′-AGG TTG TGT GTG CCA GTT ACC-3′); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), GAPDH-Fw (5′-TGG CAA AGT GGA GAT TGT TGC C-3′) and GAPDH-Rev (5′-AAG ATG GTG ATG GGC TTC CCG-3′); and SAPAP3, SAPAP3-Fw (5′-ACT ATT TGC AGG TGC CGC AAG-3′) and SAPAP3-Rev (5′-GGG CTA CCA TCT GAG TCT CC-3′). For Jacob and Arc/Arg3.1 mRNAs the appropriate QuantiTect Primer Assay was obtained from Qiagen (catalog numbers QT01077832 and QT00250684, respectively). RT-PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels. MBP fusion protein production was performed as described previously (20Landgraf P. Wahle P. Pape H.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25036-25045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Samples containing 5 nm MBP-Jacob or 5 nm MBP alone, 2 mm Ca+2 or 2 mm EGTA, and μ-Calpain (specific activity, 0.195 enzyme units; Calbiochem) were incubated in Calpain reaction buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6). The reactions were brought to 20 μl and incubated at 30 °C for 10 s, 30 s, and 1 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer. MBP-Jacob protein degradation was visualized on immunoblots. On a rat multiple tissue Northern blot two transcripts, a major one at 2.9 kb and a less intense one at 3.6 kb, can be clearly detected in the brain when hybridized with a Jacob cDNA probe. Very faint signals were detectable in the testis, and even fainter or no signals were identified in other investigated tissues (Fig. 1A). The two bands may reflect alternative splicing of the Jacob pre-mRNA. Subsequent in situ hybridization experiments revealed a strikingly restricted localization of Jacob transcripts to the limbic system and cortical areas of the rat brain. The highest levels of Jacob mRNAs are present in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, thalamus, and amygdala, whereas the transcript concentration in the striatum and cerebellum is very low (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, gene expression appears to be developmentally regulated with highest mRNA levels between the second and third postnatal week, the postnatal period during which synapto-dendritic wiring is most dynamic. The sections treated with RNase H (Fig. 2B) or hybridized with sense controls (data not shown) showed no signal above background. A closer inspection of the hybridization pattern revealed that Jacob mRNAs are abundantly present in the molecular layers of the hippocampus (Fig. 2, A and C), indicating dendritic localization of the transcripts. In contrast, α-tubulin transcripts are restricted to regions of neuronal somata (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2.Jacob is prominently expressed in cortex and the limbic brain and exhibits a dendritic mRNA in the hippocampus.

C, comparison of Jacob and tubulin-α hybridization signals in the hippocampus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Alternative splicing of exons 5, 6, 8, and 9 generates multiple Jacob mRNAs (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, we sought to determine whether distinct transcripts differ in their brain distribution. Surprisingly, in the adult rat brain all tested splice variants exhibit a similar distribution pattern with slightly different levels of abundance (Fig. 3C). Importantly, all investigated alternatively spliced transcripts are present in the molecular layers of the hippocampus (Fig. 3C) and thus should be transported to dendrites. Furthermore these data suggest that the dendritic mRNA localization is due to a sequence element common to all Jacob mRNA variants. Therefore we decided to analyze the dendritic targeting of Jacob mRNAs in more detail. Extrasomatic trafficking of mRNAs in mammalian neurons involves cis-acting DTEs within the localized transcripts (20Landgraf P. Wahle P. Pape H.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25036-25045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Bramham C.R. Wells D.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 776-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 22Kindler S. Wang H. Richter D. Tiedge H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 223-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To determine the presence and position of DTEs within Jacob transcripts, we transfected DIV8 primary rat hippocampal neurons with eukaryotic expression vectors encoding chimeric reporter mRNAs, all of which contain the EGFP coding region as a common part, a sequence that is incapable to mediate dendritic mRNA targeting (17Blichenberg A. Schwanke B. Rehbein M. Garner C.C. Richter D. Kindler S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8818-8829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six days after transfection, the subcellular localization of recombinant transcripts was determined by nonradioactive in situ hybridization with an EGFP antisense probe (17Blichenberg A. Schwanke B. Rehbein M. Garner C.C. Richter D. Kindler S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8818-8829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although reporter transcripts containing the DTE of MAP2 mRNAs displayed dendritic localization in almost 90% of the transfected cells (n = 81; Fig. 4, A and E), chimeric EGFP-α-tubulin transcripts were mainly restricted to somata (9,7% dendritic targeting, n = 154; Fig. 4, B and E). In comparison, reporter transcripts containing either the coding region (pNELjaccr) or the complete 3′-UTR of Jacob mRNAs (pNELjacu) localized to dendrites in about 40% (n = 154) and slightly more than 60% (n = 250) of the neurons, respectively (Fig. 4, C–E). Thus, whereas the coding region of Jacob transcripts appears to contain sequences promoting dendritic mRNA targeting, the major DTE mediating efficient extrasomatic trafficking resides in the 3′-UTR, which is common to all splice variants, in agreement with our previous observations that all Jacob transcripts are present in dendritic fields in the hippocampus. In dendrites, pNELjacu derived reporter mRNAs assembled into distinct granules, which appear to resemble individual RNA transport packages (Fig. 4D). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that has been implicated in both dendritic mRNA targeting and the local control of translation at postsynaptic sites (10Dictenberg J.B. Swanger S.A. Antar L.N. Singer R.H. Bassell G.J. Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 926-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 13Bardoni B. Davidovic L. Bensaid M. Khandjian E.W. Expert Rev. Mol.

To determine whether FMRP may be involved in cytoplasmic processing of Jacob transcripts, we probed for an in vivo association of the two components. Utilizing brain homogenates derived from adult male Fmr1−/− knock-out mice (KO) and congenic C57BL/6J WT mice as input material, we performed immunoprecipitations with FMRP-specific (F-IP) and PABP-specific (P-IP) antibodies as well as with unrelated rabbit IgGs (IgG-IP) as a control. P-IP was chosen as a positive control because PABP generally interacts with polyadenylated mRNAs. KO-F-IP and WT-IgG-IP were carried out to check for the possibility of unspecific RNA precipitation. RNA extracted from immunoprecipitates was probed for Jacob, SAPAP3, and BC1 RNAs by RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR. SAPAP3- and BC1-specific amplifications served as positive and negative controls for FMRP-associated RNAs, respectively (19Iacoangeli A. Rozhdestvensky T.S. Dolzhanskaya N. Tournier B. Schütt J.

RT-PCR data showed that Jacob and SAPAP3 mRNAs were present in both the WT-F-IP and WT-P-IP but were basically absent or only weakly detected in the KO-F-IP and WT-IgG-IP (Fig. 5A). Moreover, as previously shown (19Iacoangeli A. Rozhdestvensky T.S. Dolzhanskaya N. Tournier B. Schütt J. Brosius J. Denman R.B. Khandjian E.W. Kindler S. Tiedge H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W1964020707,"The last decades evidenced auditory laterality in vertebrates, offering new important insights for the understanding of the origin of human language. Factors such as the social (e.g. specificity, familiarity) and emotional value of sounds have been proved to influence hemispheric specialization. However, little is known about the crossed effect of these two factors in animals. In addition, human-animal comparative studies, using the same methodology, are rare. In our study, we adapted the head turn paradigm, a widely used non invasive method, on 8-9-year-old schoolgirls and on adult female Campbell's monkeys, by focusing on head and/or eye orientations in response to sound playbacks. We broadcast communicative signals (monkeys: calls, humans: speech) emitted by familiar individuals presenting distinct degrees of social value (female monkeys: conspecific group members vs heterospecific neighbours, human girls: from the same vs different classroom) and emotional value (monkeys: contact vs threat calls; humans: friendly vs aggressive intonation). We evidenced a crossed-categorical effect of social and emotional values in both species since only ""negative"" voices from same class/group members elicited a significant auditory laterality (Wilcoxon tests: monkeys, T = 0 p = 0.03; girls: T = 4.5 p = 0.03). Moreover, we found differences between species as a left and right hemisphere preference was found respectively in humans and monkeys. Furthermore while monkeys almost exclusively responded by turning their head, girls sometimes also just moved their eyes. This study supports theories defending differential roles played by the two hemispheres in primates' auditory laterality and evidenced that more systematic species comparisons are needed before raising evolutionary scenario. Moreover, the choice of sound stimuli and behavioural measures in such studies should be the focus of careful attention."
https://openalex.org/W2165134495,"The ability to repeat polysyllabic nonwords such as ""blonterstaping"" has frequently been shown to correlate with language learning ability but it is not clear why such a correlation should exist. Three alternative explanations have been offered, stated in terms of differences in: (a) perceptual ability; (b) efficiency of phonological loop functioning; (c) pre-existing vocabulary knowledge and/or articulatory skills. In the present study, we used event-related potentials to assess the contributions from these three factors to explaining individual variation in nonword repetition ability.59 adults who were subdivided according to whether they were good or poor nonword-repeaters participated. Electrophysiologically measured mismatch responses were recorded to changes in consonants as participants passively listened to a repeating four syllable CV-string. The consonant change could occur in one of four positions along the CV-string and we predicted that: (a) if nonword repetition depended purely on auditory discrimination ability, then reduced mismatch responses to all four consonant changes would be observed in the poor nonword-repeaters, (b) if it depended on encoding or decay of information in a capacity-limited phonological store, then a position specific decrease in mismatch response would be observed, (c) if neither cognitive capacity was involved, then the two groups of participants would provide equivalent mismatch responses. Consistent with our second hypothesis, a position specific difference located on the third syllable was observed in the late discriminative negativity (LDN) window (230-630 ms post-syllable onset).Our data thus confirm that people who are poorer at nonword repetition are less efficient in early processing of polysyllabic speech materials, but this impairment is not attributable to deficits in low level auditory discrimination. We conclude by discussing the significance of the observed relationship between LDN amplitude and nonword repetition ability and describe how this relatively little understood ERP component provides a biological window onto processes required for successful language learning."
https://openalex.org/W1988257381,"Learning from mistakes is a key feature of human behavior. However, the mechanisms underlying short-term adaptation to erroneous action are still poorly understood. One possibility relies on the modulation of attentional systems after an error. To explore this possibility, we have designed a Stroop-like visuo-motor task in monkeys that favors incorrect action. Using this task, we previously found that single neurons recorded from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were closely tuned to behavioral performance and, more particularly, that the activity of most neurons was biased towards the evaluation of erroneous action. Here we describe single neurons engaged in both error detection and response alertness processing, whose activation is closely associated with the improvement of subsequent behavioral performance. Specifically, we show that the effect of a warning stimulus on neuronal firing is enhanced after an erroneous response rather than a successful one and that this outcome is correlated with an error rate decrease. Our results suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex, which exhibits this activity, serves as a powerful computational locus for rapid behavioral adaptation."

Few transcriptional repressors have been identified that maintain the normal intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) proliferation state. Herein, we show that the nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR1) is differentially expressed during the proliferation-to-differentiation IEC transition. Silencing of NCoR1 expression in proliferating cells of crypt origin resulted in a rapid growth arrest without associated cell death. A genechip profiling analysis identified several candidate genes to be up-regulated in NCoR1-deficient IEC. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF, also known as serpinf1), a suspected tumor suppressor gene that plays a key role in the inhibition of epithelial tissue growth, was significantly up-regulated in these cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the PEDF gene promoter was occupied by NCoR1 in proliferating epithelial cells. Multiple retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers interacting sites of the PEDF promoter were confirmed to interact with RXR and retinoid acid receptor (RAR). Cotransfection assays showed that RXR and RAR were able to transactivate the PEDF promoter and that NCoR1 was repressing this effect. Finally, forced expression of PEDF in IEC resulted in a slower rate of proliferation. These observations suggest that NCoR1 expression is required to maintain IEC in a proliferative state and identify PEDF as a novel transcriptional target for NCoR1 repressive action.

The intestinal epithelium consists of a cell monolayer organized in crypts and villi. This epithelium is under constant and rapid renewal, which is assured by constant division of the stem cells located at the base of the crypts (1Crosnier C. Stamataki D. Lewis J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The descendant progenitor cells are progressively instructed to differentiate to exert their functional role during their journey along the villus compartment (2Menard D. Beaulieu J.F. Boudreau F. Perreault N. Rivard N. Vachon P.H. Unsicker K. Krieglstein K. Cell Signaling and Growth Factors in Development: From Molecules to Organogenesis. Wiley-VCH, 2006Google Scholar). The proliferation-to-differentiation transition of single progenitor cell is tightly regulated by morphogens, growth factors and hormones that impact on intracellular signaling pathways. Molecular alterations of specific components from these different classes of molecules are suspected to be important during the development of intestinal cancer (3van den Brink G.R. Offerhaus G.J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 109-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In vivo studies have demonstrated the role of steroid hormones and ligands during intestinal epithelial development and homeostasis (4Henning S.J. Annu. Rev.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are well-described examples of lipophilic ligand binding transcription factors that can influence intestinal epithelial proliferation, differentiation (9Varnat F.

Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1538-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These nuclear receptors can repress gene transcription via the formation of a well defined co-repressor protein complex (12Lazar M.A. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2003; 1: e001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One major player of that repression activity is the nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR1) that was originally identified for its potential to repress genes via physical interaction with the thyroid hormone receptor (13Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). However, there is now growing evidence that NCoR1 can repress transcription through interaction with several other classes of transcriptional activators including activator protein (AP)-1 and NF-κB (14Perissi V. Aggarwal A. Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2004; 116: 511-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 15Lee S.K. Kim J.H. Lee Y.C. Cheong J. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12470-12474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). One additional important class of nuclear receptors that are recruiting NCoR1 repressive action is the retinoid receptors (16Weston A.D. Blumberg B. Underhill T.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These receptors are composed of either RAR-RXR heterodimers or RXR-RXR homodimers and can repress transcription in a ligand-independent manner. In absence of co-repressors, these receptors are involved in the differentiation of various epithelia (17Kubota H. Chiba H. Takakuwa Y. Osanai M. Tobioka H. Kohama G. Mori M. Sawada N. Exp.

Ncor1 gene deletion in mice resulted in an impairment of neural stem cell proliferation and spontaneous differentiation into astrocytes (19Hermanson O. Jepsen K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 2002; 419: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Other reports have recently suggested an antiproliferative role for NCoR1 in hepatocytes (20Feng X. Jiang Y. Meltzer P. Yen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15066-15072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and thyroid tumor cells (21Furuya F. Guigon C.J. Zhao L. Lu C. Hanover J.A. Cheng S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6116-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, NCoR1 may influence cell proliferation by affecting different gene targets in specific cellular contexts. Because many NCoR1-interacting partners are crucial to the regulation of many IEC functions, we sought to evaluate the functional role of NCoR1 in this specific context. We provide here the evidence that NCoR1 nuclear expression is associated with proliferative and non-differentiated epithelial cells and that NCoR1 silencing by RNA interference causes cells to growth arrest. The pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF), a 50-kDa member of the serine protease inhibitor family, was further identified as a transcriptional target for NCoR1 repressive action during this process. Ectopic expression of PEDF in IEC reduced the proliferation rate, an observation that was consistent with the tumor suppressor properties of this regulator in epithelial tissues (22Doll J.A. Stellmach V.M. Bouck N.P. Bergh A.R. Lee C. Abramson L.P. Cornwell M.L. Pins M.R. Borensztajn J. Crawford S.E. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 774-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Caco-2/15 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. IEC-6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 units/ml insulin. In both cases, the media were supplemented with 4.5g/liter d-glucose, 25 mm HEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were kept subconfluent for 5–10 passages. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cell proliferation assays were manually performed using a hemacytometer in the presence of 0.4% trypan blue to account for cell viability. Inhibition of proteasome activity was performed with supplementation of 50 μm MG132 into the cell culture medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Animal experimentation was approved by the Institutional Animal Research Review Committee in conformity with the Canadian Council on Animal Care. CD-1 wild-type mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) were sacrificed and the jejunum harvested, inverted onto polyethylene tubing, ligatured at both extremities, and washed with KRB buffer, pH 7.5, as described previously (23Boudreau F. Lussier C.R. Mongrain S. Darsigny M. Drouin J.L. Doyon G. Suh E.R. Beaulieu J.F. Rivard N. Perreault N. Faseb J. 2007; 21: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Segments were then incubated under agitation in ice-cold isolation buffer (2.5 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm NaCl) for 2-min intervals. After each interval, cell suspensions were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. Pellets were then washed with ice-cold KRB buffer and lysed for either nuclear protein or total RNA isolation (23Boudreau F. Lussier C.R. Mongrain S. Darsigny M. Drouin J.L. Doyon G. Suh E.R. Beaulieu J.F. Rivard N. Perreault N. Faseb J. 2007; 21: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells as described previously (23Boudreau F. Lussier C.R. Mongrain S. Darsigny M. Drouin J.L. Doyon G. Suh E.R. Beaulieu J.F. Rivard N. Perreault N. Faseb J. 2007; 21: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription reactions were carried out at 42 °C for 1 h in the presence of 1 μg of RNA, 40 milliunits of poly-oligo(dT)12–18 (Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfé, QC) and 40 units of reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 μl with 1 μl of the RT reaction, 1 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Pickering, ON), and 100 ng of each specific oligonucleotide. Real-time PCR was performed using a Lightcycler apparatus (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (23Boudreau F. Lussier C.R. Mongrain S. Darsigny M. Drouin J.L. Doyon G. Suh E.R. Beaulieu J.F. Rivard N. Perreault N. Faseb J. 2007; 21: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Experiments were run and analyzed using the Lightcycler software 4.0 (relative quantification monocolor) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Double-stranded DNA amplification during PCR was monitored using SYBR Green I (QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and PCR amplification programs designed as described in the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Handbook (Qiagen). A serial dilution of a calibrator sample was used for the standard curve for each gene analyzed, which was then used to correct for the differences in the efficiency of the PCR. Primers sequences are available upon request. Cell protein fractionation (cytosol, membranes and organelles, nucleus, and cytoskeleton) was performed with the ProteoExtract subcellular proteome extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). 5 μg of protein extract was analyzed by 3–8% Tris acetate NuPAGE (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Western blot was performed as described previously (23Boudreau F. Lussier C.R. Mongrain S. Darsigny M. Drouin J.L. Doyon G. Suh E.R. Beaulieu J.F. Rivard N. Perreault N. Faseb J. 2007; 21: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). NCoR1 and SMRTe antibodies were purchased from Millipore (Upstate). Actin, histone H1, and PPARγ antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Three different sets of shRNA oligonucleotides were designed for rat NCoR1 targeting according to Ambion guidelines (technical bulletin 506) using the siRNA sequences tacttgccttacttcttca (1), aaaccaaagctgatcaaca (2), or gcagaactacttaggaact (3) with ttcaagaga as the loop sequence (see Fig. 3A). The oligonucleotide-annealed products were subcloned into pLenti6-U6 (23Boudreau F. Lussier C.R. Mongrain S. Darsigny M. Drouin J.L. Doyon G. Suh E.R. Beaulieu J.F. Rivard N. Perreault N. Faseb J. 2007; 21: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) between the BamHI and XhoI sites, giving rise to pLenti6-shNCoR. Lentiviruses were produced and used for cell infection according to Invitrogen recommendations (ViraPower lentiviral expression system instruction manual). The cDNA of rat PEDF was PCR-amplified from IEC-6 total RNA and subcloned into BamH1 and EcoRI restriction sites of the retroviral vector pBabe-puro. The HEK 293T cell line was used for transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and both the retroviral DNA construct and helper amphotropic DNA as described previously (24Gheorghiu I. Deschênes C. Blais M. Boudreau F. Rivard N. Asselin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44331-44337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Subconfluent IEC-6 cells were infected with either an empty vector (control) or PEDF recombinant viruses in the presence of 2 μg/ml of polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). Two days after infection, cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Probes for the microarray analysis were generated from isolated RNA obtained 2 days after RNAi-dependent shutdown of NcoR1 expression. Affymetrix GeneChip® Rat Genome 230 2.0 arrays were screened with the generated probes via the microarray platform of McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Center as described previously (25Novak J.P. Sladek R. Hudson T.J. Genomics. 2002; 79: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To test for changes in signal intensity, compiled data (RMA analysis) were screened using the software available on the microarray platform website. Genes were then filtered for up- or down-regulation of expression of a minimum of 2-fold and a minimal magnitude change of 200 fluorescence units between control and NCoR1 knockdown cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) were performed using the protocol from the ChIP assay kit (Upstate, VA). Subconfluent and confluent Caco-2/15 cells were incubated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C for DNA cross-link. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with NCoR1 antibody (catalog 06–892; Millipore, Upstate, VA). One percent of the lysate was kept to control the amount of DNA used for immunoprecipitation (Input). Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified and diluted 1:20 before PCR amplification. The following sequences were used for PEDF promoter amplification; −878 up: 5′-gaggcaggagaacctcttga-3′; −529 down: 5′-cgagaccccgtctcaaaaa-3′; −411 up: 5′-gccaacacacctgggtaattt; and −81 down: 5′-cacacatttgcacaccttcc-3′. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed essentially as described previously (26Boudreau F. Rings E.H. Swain G.P. Sinclair A.M. Suh E.R. Silberg D.G. Scheuermann R.H. Traber P.G.

Biol. 2001; 148: 13-30PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The reactions were performed in a volume of 24 μl of binding buffer D (10 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 4 μg of nuclear protein extracts from 293T cells transfected or not with RXRα (Open Biosystems, MHS1010-98051588) and RARα (Open Biosystems, MHS1010-97228051) expression vectors, 50 mm KCl, 50 ng of poly(dI-dC), and 25,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA probes for 10 min. For the supershift analysis, 600 ng of RXRα (D20SC-553) or RARα (C20SC-551) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added, and the binding reactions were pursued for 10 min at room temperature. Retarded complexes were then separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C for 4 h, dried for 1 h at 80 °C, and exposed overnight on a Molecular Imager FX screen (Bio-Rad). The running buffer used was a Tris-glycine 0.5× buffer (0.2 m glycine, 0.025 m Tris, and 1 mm EDTA). The DNA probes consisted of double-stranded oligonucleotides of 8 potential RXR binding sites within the promoter region of the human PEDF gene (Fig. 6). The human PEDF gene promoter was amplified by PCR from purified genomic DNA isolated from human fetal colon. The primers used from the amplification included positions −995 to +1 relatively to the transcriptional initiation site. The PCR product was subcloned in the pGL3basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Integrity of the subcloned PCR product was confirmed by sequence analysis. 293T cells were transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells at 50% confluence wre incubated with 0.2 μg of luciferase reporter, 0.1 μg of RARα, and/or RXRα expression vectors, 0.2 μg of NCoR1 expression vector, 0.018 μg of the pRL SV40 Renilla luciferase vector (Promega), and a constant total DNA amount of 0.8 μg per transfected well in the presence of 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000/100 μl of OptiMEM. The medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum after an incubation of 4 h. The luciferase and Renilla activities were determined 48 h after the transfection using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega Biotech). Each experiment was repeated three times with five replicates. All data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Groups were compared using the Student's t test (GraphPad Prism 4, GraphPad Software, San Diego). Statistical significance was defined as p < .05. To investigate the profile of NCoR1 expression during epithelial cell differentiation, populations of epithelial cells from the mouse small intestinal mucosa were progressively isolated along the villus-to-crypt axis using a modified Weiser procedure (23Boudreau F. Lussier C.R. Mongrain S. Darsigny M. Drouin J.L. Doyon G. Suh E.R. Beaulieu J.F. Rivard N. Perreault N. Faseb J. 2007; 21: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Total RNA was isolated from these epithelial cell populations, and NCoR1 gene transcript levels were assessed by real-time RT-PCR analyses. No significant change in NCoR1 mRNA expression was detected along the villus-to-crypt axis (Fig. 1B) in contrast to the induction of the sucrase-isomaltase gene transcript in the villus epithelial cell fractions, a specific marker of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation (Fig. 1C). Because it has been previously reported that NCoR1 regulation of expression could be dependent on post-transcriptional mechanisms in other systems (28Zhang J. Guenther M.G. Carthew R.W. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1775-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), we next evaluated the NCoR1 protein profile of expression in intestinal epithelial cell fractions that were progressively harvested from the villus-to-crypt axis. NCoR1 protein was detectable in mouse crypt IEC fractions and disappeared in the most upper villus-associated epithelial fractions (Fig. 1D). The decrease of NCoR1 protein expression correlated with the detection of faster migrating dephosphorylated forms of the Rb protein that are normally associated with non-cycling G1-arrested cells (29Houde M.

We next undertook to explore the pattern of NCoR1 expression during the proliferation-to-differentiation transition of pure intestinal epithelial cells in culture. The Caco-2/15 cell line that spontaneously differentiates into enterocytes upon reaching confluence was chosen because it has been extensively used as a model of IEC differentiation (30Boudreau F.

Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 414-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Again, no significant change in NCoR1 gene transcript expression was detected during the proliferation-to-differentiation transition of Caco-2/15 cells in culture (Fig. 2A). The sucrase-isomaltase gene transcript was strongly increased during this process (Fig. 2B) as has extensively been reported in the past (30Boudreau F. Zhu Y. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32122-32128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Vachon P.H. Beaulieu J.F. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 414-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We then investigated the NCoR1 protein profile during cell growth arrest and differentiation. Nuclear and cytosolic protein fractions were harvested at different Caco-2/15 cell confluence stages and subjected to Western blot analysis. Nuclear NCoR1 protein levels significantly decreased during the proliferation-to-differentiation transition of Caco-2/15 cells in culture, a pattern that was not observed for cytosolic NCoR1 protein levels (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, PPARγ protein was strongly induced in postconfluent-differentiated cells (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these observations indicate that NCoR1 protein expression was associated with proliferating, non-differentiated IEC.FIGURE 2.NCoR1 protein is down-modulated during the proliferation-to-differentiation transition of Caco-2/15 cells in culture. Total RNA from Caco-2/15 cells at different stages of confluence was used to monitor mRNA levels of the NCoR (A) and sucrase-isomaltase (B) genes (n = 3). C, subcellular fractions of Caco-2/15 cells were harvested at different stages of confluence. Western blots were performed with NCoR1, histone H1, and α-tubulin antibodies. Total extracts of Caco-2/15 cells were subjected to Western blot with PPARγ antibody. Specific detection of actin was done to control for protein loading.

Isselbacher K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 248-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) and has been extensively used as a model to study normal and non-cancerous IEC proliferation. We sought to directly neutralize NCoR1 expression by an RNA interference approach. In general, IEC-6 cell transfection with an enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) expression vector resulted in poor efficiency of detection. However, stable infection of a lentivirus-eGFP into IEC-6/Cdx2 cells consistently resulted in over 90% of positive eGFP cells among the cell population. We thus generated lentiviral constructs that contained shRNA sequences under the control of a U6 promoter that were predicted to target the rat Ncor1 mRNA (Fig. 3A). Three independent shRNA NCoR1 lentiviruses were tested to down-regulate NCoR1 synthesis. A Western blot was performed with total extracts obtained from short term infected IEC-6 cell populations. The NCoR1 protein level was efficiently decreased in IEC-6 cells infected with the shRNA lentivirus 3 as opposed to cells infected with an eGFP lentivirus, an irrelevant shRNA lentivirus and two other NCoR1-specific shRNA constructs (Fig. 3B). The silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors (SMRT), a functionally related family member of NCoR1 (33Hu X. Lazar M.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 6-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), was not influenced under these specific conditions. The specific shRNA/NCoR3 construct was further utilized to efficiently interfere with NCoR1 expression. Stable IEC-6 cell populations were first generated with either NCoR1 shRNA or control shRNA lentiviruses. Long term antibiotic resistance selection of these recombinant cells consistently resulted in poor cell recovery of the NCoR1 shRNA populations. In addition, these cells progressively overcame the loss of NCoR1 protein expression (data not shown). A short term strategy was thus chosen to investigate whether the loss of NCoR1 could impact on cell proliferation and/or cell death. IEC-6 cells were infected with either control or shRNA/NCoR#3 lentiviruses and distributed into 6-well tissue culture plates. An inhibition of cell growth was rapidly observed for shRNA/NCoR3 cells that persisted for several days when compared with control infected cells (Fig. 4A). Western blot confirmed that NCoR1 expression was reduced in these cell populations during the kinetics (Fig. 4B). No significant increase in cell death was observed between control and NCoR1 knockdown cells as determined by the trypan blue exclusion test or by detection of the cytoplasmic specific 89-kDa cleaved form (34Nicholson D.W.

https://openalex.org/W2056564088,"Inhibitor of differentiation protein-2 (Id2) is a dominant negative helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein, and a positive regulator of proliferation, in various cells. The N-terminal region of Id2 contains a consensus cdk2 phosphorylation sequence SPVR, which may be involved with the induction of apoptosis, at least in myeloid 32d.3 cells. However, the role of Id2 phosphorylation at serine 5 in skeletal muscle cells is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine if the phosphorylation of Id2 at serine 5 alters its cellular localization and its role in apoptosis in C2C12 myoblasts. Overexpression of wild type Id2 decreased MyoD protein expression, which corresponded to the increased binding of Id2 to basic HLH proteins E47 and E12. Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation was significantly decreased by the overexpression of phospho-ablated Id2 (S5A); conversely, overexpression of wild type Id2 increased cellular proliferation. The subcellular localization of Id2 and phospho-mimicking Id2 (S5D) were predominantly nuclear compared to S5A. The decreased nuclear localization of S5A corresponded to a decrease in cellular proliferation, and an increase in apoptosis. These data suggest that unphosphorylated Id2 is primarily localized in the cytosol, where it is growth suppressive and potentially pro-apoptotic. These results imply that reducing unphosphorylated Id2 may improve the pool of myoblasts available for differentiation by increasing proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2053924298,"Background A key step of anthrax toxin action involves the formation of a protein-translocating pore within the endosomal membrane by the Protective Antigen (PA) moiety. Formation of this transmembrane pore by PA involves interaction of the seven 2β2–2β3 loops of the heptameric precursor to generate a 14-strand transmembrane β barrel. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the effects on pore formation, protein translocation, and cytotoxicity, of mutating two phenylalanines, F313 and F314, that lie at the tip the β barrel, and a third one, F324, that lies part way up the barrel. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that the function of these phenylalanine residues is to mediate membrane insertion and formation of stable transmembrane channels. Unlike F427, a key luminal residue in the cap of the pore, F313, F314, and F324 do not directly affect protein translocation through the pore. Our findings add to our knowledge of structure-function relationships of a key virulence factor of the anthrax bacillus."

But whereas existing Web sites merely respond directly to user input, there is growing interest in making them adaptive through the use of computational intelligence. A promising approach for this involves a family of optimization techniques called evolutionary algorithms."
