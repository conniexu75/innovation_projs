https://openalex.org/W2023021640,"Recent assessments of areas of different tropical forest types and their corresponding stand volumes were used to calculate the biomass densities and total biomass of tropical forests. Total biomass was estimated at 205 x 10(9) tons, and weighted biomass densities for undisturbed closed and open broadleaf forests were 176 and 61 tons per hectare, respectively. These values are considerably lower than those previously reported and raise questions about the role of the terrestrial biota in the global carbon budget."
https://openalex.org/W2060249912,"Frictional sliding on sawcuts and faults in laboratory samples of granite and gabbro is markedly temperature-dependent. At pressures from 1 to 5 kilobars, stick-slip gave way to stable sliding as temperature was increased from 200 to 500 degrees Celsius. Increased temperature with depth could thus cause the abrupt disappearance of earthquakes noted at shallow depths in California."
https://openalex.org/W2030689262,"An active maize Adhl-F gene, a Ds-induced mutant of this gene, and two independent Ac-induced revertant alleles have been isolated. The Ds mutant differs from the progenitor allele in having a 405-base pair insertion flanked by a direct repeat of 8 bp. The repeat is a duplication of the 8 bp existing at the point of insertion in the 5' untranslated region of the gene. The insertion sequence is AT-rich (A, adenine; T, thymine) and has 11-bp inverted repeat sequences at its termini. In the revertants the insertion with its inverted repeats is deleted, but the 8-bp direct repeats remain in modified form. These results establish that the 405-bp sequence is a Ds element. The Adh1 messenger RNA level is low in the Ds mutant, and it appears that new sites for transcription initiation or RNA processing or both are used. There are at least 30 sequences in the maize genome related to the Ds element."
https://openalex.org/W2101117778,"The P300 is a positive-going component of the event-related potential. In subjects with absolute, or ""perfect,"" pitch, the P300 elicited by the less frequent of two auditory probes is small or absent. In these subjects, visual probes elicit a normal P300. These results support the view of P300 as a manifestation of the updating of working memory."
https://openalex.org/W2044683518,"Oxygen- and hydrogen-isotope analyses from the core hole through the Antarctic Ice Sheet at Byrd Station define temperature variations over more than 75,000 years. Synchronism between major climatic changes in Antarctica and the Northern Hemisphere is strongly indicated. The Wisconsin cold interval extended from 75,000 to 11,000 years ago. Three intra-Wisconsin warmer phases were all colder than pre- or post-Wisconsin times, which suggests that North American and Eurasian continental ice sheets did not disappear at any time during the Wisconsin."
https://openalex.org/W2065649627,"Carbon monoxide, ethylene, and propylene were produced in illuminated, cell-free distilled water or natural seawater systems to which dissolved organic matter produced by phytoplankton had been added. Methane and the higher saturated gaseous hydrocarbons were not produced. In the dark, little or no carbon monoxide and no hydrocarbons were produced in the distilled water systems; only carbon monoxide was produced in natural seawater, but less was produced than in the light."
https://openalex.org/W1996366507,A combination of measurements of carbon-13 and the hydrogen sulfide content in Black Sea waters with available data on the total carbon dioxide in these waters indicates that the contribution of organic sulfur to the hydrogen sulfide lies between 3 and 5 percent and increases with depth. Likely causes for the increase are increasing productivity or upward movement of the anoxic zone during the facts last 2000 year.
https://openalex.org/W2009696437,"Study of a worldwide sample of historical earthquakes showed that slopes most susceptible to catastrophic rock avalanches were higher than 150 meters and steeper than 25 degrees. The slopes were undercut by fluvial or glacial erosion, were composed of intensely fractured rock, and exhibited at least one other indicator of low strength or potential instability."
https://openalex.org/W2064653223,Delaunay's reduced Hamiltonian of the main problem in lunar theory is checked against a new analytical theory based on Lie transforms. It is found to be correct up to order 9 with the exception of one error in addition at order 7.
https://openalex.org/W2614444458,"The field of artificial intelligence is discussed. The field is split into two groups: the engineers who are trying to get their programs to do smart things, by whatever means they can and the scientists who are interested in a general theory of intelligence, both human and machine. It is concluded that the essence of intelligence seems to be less a matter of reasoning ability than of knowing a lot about the world."
https://openalex.org/W2021885815,"The sound velocity data for the lunar rocks were compared to numerous terrestrial rock types and were found to deviate widely from them. A group of terrestrial materials were found which have velocities comparable to those of the lunar rocks, but they do obey velocity-density relations proposed for earth rocks."

https://openalex.org/W2030129466,"Despite the expenditure of large amounts of telescope time and other resources, most of the fundamental questions concerning quasi-stellar objects (quasars) remain unanswered. A complex phenomenology of radio, infrared, optical, and x-ray properties has accumulated but has not yielded even a satisfactory classification system. The large red shifts (distances) of quasars make them very valuable tools for studying cosmology and the properties of intervening matter in the Universe through observations of absorption lines and gravitational lenses."
