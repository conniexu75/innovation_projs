https://openalex.org/W1974669825,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI) are protein kinases that are regulated both by allosteric activation (AMP and Ca2+/CaM, respectively) and by phosphorylation by upstream protein kinases (AMPK kinase (AMPKK) and CaMKI kinase (CaMKIK), respectively). We now report that AMPKK can activate CaMKI and that, conversely, CaMKIK can activate AMPK. CaMKIK is 68-fold more effective at activating CaMKI than AMPK, while AMPKK is 17-fold more effective at activating AMPK than CaMKI. Our results suggest that CaMKIK and AMPKK are distinct enzymes dedicated to their respective kinase targets but with some overlap in their substrate specificities. The availability of alternative substrates for AMPKK and CaMKIK allowed the unequivocal demonstration that AMP and Ca2+/calmodulin promote the activation of AMPK and CaMKI, respectively, via three independent mechanisms: 1) direct activation of AMPK and CaMKI, 2) activation of AMPKK and CaMKIK, and 3) by binding to AMPK and CaMKI, inducing exposure of their phosphorylation sites. Since AMP and Ca2+/calmodulin each has a triple effect in its respective system, in vivo, the two systems would be expected to be exquisitely sensitive to changes in concentration of their respective activating ligands.

https://openalex.org/W2053204073,"Ceramide produced by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin is an important cellular intermediate in hormone action. Here, we present evidence that interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) binding to normal human fibroblasts initiates a lipid messenger cascade that takes place in a sphingomyelin-rich plasma membrane domain with the characteristics of caveolae. Hormone binding first stimulated the appearance of diacylglycerol (DAG) in a caveolearich membrane fraction isolated from whole cells. This was immediately followed by the loss of a resident population of sphingomyelin from the fraction and the concomitant appearance of ceramide. The ceramide produced in response to IL-1 beta blocked platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis. IL-1 beta stimulated the appearance of DAG in other fractions from the same cell, but this DAG was not coupled to ceramide production. This indicates that ceramide production is highly compartmentalized at the cell surface. Since caveolae are known to be involved in membrane internalization, they may be essential for the delivery of ceramide to a site of action within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1987630530,"Neuronal Cdc2-like kinase is a heterodimer of Cdk5 and a 25-kDa subunit that is derived from a 35-kDa brain- and neuron-specific protein called the neuronal Cdk5 activator (p35/p25nck5a) (Lew, J., Huang, Q.-Q., Qi, Z., Winkfein, R. J., Aebersold, R., Hunt, T., and Wang, J. H.(1994) Nature 371, 423-426; Tsai, L. H., Delalle, I., Caviness, V. S., Jr., Chae, T., and Harlow, E.(1994) Nature 371, 419-423). Upon screening of a human hippocampus library with a bovine Nck5a cDNA, we uncovered a distinct clone encoding a 39-kDa isoform of Nck5a. The isoform, designated the neuronal Cdk5 activator isoform (p39nck5ai), showed a high degree of sequence similarity to p35nck5a with 57% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis detected its mRNA transcript in bovine and rat cerebrum and cerebellum, but not in any other rat tissues examined. In situ hybridization showed that Nck5ai was enriched in CA1 to CA3 of the hippocampus, but absent in the fimbria of hippocampal formation. Among seven cell lines in proliferating cultures, only PC12 and N2A, two cell lines capable of differentiating into neuron-like cells, were found to contain Nck5ai mRNA. A 30-kDa truncated form of Nck5ai expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli] was found to associate with Cdk5 to form an active Cdk5 kinase. Thus, the isoform shares many common characteristics with p35nck5a, including Ckd5 activating activity and brain- and neuron-specific expression. Both proteins show limited sequence homology to cyclins, suggesting that they define a new family of cyclin-dependent kinase-activating proteins.

The cell division cycle gene, cdc2, in fission yeast performs rate-limiting functions in both G1/S and G2/M transitions. The protein product of the gene, p34cdc2, is a protein kinase catalytic subunit that associates with specific cyclins to form functional protein kinases, which are activated at discrete phases of the cell cycle(1Ghiara J.B.

In mammalian cells, seven Cdc2 homologous proteins have been discovered; most have been shown to depend on cyclin for activity. These Cdc2 homologous proteins are called cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdkscyclin-dependent kinaseskbkilobase(s)Pipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidMops4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidGSTglutathione S-transferaseDTTdithiothreitol. and are individually identified by a numerical system as Cdk1 (Cdc2), Cdk2 up to Cdk7 (12Meyerson M.

In addition to Cdks, an extended family of cyclins has been demonstrated to exist in mammalian cells. Combinatorial association between members of these two protein groups gives rise to a large number of heterodimeric protein kinases that are called Cdc2-like kinases(15Xiong Y. Connolly T. Futcher B.

While most of the Cdc2-like protein kinases are cell cycle regulators, the concept has emerged recently that some of the Cdc2-like kinases may have major functions unrelated to cell division(18Hellmich M.R. Pant H.C. Wada E. Battey J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10867-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A novel Cdc2-like kinase has been discovered, purified from mammalian brains, and extensively characterized recently(19Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

The purified kinase has been shown to be a heterodimer of Cdk5 and a 25-kDa regulatory subunit that is essential for kinase activity(19Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular cloning studies have revealed that the 25-kDa protein is derived proteolytically from a 35-kDa precursor protein that is expressed specifically in brain neurons(23Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z.

Since this brain Cdc2-like kinase is considered neuron-specific on account of its regulatory subunit, it has been designated neuronal Cdc2-like kinase, and the regulatory subunits, neuronal Cdk5 activator (Nck5a or p25/35nck5a). In addition to its tissue specificity, p25/35nck5a possesses certain unique properties that distinguish it from members of the cyclin family. The amino acid sequence of the protein displays minimal homology to cyclins(23Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). While the activation of Cdk1, Cdk2, and Cdk4 by various cyclins has been shown to depend on the phosphorylation of the Cdks by a specific Cdk-activating kinase(25Fesquet D. Labbe J.C. Derancourt J.

Northern blot analysis has revealed two populations of mammalian brain mRNA (4.0- and 2.4-kb mRNAs) that hybridize with a Nck5a probe, suggesting the existence of isoforms of Nck5a(23Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In this study, we document the discovery, cloning, and preliminary characterization of an isoform of Nck5a. The isoform, a 39-kDa protein, shows 57% amino acid sequence identity to Nck5a. The protein, tentatively designated the neuronal Cdk5 activator isoform (Nck5ai or p39nck5ai), is similar to Nck5a in displaying Cdk5 activation activity and brain- and neuron-specific expression, but distinct from Nck5a in cell culture distribution. A 2-year-old female human hippocampus cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened with a randomly labeled probe of bovine brain Nck5a according to the protocols of the manufacturer. 106 plaques were transferred to Hybond™ nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.); prehybridized at 42°C with prehybridization buffer containing 20 mM Pipes (Sigma), 0.8 mM NaCl, 50% formamide (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured fragmented salmon sperm DNA for at least 2 h; and hybridized by addition of the probe, at a specific radioactivity of 106 cpm/ml, to prehybridization buffer at 42°C for 16 h. The membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSC (0.3 M NaCl, 0.03 M trisodium citrate), 0.1% SDS for 10 min each at room temperature and once in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 42°C. Autoradiography was carried out at -70°C with a pair of amplifiers for 12 h. Mouse fibroblast L929 cells were maintained in Joklik's modified minimum essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The other cell lines, A431 (a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line), HeLa, Jurkat, C6 (a glioma cell line), PC12, and Neuro-2A, were maintained in medium and serum as recommended(32Hay R. Caputo J. Chen T.R. McClintock P. Reid Y. American Type Culture Collection Catalogue of Cell Lines and Hybridomas. 7th Ed. American type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD1992Google Scholar). Total RNAs from different rat tissues and bovine brain were isolated by the single step guanidinium thiocyanate method(33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and total RNAs from the various cell lines were isolated(34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). mRNAs were isolated by two rounds of oligo(dT)-cellulose (Boehringer Mannheim) chromatography(34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 5 μg of mRNA was separated in a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond™ nylon membrane, which was then hybridized with buffer containing 6 × SSPE (1 M NaCl, 60 mM NaH2PO4, 6 mM EDTA), 50% formamide, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml boiled fragmented salmon sperm DNA for 16 h at 42°C. The membrane was washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS for 10 min each at room temperature and once in 0.2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 42°C for 15 min. Autoradiography was carried out at -70°C with amplifier screens for 20 h. The membrane was rehybridized with a new probe after soaking it twice in boiled 0.5% SDS. The random probes were labeled to 3 × 109 cpm/μg DNA(35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 3.5.9-3.5.10Google Scholar). In situ hybridization procedures used for the study of localization of the p39nck5ai mRNA were identical to those described(36Hirota S. Ito A. Morii E. Wanaka A. Thyama M. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 15: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The p39nck5ai cRNA probes were prepared from rat cDNA clones. Specificity of these probes was verified by Northern blotting. Female Sprague-Dawley 3-month-old rats (Shizuoka Laboratory Center, Shizuoka, Japan) were deeply anesthetized with diethyl ether. Surgically obtained tissues were fixed in RNase-free 4% paraformaldehyde solution overnight; sequentially dehydrated with 70, 80, 90, and 100% ethanol; embedded in paraffin; and cut in sections of 4-μm thickness. Deparaffined tissue specimens were incubated for 15 min in Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.01% proteinase K (Sigma) and acetylated for 15 min with 0.1 mol/liter triethanolamine containing 0.2% acetic acid. After sequential dehydration in alcohol solutions, each specimen was hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled probe. After hybridization, the slides were incubated with RNase A (10 μg/ml) and washed with 2 × SSC and 0.2 × SSC. After thoroughly washing, the specimens were incubated in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH) for 30 min. They were washed several times and developed by adding the substrate for alkaline phosphatase. As a control, the sense RNA probe was synthesized and used for hybridization at the same concentration and in the same way as described above. The nucleotide sequence of nck5ai was determined by an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) using the DyeDeoxy™ terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and by the chain termination method using Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). For non-GC-rich regions, only one DNA strand was sequenced twice. For the 5′-GC-rich region, both DNA strands were sequenced several times. nck5ai was cloned in pBluescript KS+ and sequenced using both T3 (5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAG-3′) and T7 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) primers. Plasmid DNA used for nucleotide sequencing was purified by a modified mini-alkaline lysis/polyethylene glycol precipitation procedure as described by Applied Biosystems, Inc. (part 90149, rev. E). Other plasmid purifications were performed using the QIAprep plasmid purification kit (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the procedure recommended by the supplier. The expression plasmids of GST-Cdk5 and GST-p21nck5a described previously (23Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) were used for protein expression. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was freshly transformed, and cells were cultured to A600 = 1.0 and then stimulated with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside at 25°C overnight. Cells were then lysed with a French press (1000 p.s.i.) in MTPBS (150 mM NaCl, 16 mM Na2HPO4, 4 mM NaH2PO4) containing 2 mM DTT, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, GST fusion protein was purified on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) as described previously(31Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Lee K.Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 37Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). In vitro reconstitution of the active Cdk5 complex was performed as described(23Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 31Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Lee K.Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). GST-Cdk5 was incubated with either GST-p21nck5a or GST-p30nck5ai at room temperature for 2 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT. The histone kinase activity of the reconstituted Cdk5 complex was measured in 30 mM Mops, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 μM histone H1 peptide, and 100 μM [g-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol) at 30°C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of acetic acid. Phosphate incorporation into the histone peptide was measured by a scintillation counter. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked by 5% skim milk in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with a specific antibody. Fresh bovine brain (1 kg) was homogenized in buffer containing 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.6 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.3 mg/ml benzamidine, and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was incubated with GST or GST fusion proteins in homogenization buffer supplemented with 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT at 4°C for 2 h. GST and GST fusion proteins were then precipitated with glutathione-agarose. The GST and GST fusion protein precipitates were either analyzed by Western blotting or assayed for histone kinase activity. During the screening of a human hippocampus library with a randomly labeled DNA probe from a bovine Nck5a cDNA encoding the active domain of the protein(23Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), several clones (9I4, 3I4, 10I4, 15I23, and 7II2) were obtained. Restriction map analysis of the clones suggested that these clones represented two different mRNA transcripts. Partial nucleotide sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences of clones 15I23, 3I4, and 10I4 indicated that these clones encoded a protein that was identical to human Nck5a(24Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). On the basis of their nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences, clones 9I4 and 7II2 were found to encode a distinct Nck5a homologous protein. Clone 7II2 appeared to contain the complete protein reading frame. Fig. 1 shows the nucleotide sequence of clone 7II2 and the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein. The protein contains 367 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of ~39,000. The assignment of the initiation codon is based on the observation that the sequence flanking the ATG codon contains an A at position -3 and a G at position +4, characteristic of a functional initiation codon(39Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A GeneBank™ search with the nucleotide sequence and the protein sequence has shown that this is a novel protein. The sequence alignment of p35nck5a and the isoform, p39nck5ai, is presented in Fig. 2A. The two proteins show 57% amino acid identity in the overall sequence, with a higher level of homology (65% amino acid identity) in the region of the protein corresponding to the 25-kDa subunit of the purified neuronal Cdc2-like kinase. This region of Nck5a contains the Cdk5-activating domain(23Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal sequence of 9 amino acid residues and the carboxyl-terminal sequence of 3 residues of the two proteins are identical. The difference in molecular weights of the two proteins can be attributed mainly to the presence of a number of gaps in the Nck5a sequence when the proteins are aligned for optimal homology. Most of these gaps are located close to the protein termini. Like p35nck5a, p39nck5ai shows no overall amino acid sequence homology to cyclins. A small region of 17 residues in Nck5a and Nck5ai sequence is the only region with detectable sequence similarity to the equivalent region of the cyclin box consensus sequence (Fig. 2B). Amino acid identity of Nck5a and Nck5ai in this region is 88.2%. In a previous study, Northern blot analysis of bovine brain mRNA using a Nck5a cDNA probe detected a 4-kb mRNA band, whereas human brain was found to contain two populations of mRNA of 4 and 2.4 kb(23Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In the present study, mRNAs from bovine cerebrum and cerebellum and rat cerebrum and cerebellum were probed by the randomly labeled Nck5a cDNA. Fig. 3 shows that the two populations of mRNA could be detected in both bovine and rat cerebrum, with the Northern blot intensity of the 2.4-kb transcript much weaker than that of the 4-kb transcript. Bovine and rat cerebellum also contained the transcripts, but at much lower levels, and only the 4-kb transcript was clearly seen on the Northern blot. When the blots of rat and bovine brain mRNAs were probed by a randomly labeled Nck5ai cDNA probe, the same two populations of mRNA of 4.0 and 2.4 kb were detected in bovine and rat cerebrum. However, contrary to what was revealed by the Nck5a cDNA probe, the smaller transcript displayed far higher intensity than the larger transcript on the Northern blot probed by the Nck5ai cDNA (Fig. 3). Weak Northern blot signals of the 2.4-kb transcript could also be detected in bovine and rat cerebellum. whereas no signal was detected at the 4.0-kb mRNA positions (Fig. 3). These observations indicate that the 4.0- and 2.4-kb mRNAs represent Nck5a and Nck5ai transcripts, respectively. Tissue distribution study in humans has revealed that the mRNA transcript of Nck5a is expressed specifically in the brain(23Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that Nck5a mRNA displays a similar brain-specific expression in rats. Essentially identical tissue expression patterns were observed for the 4- and 2.4-kb transcripts. Both transcripts were found to be expressed exclusively in brains, with levels in the cerebrum markedly higher than those in the cerebellum. No expression of either of the two transcripts was detected in non-neuronal tissues even upon increasing the exposure time by 10 times that used for the experiment of Fig. 3. The tissue distributions of Nck5a and Nck5ai mRNAs are markedly different from that of Cdk5. Previous studies showed that Cdk5 was widely distributed in humans as all human tissues examined were found to contain Cdk5 mRNA. Northern blot analysis of Cdk5 tissue distribution in rats showed that Cdk5 mRNA expression could also be readily detected in all the rat tissues examined (data not shown). A number of proliferating cell lines were examined previously by Northern blot analysis and Western immunoblot analysis for Cdk5 distribution; all were found to contain Cdk5 mRNA and Cdk5 protein (40Tsai L.H. Takahashi T. Caviness Jr., V.S. Harlow E. Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 1029-1040PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the cultured cells contained any of the neuronal Cdk5 activators, several cell lines were examined for the expression of p35nck5a and p39nck5ai mRNAs by Northern blot analysis. Fig. 4A shows that none of the cell lines expressed p35nck5amRNA, with the exception of Jurkat cells, a human T cell line, which showed a very low, nonetheless detectable Northern blot signal. On the other hand, N2A cells, a neuroblastoma cell line, and PC12 cells, a pheochromocytoma cell line that can be differentiated by nerve growth factor treatment into sympathetic neuron-like cells, expressed significant levels of p39nck5aimRNA (Fig. 4B). The level of the mRNA transcript was especially high in PC12 cells. None of the other cell lines, including a glioma cell line (C6), contained detectable p39nck5aitranscript. The observation that only cell lines of neural origin or with neuron characteristics express p39nck5aisuggests that the protein is neuron-specific. In situ hybridization procedures were used to examine the regional distribution of p39nck5ai mRNA in the brain of a 3-month-old rat. The result indicated that the messenger transcript was highly expressed in CA1 to CA3 of hippocampal formation, an area enriched in neurons (Fig. 5). The presence of the Nck5ai mRNA in neurons can be clearly seen with a higher magnification of the CA3 region (Fig. 5C). Some expression of the p39nck5ai mRNA could also be seen in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In contrast, no expression of the mRNA was detected in the fimbria hippocampi, an area containing axons of neurons and glial cells. These results on the regional distribution of p39nck5ai mRNA are compatible with the suggestion that p39nck5ai is a neuron-specific protein. The active neuronal Cdc2-like kinase purified from bovine brain contains a 25-kDa subunit (p25nck5a)(19Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a truncated form of p35nck5a(23Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed p25nck5a or a further truncated form of 21 kDa (p21nck5a) can activate bacterially expressed monomeric Cdk5 to an activity similar to that of the purified neuronal Cdc2-like kinase(31Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Lee K.Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that p21nck5a contains the active domain essential for Cdk5 activation. A cDNA clone encoding a 30-kDa truncated form of p39nck5ai containing the region corresponding to p25nck5a was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli. The expressed fusion protein, GST-p30nck5ai, was purified by glutathione affinity chromatography and tested for Cdk5 activating activity. Fig. 6 shows that the protein could activate bacterially expressed Cdk5 to a maximal activity about the same as that achieved by a GST-p21nck5a fusion protein. Three different preparations of GST-p30nck5ai were tested for the ability to activate Cdk5; essentially identical levels of maximal Cdk5 activation were obtained. However, the dose dependence of the Cdk5 activation by the bacterially expressed fusion protein varied from preparation to preparation, probably because different preparations contained different proportions of the active protein. Bovine brain extract contains high levels of monomeric Cdk5. Monomeric brain Cdk5 has been partially purified and shown to associate readily with p25nck5a or p21nck5a to form active Cdk5 kinases. When the GST-p30nck5ai fusion protein was incubated with an aliquot of bovine brain extract and then affinity-precipitated by glutathione beads, Cdk5 in the brain extract was found to coprecipitate with the fusion protein as revealed by a specific Cdk5 antibody probe (Fig. 7A). The precipitate displayed good histone H1 peptide kinase activity, suggesting that brain Cdk5 could be activated by the fusion protein (Fig. 7B). In a separate experiment, a monomeric Cdk5 preparation partially purified from bovine brain was incubated with the GST-p30nck5ai fusion protein for 30 min, and the kinase activity of the sample was then determined. While neither monomeric Cdk5 nor the bacterially expressed fusion protein alone had any kinase activity, incubation of the two proteins together resulted in high histone H1 kinase activity (data not shown). This observation provides direct proof that Nck5ai is capable of activating the native form of Cdk5. Until now, Nck5a has been the only protein known to be capable of reconstituting highly active Cdk5 kinases. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of an isoform of Nck5a, a 39-kDa protein that displays a high degree of amino acid sequence homology to p35nck5a with 57% amino acid identity. Like p35nck5a, this protein, called p39nck5ai, is capable of associating with Cdk5 to form functional kinases of high activity and shows brain-specific mRNA expression as revealed by the Northern blot analysis of its tissue distribution in both bovine and rat tissues. On the basis of detailed immunohistochemical studies and in situ hybridization analysis, p35nck5a has been suggested to be expressed specifically in neurons. 2K. Tomizawa, H. Matsui, M. Matsushita, J. Lew, M. Tokuda, T. Itano, R. Konishi, J. H. Wang, and O. Hatase, submitted for publication. At least two lines of evidence support the suggestion that p39nck5ai is also present specifically in animal brain neurons. Among a number of cell lines examined in culture, only N2A cells (a cell line of neural origin) and PC12 cells (a pheochromocytoma cell line capable of differentiating with nerve growth factor into neuron-like cells) were found to contain p39nck5ai mRNA. Significantly, a cell line of glial origin, the C6 glioma cell line, did not show detectable p39nck5ai mRNA signal on its Northern blot. The in situ hybridization patterns of Nck5ai indicate that p39nck5ai is greatly enriched in the CA1 to CA3 zone of hippocampal formation of adult rat brain (a region rich in neurons) and absent in the fimbria hippocampi, where glial cells predominate. The existence of two brain- and neuron-specific Cdk5 activators has raised the question as to the physiological significance of the isoforms. As the brain is a highly complex organ containing many different cell types, one possible reason for the existence of isoforms of neuronal Cdk5 activators may be that the isoforms have distinct cell-type or brain regional distributions. Alternatively, the isoforms may coexist in the same neurons, but have differential subcellular localizations. We have recently observed that Cdk5 and p35nck5a are localized in different compartments in neurons of adult rat brains. While Cdk5 is enriched in the axons of central nervous neurons, p35nck5a has been seen mostly in the cell body.2 It is tempting to speculate that p39nck5ai may have an axonal localization so that the cell body and axonal function of Cdk5 in neurons are regulated by Nck5a and Nck5ai, respectively. The situation is somewhat similar to the regulation of Cdc2 by phase-specific cyclins in yeast during cell division cycle progression(10Nasmyth K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 11Reed S.I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 529-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), except that the phase-specific cyclins are temporal specific regulators of Cdc2, whereas Nck5a and Nck5ai are spatial specific regulators of Cdk5. Work is under way to determine whether p39nck5ai indeed has an axonal localization. The suggestion that p35nck5a and p39nck5ai have different functional roles in brain neurons appears to be supported by the observation that the two proteins are differentially expressed in cultured proliferating cells. Of all the cells examined, only the two cell lines with neuronal characteristics and capable of induced differentiation into neuron-like cells were found to contain p39nck5ai. While it is tempting to suggest that the protein contributes to the neuronal differentiation of the cells, supporting evidence for such a suggestion has not been forthcoming. In contrast to Nck5ai mRNA, Nck5a mRNA was not detected in any of the cell lines examined, except in the human T cell line (Jurkat cells), albeit at a very low level. The significance of the presence of p35nck5a in a human T cell line is not clear. It should be noted that neither p35nck5a nor p39nck5ai mRNA has been detected in bovine or rat thymus, an organ with concentrated T cells. The question as to why p35nck5a mRNA is absent in proliferating N2A and PC12 cells is not addressed in this study. The possibility that the protein and its mRNA are expressed in differentiated N2A and PC12 cells will be of considerable significance and interest. Although p35nck5a and p39nck5ai are activators of a cyclin-dependent kinase, they display only marginal sequence homology to members of the cyclin family. The two proteins also appear to distinguish themselves from members of the cyclin family in the mechanism of kinase activation. It has been well documented that the activation of Cdk2 by cyclin A, Cdc2 by cyclin B, and Cdk4 by cyclin D is dependent on the phosphorylation of the Cdks on a threonine residue (Thr-160 of Cdc2 or its equivalent in the other Cdks) by a specific Cdk-activating kinase for full kinase activity(25Fesquet D. Labbe J.C. Derancourt J. Capony J.P. Galas S. Girard F. Lorca T. Shuttleworth J. Doree M. Cavadore J.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3111-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 26Poon R.Y.C.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The activation of Cdk5 by the Cdk5 activators, on the other hand, can bring out high Cdk5 kinase activity in the absence of Cdk5 phosphorylation (31Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Lee K.Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The unique amino acid sequences and distinctive activation characteristics together suggest that the two proteins may define a new family of kinase activator proteins. As none of the cyclins and no other proteins have been shown to activate Cdk5, this new family of kinase activators may be specific and unique for Cdk5 or Cdk5-like kinases. While Cdk5 has a wide tissue and cell distribution, only brain- and neuron-specific Cdk5 activators have been identified to date. It seems reasonable to suggest that there are additional members of this protein family that function as Cdk5 activators in non-neuronal cells. If so, degenerated polymerase chain reaction primers derived from some of the most conserved regions of these two neuronal Cdk5 activators may be useful in the search for additional Cdk5 kinase activators."

In the current studies, murine neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a) were stably transfected with human apoE3 or apoE4 cDNA, and the effect on neurite outgrowth was examined. The stably transfected cells secreted nanogram quantities of apoE (44-89 ng/mg of cell protein in 48 h). In the absence of lipoproteins, neurite outgrowth was similar in the apoE3- and apoE4-secreting cells. The apoE4-secreting cells, when incubated with β-VLDL, VLDL, cerebrospinal fluid lipoproteins (d < 1.21 g/ml), or with triglyceride/phospholipid (2.7:1 (w/w)) emulsions, showed a reduction in the number of neurites/cell, a decrease in neurite branching, and an inhibition of neurite extension, whereas in the apoE3-secreting cells in the presence of a lipid source, neurite extension was increased. Uptake of β-VLDL occurred to a similar extent in both the apoE3- and apoE4-secreting cells. With low density lipoproteins or with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine emulsions, either alone or complexed with cholesterol, no differential effect on neurite outgrowth was observed. A slight differential effect was observed with apoE-containing high density lipoproteins. The differential effect of apoE3 and apoE4 in the presence of β-VLDL was blocked by incubation of the cells with heparinase and chlorate, with lactoferrin, or with receptor-associated protein, all of which prevent the uptake of lipoproteins by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). The data suggest that the secreted and/or cell surface-bound apoE interact with the lipoproteins and facilitate their internalization via the heparan sulfate proteoglycan-LRP pathway. The mechanism by which apoE3 and apoE4 exert differential effects on neurite outgrowth remains speculative. However, the data suggest that apoE4, which has been shown to be associated with late onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease, may inhibit neuronal remodeling and contribute to the progression of the disease.

E, a 34-kDa protein coded for by a gene on chromosome 19, plays a prominent role in the transport and metabolism of plasma cholesterol and triglyceride through its ability to interact with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) (1Mahley R.W.

Apolipoprotein E also may play an important role in the redistribution of lipids within the central nervous system(3Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Hui D. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

Three common isoforms of apoE, distinguished by differing mobility on isoelectric focusing gels, differ in amino acids at positions 112 and 158(1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). The most common isoform, apoE3, has cysteine at position 112 and arginine at 158, whereas apoE2 has cysteine at both positions, and apoE4 has arginine at both. The isoforms are encoded by three alleles at the same gene locus. Apolipoprotein E4 has recently been shown to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD)(8Namba Y. Tomonaga M. Kawasaki H. Otomo E.

Homozygosity for apoE4 is virtually certain to result in AD by age 80(11Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D.E. Gaskell P.C. Small G.W. Roses A.D. Haines J.L. Pericak-Vance M.A. Science. 1993; 261: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (7163) Google Scholar). The defining neuropathological features of AD are the presence of extracellular deposits of β-amyloid in the cerebral cortex and vascular amyloid around blood vessels as well as intracellular deposits of hyperphosphorylated Ŵ in the form of neurofibrillary tangles in neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala(22Goedert M. Sisodia S.S. Price D.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1991; 1: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein E is associated with both the senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles present in the brains of AD patients(10Strittmatter W.J. Saunders A.M. Schmechel D. Pericak-Vance M. Enghild J. Salvesen G.S. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1977-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (3657) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which apoE4 is related to AD is unknown and could involve a direct effect of apoE on neurons. We therefore examined the effect of apoE3 and apoE4 on neurons in vitro. When fetal rabbit dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were incubated with β-migrating very low density lipoproteins (β-VLDL), which are rich in apoE and cholesterol, neurite outgrowth and branching were increased (23Handelmann G.E. Boyles J.K. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1677-1688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of rabbit apoE (structurally similar to human apoE3) together with the β-VLDL reduced neurite branching but very significantly increased neurite extension(23Handelmann G.E. Boyles J.K. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1677-1688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an extension of these studies, we found that human apoE3 and apoE4, when added together with β-VLDL, have differential effects on the outgrowth of neurites from DRG neurons in culture(24Nathan B.P. Bellosta S. Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. Science. 1994; 264: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Compared with cells incubated with β-VLDL alone, cells treated with human apoE3 plus β-VLDL showed decreased branching and increased neurite extension, whereas cells treated with apoE4 plus β-VLDL had decreased neurite outgrowth(24Nathan B.P. Bellosta S. Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. Science. 1994; 264: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Similar observations showing an isoform-specific effect of exogenous apoE3 and apoE4 in the presence of a source of lipid have been described using a murine neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro-2a) in culture(25Nathan B.P.

When incubated with β-VLDL, VLDL, or CSF lipoproteins, these cells, expressing small amounts of endogenous apoE3 and apoE4, displayed differences in neurite outgrowth. The enhanced neurite outgrowth in the apoE3-secreting cells and inhibition of neurite outgrowth in the apoE4-secreting cells were abolished by reagents known to block binding and internalization of apoE-enriched lipoproteins by the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-LRP pathway(26Mahley R.W.

Suramin was from Miles Inc. (FBA Pharmaceuticals, West Haven, CT), and 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI) was from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). The murine neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro-2a) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Bovine CSF was obtained from Pel-Freez, Inc. (Fayetteville, AR).Preparation of Lipoproteins and LiposomesRabbit β-VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) were isolated from the plasma of New Zealand White rabbits fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet for 4 days (29Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Esser V. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5810-5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Rabbit VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) were isolated by ultracentrifugation from fasting plasma obtained from rabbits fed a normal rabbit chow. The VLDL were washed once by ultracentrifugation at d = 1.006 g/ml. Bovine CSF lipoproteins (d < 1.21 g/ml) were isolated by ultracentrifugation as described previously (3Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Hui D. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14352-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were washed once by recentrifugation through a solution of d = 1.21 g/ml. Canine apoE HDLC (d = 1.006-1.02 g/ml) were isolated by ultracentrifugation and Pevikon electrophoresis from the plasma of foxhounds fed a semisynthetic diet containing hydrogenated coconut oil and cholesterol (30Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Fry D.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1977; 87: 205-226PubMed Google Scholar). The β-VLDL were iodinated by the method of Bilheimer et al.(31Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar), and free iodine was removed by PD10 column chromatography. The DMPC vesicles were prepared essentially as described previously(32Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DMPC alone (90 mg) or with the addition of cholesterol (10 mg) was dissolved in benzene and dried by lyophilization. The lyophilized material was then resuspended in 3 ml of 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, and 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.6) and sonicated for 30 min at 37°C using a sonifier cell disrupter (Branson 450, Danbury, CT) equipped with a microtip and full setting at 7 (50 watts) (32Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The material was centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 rpm (37°C), and the supernatant was used for additions to cells. The lipid emulsion A was prepared as described previously(33Pittman R.C. Glass C.K. Atkinson D. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2435-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Spooner P.J.R. Clark S.B. Gantz D.L. Hamilton J.A. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1444-1453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the lipids were mixed together in the ratio, 100 mg of triolein and 25 mg of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, and then dried under a stream of nitrogen. The pellet was then resuspended in 5 ml of 10 mM Tris-Cl, 0.1 M KCl, and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) buffer and sonicated as described previously(34Spooner P.J.R. Clark S.B. Gantz D.L. Hamilton J.A. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1444-1453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The material was then centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 rpm. The composition of the final emulsion was 2.7:1 for triolein/phosphatidylcholine (w/w). The size and morphology of the emulsion particles were determined by negative staining electron microscopy.Preparation of Expression VectorsThe expression vectors were assembled in the pBSSK plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The constructs contained the rat neuron-specific enolase promoter (kindly provided by Dr. J. G. Sutcliffe, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA), which has been previously used to direct neuron-specific expression of the human amyloid precursor protein and β-galactosidase in transgenic mice(35Quon D. Wang Y. Catalano R. Scardina J.M. Murakami K. Cordell B. Nature. 1991; 352: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 36Forss-Petter S. Danielson P.E. Catsicas S. Battenberg E. Price J. Nerenberg M. Sutcliffe J.G. Neuron. 1990; 5: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition, the construct contained the first exon (noncoding), the first intron, and the first six bases of the second exon (prior to the initiation methionine) of the human apoE gene, followed by the apoE cDNA. The apoE4 construct was identical except that it also contained the third intron. The noncoding region of the fourth exon was downstream from the cDNA, followed by 112 base pairs of the 3′-flanking sequence of the human apoE gene that contains the polyadenylation signal. The apoE constructs for insertion in these expression vectors were kindly provided by Drs. S. Lauer and J. Taylor of the J. David Gladstone Institutes. The orientation of the cDNAs was confirmed by sequencing, using an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer. The final constructs were referred to as neuron-specific enolase-E3 (for E3 cDNA) and neuron-specific enolase-E4 (for E4 cDNA). Plasmid DNA was purified by two rounds of cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation(37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To test the constructs, Chinese hamster ovary cells and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transiently transfected (lipofectin-mediated), and the concentration of apoE in the medium was measured as described below. Similar levels of expression of apoE3 and apoE4 were achieved (data not shown).Production of Stably Transfected Neuro-2a Cell LinesCells at 20-30% confluence were cotransfected with pSV2 neo and either neuron-specific enolase-E3 or neuron-specific enolase-E4 using a calcium phosphate precipitation protocol(38Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Control cells were transfected with pSV2 neo alone following the same protocol (38Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were selected by growth in DMEM/F12 media containing 10% FBS and 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Individual G418-resistant colonies were selected and expanded. Secretion of human apoE3 or apoE4 by the transfected cells was verified by Western blotting of the conditioned media as described below.Apolipoprotein E QuantitationIntracellular, cell-surface-bound, and secreted apoE were quantitated in cells maintained for 96 h in N2 medium, a serum- and lipid-free medium (DMEM/F12 containing growth supplements (39Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 129: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with or without added β-VLDL (40 μg of cholesterol/ml)). The medium was changed once at 48 h. The secreted apoE reported is that present in the medium following the second 48-h incubation. The media were collected and, after the addition of protease inhibitors, centrifuged to eliminate suspended cells. The cell monolayers were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 2 ml of DMEM/F12 containing 25 mM Hepes and 10 mM suramin, a polyanion that is able to release apoE bound to the cell surface (27Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apoE was precipitated from the medium and the suramin extract by addition of 50 μg/ml of fumed silica (Sigma) and centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min.Each pellet was washed 3 times with sterile water and dissolved in gel-loading buffer. Cellular apoE was extracted from the cells, following suramin removal of surface-bound apoE, using STEN buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, containing 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Samples were electrophoresed on 5-20% polyacrylamide gradient gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, as described previously(40Ji Z.-S. Lauer S.J. Fazio S. Bensadoun A. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13429-13436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper by blotting and treated with an anti-human apoE polyclonal antiserum (1:1,000 dilution) raised in rabbit (generously provided by Dr. K. H. Weisgraber, Gladstone Institutes). The nitrocellulose immunoblot then was incubated with donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000 dilution) (Amersham Corp.). After washing to remove unbound antibody, the immunocomplex was detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Corp.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitation of the level of apoE bound, internalized, and secreted by the cells was accomplished by densitometric scanning (Ambis Scanner, San Diego, CA) and based on a standard curve of purified human plasma apoE3 and apoE4.Neurite OutgrowthCells were grown in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS and G418 (400 μg/ml). On the day the experiment was initiated, the cells were subcultured into 35-mm plates in DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS. The cells were allowed to adhere to the plastic plates for 2 h at 37°C, and then the culture medium was changed to N2 medium with or without increasing concentrations of lipoproteins. After 48 h at 37°C, the media were replaced with the same medium (with or without lipoproteins), and the incubation was continued for an additional 48 h. (The CSF lipoproteins were dialyzed against N2 medium prior to addition to the cells.) The cells then were washed with DMEM/F12 containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, nonspecifically stained for 1 h at 37°C with DiI added in Me2SO as described previously(24Nathan B.P. Bellosta S. Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. Science. 1994; 264: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS (v/v). Neurons were imaged in fluorescence mode with a confocal laser scanning system (MRC-600, Bio-Rad), and the images were digitized with an Image-1/AT image analysis system (Universal Images, West Chester, PA). The neuronal images were coded before characterization, and the following variables were measured: 1) number of neurites (defined as cell surface projections at least one-half the cell diameter) on each neuron; 2) neurite branching (the number of branch points on each neurite); and 3) neurite extension (the length of the longest neurite, measured from the cell body). Typically, in each experiment the neurites of 20-40 neurons/plate were measured, and the results were presented as the mean ± S.E.In studies on the effect of the inhibitors of lipoprotein binding to the LRP, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in N2 medium containing the indicated concentrations of either lactoferrin, chlorate, or heparinase or with the receptor-associated protein (RAP). Then the β-VLDL were added, and the incubation was continued for a total of 96 h. The reagents, except for β-VLDL, were re-added every 24 h. The media and β-VLDL were replaced after 48 h.Cell Association and Degradation of 125I-β-VLDLThe cells were grown for 24 h in 35-mm dishes in N2 medium alone. Then 125I-β-VLDL (3 μg of protein/ml of medium) were added, and the incubation was continued for 16 h at 37°C. The medium was analyzed for trichloroacetic acid-soluble lipoprotein degradation products as described previously(41Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). The cells were placed on ice, washed with PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and dissolved in 0.1 N NaOH. Lipoprotein cell association was determined by measuring cellular radioactivity using a g counter (Beckman Gamma 8000, Beckmann Instruments, Fullerton, CA)(41Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar).Cell Association of DiI-labeled β-VLDLThe cells were grown for 24 h in 35-mm dishes in N2 medium. Then DiI-labeled β-VLDL (4 μg of protein/ml of medium), prepared as described previously(42Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 2-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Weinstein J.N. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were added, and the incubation was continued for 5 h at 37°C. The cells then were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (v/v). Uptake of DiI-labeled β-VLDL was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. To quantitate the amount of DiI-labeled lipoprotein in the cells at the end of the incubation, the cells were scraped, using two 0.5-ml aliquots of PBS, and lyophilized. The DiI was extracted from the dried cell pellet with methanol and analyzed using a spectrofluorometer (excitation 520 nm, emission 570 nm)(42Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 2-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standards of DiI in methanol were used for quantitation.Association of ApoE with Lipid ParticlesApolipoproteins E3 and E4 were iodinated using Bolton-Hunter reagent (DuPont NEN) as described previously (44Innerarity T.L.

https://openalex.org/W1974402242,"We have measured proton release into the medium after proton transfer from the retinal Schiff base to Asp85 in the photocycle and the C=O stretch bands of carboxylic acids in wild type bacteriorhodopsin and the E204Q and E204D mutants.

INTRODUCTIONBacteriorhodopsin is the light-driven proton pump in the cell membranes of halobacteria. The transport cycle (“photocycle”) is initiated by photoisomerization of retinal from all-trans to 13-cis and the ensuing transfer of a proton from the retinal Schiff base to Asp85, an anionic residue that lies between the Schiff base and the extracellular surface of the protein (Mathies et al., 1991; Tittor, 1991; Ebrey, 1993; Krebs and Khorana, 1993; Lanyi, 1993). After protonation of Asp85, a proton is released to the aqueous phase. A protein conformational shift observed while the Schiff base is unprotonated (Subramaniam et al., 1993) has been associated with the kinetically detected M1 to M2 reaction (Váró and Lanyi, 1995). It was suggested to change the access of the Schiff base away from Asp85 and toward the initially protonated Asp96 that lies near the cytoplasmic surface (Kataoka et al., 1994) and to lower the pKa of Asp96 (Cao et al., 1993b; Brown et al., 1995a). Asp96 thus becomes a proton donor and reprotonates the Schiff base. This is followed by reprotonation of Asp96 from the cytoplasmic surface, reisomerization of the retinal to all-trans, and deprotonation of Asp85 in the extracellular domain, thereby recovering the initial state. The intermediate states that arise and decay in this cycle have been named J, K, L, M, N, and O (Lozier et al., 1975).The proton transfers inside the protein to and from the Schiff base trigger the proton transfers between groups near the surfaces and the aqueous phase. The pKa of the release group in the extracellular domain is lowered after protonation of Asp85 (Zimányi et al., 1992), and the pKa of the proton uptake group in the cytoplasmic domain is raised after deprotonation of Asp96 (Zimányi et al., 1993). In this way the extracellular and cytoplasmic peripheral domains facilitate the unidirectional passage of protons. The details of this coupling are not yet clear because both regions are structurally complex (Henderson et al., 1990) and contain several protonatable and hydrogen-bonding residues, as well as functionally important bound water (Maeda et al., 1992, 1994; Brown et al., 1994; Fischer et al., 1994; Kandori et al., 1995; Yamazaki et al., 1995).The relevant buried protonatable residues to the extracellular side of the Schiff base are Asp85, Asp212, and Arg82 and possibly Tyr57 and Tyr185. The first three and coordinated water constitute a diffuse counter-ion to the Schiff base (De Groot et al., 1989, 1990; Dér et al., 1991). Interaction of the anionic Asp85 with Arg82 is indicated by the fact that the pKa of Asp85 is increased by about 5 pH units in the R82Q and R82A mutants (Subramaniam et al., 1990; Thorgeirsson et al., 1991; Balashov et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1993), and interaction of Asp85 with the Schiff base is inferred from the fact that the pKa of the Schiff base is decreased by about 4 pH units in the D85N mutant (Otto et al., 1990; Marti et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1993; Tittor et al., 1994; Kataoka et al., 1994). The participation of Asp212 in these interactions is indicated by the observations that in D212N the Schiff base does not deprotonate after photoisomerization of the retinal near neutral pH (Otto et al., 1990; Needleman et al., 1991; Cao et al., 1993b), and in the D212N/R82Q mutant the pKa of Asp85 is not raised as in R82Q, but the pKa of the Schiff base appears to be several pH units higher than in the wild type (Brown et al., 1995b). Understanding the first half of the photocycle means understanding the nature of dipole interactions and proton transfers within this complex. There are some suggestive clues. A newly formed hydrogen bond between water and Asp85 appears to play an essential role in destabilizing the Schiff base proton in the L intermediate (Maeda et al., 1994). After transfer of this proton to Asp85 in the L to M reaction, a proton is released to the extracellular surface. The released proton originates not from Asp85, because this residue remains protonated until the final reaction of the photocycle, but from an unknown group termed XH. The pKa of XH must be high in the unphotolyzed protein (Kono et al., 1993; Balashov et al., 1993) but will have decreased at this time to about 6 (Zimányi et al., 1992). Above pH 6 XH releases its proton, but at more acid pH it remains protonated throughout, and a proton is released at the extracellular surface only at the end of the photocycle, presumably directly from Asp85 as its pKa returns to its initial low value (about 2.5). Arg82 and Tyr57 have been proposed as candidates for XH, but the former would have to be in a very unusual environment for its pKa to become as low as 6 (Brown et al., 1993), and as for the latter, neither UV Raman (Ames et al., 1990) nor NMR (Herzfeld et al., 1990; McDermott et al., 1991) indicate the formation of a tyrosinate in the photocycle. In view of these problems, until now a water liganded to Arg82 (Braiman et al., 1988) seemed to be the most likely source of the released proton.In this report we identify Glu204, a residue located nearly at the surface end of the extracellular proton channel and about 15 Å from the Schiff base (Henderson et al., 1990), as part of the proton release mechanism. The evidence indicates that Glu204 is protonated in BR but unprotonated in the M state and strongly suggests therefore that Glu204 is the proton release group XH. This role for Glu204 was recently predicted on the basis of molecular dynamics calculations (Scharnagl et al., 1995).MATERIALS AND METHODSThe site-specific residue replacements E204Q and E204D were introduced into the bop gene and expressed in Halobacterium salinarium with a vector based on a halobacterial plasmid to be described elsewhere. The mutant R82Q was described before (Brown et al., 1993). The purple membranes containing these proteins were purified by a standard method (Oesterhelt and Stoeckenius, 1974).Time-resolved spectroscopy was as described previously (Cao et al., 1993a, 1993b). The experiments that measured proton release were done in 2 M NaCl at the pH indicated, without buffer, and with or without 50 μM pyranine. When it occurred several milliseconds after photoexcitation or later, the absorption change of pyranine was assumed to approximate the kinetics of the interaction of the protons with the protein, because protons at the surface and in the bulk equilibrate in about 1 ms (Heberle and Dencher, 1992). All spectroscopy in the visible was at a regulated 22°C.For the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 1The abbreviations used are: FTIRFourier transform infrared. measurements, 40-μl aliquots of the samples in 2.5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7, were dried on a BaF2 window, humidified with H2O or D2O before mounting into an Oxford cryostat, and illuminated at 274°K for 2 min with >500 nm light for light adaptation. The M minus BR spectra were measured at 230 K after 1 min of illumination with >500 nm light in a Bio-Rad FTIR spectrometer FTS60A/896 with 2 cm-1 resolution. The spectra shown are differences of the averages of four to six recordings, each calculated from 128 interferograms before and after illumination. All the spectra are scaled by normalizing to the amplitude of the 1169 cm-1 band.RESULTSPhotocycle and Protonation/Deprotonation Kinetics of E204Q BacteriorhodopsinThe absorption maximum of the chromophore did not shift noticeably upon replacement of Glu204 with glutamine (not shown); neither was the photocycle fundamentally changed. Some differences from wild type were noted, however. Fig. 1 shows difference spectra of E204Q measured at various delay times after photoexcitation with a nanosecond laser flash. The decay of the initial red-shifted product (the K intermediate) is accompanied by the rise of a somewhat blue-shifted state (the L intermediate) and followed at a much earlier time than in wild type by the formation of a far-blue shifted state (the M intermediate). Because of the rapid rise of the M state, the L state accumulates only to a small extent. Decay of the M intermediate in the wild type results in the formation of a state that absorbs near the maximum of BR (the N intermediate) but at neutral pH this is not readily detectable in E204Q. Instead, the strongly red-shifted state that follows N (the O intermediate) is the one that accumulates in large amounts before recovery of the initial BR state.Fig. 2A shows the time-courses of absorbance changes at selected wavelengths after photoexcitation of wild type bacteriorhodopsin. At 410 nm the M intermediate is measured, at 660 nm the O intermediate is measured, and at 570 nm mostly the depletion of the BR state is measured. From the latter, the presence or the absence of the N intermediate during and after decay of the M state can be inferred also (Zimányi et al., 1993). In addition to these traces, the net absorption of the pH indicator dye pyranine is included (Fig. 2, dashed line) to show the release of protons (from the extracellular surface) and their uptake (at the cytoplasmic surface) that occurs roughly during the decay of N. Although pyranine detects the protons only once they are in the bulk, the pH-dependent kinetics had argued (Zimányi et al., 1992) that when the protons are released to the membrane surface during the formation of M, it occurs during the M1 to M2 reaction.Figure 2:Absorbance change at selected wavelengths and proton kinetics as measured with pyranine.

Fig. 2B shows that in R82Q (a) the formation of M is more rapid than in wild type, (b) proton release is delayed until after proton uptake at the other membrane surface, and (c) very little of the O intermediate accumulates. Proton transport occurs in spite of the late release of the proton to the extracellular surface, apparently because the M1 to M2 reaction can proceed without deprotonation of the XH group, as in the wild type at pH < 6 (Zimányi et al., 1992). The effects of the R82Q mutation on the deprotonation of the Schiff base and the proton release have suggested that Arg82 has a role in proton conduction between the Schiff base and the aqueous phase. The effect of Arg82 on the accumulation of O was suggested to reflect a requirement for its positive charge for the early reisomerization of the retinal from 13-cis to all-trans in the N to O reaction (Otto et al., 1990; Cao et al., 1993a; Balashov et al., 1993).Fig. 3A shows single wavelength kinetics for the chromophore and for protons in E204Q at pH 7.3. This mutant resembles R82Q in that (a) the formation of M is more rapid than in wild type (by about 3×), but more importantly in that (b) proton release is delayed until after proton uptake. Thus, as in R82Q, the proton release mechanism that utilizes deprotonation of XH is made inactive upon replacing Glu204. However, unlike in R82Q, the O intermediate accumulates in amounts even larger than in the wild type. The decay of M contains a second phase, larger than in wild type, with a time constant that roughly corresponds to the rise of the O state. The proton uptake coincides with the rise of the O state.Figure 3:Absorbance change for E204Q (A) and E204D (B) bacteriorhodopsins at selected wavelengths and proton kinetics as measured with pyranine.

However, the decay of M and the rise and decay of the O state are much more rapid, as in the wild type. The rise of M is 1.5× faster than in the wild type. Importantly, Fig. 3B shows that, unlike in E204Q, proton release is unaffected when Glu204 is replaced with an aspartate. Proton release occurs before uptake, as in the wild type (Fig. 2A).FTIR Spectra of Photointermediates of Wild Type, E204Q, and E204D BacteriorhodopsinsThe results above demonstrate that like Arg82, residue 204 is a participant in the release of a proton to the extracellular surface. There are three alternatives: (a) Glu204 influences XH but does not have a proton transfer role, (b) Glu204conducts the proton from XH to the aqueous medium, and (c) Glu204 is in fact XH, the source of the released proton. The features of the C=O stretch region for protonated carboxyls should reveal whether Glu204 does not deprotonate or deprotonates only transiently and without accumulation of the carboxylate anion (alternatives a or b) or if Glu204 deprotonates in M and remains unprotonated (alternative c). However, the C=O stretch frequency for a glutamic acid is in general lower than that for aspartic acid, such as Asp85 (Braiman et al., 1988) or Asp96 (Bouschéet al., 1991), and the intensity of the band is weaker; therefore the expected negative depletion band would be buried in the complex amide band region between 1650 and 1700 cm-1. Indeed, an early FTIR study (Eisenstein et al., 1987) found no evidence that any of the glutamic acids participate in proton transport. On the other hand, the two mutants studied would help to decide this. The putative band from the deprotonation of Glu204 would be absent in E204Q, and its frequency would be shifted in E204D to above 1700 cm-1, a range where the amide bands do not interfere.Fig. 4 shows M minus BR spectra in the C=O stretch region for the wild type protein, E204Q, and E204D. The spectrum of the wild type (Fig. 4A) contains the prominent positive band of the protonated Asp85 at 1761 cm-1, characteristic of the M state (Braiman et al., 1988; Fahmy et al., 1992). As in many earlier reported spectra under these conditions, there is no obvious negative band that would indicate the deprotonation of Glu204. However, the appearance of a negative band at 1714 cm-1 in E204D (Fig. 4C) raises the strong possibility that when residue 204 is an aspartic acid, it becomes deprotonated. If this is indeed the depletion band of the protonated Asp204, its frequency will be downshifted in D2O, similarly to the positive band of the protonated Asp85. The appearance of a negative band at 1703 cm-1 in D2O (Fig. 4C, dotted line) confirms this. The downshift of 11 cm-1 in D2O is similar to the 12 cm-1 downshift for Asp85 in the same spectra. Fig. 4 shows also the differences between the spectra measured in H2O and D2O for E204Q and E204D. Recordings of two independent experiments are shown to illustrate the reproducibility of these difference spectra. In the E204D the H2O/D2O difference spectrum has the positive and negative features expected from the spectra in Fig. 4C. They are absent in E204Q (Fig. 4B). Importantly, the results with the wild type (Fig. 4A) show that there is a similar H2O/D2O difference feature at lower frequencies, where the original bands are obscured by the amide bands. The negative band is at 1700 cm-1, and the positive band is at 1690 cm-1. We suggest that the 1700 cm-1 band is the depletion band of the protonated Glu204. The small bands in the 1720-1740 cm-1 region are ascribed to perturbation of Asp96 and Asp115 (Sasaki et al., 1994). The broad bands in the 1680-1705 cm-1 region in E204Q and E204D are likely due to perturbation of peptide C=O and arginine C-N (Braiman et al., 1994). These perturbations could be different in the different mutants. In E204Q Gln204 might contribute also to these bands.Figure 4:M minus BR difference spectra in the C=O stretch region for wild type bacteriorhodopsin and E204Q and E204D measured with FTIR. For each sample a spectrum in H2O (solid line), a spectrum in D2O (dotted line), and H2O minus D2O spectra from two independent experiments (solid lines below the other two) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The amplitude of the C=O band ascribed to Glu204 is smaller than that of Asp85. Increasing the pH from 7 to 10, which would result in more complete deprotonation of Glu204 in the photocycle but in less observed amplitudes if this pH is higher than the pKa of Glu204 in the unphotolyzed state, did not change the amplitudes (not shown). Tilting the samples, which would reveal any orientational effects of the C=O group in question, did not increase the amplitude relative to that of the Asp85 band (not shown). Measuring the M minus BR spectrum in photostationary states at room temperature, which might result in more efficient proton release, did not increase the amplitude either (not shown). Thus, the low intensities might originate from some degree of delocalization of the proton of residue 204 within the extracellular hydrogen-bonded network. The greater intensity of the band in Asp204 than that in Glu204 might originate, likewise, from better localization of the proton on the aspartate than on the glutamate. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the proton is localized fully on Glu204, but the intensity of the C=O stretch band is lower than expected for some other (unknown) reason.In the region of the O-H stretch of water, the negative band of the wild type at 3643 cm-1 is replaced in E204Q with a band shifted to a lower frequency, at 3638 cm-1 (Fig. 5). The water that changes its hydrogen bonding is therefore more strongly bound in this mutant, as in D212N (Kandori et al., 1995). Replacing Glu204 with aspartic acid preserved the higher frequency, although a second weaker depletion band of unknown origin at a lower frequency appeared also (Fig. 5C).Figure 5:M minus BR difference spectra in the water O-H stretch region for wild type bacteriorhodopsin and E204Q and E204D measured with FTIR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe report here that proton release at the extracellular surface of bacteriorhodopsin does not occur at its normal time in the photocycle when Glu204 is replaced with a glutamine. The influence of this mutation is through removing the carboxyl group, because proton release is normal in E204D. Glu204 is located near the extracellular surface (Henderson et al., 1990), and in a structural model from molecular dynamics calculations (Humphrey et al., 1994), it is connected by a chain of three hydrogen-bonded water molecules to Arg82 in the cluster of residues that directly participate in the counter-ion to the Schiff base. In considering the possible role of Glu204 in the proton release, it is instructive therefore to recall what is known about the hydrogen bonding of water in this region during the photocycle.The properties of the water near Asp85, detected in the L and M states by FTIR, can be summarized as follows. In the wild type unphotolyzed protein it is weakly hydrogen-bonded (O-H stretch at 3643 cm-1) but becomes somewhat more strongly bonded (shift to 3636-3638 cm-1) when either Asp212 (Kandori et al., 1995) or Glu204 (Fig. 5) is replaced. It becomes much more strongly hydrogen-bonded in the L intermediate of the wild type protein (shift to a diffuse region between 3460 and 3560 cm-1). These bands of the O-H stretch are eliminated when Asp85 is replaced (Maeda et al., 1994), suggesting that either Asp85 participates in the increased hydrogen bonding or possibly this water is absent altogether in the D85N mutant. The extent of the shift is greatly reduced when Asp212 is replaced with asparagine (Kandori et al., 1995), suggesting that Asp212 is an important participant in the stronger hydrogen bonding. Therefore, it seems likely that water is held in a hydrogen-bonded network by Arg82, Asp212, Glu204, and Asp85, and this network in the unphotolyzed state is characterized by a balance of opposing hydrogen bonds. After photoexcitation the water becomes more strongly bound to Asp212 and creates the conditions in the L state for the role of Asp85 as proton acceptor to the Schiff base in the L to M reaction and for the subsequent release of a proton to the surface.Arg82 and Glu204 have different functions from Asp85 and Asp212 in this network. When Asp85 or Asp212 is replaced, the complex in L becomes nonfunctional for proton transfer and the Schiff base remains protonated. Replacing Arg82 or Glu204 redistributes the hydrogen bonds of bound water to favor the remaining residues and accelerates rather than abolishes the proton transfer from Schiff base to Asp85. However, the release of a proton to the surface cannot occur at this time in the photocycle when Arg82 or Glu204 is replaced. This does not necessarily identify either of these residues as the group XH, the source of the proton, however. There has never been any direct evidence that the origin of the released proton is Arg82 itself, and we had estimated (Brown et al., 1993) its pKa in the photocycle as much higher than that of XH. A normal proton release in the photocycle of D212N/R82Q (Brown et al., 1995b) argues that Arg82 is not XH. On the other hand, we find not only that proton release depends on Glu204 but that Glu204 is protonated in BR and deprotonated in the M state. It appears therefore that Glu204 is XH, and the proton to be released in the M state is either localized entirely on this carboxyl group or to some degree delocalized in a hydrogen-bonded network that contains also water.Although much closer to the aqueous interface than the residues near the Schiff base (Henderson et al., 1990), Glu204 can probably fulfill the requirements we had set earlier for XH (Zimányi et al., 1992). Because it is the source of the released proton, its pKa should be high in the unphotolyzed protein but decrease to about 6 in the photocycle. Molecular dynamics and electrostatic calculations have estimated the pKa of Glu204 as 13 before photoexcitation but 6-8 in the M state (Scharnagl et al., 1995). We therefore suggest the following sequence of events after photoisomerization of the retinal. First, the Schiff base proton is transferred to the anionic D85. Second, the hydrogen bond between Arg82 and the now neutral Asp85 is broken, and the water dipoles in the network redistribute so as to transfer some of the positive charge of Arg82 toward Glu204. Although the location of Arg82 in the model from electron diffraction is ambiguous (Henderson et al., 1990), in several structural models based on molecular dynamics (Humphrey et al., 1994; Scharnagl et al., 1995), Arg82 does assume the position between Asp85 and Glu204 required for this. Alternatively, the side chain of Arg82 could move from Asp85 toward Glu204. Third, Glu204 loses its proton to the surface and the aqueous phase. This sequence would account for the so far poorly understood events that result in proton release in the photocycle. INTRODUCTIONBacteriorhodopsin is the light-driven proton pump in the cell membranes of halobacteria. The transport cycle (“photocycle”) is initiated by photoisomerization of retinal from all-trans to 13-cis and the ensuing transfer of a proton from the retinal Schiff base to Asp85, an anionic residue that lies between the Schiff base and the extracellular surface of the protein (Mathies et al., 1991; Tittor, 1991; Ebrey, 1993; Krebs and Khorana, 1993; Lanyi, 1993). After protonation of Asp85, a proton is released to the aqueous phase. A protein conformational shift observed while the Schiff base is unprotonated (Subramaniam et al., 1993) has been associated with the kinetically detected M1 to M2 reaction (Váró and Lanyi, 1995). It was suggested to change the access of the Schiff base away from Asp85 and toward the initially protonated Asp96 that lies near the cytoplasmic surface (Kataoka et al., 1994) and to lower the pKa of Asp96 (Cao et al., 1993b; Brown et al., 1995a). Asp96 thus becomes a proton donor and reprotonates the Schiff base. This is followed by reprotonation of Asp96 from the cytoplasmic surface, reisomerization of the retinal to all-trans, and deprotonation of Asp85 in the extracellular domain, thereby recovering the initial state. The intermediate states that arise and decay in this cycle have been named J, K, L, M, N, and O (Lozier et al., 1975).The proton transfers inside the protein to and from the Schiff base trigger the proton transfers between groups near the surfaces and the aqueous phase. The pKa of the release group in the extracellular domain is lowered after protonation of Asp85 (Zimányi et al., 1992), and the pKa of the proton uptake group in the cytoplasmic domain is raised after deprotonation of Asp96 (Zimányi et al., 1993). In this way the extracellular and cytoplasmic peripheral domains facilitate the unidirectional passage of protons. The details of this coupling are not yet clear because both regions are structurally complex (Henderson et al., 1990) and contain several protonatable and hydrogen-bonding residues, as well as functionally important bound water (Maeda et al., 1992, 1994; Brown et al., 1994; Fischer et al., 1994; Kandori et al., 1995; Yamazaki et al., 1995).The relevant buried protonatable residues to the extracellular side of the Schiff base are Asp85, Asp212, and Arg82 and possibly Tyr57 and Tyr185. The first three and coordinated water constitute a diffuse counter-ion to the Schiff base (De Groot et al., 1989, 1990; Dér et al., 1991). Interaction of the anionic Asp85 with Arg82 is indicated by the fact that the pKa of Asp85 is increased by about 5 pH units in the R82Q and R82A mutants (Subramaniam et al., 1990; Thorgeirsson et al., 1991; Balashov et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1993), and interaction of Asp85 with the Schiff base is inferred from the fact that the pKa of the Schiff base is decreased by about 4 pH units in the D85N mutant (Otto et al., 1990; Marti et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1993; Tittor et al., 1994; Kataoka et al., 1994). The participation of Asp212 in these interactions is indicated by the observations that in D212N the Schiff base does not deprotonate after photoisomerization of the retinal near neutral pH (Otto et al., 1990; Needleman et al., 1991; Cao et al., 1993b), and in the D212N/R82Q mutant the pKa of Asp85 is not raised as in R82Q, b"

H. Wong, P. Oelkers, P. N. Rao, M. J. Pettenati, and P. A. Dawson, manuscript in preparation. In this paper, we describe the identification and characterization of a naturally occurring dysfunctional mutation in the HISBT gene. ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter human wild-type ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline human mutant ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter, HISBT(P290S) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis single stranded conformation polymorphism β-galactosidase sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate. Human ileal tissue (within 10 cm of the ileocecal valve) was obtained from a surgical specimen excised due to Crohn's disease. Tissues were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -70°C. Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/CsCl centrifugation procedure(7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using oligo(dT)-cellulose spin columns from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Genomic DNA was isolated from ileal tissue or peripheral white blood cells using the SDS-proteinase K procedure(8Strauss W.M. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 2.2.1-2.2.3Google Scholar). [3H]Taurocholic acid (2.0-2.6 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Tran35S-label (a mixture of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys) was obtained from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Unlabeled taurocholate was purchased from Sigma. COS-1 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in medium A that consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4500 mg/liter D-glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For [3H]taurocholate uptake assays, COS cells were incubated in medium B, which consisted of a modified Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 137 mM NaCl(5Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction was used to obtain a human ISBT DNA probe. First strand cDNA was synthesized from human ileal poly(A)+ RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Superscript kit; Life Technologies Inc.). For the PCR, oligonucleotide primers were synthesized corresponding to amino acid sequences conserved between the hamster ISBT and rat liver Na+/bile acid cotransporter(9Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foguet M. Lubbert H. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10629-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The sense oligonucleotide primer 5′-CAGTTTGGAATCATGCCTCTC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TGTTCTGCAACCCGGTTTCCA-3′ corresponded to amino acids 75-81 and 261-266 of the hamster ISBT. Amplification was performed using an annealing temperature of 45°C. A product of the expected size (576 base pairs) was isolated from a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel and subcloned into a pT7Blue T vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The inserts were sequenced by the dideoxy method(7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A λgt10 cDNA library was constructed from human ileal poly(A)+ RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Superscript kit; Life Technologies Inc.). cDNA was synthesized using a combination of random hexamers and oligo(dT) primers and ligated to EcoRI-NotI adapters. cDNAs greater than 0.5 kilobases in length were isolated on a 1.0% (w/v) agarose gel and ligated to EcoRI-cleaved λgt10 DNA. After in vitro packaging using a Gigapack II Gold Cloning kit (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA), the phage (1.5 × 106 total plaques) were plated and transferred to replicate filters. The filters were hybridized for 16 h at 42°C in buffer containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 2 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 1 × 106 cpm/ml of radiolabeled probe. After hybridization, filters were washed in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 65°C for 30 min. Positive clones were plaque purified; plate lysate DNA was isolated (10Xu S.-Y. Gene Anal. Tech. 1986; 3: 90-91Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pBluescript KS II for restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. The dysfunctional HISBT cDNA, indicated as HISBT(m), was subcloned into EcoRI-digested pCMV5 (11Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for expression studies. Conserved sites for the restriction enzymes, HincII and BanI, were used to generate the HISBT(m) and hamster ISBT chimeras that are diagrammed (see Fig. 3). The pHA construct encoded HISBT(m) amino acids 1-153 and hamster ISBT amino acids 154-348 in the expression plasmid pCMV5. The pAH construct encoded hamster ISBT amino acids 1-153 and HISBT(m) amino acids 154-348 in the expression plasmid pcDNA I/Amp (Invitrogen; San Diego, CA). The pHHA construct encoded HISBT(m) amino acids 1-254 and hamster ISBT amino acids 255-348 in pCMV5. The pHAH construct encoded HISBT(m) amino acids 1-153, hamster ISBT amino acids 154-254, and HISBT(m) amino acids 255-348 in pCMV5. To construct the wild-type HISBT, the following fragments were ligated into pCMV5: HISBT(m) EcoRI-SacI (nucleotides 1-966; amino acids 1-283) and human ISBT cDNA clone λH13 SacI-EcoRI (nucleotides 967-1253; amino acids 284-348). The constructs were verified by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing. A synthetic peptide (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) corresponding to amino acids 335-348 of the hamster ISBT was coupled to tuberculin-purified protein derivative (Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen, Denmark) using glutaraldehyde(12Lachmann P.J. Strangeways L. Vyakarnam A. Evans G. CIBA Found. Symp. 1986; 119: 25-57PubMed Google Scholar). Three New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with 200 μg of coupled peptide in Freund's complete adjuvant. Rabbit serum was assayed for anti-ISBT antibody by immunoblotting using rat or hamster ileal brush-border membrane preparations (13Kessler M. Acuto O. Storelli C. Murer H. Muller M. Semenza G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 506: 136-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). The IgG was then purified from rabbit serum by protein A-Sepharose chromatography(14Dawson P.A. Metherall J.E. Ridgway N.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9128-9134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblotting studies, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in buffer A (15% SDS, 8 M urea, 10% sucrose, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mM EDTA, and 5 mM dithiothreitol) by repeated aspiration through a 25-gauge needle(15Dawson P.A. Ridgway N.D. Slaughter C.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16798-16803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were diluted 10-fold with Laemmli sample buffer (3% SDS, 5% glycerol, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mM EDTA, and 2.5%β-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (14Dawson P.A. Metherall J.E. Ridgway N.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9128-9134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using rabbit anti-ISBT peptide antibody. The rabbit antibody was visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (ECL; Amersham Corp). On day 0, 5 × 105 COS cells/60-mm dish were plated in medium A. On day 1, duplicate dishes of cells were transfected with 2 μg of β-galactosidase (β-gal)(5Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hamster ISBT(5Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or HISBT(m) expression plasmid by the DEAE-dextran method(5Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On day 4, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with methionine- and cysteine-free medium A for 45 min. The cells were then incubated in 1 ml of methionine and cysteine-free medium A containing 200 μCi/ml Tran35S-label for 1 h. After the pulse, the cells were washed once with PBS and chased for 1 h in medium A supplemented with 100 μM unlabeled methionine and 100 μM unlabeled cysteine. The cells were then scraped in PBS and recovered by centrifugation at 400 × g. Cell pellets were lysed in buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin) by repeated aspiration through a 25-gauge needle. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C, and the cell supernatant was immunoprecipitated by incubation with 9 μg of anti-ISBT peptide antibody plus 50 μl of protein A-agarose (50% suspension in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 (TBS-C); RepliGen, Cambridge, MA) for 12 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 s. Pellets were washed twice with buffer B and once with TBS-C. The protein A-agarose beads were resuspended in 0.5% SDS and 1%β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 10 min to elute the immunoprecipitated protein. For endoglycosidase H digestion, aliquots of eluted protein were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 1 × 103 units of endoglycosidase Hf (New England Biolabs; Beverly, MA) in 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.5% SDS, and 1%β-mercaptoethanol. For peptide:N-glycosidase F digestion, aliquots of the eluted protein were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 1 × 103 units of peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, and 1%β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were then brought to 3% SDS, 5% glycerol, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mM EDTA, and 2.5%β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, gels were soaked for 60 min in Entensify (DuPont NEN), dried, and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm. A human placental genomic DNA library in λEMBL3 (Catalog no. HL1067j; Clontech; Palo Alto, CA) was screened using standard methods (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 32P-labeled probes derived from the coding region of the human ISBT cDNA. After screening a total of 2 × 105 bacteriophage, one positive clone was identified and plaque purified. Plate lysate DNA was isolated (10Xu S.-Y. Gene Anal. Tech. 1986; 3: 90-91Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pBluescript II KS for restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. A region of the HISBT gene encompassing the point mutation was amplified by PCR using flanking oligonucleotides and subcloned into a pT7 Blue T vector. The sense oligonucleotide primer 5′-ACACGCAGCTATGTTCCACCATCGT-3′ corresponded to HISBT nucleotides 915-939 (amino acids 266-274); the antisense primer 5′-TGAAATGGGATTGGCATGATTCCT-3′ corresponded to flanking intron sequence. The amplification was carried out with 100 ng of genomic DNA for 35 cycles using an annealing temperature of 65°C. The 150-nucleotide product was resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and isolated for subcloning. For each subject, 8-13 individual clones harboring inserts were subjected to dideoxy nucleotide sequencing using pT7 Blue-specific primers. As a control for contamination, parallel reactions were performed in the absence of genomic DNA. After an initial denaturation step at 100°C for 5 min, PCR amplification was performed with 100 ng of genomic DNA for 30 cycles using an annealing temperature of 68°C. The reaction buffer contained 1.75 mM MgCl2, 50 μM of each dNTP, 1.75 μM of each oligonucleotide, and 1.7 μM [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) in a volume of 20 μl(16Orita M. Suzuki Y. Hayashi K. Genomics. 1989; 5: 874-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). The antisense primer 5′-GCGAGCTGGAAAATGCTGTAGATGA-3′ corresponded to HISBT nucleotides 1014-990 (amino acids 298-291); the sense primer 5′-CATGTGCTCTCTTTAACATCTTCTT-3′ corresponded to the flanking intron sequence. Following the PCR, each sample was diluted 1:10 with Stop solution (90% formamide, 25 mM EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol) and boiled for 5 min prior to resolving on a 10% acrylamide, 10% glycerol, 2 × TBE (180 mM Tris base, 180 mM boric acid, and 4 mM EDTA) gel at room temperature under constant voltage (350 V) for 20 h. The gel was dried and exposed to film with an intensifying screen at -70°C for 4 h. A mock reaction omitting genomic DNA was run in parallel as a control for contamination. To assess the surface expression of the wild-type and mutant HISBT proteins, cell surface biotinylation was performed(17Lantz L.M. Holmes K.L. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 58-60Google Scholar). Approximately 72 h after transfection with human wild-type ISBT, human mutant ISBT, or β-gal expression plasmid, COS cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and resuspended at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells/ml in PBS containing 1 mM sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (NHS-LC-biotin; Pierce). The cells were incubated for 30 min at 20°C, washed 3 times with PBS containing 50 mM glycine, and counted. Aliquots of 6 × 105 cells were lysed in buffer B by repeated aspiration through a 25-gauge needle. After a 20-min incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were incubated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose for 12 h at 4°C prior to immunoprecipitation to reduce nonspecific binding to the resin. After centrifuging the samples for 2 min at 10,000 × g, the supernatants were removed and incubated with 3 μg of rabbit anti-ISBT peptide antibody plus 60 μl of protein A-agarose for 3 h at 4°C. As a control for specificity, parallel reactions were incubated with 3 μg of anti-ISBT peptide antibody in the presence of 20 μg of peptide antigen. Immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times with buffer B, once with TBS-C, and resuspended in 125 μl of buffer A. An aliquot corresponding to the indicated number of cells was prepared for SDS-PAGE by diluting with three volumes of Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 6 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Corp.). Biotinylated proteins were visualized using ECL. A human λgt10 cDNA library was constructed using ileal tissue resected from a patient diagnosed with Crohn's disease. After screening 1.5 × 106 plaques with a PCR-derived human ISBT cDNA probe, seven positive cDNA clones were identified. Restriction enzyme mapping revealed that six of the seven clones encoded partial cDNAs. The seventh clone, HISBT(m), encompassed the entire predicted coding sequence of the human ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter and was sequenced on both strands. The HISBT(m) clone was 1490 base pairs in length and encoded a 118-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region, a 1047-nucleotide coding sequence, and a 325-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region. To compare the bile acid transport properties of the human ISBT cDNA to the previously isolated hamster ISBT(5Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the HISBT(m) clone was inserted into the expression vector pCMV5. After transfection of the hamster ISBT into COS cells, [3H]taurocholate uptake was stimulated almost 600-fold over the mock-transfected background (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, the [3H]taurocholate uptake activity of parallel dishes of HISBT(m)-transfected COS cells was only slightly higher than background. To confirm that the HISBT protein was synthesized in HISBT(m)-transfected COS cells, a pulse-labeling and immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. As shown in Fig. 2, equivalent amounts of hamster ISBT (43 kDa; lanes 1 and 2) and human ISBT (40 kDa; lanes 6 and 7) are synthesized in the ISBT- and HISBT(m)-transfected COS cells. Since both the hamster and human ISBT cDNAs encode 348-amino acid proteins with predicted molecular masses of 38 kDa, the differences in their apparent molecular masses may be due to posttranslational modifications. The hamster ISBT encodes three potential N-linked glycosylation sites(5Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the human ISBT encodes only two. The N-linked glycosylation of the hamster and human ISBTs synthesized in transfected COS cells was examined by endoglycosidase Hf and peptide:N-glycosidase F-digestion of immunoprecipitated cell extracts. After removal of N-linked glycosylation with endoglycosidase Hf or peptide:N-glycosidase F, the hamster and human ISBTs comigrated with an identical apparent molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa (Fig. 2; lanes 3, 5, 8, and 10). The migration of the deglycosylated and glycosylated forms of ISBT are indicated by the arrows in Fig. 2. This change in apparent molecular weight is consistent with the addition of two N-linked carbohydrate chains to the hamster ISBT and one N-linked chain to the human. In addition to the 35 and 40/43 kDa bands, a 29 kDa band was also observed in cell extracts from hamster or human ISBT-transfected COS cells. The origin of this product is unclear. The 29-kDa protein is not present in mock-transfected cells (see Fig. 5) and may be generated by proteolysis of the ISBT protein.Figure 5:Immunoblotting of ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter cDNA construct-transfected COS cells. COS cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid as described in the legend to Fig. 4. 72 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in buffer A and processed for SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels and immunoblotting. Approximately 15 μg of cell protein was electrophoresed except for HISBT(m) and HAH where 6 μg was analyzed (lanes 3, 8, and 10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The pulse labeling studies indicated that the lack of taurocholate uptake activity in the HISBT(m)-transfected cells was not due to a defect in HISBT protein synthesis. Other possible explainations for the absence of activity include a block in HISBT protein trafficking to the plasma membrane or a defect in the transport mechanism itself. To identify the location of the apparent defect in the HISBT(m) clone, chimeras between the hamster ISBT and HISBT(m) cDNAs were constructed by taking advantage of several conserved restriction enzyme sites (Fig. 3). The first set of chimeras utilized the HincII site at codon 153 that divided the ISBT cDNA roughly in half. After transfection into COS cells, the chimera encoding hamster ISBT amino acids 154-348 (pHA) exhibited [3H]taurocholate uptake activity similar to the wild-type hamster ISBT, while the chimera encoding human ISBT amino acids 154-348 (pAH) expressed approximately 20-fold less activity (Fig. 4A). This analysis indicated that the defect in HISBT(m) was located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. To further localize the defect between amino acids 154 and 348, a second set of chimeras, pHHA and pHAH, were generated using the conserved BanI site at codon 254 (Fig. 3). The [3H]taurocholate uptake activity in the hamster ISBT and pHHA-transfected COS cells were similar, whereas the taurocholate uptake activity of the pHAH-transfected cells was significantly reduced (Fig. 4B). These results localized the HISBT(m) defect to the region between amino acids 255 and 348. While the pulse-labeling study in Fig. 2 indicated that similar amounts of the hamster ISBT and HISBT(m) protein were synthesized, that study did not provide a measure of the steady-state protein mass. To determine if differences in ISBT protein levels accounted for the reduced taurocholate uptake activity, immunoblotting was performed with the COS cell extracts from Fig. 4. In agreement with the pulse-labeling studies in Fig. 2, immunoblotting analysis of transfected COS cell extracts detected proteins of 43 and 40 kDa for the hamster (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 7) and human ISBT proteins (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 8), respectively. In contrast to the dramatic differences in taurocholate uptake activity (Fig. 4), similar amounts of ISBT protein were detected in the hamster and HISBT(m)-transfected COS cells (Fig. 5). Additional higher molecular weight bands were also detected in the hamster and human ISBT-transfected cells but not in the mock-transfected (β-gal) cells. These bands may represent the apparent aggregation products described previously for the rat ISBT(6Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.-M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was also performed on cell extracts from the ISBT chimera construct-transfected COS cells in Fig. 4. By immunoblotting, similar amounts of ISBT protein were detected in the pHA and pAH-transfected cells and the pHHA and pHAH-transfected cells. In addition, the different apparent molecular weights of the various chimeric ISBT proteins agreed with the predicted human or hamster glycosylation pattern (Fig. 5). These studies indicate that the lack of taurocholate activity in the HISBT(m) and ISBT chimera-transfected COS cells was not due to decreased ISBT protein accumulation. In the region between amino acids 255 and 348, the hamster ISBT and HISBT(m) differ at 23 positions. Examination of the sequence revealed that many of the changes were conservative and present in the putative cytoplasmic tail region. To determine which of these changes may be responsible for the lack of activity, a genomic clone (λHG8) was isolated that encoded the 3′ end of the HISBT gene. Amino acids 255-348 are encoded by two exons interrupted by a 2.8-kilobase intron at codon 307. Comparison of the genomic sequence of these exons to the HISBT(m) cDNA sequence revealed only a single C to T transition at nucleotide position 985 in the cDNA clone (Fig. 6). This transition resulted in a single amino acid change; the genomic λHG8 encoded a proline at codon 290 (CCG), whereas the HISBT(m) cDNA clone encoded a serine (TCG). Proline 290 lies near the extracellular face of the transporter in the seventh predicted transmembrane domain (Fig. 7). To determine if this point mutation represented a random cloning artifact, the remaining six HISBT cDNA clones were analyzed. Four of the clones encompassed this region and were sequenced. Three of the clones (λH13, λH17, and λH22) encoded proline, and one clone (λH19) encoded serine at codon 290 (data not shown).Figure 7:Proposed membrane topology of the human ileal Na+/bile acid and location of proline to serine substitution. The topology was predicted using Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis over a sliding window of 11 amino acids(34Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar). The orientation of the first transmembrane domain was assigned by analysis of the flanking positively charged amino acids as described by von Heijne(35Sipos L. Von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Transmembrane domains appear as boxes; glycosylation at Asn-10 is indicated by the branched symbol. The proline to serine substitution at position 290 (shaded box) is predicted to lie near the extracellular face of the transporter in the seventh transmembrane domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The identification of multiple independent cDNA clones encoding serine at codon 290 suggested that the library was derived from a patient who is heterozygous at this nucleotide position. To address this question, genomic DNA was isolated from ileal tissue and white blood cells obtained from the patient. The genomic DNA region flanking the point mutation was amplified by PCR and subcloned. 13 independent clones were sequenced; five clones encoded serine, and eight clones encoded proline at position 290. A similar analysis of lymphocyte genomic DNA from the proband's parents indicated that the mother was also heterozygous at this nucleotide position. To directly assay for the presence of the mutation in the proband's family, SSCP was used. The pedigree and results from the SSCP analysis are shown in Fig. 8. Analysis o"

The DNA syntheses of CTG triplets ranging from 17 to 180 and CGG repeats from 9 to 160 repeats in length were studied in vitro. Primer extensions using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, the modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase), or the human DNA polymerase β paused strongly at specific loci in the CTG repeats. The pausings were abolished by heating at 70°C. As the length of the triplet repeats in duplex DNA, but not in single-stranded DNA, was increased, the magnitude of pausings increased. The location of the pause sites was determined by the distance between the site of primer hybridization and the beginning of the triplet repeats. CGG triplet repeats also showed similar, but not identical, patterns of pausings. These results indicate that appropriate lengths of the triplets adopt a non-B conformation(s) that blocks DNA polymerase progression; the resultant idling polymerase may catalyze slippages to give expanded sequences and hence provide the molecular basis for this non-Mendelian genetic process. These mechanisms, if present in human cells, may be related to the etiology of certain neuromuscular diseases such as myotonic dystrophy and Fragile X syndrome.

https://openalex.org/W2170618588,"The widely used phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor okadaic acid is one of the many stimuli activating transcription factor NF-κB in cultured cells. Phosphorylation of IκB-α, one of NF-κB's inhibitory subunits, is a prerequisite for IκB degradation and the subsequent liberation of transcriptionally active NF-κB. This observation suggested that the phosphorylation status of IκB is influenced by an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase. In this study, we provide evidence that the effect of okadaic acid on NF-κB activation is indirect and dependent on the production of reactive oxygen intermediates rather than the inhibition of an IκB-α phosphatase. Okadaic acid was found to be a strong inducer of cellular H2O2 and superoxide production in two distinct cell lines. The structurally unrelated phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A also induced oxidative stress. The delayed onset of reactive oxygen production in response to okadaic acid correlated with the delayed activation of NF-κB. Moreover, NF-κB induction was optimal at the same okadaic acid concentration that caused optimal H2O2 production. Both reactive oxygen intermediates production and NF-κB activation were inhibited by the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and 8-(diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethyoxybenzoate, a Ca2+ chelator. Future experiments using phosphatase inhibitors in intact cells must consider that the compounds can act as strong inducers of oxidative stress, which provides one explanation for their tumor-promoting activity."
https://openalex.org/W1975499205,"Current studies indicate that ceramide is involved in the regulation of important cell functions, namely cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. In the present study, the possible role of ceramide in the differentiation of neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells was investigated. The following results were obtained. (a) Ceramide content of Neuro2a cells, induced to differentiate by retinoic acid (RA) treatment rapidly increased after addition of RA, was maintained at high levels in RA-differentiated cells and returned to the starting levels with removal of RA and reversal of differentiation; under the same conditions, the sphingosine content remained unchanged. (b) After a short pulse with [3H]sphingomyelin or [3H]sphingosine or L-[3H]serine, the metabolic formation of ceramide was markedly higher and more rapid in RA-differentiated than undifferentiated cells. (c) Inhibitors of ceramide biosynthesis (Fumonisin B1, β-chloroalanine and L-cycloserine) diminished the extent of the differentiating effect of RA and concomitantly Cer content decreased. (d) The activity of neutral sphingomyelinase increased after addition of RA, maintained high levels in RA-differentiated cells, and returned to the initial levels with removal of RA. (e) Experimental conditions that cause an elevation of ceramide content (treatment with sphingosine or ceramide or C2-ceramide or bacterial sphingomyelinase) inhibited cell proliferation and stimulated neurite outgrowth; dihydro-analogues of sphingosine, ceramide, and C2-ceramide had no effect on differentiation. (f) treatment with Fumonisin B1 completely inhibited sphingosine-induced differentiation. These data suggest a specific bioregulatory function of ceramide in the control of Neuro2a cell growth and differentiation and pose the general hypothesis of a mediator role of ceramide in the differentiation of cells of neural origin.

Increasing evidence indicates important roles for molecules of sphingoid nature in the modulation of cell response to different extracellular signals. These molecules include sphingosine, ceramide, and some derivatives of them, N-methylated forms of sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and ceramide-1-phosphate(2Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 27-41PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Ceramide (N-acyl-erythro-sphingosine) has been shown to possess bioeffector properties and to act as a key molecule in a new signal transduction pathway, the sphingomyelin pathway or cycle(4Kolesnick R. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 232-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5Hannun Y.A. Linardic C.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Neuropath. 1994; 21: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In fact, in several cell lines, especially of the immune system, the activation of certain growth factor receptors by vitamin D3 and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β, and g-interferon) induces sphingomyelin hydrolysis by activation of sphingomyelinase, resulting in the elevation of the intracellular levels of ceramide. This, in turn, acts as mediator of the elicited physiological effects, presumably by controlling the activity of specific protein kinases and protein phosphatases. In particular, ceramide has emerged as a candidate for regulatory roles in biological processes that are intimately connected to each other, including cell proliferation, oncogenesis, differentiation, and apoptosis (reviewed in (4Kolesnick R.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18713-18716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). A process that is based on the regulation of proliferation/differentiation and differentiation/apoptosis is neural development. Several cell systems (neurons, glial cells, neurotumoral cells) that undergo morphological and functional differentiation in culture are available to study this process in vitro. Some studies suggest that sphingolipids and sphingoid molecules may be involved in the regulation of neural development. In fact, exogenously added glycosphingolipids are capable to affect differentiation of neurons in primary culture and to induce differentiation of neuroblastoma cells in vitro (for a review, see (11Tettamanti G. Riboni L. Prog. Brain Res. 1994; 101: 77-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)). Moreover, in cultured hippocampal neurons, sphingolipid biosynthesis is necessary for axonal outgrowth(12Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis and degradation causes opposite effects on axonal branching(13Schwarz A. Rapaport E. Hirschberg K. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10990-10998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, induced expression of GD3 and/or b-series gangliosides is followed by differentiation of Neuro2a cells(14Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Nishi T. Hanai N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30451-30456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, in T9 glioma cells, addition of a cell-permeable ceramide analog (C2-ceramide) causes growth inhibition and formation of processes, in analogy with nerve growth factor, which produced the same effects with a concomitant increase of the cellular level of ceramide(15Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). On these premises, we decided to carry out a systematic investigation on the involvement of ceramide as a bioregulator in neural differentiation and the associated processes of proliferation and apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the role played by ceramide in the differentiation of neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells. Initially, we determined the ceramide concentration and the metabolic routes leading to ceramide in Neuro2a cells induced to differentiate by treatment with retinoic acid, under strictly standardized conditions. Then, the ceramide levels of Neuro2a cells were increased by different treatments, and the effects on differentiation were observed. The data obtained strongly suggest that ceramide is involved in the regulation of Neuro2a cell differentiation. All reagents were of analytical grade, and solvents were redistilled before use.

Sphingomyelin, radiolabeled at C-3 of the long chain base ([Sph-3H]SM), and D-erythrosphingosine, tritiated at C-3 ([3H]Sph) were prepared and purified as described previously(16Iwamori M. Moser H.W.

Gangliosides are named according to Svennerholm(1Svennerholm L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1980; 125: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The murine neuroblastoma cell line, clone NB2a (Neuro2a, CCL-131, American Cell Type Culture Collection), was used. Cells were cultured in Falcon dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 4 mML-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml potassium penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in 5% CO2, 95% air-humidified atmosphere. To induce neurite outgrowth, cells were plated at a 1.8 × 104/cm2 cell density, and 48 h after plating the medium was replaced with 2% FCS-DMEM containing 20 μM retinoic acid(22Shea T.B. Fischer I. Sapirtein U.S. Dev. Brain Res. 1985; 21: 307-314Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the incubation being continued for different times up to 48 h. Control experiment showed that incubation up to 48 h with 2% FCS-DMEM, in the absence of retinoic acid, caused only a very modest outgrowth of processes. The ability of Neuro2a cells to metabolically process SM or Sph or serine added to the culture medium was assessed on control and RA-differentiated cells (after 24 h of treatment). At the time of experiments, cells were fed with 4 μM [Sph-3H]SM (1.4 μCi/ml in DMEM) or 40 nM [3H]Sph (44 nCi/ml in 2% FCS-DMEM) or 200 nML-[3H]serine (6 Ci/ml in a serine-free medium) for different times, as previously reported(18Riboni L. Prinetti A. Bassi R. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were submitted, after pulse, to a 2-4-h period of chase in 10% FCS-DMEM devoid of 3H molecules. At the end of the pulse or pulse-chase period, cells were consecutively washed with 10% FCS-DMEM (twice) and phosphate-buffered saline (twice), harvested by scraping, and lyophilized(20Riboni L. Bassi R. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The influence of endocytosis and lysosomal activity on the metabolic processing was assessed by performing experiments at 4°C (condition that blocks endocytosis) or in the presence of 50 μM chloroquine (drug which blocks the activity of lysosomal enzymes), as previously reported(19Riboni L. Tettamanti G. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Volatile radioactivity, 3H2O, released in the culture medium, was determined by fractional distillation of the culture medium under carefully controlled conditions, collection of the distilled fractions, and measurement of the radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting(23Riboni L. Prinetti A. Pitto M. Tettamanti G. Neurochem. Res. 1990; 15: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Total lipids were extracted from lyophilized cells(20Riboni L. Bassi R. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and, after partitioning, the organic phase was subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis(24Ledeen R.W. Yu R.K. Eng L.F. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The obtained aqueous and organic phases were counted for radioactivity and analyzed by HPTLC. The following solvent systems (by volume) were used: for the organic phase (Cer, neutral glycosphingolipids, Sph, and SM) chloroform/methanol/water (55:20:3) or chloroform/methanol/32% NH4OH (40:10:1) or hexane/chloroform/acetone/acetic acid (10:35:10:1); for the aqueous phase (gangliosides) chloroform/methanol/0,2% CaCl2 (55:45:10). After HPTLC, the plates were radioscanned with a digital autoradiograph (Berthold, Germany) and then submitted to fluorography(19Riboni L. Tettamanti G. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Riboni L. Bassi R. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The identification and quantification of [3H]Cer and other 3H metabolites was performed as described previously(19Riboni L. Tettamanti G. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Riboni L. Bassi R. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 5 × 104-105 cells were plated in 35-mm Falcon dishes and grown in 10% FCS-DMEM for 24 h before the experiments. At the time of experiments, dishes were washed three times with 2% FCS-DMEM and incubated for different times (up to 24 h) in the same medium (1 ml/dish) containing D-erythro-Sph (0.1-10 μM) or C2-Cer (1-10 μM), or natural Cer (0.5-10 μM) or bacterial SM-ase (100 milliunits/ml). C2-Cer (which is a cell-permeable analog of Cer) and Sph solutions were prepared by adding small volumes of stock solutions in absolute ethanol to 2% FCS-DMEM (the final concentration of ethanol never exceeded 0.1%). The solutions were allowed to stand at 37°C for 1 h before treatment of the cells. Natural Cer was dissolved in ethanol/dodecane, 98:2 (v/v) according to Ji et al.(25Ji L. Zhang G. Uematsu S. Akahori Y. Hirabayashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and added to the medium to reach the final wanted concentration. Under these conditions, Cer is able to penetrate into cells. The final concentration of ethanol and dodecane never exceeded 0.5 and 0.01%, respectively. Neither ethanol nor dodecane at the used concentrations caused visible changes of cell morphology. Bacterial SM-ase was added to the culture medium just before use. In parallel experiments, 1 μMDL-threosphinganine or dihydro-Cer or C2-dihydro-Cer, dissolved as D-erythro-Sph, Cer, or C2-Cer, was used. The involvement of serine-palmitoyl transferase in RA-induced differentiation in vivo was assessed by adding 2.5 mM β-chloroalanine or L-cycloserine, known inhibitors of this enzyme(26Sundaram K.S. Lev M. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27Medlock K.A. Merrill Jr., A.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7079-7084Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), 2 h prior and during RA treatment. The involvement of Cer synthase in the same process was ascertained running experiments in the presence of Fumonisin B1(12Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the known inhibitor of this enzyme. The degree of morphological differentiation was assessed by phase-contrast microscopy. In particular, 200-300 cells in 4-5 random fields in each dish were counted, and cells bearing neurite-like processes longer than the major cell body diameter (after treatments not exceeding 8 h), or bearing a neurite with a length at least double that of cell diameter (after treatment longer than 8 h), were scored as differentiated. Data were expressed as neurite-bearing cells (short or long neurites) as percentage of total cells counted. Cell aggregates were not scored, and cells with more than one neurite were only counted once. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion method. 5 × 104-105cells were grown in 35-mm Falcon dishes in 10% FCS-DMEM. 24 h after plating cells were cultured in 2% FCS-DMEM containing different sphingoids or bacterial SM-ase (as described above) for 24 h. The medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of DMEM containing 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine(29Coligan J.E. Kruisbeck A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W.(eds.) Current Protocols in Immunology. 1. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 152-160Google Scholar). After 2 h at 37°C, cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The insoluble residue, filtered on microfiber glass filters GF/C (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK), was submitted to radioactivity counting. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting, fluorography, and radiochromatoscanning (Digital Autoradiograph, Berthold, Germany)(19Riboni L. Tettamanti G. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Riboni L. Bassi R. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The content of Cer and Sph was determined by the method of Preiss et al.(30Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Ohta et al.(31Ohta H. Yatomi Y Sweeney E.A. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), respectively. Total protein was assayed (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Mg2+-stimulated neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SM-ase) activity was assayed on the cell homogenate as previously reported(33Mooibroek M.J. Cook H.W. Clarke J.T.R. Spence M.W. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 1551-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Ganglioside content was determined (34Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar) as lipid bound sialic acid (using N-acetylneuraminic acid as the standard) on the aqueous phase (see above) desalted by Sephadex G-25 column chromatography. Neutral glycolipids and sphingomyelin were purified from the organic phase (after alkaline methanolysis) by Unisil silicic acid column chromatography(35Vance D.L. Sweeley C.C. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gangliosides and neutral glycolipids, separated by HPTLC (see above), were quantified by densitometric scanning (Camag TLC densitometer) (23Riboni L. Prinetti A. Pitto M. Tettamanti G. Neurochem. Res. 1990; 15: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) after visualization with a p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde reagent (36Partridge S.M. Biochem. J. 1948; 42: 238-248Crossref Scopus (456) Google Scholar) or a diphenylamine reagent(37Harris G. Mac William Y.C. Chem. Ind. 1954; 39: 249-250Google Scholar), respectively. SM was determined after perchloric acid digestion(38Dodge J.T. Phillips G.B. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 667-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical significance of differences was determined by the Student t test. Data regarding the total amount of sphingomyelin, gangliosides, and neutral glycosphingolipids as well as the qualitative pattern of major gangliosides and neutral glycosphingolipids in control and RA-differentiated Neuro2a cells are reported in Table 1. As shown, the content of both sphingomyelin and neutral glycosphingolipids was significantly reduced in differentiated cells as compared to the control preconfluent growing cells. Moreover, and in agreement with previous studies(40Kadowaki H. Evans J.E. Rys-Sikora E. Koff R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), significant changes in the ganglioside and neutral glycosphingolipid pattern were recorded; particularly, RA-differentiated cells had a lower content of GM3 and higher contents of GM2, GM1, GD1a, and GgOse3-Cer than undifferentiated cells.TABLE I Open table in a new tab After RA treatment in low (2%) FCS medium, Neuro2a cells underwent differentiation, which started to be appreciable after 60-120 min and resulted in a very elaborated network of processes after 24-48 h, in agreement with reported findings(22Shea T.B. Fischer I. Sapirtein U.S. Dev. Brain Res. 1985; 21: 307-314Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the content of endogenous Cer (1.02 ± 0.11 nmol/mg protein, in undifferentiated cells) increased rapidly with time in Neuro2a cells after RA addition until about 8 h (1.55 ± 0.46 nmol/mg protein). This level remained almost constant in differentiated cells (1.69 ± 0.33 and 1.74 ± 0.36 nmol/mg protein at 24 and 48 h, respectively). The increase of Cer content could be acknowledged at the first investigated time after RA treatment (30 min), indicating that the cell response to RA, in terms of Cer production, was very prompt. The removal of RA from the medium caused reversal of differentiation, as expected(22Shea T.B. Fischer I. Sapirtein U.S. Dev. Brain Res. 1985; 21: 307-314Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar), with a parallel decrease of the Cer content to the starting level. It is noteworthy that the Sph content (100 ± 12 pmol/mg protein) appeared to be unaffected by RA treatment. Concomitant treatment of Neuro2a cells with RA and 25 μM Fumonisin B1, the inhibitor of Cer synthase(12Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

It is noteworthy that upon RA plus Fumonisin B1 treatment, the Cer content remained substantially higher than that of undifferentiated cells.Figure 7:Effect of Fumonisin B1 on Neuro2a differentiation.

As shown in Fig. 2, undifferentiated and fully differentiated Neuro2a cells rapidly incorporated and metabolized [3H]Sph in a time-dependent fashion. The radioactivity present in the total lipid extract, as well as tritiated water released in the culture medium (volatile radioactivity), produced by complete Sph degradation, was a little higher in differentiated than undifferentiated cells and markedly increased with pulse time in both cell types. Conversely, [3H]Sph diminished with pulse time and represented only a minor portion of total incorporated radioactivity (radioactivity in the total lipid extract plus volatile radioactivity) at all the investigated times (about 5% at 30 min and 2% at 120 min). 3H2O was a minor product of [3H]Sph metabolism, since after 30 and 120 min of pulse it accounted only for about 8% and 12%, respectively, of the total incorporated radioactivity in both undifferentiated and RA-differentiated cells. [3H]Cer represented by far the major radiolabeled metabolite of exogenous [3H]Sph, accounting for more than half of total incorporated radioactivity in both undifferentiated and RA-differentiated cells (Fig. 3). It was produced more rapidly and at a higher extent in differentiated cells, whereas its utilization for the biosynthesis of complex sphingolipids (Glc-Cer, SM, and gangliosides) was higher in undifferentiated cells.Figure 3:Incorporation of radioactivity into different metabolites after feeding undifferentiated (control) and differentiated (RA-treated) Neuro2a cells for different times with 40 nM [3H]Sph.

At all investigated times [3H]Cer represented the major 3H-sphingolipid (from 52 to 87% of total sphingolipids) and was produced in significantly higher amounts by differentiated than undifferentiated cells. On the basis of these results, the effect of inhibitors of serine-palmitoyl transferase (a key enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis) on RA-induced differentiation was investigated. As shown in Table 3, treatment of Neuro2a cells with 2.5 mM β-chloroalanine or L-cycloserine resulted in a time-dependent, substantial, although not complete, inhibition of RA-induced differentiation.TABLE II Open table in a new tab TABLE III Open table in a new tab The feeding experiments with [Sph-3H]SM provided similar results (Fig. 4). After 2 h of feeding with 4 μM [Sph-3H]SM, followed or not by 4 h chase, [3H]Cer represented the major radiolabeled metabolite in both undifferentiated and RA-differentiated cells, but its metabolic formation was significantly higher in the differentiated ones (2.4-fold and 1.8-fold at 0 and 4 h chase, respectively) (Fig. 4).

Two sets of overlapping cDNAs have been characterized that differ in their 3′-terminal regions. Northern analyses with probes derived from unique regions of each set were found to hybridize with two brain-specific transcripts of 3.3 and 3.6 kilobases (kb). The 3.6-kb transcript encodes a polypeptide that exhibits 82% sequence identity with bovine brevican and is thought to be the rat ortholog of brevican. Interestingly, the polypeptide deduced from the open reading frame of the 3.3-kb transcript is truncated just carboxyl-terminal of the central domain of brevican and instead contains a putative glypiation signal. Antibodies raised against a bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase-brevican fusion protein have been used to show that both soluble and membrane-bound brevican isoforms exist. Treatment of the crude membrane fraction and purified synaptic plasma membranes with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C revealed that isoforms of brevican are indeed glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored to the plasma membrane. Moreover, digestions with chondroitinase ABC have indicated that rat brevican, like its bovine ortholog, is a conditional chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan.

In this study we set out to map the K protein domains that bind kinases.

We demonstrate that the K protein domain that recruits and is phosphorylated in an RNA-dependent manner by the IL-1-responsive kinase, designated KPK for K protein kinase, is contained within the 338-425-amino acid stretch and thus is contiguous but does not include the cluster of the SH3-binding sites.

K protein is endowed with diverse biochemical properties, and, as a result, the K protein is a highly interactive molecule. K protein was first discovered as a component of hnRNP, where it exists bound to RNA(1Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell.

There are several isoforms of K protein that represent alternatively spliced products of a gene that in humans has been mapped to chromosome 9(3Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Rasmussen H.H. Madsen P. Kruse T.A. Gesser B. Nilesen H. Celis J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). K protein binds preferentially to poly(C) compared to other ribonucleic acid homopolymers(1Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell.

As a component of the hnRNP, K protein may participate in processing and transport of pre-mRNA(4Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). The hnRNP contains at least 20 major proteins that have different RNA binding specificities. It is already clear that the differences between K protein and the other hnRNP proteins go far beyond differences in RNA binding properties. K protein also binds single- and double-stranded DNA in a sequence-selective manner and can activate gene promoters that contain cognate DNA motifs(5Takimoto M. Tomonaga T. Matunis M. Avigan M.

The functional diversity of the K protein appears to be even greater than that described for TFIIIA. The K protein was recently discovered to bind the SH3 domains of the protein-tyrosine kinases, Src, Fyn, and Lyn(10Weng Z. Thomas S.M. Rickles R.J. Taylor J.A. Brauer A.W. Seidel-Dugan C.

Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Although these observations suggested that K protein can potentially engage these protein-tyrosine kinases, it is not itself tyrosine-phosphorylated(10Weng Z. Thomas S.M. Rickles R.J. Taylor J.A.

Nonetheless, the potential interaction with these tyrosine kinases suggests that the K protein is involved not only in the regulation of gene expression but also in signal transduction. A link to the signal transduction cascade is further illustrated by recent reports that K protein interacts in vivo and in vitro with the proto-oncogene product, Vav (13Bustelo X.R. Suen K.-I.

The interaction of K protein with Vav is mediated via SH3 domains, another typical feature of signal transduction processes (10Weng Z. Thomas S.M. Rickles R.J. Taylor J.A. Brauer A.W. Seidel-Dugan C.

At least, in part, this phosphorylation is mediated by an associated kinase which can respond to treatment of cells with IL-1 and other agents(12Ostrowski J. Sims J.E. Sibley C.H.

Cells were grown at 37°C in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum or Fetal Clone, 2 mM glutamine, 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.01%), and humidified with 7-93% C02/air gas mixture. The bacterial expression vector pGEX-KT was provided by Dr. J. Dixon (University of Michigan). Glutathione agarose beads, reduced glutathione, and protein kinase A catalytic subunit were obtained from Sigma. GST-Src SH3 and GST-Csk SH3 fusion protein constructs were provided by Dr. Steve Taylor (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), and GST-p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase SH3, GST-Ras GAP SH3, GST-Grb2 COOH- and NH2-terminal SH3, GST-Abl SH3, fusion protein constructs were provided by Dr. Jonathan Graves (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Recombinant human kinase c-Src and anti-c-Src (pp60Src) mouse monoclonal antibody were purchased from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Vav (C14) rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-GST antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The full-length K protein cDNA was used as a template to generate polymerase chain reaction products containing the full-length open reading frame (1392 base pairs). The sense primer contained the first 24 bases of the 5′ end of the deleted open reading frame plus BamHI site was added. The antisense primer contained the last 20 bases of the antisense strand of the 3′-deleted open reading frame plus EcoRI site was added. The same strategy was used to generate all the GST-K deletion mutants described in the paper. Polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into TA vector as per the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Plasmids were prepared from white colonies using Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), and the inserts were released after a BamHI/EcoRI digestion. Gel-purified fragments were then ligated into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-KT (21Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) which had been cut with BamHI and EcoRI, gel-purified, and dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (U. S. Biochemicals). GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) using a modified manufacturer's protocol. Transformed cells were grown until they reached A600 = 0.6 and then were treated for 3 h with 1.0 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside. Following freezing and thawing, pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated. Fusion proteins were recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min (4°C). GST-K and GST-K deletion mutants were then purified on a glutathione column as described previously. Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modified method of Dignam et al.(22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9159) Google Scholar) as described previously(12Ostrowski J. Sims J.E. Sibley C.H. Valentine M.A. Dower S.K. Meier K.E.

In addition to dithiothreitol (0.5 mM), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mM), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml), lysis, extraction, and dilution buffers contained the following phosphatase inhibitors (all from Sigma): 30 mMp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mM NaF, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 0.1 mM Na2MoO4, and 10 mM β-glycerophosphate. Protein content was measured using the BCA method (Pierce). 4 to 8 mg of each K peptide (P1, MPPGRGGRPMPPSRRGCG; P2, MSPRRGPPPPPPGRGCG; P3, GSRARNLPLPPPPPPRGGCG; P4, CMETEQPEETFPN; P5, CQSKNAGAVIGK) dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 5 mM EDTA was used for coupling to SulfoLink Gel (Pierce) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Peptides all contained free sulfhydryl groups in their end to allow coupling (italics). 50 μl of beads were used for binding experiments. Prior to the incubation with the fraction of interest, beads were saturated overnight at 4°C with 125 mg of BSA in 500 μl of 1 × binding buffer. The excess of BSA was washed 6 times with 1 ml of 1 × binding buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40), then 2 μg of GST-Src SH3 or GST-Csk SH3 fusion proteins were added and incubated for 30 min at 4°C. Beads were then spun down, and the supernatant was saved and precipitated overnight at -70°C with 1 ml of cold acetone. Beads were washed 4 times with 1 ml of 1 × binding buffer containing 0.2% deoxycholate and 0.1% Triton X-100. 30 μl of SDS loading buffer was added, beads were boiled, and released proteins were loaded onto a 13% SDS gel. After transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, proteins were immunostained as described below. GST-K deletion mutants or purified natural K protein were run on a 13% SDS gel, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunostained as follows. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4°C in renaturation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in TTBS (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), 2.5% BSA (w/v)). The membrane was then rinsed three times for 5 min with TTBS and incubated in TTBS, 1% BSA containing a 2 mg/ml concentration of a GST SH3 domain fusion protein for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was rinsed three times for 5 min with TBST (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). The first antibody (either monoclonal anti-Src SH3 domain (10Weng Z. Thomas S.M.

The membrane was then washed three times for 5 min at room temperature with TBST and incubated for 30 min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGs (Promega). The staining was developed by incubating the membrane in 17.5 ml of substrate buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 0.05 M NaCl, 0.05 M MgCl2) containing 77 μl of nitro blue tetrazolium and 58 μl of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Life Technologies, Inc.). The GST SH3 domains used were: GST-Src SH3, GST-Csk SH3, GST-Abl SH3, GST-Grb2 Nt SH3, GST-Grb2 Ct SH3, GST-Ras GAP SH3, and GST-p85 PI3K SH3. To obtain GST-Src SH3 protein labeled with 32P, Src SH3 fragment was cloned into pGEX-2TK vector (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) (23Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F.

After transformation of BL21(DE3)pLysS cells with this plasmid, GST-Src SH3 protein was expressed as described above. After binding to glutathione beads, labeling was done directly on the beads using [γ-32P]ATP and protein kinase A as per manufacturer's protocol (Pharmacia). 32P-Labeled GST-Src SH3 protein was eluted from the beads with 5 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. KPK was co-purified with K protein by tandem IgG-affinity column using a previously described approach(24Ostrowski J. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1045-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts were chromatographed on a DEAE-Sephacel column, and, after a wash with 1 × binding buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, proteins were eluted with 30 ml of elution buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mM EGTA, and 2 mM EDTA) containing 200 mM NaCl. The DEAE-Sephacel eluate was diluted with 40 ml of 1 × binding buffer and further purified on the tandem IgG-affinity column(24Ostrowski J. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1045-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The top two modules contained Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) beads bearing preimmune No. 54 IgG, and the bottom module contained Affi-Gel 10 beads bearing anti-K protein No. 54 IgG. After washing the modules with 1 × binding buffer containing 175 mM NaCl, the K protein was eluted from the bottom module with elution buffer containing 400 mM NaCl. All phosphorylation reactions were carried out directly on beads as described previously(6Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Seger R. Rauch C.T. Sleath P.R. McMullen B.A. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol.

Briefly, after loading with the kinase, beads were washed once with 1 ml of 1 × binding buffer containing 175 mM NaCl plus the full complement of phosphatase inhibitors (30 mMp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mM NaF, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 0.1 mM Na2MoO4, and 10 mM β-glycerophosphate), once with 1 ml of 1 × binding buffer without phosphatase inhibitors, and finally once with 1 ml of 1 × kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol). After resuspending the beads in 270 μl of binding buffer, 30 μl of 10 × kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added with or without 1 mg/ml poly(C) RNA, and the phosphorylation reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by washing the beads twice with 800 μl of binding buffer. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 100 μl of 1 × SDS loading buffer (60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol)(25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar), loaded on a 10% SDS gel, and autoradiographed.

Gu Q. Gadowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we set out to identify the K protein SH3-binding site(s) and determine whether or not KPK binds to K protein via SH3 interactions. The purified full-length GST-K fusion protein and a number of GST-K protein deletion mutants were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane. Blotted proteins were either immunostained with anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1A) or were analyzed for their binding to the c-Src SH3 domain by Far Western blot analysis using 32P-labeled GST-Src SH3 fusion protein as a probe (Fig. 1B). The c-Src SH3 domain bound to the deletion mutants GST-K13 (aa 1-337, lane 1), GST-K5 (aa 171-464, lane 5), GST-K3 (aa 171-337, lane 6), GST-K2 (aa 82-337, lane 7), and the full-length GST-K protein (lane 9), while it did not bind the deletion mutants GST-K10 (aa 337-382, lane 2), GST-K7 (aa 318-464, lane 3), GST-K6 (aa 84-209, lane 4), and GST-K1 (aa 425-464, lane 8). The GST-K deletion mutants that bound the c-Src SH3 domain contain a common sequence encompassing the 209-318 amino acid residues (see bottom panel, Fig. 1). Thus, this K protein fragment represents the c-Src SH3-binding domain (SH3-BD). Although the intensities of the major immunostained bands for each of the GST-K deletion mutants were approximately the same (Fig. 1A), the levels of the 32P signals were quite different (Fig. 1B). For example, the 32P signal of the bands that correspond to the GST-K3 (aa 171-337, lane 6) and GST-K2 (aa 82-337, lane 7) deletion mutants is stronger than the 32P intensity seen with the longer GST-K13 (aa 1-337, lane 1) mutant. This observation suggests that the affinity of the shorter mutants which recognize the c-Src SH3 domain is higher. This might explain the equal signal seen with the full-length GST-K protein (90 kDa) and the less abundant fragment of 60 kDa co-expressed in that preparation (Fig. 1, compare lanes 9 in A and B). The reason for the apparently lower SH3 binding affinities of the longer GST-K protein fragments may reflect a higher degree of masking of the SH3-BD when this domain is present in the context of a larger protein. Next we tested K protein specificity as a ligand for SH3 domains from different proteins involved in signal transduction. Far Western blot analysis from this experiment is illustrated in Fig. 2. Immunoblotting with the anti-K antibody No. 54 shows the position of the K protein (lane 1). As before (Fig. 1), the GST-Src SH3 domain bound to K protein when directly used as a probe (lanes 8). In contrast, SH3 domains from the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-associated p85 subunit (26Skolnik E.Y. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Lowenstein E. Fischer R. Drepps A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) did not bind to the K protein. These results show that the ability of K protein to bind SH3 domains is selective for the c-Src SH3 domain. Inspection of the murine and the human K protein 209-318-amino acid stretch (2Matunis M.J.

Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 30Williamson M.P. Biochem.

Affinity beads bearing synthetic peptides, each representing one of the three K protein proline-rich residues were used to determine which, if any, of these sites bind directly and specifically the c-Src SH3 domain. To do that, these peptide beads were mixed with buffer containing either GST-Src- or GST-Csk SH3 fusion proteins. After centrifugation, proteins on the beads and in the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-GST antibody (Fig. 3). As expected from above experiments (Fig. 2), the GST-Csk SH3 fusion protein did not bind to beads bearing P1 (aa 264-278), P2 (aa 283-297), or P3 (aa 301-318) synthetic peptides (Fig. 3A, lanes 7-9), and, as a consequence, all of GST-Csk SH3 protein was recovered in the supernatants (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-3). In contrast, the GST-Src SH3 fusion protein bound in a very efficient manner to the P1, P2, and P3 beads (Fig. 3A, lanes 10-12), while only trace amounts remained in the supernatant of P1 and P2 (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). The specificity of the binding was assessed by using beads bearing P4 (aa 1-12) and P5 (aa 50-60) peptide which represent sequences outside of the SH3-BD (see bottom panel). As illustrated in B, there was no binding of GST-Src SH3 to P4 (lane 6) or P5 (lane 5) compared to P3 peptide (lane 4). Once again, the GST-Csk SH3 domain did not bind to any of these peptides (lanes 1-3). These res"

In a discoidal particle containing two molecules of apoA-I and 85 molecules of POPC, apoA-I exhibits an α-helix content of 70% and a free energy of stability of its α-helical segments (ΔGD0) of 2.2 kcal/mol. Inclusion of eight molecules of TG into the complex significantly reduces the α-helix content and stability of apoA-I, whereas inclusion of four molecules of CE into the complex has an opposite effect in that the α-helix content is significantly reduced and the stability of the remaining α-helical structure of apoA-I is increased. Neutral lipids have a different effect on apoA-I conformation in spherical LpA-I particles. In a sonicated-spherical LpA-I particle containing two molecules of apoA-I and 70 molecules of POPC, apoA-I exhibits an α-helix content of about 60% and a ΔGD0of 1.2 kcal/mol apoA-I. Inclusion of either 10 molecules of TG or six molecules of CE into such a particle increases both the α-helix content and stability of apoA-I. Increasing the CE/TG ratio in LpA-I particles that contain both neutral lipids enhances the stability of the α-helical segments. ApoA-I molecules tend to dissociate and cause particle instability when ΔGD0for the lipid-bound α-helices is less than that for helices in the lipid-free state.

Interestingly, activation of this kinase seems to be correlated to the phosphorylation of a threonine residue in a MAP kinase recognition consensus sequence PXTP located carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic domain of the enzyme(14Stokoe D.

This would indicate a process of activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 different from other protein kinases, which are activated by phosphorylation within the catalytic domain in the vicinity of the putative substrate binding site (reviewed in (15Marshall C.J.

In this article we use a recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-MAPKAP kinase 2-fusion protein and various mutants to study the mechanism of activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 by p44MAPK (ERK1) and p38/40MAPK (RK) in vitro. Furthermore, we analyze the stress-dependent activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 in vivo by transfection experiments with an epitope-tagged enzyme and appropriate mutants in NIH 3T3 cells. We provide evidence that, in addition to the phosphorylation at Thr-317 outside the catalytic domain, activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 by ERK1 proceeds through phosphorylation of a second threonine residue Thr-205 inside the catalytic domain in vitro. Furthermore, the data presented indicate that there is no further regulatory residue in MAPKAP kinase 2 phosphorylated in vitro by p38/40 or in vivo as a result of heat shock. Different constitutively active mutants of MAPKAP kinase 2 are obtained by replacement of the threonine residues at the phosphorylation sites by glutamic acid, which mimics a negative phosphate charge. In addition, constitutive activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 is reached by mutations of the A-helix motif carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic domain. A model for the mechanism of dual regulation of MAPKAP kinase 2 activity by phosphorylation of Thr-205 inside the catalytic domain and by phosphorylation of Thr-317 outside the catalytic domain involving the A-helix motif is proposed. Phosphorylation site and deletion mutants of MAPKAP kinase 2 were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the GST-MAPKAP kinase 2 Δ3B expression vector pGEX-5X-3-MK2-Δ3B (16Plath K. Engel K. Schwedersky G. Gaestel M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1188-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as double-stranded template and the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech). Mutations were verified by double-stranded plasmid DNA sequencing using Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant GST-MAPKAP kinase 2-ΔPC (Δ amino acids 315-383) was derived from pGEX-5X-3-MK2-Δ3B by digestion with PpuMI and XhoI, subsequent filling to blunt ends by Klenow polymerase, and ligation. Apart from the deletion, this results in addition of the sequence SSGRIVTD to the carboxyl terminus. The E. coli expression vector pGEX-5X-3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used to express the enzyme MAPKAP kinase 2 and its mutants as a GST-fusion protein in Escherichia coli SURE (Stratagene) cultivated in LB medium containing 16 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl. Expression was induced at an optical density A600 = 1 by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. After an additional 90 min, cells were harvested and lysed, and GST-fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) as described by the manufacturers. The concentration of purified fusion proteins was measured according to (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). 1.5 × 108 Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells were treated with anisomycin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml for 20 min. Cells were washed 3 times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer L (20 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.27 M sucrose, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a 20-min incubation on ice, the lysate was prepared as the supernatant of a 13,000 rpm centrifugation, diluted with 10 ml of Mono Q-buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.3 mM Na3VO4, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) Brij 35, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a Mono Q column (Pharmacia, column dimensions 5 × 0.5 cm). The column was developed with a linear gradient from 0 to 700 mM NaCl (40 ml), and 1-ml fractions were collected. 10-μl aliquots of the fractions were incubated with 1 μM recombinant GST-MAPKAP kinase 2 Δ3B in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM ATP, 0.1 μM okadaic acid, and 125 μM sodium orthovanadate for 30 min at 30°C. 10 μl of this reaction mixture were subsequently assayed for MAPKAP kinase 2 activity as described below. For determining endogenous MAPKAP kinase 2 activity, 4-μl aliquots of the fractions were assayed. Immunoblot detection of ERKs in the Mono Q fractions was performed using a mouse monoclonal pan ERK antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington) and a secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega). Western blot detection of p38/40MAPK (RK) was achieved with a sheep antiserum against a carboxyl-terminal peptide from human RK (kindly provided by P. Cohen, Dundee). Immunoprecipitation of p38/40MAPK (RK) was performed with a rabbit antiserum raised against a carboxyl-terminal peptide from Xenopus Mpk2 as described in (11Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). 1 μM concentration of the purified recombinant fusion proteins GST-MAPKAP kinase 2 and its mutants were incubated in a 25-μl kinase reaction mixture containing 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 4 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM ATP, 0.1 μM okadaic acid, 125 μM sodium orthovanadate, and 5 ng of pp44MAPK (Biomol, purified from sea star) or 10 μl of the Mono Q fractions 13 and 19 or the anti-Mpk2 immunoprecipitate for 30 min at 30°C. Control incubations omitting MAPKs to analyze the influence of autophosphorylation on the recombinant protein were always carried out. 10-μl aliquots from the MAP kinase activation mixture or 4 μl of the Mono Q fractions were incubated in a kinase reaction mixture of a final volume of 25 μl, containing 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 4 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM ATP, 1.5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, and 10 μg of recombinant Hsp25 purified from E. coli(18Gaestel M. Gross B. Benndorf R. Strauss M. Schunck W.H. Kraft R. Otto A. Böhm H. Stahl J. Drabsch H. Bielka H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After 10 min at 30°C, reactions were terminated by adding 8 μl of 4 × SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 33P-Labeled proteins were detected by the Bio Imaging Analyzer BAS 2000 (Fuji) and Hsp25 labeling was quantified by photostimulated luminescence. Assay conditions were tested to guarantee a linear dependence of kinase activity determined on the assay time chosen. The cDNA of mouse MAPKAP kinase 2 (19Engel K. Plath K. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was cloned into the KpnI/BamHI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by a polymerase chain reaction strategy introducing the Myc epitope EQKLISEEDLG at the amino terminus of the protein using the oligonucleotide primer 5′-CGG GGT ACC ATG GAA CAG AAG CTC ATC AGC GAA GAG GAC CTA GGA GGC TCT CCG GGC CAG ACT CCG. The mutations of the phosphorylation sites were performed with the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) as described above. Plasmids were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells by the LipofectAMINE Transfection Kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable transfected cell lines were established by a 2-week selection with G418 (800 μg/ml). Heat shock treatment of cells was performed for 15 min at 43.5°C. For immunoblot detection of epitope-tagged MAPKAP kinase 2, 106 cells were lysed by boiling in SDS-electrophoresis loading buffer, applied directly to SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Immunochemical detection was performed using monoclonal antibody 9E10 (European Collection of Animal Cell Culture, cell line 85102202) and an anti-mouse immunoglobulin secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega). Immunoprecipitation was carried out after 15 min of incubation of 106 cells in 80 μl of lysis buffer L. Cell lysate was diluted with 500 μl of IP buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 25 mM NaF, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated with 25 μl of purified 9E10 antibody overnight at 4°C. Precipitation was achieved by adding 25 μl of a 1:1 (v/v) suspension of Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and a further incubation for 1 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitate was washed four times with IP buffer, and the pellet was redissolved in 25 μl of MAPKAP kinase 2 reaction mixture and analyzed as described above. The structure of the catalytic core of MAPKAP kinase 2 was modeled on the basis of the coordinates of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) at 2.7 Å(20Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar), taken from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (BPDB entry 2cpk). The sequences were aligned with the bestfit routine of the GCG package (Genetics Computer Group, Program Manual for the GCG Package, Version 7, April 1991, Madison, WI) giving an identity of 30%. The amino acids of MAPKAP kinase 2 were generated by mutating, deleting, and inserting residues with the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou S.W. Cowan M.K. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) according to the alignment. The geometry of the model was improved iteratively with the energy minimization routine of X-PLOR (22Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 46-57Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and optical inspection on the graphics screen. The positions of inserted residues were altered by local molecular dynamics calculations and subsequent energy minimization. The resulting model consists of residues 40 to 300 (the ATP-binding and catalytic domain) with root mean square deviations from target values of 0.009 Å for bond lengths and 2.92° for angles. No residue is in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot according to PROCHECK(23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The superposition of 74% of the Cα atoms on the start model gave a root mean square deviation of 0.68 Å. The A-helix was modeled in standard α-helix conformation and fitted into the catalytic domain of MAPKAP kinase 2 by analogy to the position in cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The complex was then energy-minimized with backbone atoms kept fixed. We have analyzed the activation of mouse MAPKAP kinase 2 by MAP kinases using a recombinant GST-MAPKAP kinase 2 fusion protein and the p44MAPK ERK1. The cDNA of mouse MAPKAP kinase 2 (19Engel K. Plath K. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was used to express the fusion protein GST-MAPKAP kinase 2 in E. coli. The nonphosphorylated purified GST-MAPKAP kinase 2 had no significant catalytic activity as judged by its ability to phosphorylate the small heat shock protein Hsp25 which is a dominant substrate for MAPKAP kinase 2 in vitro(24Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and in vivo(25Engel K. Ahlers A. Brach M.A. Herrmann F. Gaestel M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As already shown for the native rabbit MAPKAP kinase 2 (14Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), in vitro phosphorylation of the recombinant mouse and human MAPKAP kinase 2 fusion protein by MAPK leads to activation of the enzyme(16Plath K. Engel K. Schwedersky G. Gaestel M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1188-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Zu Y.L. Wu F. Gilchrist A. Ai Y. Labadia M.E. Huang C.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), indicating that the recombinant protein shares the mechanism of activation with the native enzyme. This has also been demonstrated to be true for a deletion mutant of the GST-MAPKAP kinase 2 where the 27 amino acids of the proline-rich SH3 binding motif are missing and which is, probably due to the missing GC-rich coding region, much better expressed in E. coli(16Plath K. Engel K. Schwedersky G. Gaestel M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1188-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This recombinant fusion protein GST-MAPKAP kinase 2 Δ3B is used for the in vitro activation studies, since it has a Km value very similar to the wild type enzyme and shows at least a 10-fold activation in vitro. This corresponds to the degree of MAPKAP kinase 2 activation in vivo (see below). To discern it from the different phosphorylation site and A-helix mutants described in the additional experiments, this recombinant form of MAPKAP kinase 2 is referred to as wild type MAPKAP kinase 2 (cf. Fig. 1A). In order to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the activation of mouse MAPKAP kinase 2 by single MAPK phosphorylation carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic domain, we replaced the amino acid residue Thr-317, which is homologous to the only identified MAPK phosphorylation site of rabbit MAPKAP kinase 2(14Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), by the amino acid alanine which cannot be phosphorylated. The mutation of this phosphorylation site led to decreased phosphorylation and activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 by ERK1 but, unexpectedly, the T317A mouse MAPKAP kinase 2 mutant (cf. Fig. 1A) could still be activated by ERK1 (Fig. 1B). This indicated that there is at least a second regulatory phosphorylation site of MAPKAP kinase 2 for ERK1. To identify further putative Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites of MAPKAP kinase 2, we compared primary sequences of MAPKAP kinase 2, MAPKAP kinase 1 (p90RSK), ERK2, Cdk2, and cAPK. Fig. 1C demonstrates the conservation of threonine residues in the loop between subdomains VII and VIII of their catalytic core. These threonine residues are essential for the activation of these kinases: MAPKAP kinase 1 is known to be activated by ERK2 phosphorylation at the threonine residue which is nine residues amino-terminal to the subdomain VIII (APE)(27Sutherland C. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), MAPK ERK2 is phosphorylated by MEK1 both at the threonine and tyrosine in similar positions(28Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), and comparable regulatory phosphorylation sites are also present in Cdk2 or in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (29Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (marked by asterisks in Fig. 1C). Interestingly, in both MAPKAP kinases 1 and 2, the equivalent threonine is followed by a proline, the minimum consensus sequence for phosphorylation by MAP kinases(30Clarke-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, a potential second phosphorylation site of MAPKAP kinase 2 could be Thr-205, the phosphorylation site equivalent to Thr-470, Thr-192, Thr-161, and Thr-197 of, respectively, MAPKAP kinase 1, ERK2, Cdk2, and cAPK. To experimentally prove whether this site is phosphorylated by MAPK, we substituted Thr-205 of mouse MAPKAP kinase 2 with alanine (cf. Fig. 1A) and analyzed the phosphorylation and activation of this mutant by ERK1. As shown in Fig. 1B, the T205A mutant shows an activation by ERK1 similar to the mutant T317A. There is still activation of the mutant by ERK1, but not to the same degree as in the wild type enzyme. Only the double mutant T205A,T317A, which shows a slightly increased basal activity, could not be activated by ERK1 (cf. Fig. 1B), indicating that both phosphorylation sites contribute to the in vitro activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 by ERK1 and that these sites seem to be the major regulatory phosphorylation sites of the enzyme. To reinforce the notion that Thr-205 and Thr-317 both contribute to MAPKAP kinase 2 activation, we mutated these residues also to glutamate which can mimic the negative charge of the phosphate group. The appropriate T205E, T317E, and T205E,T317E mutants, and, as a control, the mutant T209E were expressed as GST-fusion proteins and their activity was analyzed before and after phosphorylation by ERK1 in vitro using Hsp25 as substrate (Fig. 2A). Mimicry of phosphorylation at both sites Thr-205 and Thr-317, but not at residue Thr-209, which is also located between subdomains VII and VIII and followed directly by a proline (not shown), leads to activation of MAPKAP kinase 2. The activity of the single mutants T205E and T317E is increased to about 5-fold compared to the wild type and could be stimulated further by ERK1 phosphorylation, indicating that the second, intact phosphorylation site contributes to activation. The activity of the double mutant T205E,T317E is increased to about 10-15-fold and could not significantly be further stimulated by incubation with MAPK (Fig. 2B), supporting the notion that Thr-205 and Thr-317 are the regulatory phosphorylation sites of MAPKAP kinase 2. Until now, it is not completely understood which forms of the MAPKs are responsible for MAPKAP kinase 2 activation in vivo and whether all these enzymes recognize and phosphorylate the same sites in MAPKAP kinase 2(11Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 12Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L.

Since there is growing evidence that the p38/40MAPK, also designated as MAPKAP kinase 2 reactivating kinase (RK), is the major enzyme responsible for stress-induced activation of MAPKAP kinase 2(6Derijard B.

Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), we also analyzed in vitro activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 by this enzyme. For this purpose, we stimulated Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells with the stress-signaling agonist anisomycin (31Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7352-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and found about 10-fold activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 in these cells (Fig. 3A). The MAPKAP kinase 2 activator from the lysate of anisomycin-stimulated EAT cells was partially purified by Mono Q chromatography as described in (11Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). The chromatographic fractions were assayed both for MAPKAP kinase 2 and MAPKAP kinase 2 activator. In addition to a broad peak of MAPKAP kinase 2 activity eluting in the gradient between 100 mM and 200 mM NaCl as described for MAPKAP kinase 2 from interleukin 1-stimulated KB cells(12Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), a MAPKAP kinase 2 activator elutes from the Mono Q column in a very sharp peak at 350 mM NaCl (Fraction 19 in Fig. 3B). This is exactly the same position in the gradient described for the p38/40MAPK (RK) from arsenite-stimulated PC12 cells and heat shock-stimulated HeLa cells (11Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar), indicating that this activity peak probably represents the p38/40MAPK (RK) of EAT cells. The presence of p38/40MAPK (RK) in fraction 19 was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an antiserum against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of human RK (not shown) and by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Mpk2 antiserum (11Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar) and subsequent MAPKAP kinase 2 activation assay as described above (Fig. 3C). The presence of ERK2 in the peak fraction could be excluded, since Western blot detection of ERKs using the monoclonal pan ERK antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington) clearly shows that these enzymes elute between fractions 8 and 14 (not shown). We then analyzed activation of recombinant wild type MAPKAP kinase 2, the single mutants T205A and T317A, and the double mutant T205E,T317E by the p38/40MAPK peak fraction. As seen in Fig. 3D, wild type MAPKAP kinase 2 can be stimulated by the p38/40MAPK fraction in the same manner as by ERK1. This is also the case for ERK1/p38/40MAPK stimulation of the single mutants T205A and T317A ("

This divergence is particularly greater at the C-terminal domain of Gαh, giving rise to the hypothesis that this region may play a significant role in hormone signaling. In this study, evidence for a direct interaction between the region of Gαh and PLC is demonstrated. This interaction activates PLC.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe isolated full-length hhGαh cDNA was an exact match in the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences with the human endothelial TGase II(14Genitile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande N. Birckbichler P.J. Lee K.N. Stein J.P. Davis P.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 478-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify interaction sites of hhGαh with the α1-adrenoreceptor and PLC, systematic 10-amino acid-deleted mutants of hhGαh cDNA(s) were generated from the C-terminal end (Fig. 1). The full-length hhGαh cDNA and truncated hhGαh cDNA(s) were cotransfected into COS-1 cells with α1B-adrenoreceptor cDNA. The expressed proteins were recognized by the Gh7a antibody as well as guinea pig TGase II antibody and were of the expected sizes with ~80 kDa for full-length hhGαh and a decrease in size as the length of nucleotide deletion increased (Fig. 2A). The α1B-receptor was also expressed, resulting in 2-3 pmol/mg protein of [3H]prazosin binding. The expressed hhGαh proteins exhibited both GTP binding and TGase activities (Fig. 2B and inset). The Ca2+-stimulated TGase activities of expressed hhGαh and its truncated mutants were completely inhibited with >100 μM GTP, and the inhibitory potency (IC50) of GTP was in the range of 20-50 μM for all hhGαh proteins, also confirming that GTP is a negative regulator for the TGase of Gαh(1Nakaoka H.

The(-)-epinephrine-mediated activation of PLC was increased approximately 2-fold with hhGαh and the ΔK676 mutant, whereas the ΔL656 and ΔE646 mutants lost the agonist-mediated PLC stimulation, exhibiting a level similar to that of the α1B-receptor alone. The ΔN666 mutant stimulated PLC upon activation of the α1-receptor, but to a lesser extent than wild type. These data suggested that a region comprising 20 amino acids between His657 and Lys677 is critical for coupling to the α1B-receptor or PLC.Figure 3:Coupling ability of expressed hhGαh and its mutants.

The α1-receptor-mediated PLC stimulation was determined after normalizing receptor number (100 fmol/tube) in a 100-μl final volume. Receptor number was normalized, since the receptor number is the determinant in signal manipulation, not G-protein number(17May D.C. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4888-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the expression level of hhGαh and its mutants was also 3-5-fold higher than the receptor level.

The mutants, ΔK676, ΔN666, and ΔL656, coexpressed with the α1B-adrenoreceptor, coimmunoprecipitated >90%α1-receptor as wild type did, indicating that the receptor interaction site on these mutants was intact (Fig. 3B). However, the mutant, ΔE646, consistently coimmunoprecipitated less receptor (~80%) than other mutants but more than the receptor alone (~35%). Although less coimmunoprecipitation of the receptor with this mutant suggested that this region on hhGαh might contain the receptor interaction site, this point should be further investigated. Coimmunoprecipitation of the receptor with membrane extract from the expressed α1B-receptor alone was probably due to complex formation between the internal Gαh and the receptor.The loss of PLC interaction site was then assessed by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 3C). The results revealed that the ΔK676 mutant coimmunoprecipitated PLC as effectively as the wild type, whereas the ΔL656 and ΔE646 mutants failed to coimmunoprecipitate PLC, showing a similar level to that of the α1B-receptor alone. The ΔL666 mutant again showed lower coimmunoprecipitation of PLC than hhGαh but higher than theΔL656 and ΔE646 mutants. The loss of the PLC interaction site was further confirmed by determining PLC stimulation in response to GTP (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, the basal levels of PLC in membranes expressing hhGαh and mutants were increased 3~6-fold compared to the α1B-receptor alone. Within these increases, the PLC basal activity gradually decreased as the deletion size increased (Fig. 4A). In the presence of GTP, the expressed hhGαh and the mutant ΔK676 increased PLC stimulation 2-fold (Fig. 4B). Increases in deletion size also resulted in a gradual decrease of GTP-mediated PLC stimulation. Mutants ΔL656 and ΔE646 lost ability to stimulate PLC in response to GTP. These results were consistent with the finding from the coimmunoprecipitation studies and strongly suggested that a region between His657 and Lys677 on hhGαh contained a PLC interaction site.Figure 4:The GTP-mediated PLC activation. The membranes (30 μg/tube) were preincubated with and without 0.1 mM GTP in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2 at 30°C for 30 min. Production of IP3 was measured with various concentrations of CaCl2 at 30°C for 10 min. Panels A and B are shown in the absence and presence of GTP, respectively. The data shown are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further define this putative PLC interaction site, four overlapping peptides corresponding to the deleted regions of hhGαh were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit coimmunoprecipitation of PLC (Fig. 5A). Peptide 4 (Leu661-Lys672), among the four peptides, was able to inhibit coimmunoprecipitation of PLC (Fig. 5B). Coimmunoprecipitation of PLC was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, and at 100-200 μM of the peptide, the inhibition reached ~80%, suggesting that other interaction site(s) probably exist (Fig. 5C). The competition potency (IC50) of peptide 4 for the interaction between hhGαh and PLC was ~20 μM.Figure 5:A, map of the synthesized peptides of hhGαh. Overlapping amino acids in peptides 3 and 4 are indicated with asterisks. B, effect of peptides of hhGαh on coimmunoprecipitation of PLC by Gh7a antibody-protein A-agarose.

Bottenus R.E. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13411-13414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region of FXIIIa was chosen because FXIIIa does not interact with or stimulate PLC or bind GTP(4Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), and this region of FXIIIa is distinct among TGases(13Ichinose A. Bottenus R.E. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13411-13414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chimera was expressed ~7-fold higher than endogenous Gαh and to the similar level of hhGαh (Fig. 6A). The chimera protein exhibited GTP binding and TGase activity at the same levels as the wild type (Fig. 6B). In addition, using the partially purified chimera when the GTP-mediated inhibition of TGase activity was titrated, the inhibition was similar to ΔK676 and wild type, indicating that substitution of this region did not change GTP binding affinity (data not shown). The chimera also failed to stimulate PLC in response to GTP (Fig. 6C) and upon activation of the α1B-receptor (data not shown). The Ga antibody did not coimmunoprecipitate PLC but effectively coimmunoprecipitated the receptor (data not shown). These findings clearly demonstrate that the C-terminal region of hhGαh from Val665 to Lys672 is a critical site for interaction and stimulation of PLC.Figure 6:Coupling ability of the expressed hhGαh/FXIIIa chimera.

IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The substituted region of the chimera has a significant change in properties of the amino acids (Fig. 1). Thus, four charged amino acids (Asn667, Glu669, Asp671, and Lys672) were substituted for serine, except Asp671. Hydrophobic amino acids (Val665, Val666, and Phe668) were also changed to smaller (V666A and F668M) or larger (V665I) amino acids. Although it has been suggested that replacement of a bulky side chain of hydrophobic amino acids can result in loss of activity due to unfavorable van der Waals interactions(19Eriksson A.E. Baase W.E. Zhang X.J. Heinz D.W. Blaber M. Baldwin E.P. Science. 1992; 255: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), overall hydrophobicity of the substituted amino acids, however, remains similar. Therefore, it is unlikely that a hydrophobic interaction is responsible for coupling of hhGαh to PLC. Three charged amino acids in this region, i.e. a hydrophilic interaction, probably play a critical role in the contact of hhGαh with PLC.In heterotrimeric G-protein-mediated signaling systems, the near C-terminal domain of the α-subunit appears to contain an effector contact region (adenylyl cyclase with GαS(20Masters S.B.

Despite extensive primary structural differences between Gαh and α-subunits of the heterotrimeric G-proteins, our data indicate that Gαh seems to share this common structural feature in signaling. Our data also suggest that the carboxyl domain of Gαh with its primary structure distinct from other transglutaminases is likely to be involved in signaling functions, including receptor and GTP binding sites.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe isolated full-length hhGαh cDNA was an exact match in the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences with the human endothelial TGase II(14Genitile V. Saydak M.

To identify interaction sites of hhGαh with the α1-adrenoreceptor and PLC, systematic 10-amino acid-deleted mutants of hhGαh cDNA(s) were generated from the C-terminal end (Fig. 1). The full-length hhGαh cDNA and truncated hhGαh cDNA(s) were cotransfected into COS-1 cells with α1B-adrenoreceptor cDNA. The expressed proteins were recognized by the Gh7a antibody as well as guinea pig TGase II antibody and were of the expected sizes with ~80 kDa for full-length hhGαh and a decrease in size as the length of nucleotide deletion increased (Fig. 2A). The α1B-receptor was also expressed, resulting in 2-3 pmol/mg protein of [3H]prazosin binding. The expressed hhGαh proteins exhibited both GTP binding and TGase activities (Fig. 2B and inset). The Ca2+-stimulated TGase activities of expressed hhGαh and its truncated mutants were completely inhibited with >100 μM GTP, and the inhibitory potency (IC50) of GTP was in the range of 20-50 μM for all hhGαh proteins, also confirming that GTP is a negative regulator for the TGase of Gαh(1Nakaoka H.

The results revealed that the ΔK676 mutant coimmunoprecipitated PLC as effectively as the wild type, whereas the ΔL656 and ΔE646 mutants failed to coimmunoprecipitate PLC, showing a similar level to that of the α1B-receptor alone. The ΔL666 mutant again showed lower coimmunoprecipitation of PLC than hhGαh but higher than theΔL656 and ΔE646 mutants. The loss of the PLC interaction site was further confirmed by determining PLC stimulation in response to GTP (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, the basal levels of PLC in membranes expressing hhGαh and mutants were increased 3~6-fold compared to the α1B-receptor alone. Within these increases, the PLC basal activity gradually decreased as the deletion size increased (Fig. 4A). In the presence of GTP, the expressed hhGαh and the mutant ΔK676 increased PLC stimulation 2-fold (Fig. 4B). Increases in deletion size also resulted in a gradual decrease of GTP-mediated PLC stimulation. Mutants ΔL656 and ΔE646 lost ability to stimulate PLC in response to GTP. These results were consistent with the finding from the coimmunoprecipitation studies and strongly suggested that a region between His657 and Lys677 on hhGαh contained a PLC interaction site.Figure 4:The GTP-mediated PLC activation. The membranes (30 μg/tube) were preincubated with and without 0.1 mM GTP in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2 at 30°C for 30 min.

Peptide 4 (Leu661-Lys672), among the four peptides, was able to inhibit coimmunoprecipitation of PLC (Fig. 5B). Coimmunoprecipitation of PLC was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, and at 100-200 μM of the peptide, the inhibition reached ~80%, suggesting that other interaction site(s) probably exist (Fig. 5C). The competition potency (IC50) of peptide 4 for the interaction between hhGαh and PLC was ~20 μM.Figure 5:A, map of the synthesized peptides of hhGαh.

Bottenus R.E. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13411-13414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region of FXIIIa was chosen because FXIIIa does not interact with or stimulate PLC or bind GTP(4Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), and this region of FXIIIa is distinct among TGases(13Ichinose A. Bottenus R.E. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13411-13414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chimera was expressed ~7-fold higher than endogenous Gαh and to the similar level of hhGαh (Fig. 6A). The chimera protein exhibited GTP binding and TGase activity at the same levels as the wild type (Fig. 6B). In addition, using the partially purified chimera when the GTP-mediated inhibition of TGase activity was titrated, the inhibition was similar to ΔK676 and wild type, indicating that substitution of this region did not change GTP binding affinity (data not shown). The chimera also failed to stimulate PLC in response to GTP (Fig. 6C) and upon activation of the α1B-receptor (data not shown). The Ga antibody did not coimmunoprecipitate PLC but effectively coimmunoprecipitated the receptor (data not shown). These findings clearly demonstrate that the C-terminal region of hhGαh from Val665 to Lys672 is a critical site for interaction and stimulation of PLC.Figure 6:Coupling ability of the expressed hhGαh/FXIIIa chimera.

Thus, four charged amino acids (Asn667, Glu669, Asp671, and Lys672) were substituted for serine, except Asp671. Hydrophobic amino acids (Val665, Val666, and Phe668) were also changed to smaller (V666A and F668M) or larger (V665I) amino acids. Although it has been suggested that replacement of a bulky side chain of hydrophobic amino acids can result in loss of activity due to unfavorable van der Waals interactions(19Eriksson A.E.

Science. 1992; 255: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), overall hydrophobicity of the substituted amino acids, however, remains similar. Therefore, it is unlikely that a hydrophobic interaction is responsible for coupling of hhGαh to PLC. Three charged amino acids in this region, i.e. a hydrophilic interaction, probably play a critical role in the contact of hhGαh with PLC.In heterotrimeric G-protein-mediated signaling systems, the near C-terminal domain of the α-subunit appears to contain an effector contact region (adenylyl cyclase with GαS(20Masters S.B.

Science. 1992; 256: 1031-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). Despite extensive primary structural differences between Gαh and α-subunits of the heterotrimeric G-proteins, our data indicate that Gαh seems to share this common structural feature in signaling. Our data also suggest that the carboxyl domain of Gαh with its primary structure distinct from other transglutaminases is likely to be involved in signaling functions, including receptor and GTP binding sites. The isolated full-length hhGαh cDNA was an exact match in the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences with the human endothelial TGase II(14Genitile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande N. Birckbichler P.J. Lee K.N. Stein J.P. Davis P.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 478-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify interaction sites of hhGαh with the α1-adrenoreceptor and PLC, systematic 10-amino acid-deleted mutants of hhGαh cDNA(s) were generated from the C-terminal end (Fig. 1). The full-length hhGαh cDNA and truncated hhGαh cDNA(s) were cotransfected into COS-1 cells with α1B-adrenoreceptor cDNA. The expressed proteins were recognized by the Gh7a antibody as well as guinea pig TGase II antibody and were of the expected sizes with ~80 kDa for full-length hhGαh and a decrease in size as the length of nucleotide deletion increased (Fig. 2A). The α1B-receptor was also expressed, resulting in 2-3 pmol/mg protein of [3H]prazosin binding. The expressed hhGαh proteins exhibited both GTP binding and TGase activities (Fig. 2B and inset). The Ca2+-stimulated TGase activities of expressed hhGαh and its truncated mutants were completely inhibited with >100 μM GTP, and the inhibitory potency (IC50) of GTP was in the range of 20-50 μM for all hhGαh proteins, also confirming that GTP is a negative regulator for the TGase of Gαh(1Nakaoka H.

All mutants, as well as hhGαh, elevated the basal PLC activity as compared to that of the α1B-receptor alone (Fig. 3A), indicating induction of precoupled protein complexes resulting from overexpression of the proteins(1Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 18Coupry I. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9852-9857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The(-)-epinephrine-mediated activation of PLC was increased approximately 2-fold with hhGαh and the ΔK676 mutant, whereas the ΔL656 and ΔE646 mutants lost the agonist-mediated PLC stimulation, exhibiting a level similar to that of the α1B-receptor alone. The ΔN666 mutant stimulated PLC upon activation of the α1-receptor, but to a lesser extent than wild type. These data suggested that a region comprising 20 amino acids between His657 and Lys677 is critical for coupling to the α1B-receptor or PLC. The possibility that the receptor and/or PLC recognition sites were deleted was examined by coimmunoprecipitation. The mutants, ΔK676, ΔN666, and ΔL656, coexpressed with the α1B-adrenoreceptor, coimmunoprecipitated >90%α1-receptor as wild type did, indicating that the receptor interaction site on these mutants was intact (Fig. 3B). However, the mutant, ΔE646, consistently coimmunoprecipitated less receptor (~80%) than other mutants but more than the receptor alone (~35%). Although less coimmunoprecipitation of the receptor with this mutant suggested that this region on hhGαh might contain the receptor interaction site, this point should be further investigated. Coimmunoprecipitation of the receptor with membrane extract from the expressed α1B-receptor alone was probably due to complex formation between the internal Gαh and the receptor. The loss of PLC interaction site was then assessed by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 3C). The results revealed that the ΔK676 mutant coimmunoprecipitated PLC as effectively as the wild type, whereas the ΔL656 and ΔE646 mutants failed to coimmunoprecipitate PLC, showing a similar level to that of the α1B-receptor alone. The ΔL666 mutant again showed lower coimmunoprecipitation of PLC than hhGαh but higher than theΔL656 and ΔE646 mutants. The loss of the PLC interaction site was further confirmed by determining PLC stimulation in response to GTP (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, the basal levels of PLC in membranes expressing hhGαh and mutants were increased 3~6-fold compared to the α1B-receptor alone. Within these increases, the PLC basal activity gradually decreased as the deletion size increased (Fig. 4A). In the presence of GTP, the expressed hhGαh and the mutant ΔK676 increased PLC stimulation 2-fold (Fig. 4B). Increases in deletion size also resulted in a gradual decrease of GTP-mediated PLC stimulation. Mutants ΔL656 and ΔE646 lost ability to stimulate PLC in response to GTP. These results were consistent with the finding from the coimmunoprecipitation studies and strongly suggested that a region between His657 and Lys677 on hhGαh contained a PLC interaction site. To further define this putative PLC interaction site, four overlapping peptides corresponding to the deleted regions of hhGαh were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit coimmunoprecipitation of PLC (Fig. 5A). Peptide 4 (Leu661-Lys672), among the four peptides, was able to inhibit coimmunoprecipitation of PLC (Fig. 5B). Coimmunoprecipitation of PLC was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, and at 100-200 μM of the peptide, the inhibition reached ~80%, suggesting that other interaction site(s) probably exist (Fig. 5C). The competition potency (IC50) of peptide 4 for the interaction between hhGαh and PLC was ~20 μM. The findings that a region of 12 amino acids between Leu661 and Lys672 in hhGαh contains a PLC interaction site were refined by a chimera, hhGαh/FXIIIa, in which eight amino acid residues Val665-Lys672 of hhGαh were substituted with the corresponding region (Ile707-Ser714) of human factor XIIIa (see Fig. 1)(13Ichinose A.

The results from single turnover experiments with greater or equal molar equivalents of sEH:substrate were consistent with the existence of a stable intermediate formed by a nucleophilic amino acid attacking the epoxide group.

Electrospray mass spectrometry of this fragment conclusively illustrated the incorporation of 18O. After complete digestion of the latter peptide it was shown that Asp-333 of sEH exhibited an increased mass. The attack by Asp-333 initiates enzymatic activity, leading to the formation of an α-hydroxyacyl-enzyme intermediate.

NifB-co is one potential source of iron and sulfur for FeMo-co biosynthesis. In the course of attempting to purify the NIFB protein from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shah et al.(16Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) isolated and purified the apparent product of NIFB as a detergent-solubilized, small molecule termed NifB-cofactor (NifB-co). Solutions of NifB-co exhibit certain characteristics that are similar to solutions of purified FeMo-co, including color, stability in N-methylformamide, and oxygen lability. The requirement for NIFB in the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assay is satisfied by the addition of NifB-co, and the amount of FeMo-co synthesized in vitro is proportional to the amount of NifB-co added to the system in which all other components are present in excess. The stoichiometric requirement of NifB-co is consistent with the hypothesis that NifB-co is an iron-sulfur precursor of FeMo-co. Because a functional nifB gene is also required for the molybdenum-independent nitrogen fixation systems(17Joerger R.D. Bishop P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has been proposed that NifB-co is the basic iron-sulfur cluster for the synthesis of FeMo-co, the vanadium-containing cofactor (FeV-co) of the vnf-encoded nitrogenase, and the iron-only cofactor of the anf-encoded nitrogenase(16Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro activation of apodinitrogenase by FeMo-co apparently requires the presence of a protein designated as gamma(18Allen R.M. Homer M.J. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23670-23674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies show that addition of purified FeMo-co to crude extracts and partially purified fractions containing gamma results in a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of gamma on native gels. The mobility change correlates with the incorporation of iron into gamma(19Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 224752-247545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, crude extracts that contain this faster migrating form of gamma (with associated FeMo-co) are capable of activating apodinitrogenase in vitro(19Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 224752-247545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To date there has been no direct evidence for the incorporation of iron and sulfur from NifB-co into FeMo-co or for the flow of iron and sulfur from NifB-co through the NIFNE and gamma proteins. This report directly demonstrates that iron and sulfur from NifB-co can become associated with NIFNE and gamma, and ultimately become incorporated into apodinitrogenase as FeMo-co.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3249-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Strain DJ678 (ΔnifDK ΔYENX::kan) was constructed by transforming strain DJ33 (21Jacobson M.R. Brigle K.E. Bennett L.T. Setterquist R.A. Wilson M.S. Cash V.L. Beynon J. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with pDB583. Plasmid pDB583 was derived from pDB42 by replacing an internal BglII fragment with a 1.6-kilobase BamHI fragment that carries a kanamycin resistance cartridge from pUC4-KIXX (from Pharmacia). DJ678 resulted from a double-reciprocal recombination event where the deletion and insertion mutations located in pDB583 were transferred to the chromosome. Plasmid pDB583 is not capable of autonomous replication in A. vinelandii. Experimental details of similar strain constructions are described in (21Jacobson M.R. Brigle K.E. Bennett L.T. Setterquist R.A. Wilson M.S. Cash V.L. Beynon J. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain UW45 was grown and derepressed in tungsten-containing medium (molybdenum-free) as described previously(11Shah V.K. Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When necessary, small molecules (i.e. homocitrate) were removed from the cell extracts by Sephadex G-25 column chromatography. K. pneumoniae strain UN1217 (nifN4536) has been described (22MacNeil T. MacNeil D. Roberts G.P. Supiano M.A. Brill W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 253-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The minimal medium (23Yoch D.C. Pengra R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1966; 168: 618-622Crossref Google Scholar) was modified as described previously (16Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When derepressing the culture in the presence of Na235SO4, 2.5 g of MgCl2•6H2O was substituted for MgSO4•7H2O (the only source of sulfur in the medium). FeCl3 was excluded from medium used for derepression of strain UN1217 in the presence of 55FeCl3. Contaminating metals were removed from the phosphate salts by passage over a Chelex-100 column and all glassware was rinsed overnight with 4 N HCl. For sulfur donation studies, a starter culture of strain UN1217 was grown aerobically on a rotary shaker at 30°C for 20-24 h in 275 ml of medium (minimal medium as described previously; (16Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) containing 15.6 mM ammonium acetate (filter-sterilized). One ml of this culture (stationary phase) was transferred to 250 ml of fresh medium containing 0.2 mM sulfur added as Na2SO4. Approximately 15 h later, this starter culture was used to inoculate a larger culture that would be derepressed. A 5-liter Pyrex carboy containing 4.5 liter of the medium plus 3 ml of a 22% ammonium acetate solution (approximately 1.9 mM final concentration) and 28.7 ml of a 10 mM Na2SO4 solution (approximately 0.063 mM sulfur final concentration) was inoculated with 105 ml of the starter culture. The large culture was grown at 30°C and sparged vigorously with compressed air (filter-sterilized). The culture was spot tested for ammonium using Nessler's reagent. Thirty min after exhaustion of the ammonium (which occurred approximately 4 h post inoculation), derepression of the Nif proteins was initiated by switching the gas from air to 95% N2+ 5% CO2 and by adding 4.4 ml of a sterile 10% L-serine solution. At this time, approximately 4 mCi of Na235SO4 (specific activity 561-572 mCi/mmol) were added to the culture. Six hours after the start of derepression, the cells were harvested (approximately 5 g, wet weight) by centrifugation and stored at -80°C. Approximately 60% of the radiolabel added to the medium was incorporated into the cells. Growth and derepression of strain UN1217 in the presence of 55FeCl3 were similar to that described above, with the following modifications. The starter cultures were not supplemented with any iron. The medium in the 5-liter carboy was supplemented with FeCl3 to a final concentration of approximately 10 μM. At the start of derepression, 2 mCi of 55FeCl3 (specific activity 26.7-29.2 mCi/mg) were added. 55Fe-Labeled ferric citrate was prepared by diluting the 55FeCl3 into 1 ml of distilled H2O containing 5 mg of sodium citrate (pH approximately 7). The solution was heated and the entire volume was added to the carboy. Approximately 50-70% of the radiolabel added to the medium was incorporated into the cells. All buffers used throughout the preparation of the crude extracts containing NifB-co were deoxygenated as described previously and contained 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1.7 mM DTH (16Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anoxic conditions were maintained throughout the procedure. The UN1217 cells were suspended in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4, 2 ml/g wet weight of cells) in a centrifuge tube equipped with a screw-cap modified to accommodate a rubber stopper (so that the tube could be flushed with argon on a gassing manifold). Deoxyribonuclease (approximately 1 mg/15 ml), ribonuclease (approximately 1 mg/15 ml), and lysozyme (approximately 3 mg/15 ml) were added to the suspension. The suspension was incubated at 30°C for 1 h. Approximately 4.5 ml of the cell suspension were transferred to 10-ml polycarbonate centrifuge tubes (16 × 76 mm) that contained 9.5 g of 0.1-0.2 mm glass beads. The beads had been equilibrated overnight with anoxic 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). The tubes were degassed, and cell breakage was initiated by vortexing (standard bench-top vortexer on high setting) each tube for 1 min. Each tube was placed on ice for at least 2 min following vortexing. Seven vortex/ice cycles were used for K. pneumoniae cell breakage. N-Lauroylsarcosine was added to a final concentration of 2% (from a 20% anoxic stock solution in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)). After 10 min at room temperature, the tubes were centrifuged at 27,200 × g for 10 min. The temperature during centrifugation was maintained at approximately 20°C to avoid precipitation of the detergent. The supernatants containing NifB-co were anoxically transferred and combined. To ensure that all of the NifB-co was collected, 2 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.2 ml of 20% N-lauroylsarcosine stock solution were added to each tube immediately after the supernatant was removed. The tubes were degassed, vortexed for 1 min, and centrifuged as described above. The supernatants were anoxically transferred and combined (but kept separately from the first supernatant). Both supernatants were assayed for NifB-co activity using the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis assay (described below). The supernatants were stored at -20°C. All buffers used throughout the purification of NifB-co contained 1.7 mM DTH. The NifB-co was purified according to the published protocol with some key modifications to accommodate small scale purification of radiolabeled NifB-co(16Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatants described above were combined and diluted 3-fold into 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). DTT was added to a final concentration of 5 mM, and the diluted sample was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The preparation was applied to a 1 × 8.5-cm Sephacryl S-200 column equilibrated with 0.1 M NaCl in 25 mM MOPS (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM DTT and 0.4% N-lauroylsarcosine. NifB-co binds to Sephacryl S-200 under these conditions. The column was washed with two column volumes of the equilibration buffer and the NifB-co was eluted with 0.1 M NaCl in 25 mM MOPS (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM DTT and 2% SB-12. The column flow rate during the load and elution was approximately 19 ml/h. Fractions were collected anoxically and assayed for NifB-co activity using the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis system (described below). 35S-Labeled and 55Fe-labeled NifB-co were successfully purified from 4 and 3 different lots of cells, respectively. Nine-ml serum vials were flushed with purified argon and rinsed with anoxic 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). A complete FeMo-co synthesis reaction mixture was prepared by combining the following: 100 μl of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 μl of 1 mM Na2MoO4, 20 μl of 5 mM homocitrate (that had been treated with base to cleave the lactone, pH 8.0), and 200 μl of an ATP-regenerating mixture (containing 3.6 mM ATP, 6.3 mM MgCl2, 51 mM phosphocreatine, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 6.3 mM DTH). The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10-15 min. Two hundred μl of the appropriate A. vinelandii cell-free extract (except in FeMo-co activated samples), 25 μl of the Sephacryl S-200 fraction containing NifB-co, and 10 μl of purified dinitrogenase reductase (0.1 mg of protein) were added to the reaction mixtures. The vials were incubated in a rotary water-bath shaker at 30°C for 35 min. After this incubation, samples to be applied onto native, polyacrylamide gels were placed on ice. The activity of the newly formed dinitrogenase was measured in the remainder of the vials using the C2H2 reduction assay as described previously(11Shah V.K. Imperial J. Ugalde R.A. Ludden P.W. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1636-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In control experiments, various components of the complete reaction mixture were excluded as indicated under “Results and Discussion.” Where indicated, apodinitrogenase in 200 μl of the appropriate extract was activated by incubation with an excess of purified, unlabeled FeMo-co for 10 min before performing the in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction with the labeled NifB-co. The preparation of FeMo-co and the FeMo-co insertion assays were performed as described previously(3Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3249-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Where indicated, NifB-co was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 20 min prior to the addition of FeMo-co. One hundred μl of anoxic 50% glycerol were added to reaction mixtures that would be applied onto the gels. Unless otherwise indicated, 100 μl of the reaction mixtures (with added glycerol) were applied onto the gels. Proteins were separated on anoxic, native gels with a 5-10% acrylamide (37.5 acrylamide:1 bisacrylamide) and 0-20% sucrose gradient and 400 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0). Gel dimensions were approximately 14 × 10 × 0.15-cm. The reservoir buffer was N2-sparged 65 mM Tris-glycine (pH 8.6) containing 1.7 mM DTH. Gels were prerun for at least 45 min at 122 V for initial reduction and proteins were electrophoresed for 2,300 V × h (approximately 122 V) or 900 V × h (approximately 60 V). Gels were run at 4°C. The protocols for immunoblotting and developing (24Blake M.S. Johnson K.H. Russel-Jones G.J. Gotchlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar) with modifications by Brandner et al.(25Brandner J.P. McEwan A.G. Kaplan S. Donahue T. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 360-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described. Native gels were equilibrated in the transfer buffer for at least 15 min before blotting. Polyclonal antibodies to dinitrogenase were raised in rabbits. Gels were exposed to a phosphor screen for 1-3 days and were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics model 425e PhosphorImager. The method of Brumby et al.(26Brumby P.E. Miller R.W. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2222-2228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to confirm that acid-labile sulfide is a component of NifB-co. The tubes used for analysis were stoppered and placed under an argon atmosphere on a gassing manifold. All manipulations were done using a Hamilton syringe inserted through the stopper. In the initial study, purified NifB-co was reported to contain iron as the only metal(16Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1154-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The similarities between solutions of NifB-co and FeMo-co suggested that NifB-co was an iron-sulfur cluster, although the presence of acid-labile sulfide was not demonstrated. Prior to investigating the role of NifB-co as a sulfur donor for FeMo-co synthesis, the presence of acid-labile sulfide in NifB-co was confirmed (data not shown). Various components of the buffer used to purify NifB-co, including N-lauroylsarcosine, DTT, and DTH, interfered with the colorimetric assay for acid-labile sulfide, and therefore precise quantitation of the iron:sulfur ratio of NifB-co was not possible. The data revealed, however, that purified NifB-co preparations contained significant amounts of acid-labile sulfide. Modifications of the NifB-co purification scheme and of the assay for acid-labile sulfide are currently being investigated to accurately quantitate the iron and sulfur content of NifB-co. To investigate the role of NifB-co as an iron-sulfur donor for FeMo-co biosynthesis, NifB-co was independently labeled in vivo with 55Fe or 35S. The labeled cofactor was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 55Fe- and 35S-labeled NifB-co fractions contained an average of 2,200,000 and 300,000 cpm/ml, respectively. The average activities of the 55Fe and 35S-labeled NifB-co fractions were 770 and 400 nmol of C2H2 reduced/min by dinitrogenase formed/ml of the NifB-co-containing fraction, respectively. The in vitro FeMo-co synthesis system together with anoxic, native gel electrophoresis was employed to monitor the incorporation of iron and/or sulfur from NifB-co into the FeMo-co of dinitrogenase. A complete reaction mixture that included all of the components known to be required for FeMo-co biosynthesis was used to monitor donation of iron and sulfur from NifB-co to FeMo-co. The complete reaction mixtures contained molybdenum, homocitrate, an ATP-regenerating system, and cell-free extract from strain UW45 (nifB), which served as a source of NIFNE, dinitrogenase reductase, apodinitrogenase, and any other unidentified factors required for in vitro FeMo-co biosynthesis. Purified 55Fe- or 35S-labeled NifB-co was added to complete the reaction mixture. A number of control reactions (in which iron and sulfur from NifB-co were not expected to be incorporated into dinitrogenase) were performed to demonstrate the specificity of incorporation of radiolabel from active NifB-co into dinitrogenase. Homocitrate, molybdenum, and MgATP were omitted from some in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction mixtures to prevent FeMo-co synthesis. In other control reaction mixtures, the oxygen-labile, labeled NifB-co was inactivated by exposure to air prior to addition to the reactions. In other control assays, all of the apodinitrogenase present in the UW45 extracts was activated in vitro with unlabeled, purified FeMo-co prior to the addition of labeled NifB-co to the complete reaction mixture. In this system, all of the available FeMo-co binding sites on the apodinitrogenase should be occupied by unlabeled FeMo-co, and therefore iron and sulfur from labeled NifB-co were not expected to be associated with dinitrogenase. To investigate the incorporation of 55Fe and 35S from NifB-co into FeMo-co, the proteins in the various in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction mixtures were separated on anoxic native gels. The position to which dinitrogenase migrated was determined by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). The data in Fig. 1A revealed that incorporation of 55Fe from labeled NifB-co into dinitrogenase required the presence of all of the components known to be required for in vitro FeMo-co synthesis. A prominently labeled band that comigrated with dinitrogenase was only detected in the lanes to which the complete FeMo-co synthesis reaction mixture (plus apodinitrogenase) was applied (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 8). The species that migrated slightly faster than dinitrogenase has been identified as NIFNE and is discussed in detail below. At least five lines of evidence suggested that in the complete in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction mixture, iron from NifB-co was specifically incorporated into the FeMo-co of dinitrogenase. (i) Only very low levels of iron were associated with dinitrogenase when FeMo-co synthesis was prevented in the reaction mixtures by omission of MgATP, molybdenum, or homocitrate (each of which is a known requirement for in vitro FeMo-co synthesis; see Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 6, and 9, respectively). (ii) The absence of a band that co-migrated with dinitrogenase in samples where the air-inactivated 55Fe-NifB-co was utilized demonstrated that active NifB-co was required for incorporation of the 55Fe into FeMo-co of dinitrogenase (Fig. 1A, lane 5). (iii) Activation of apodinitrogenase with unlabeled FeMo-co prior to synthesizing FeMo-co using the 55Fe-labeled NifB-co resulted in almost no association of 55Fe with dinitrogenase (Fig. 1A, lane 3). (iv) No radiolabel was detected at the dinitrogenase position in the lane containing only free 55Fe-NifB-co (Fig. 1A, lane 4). (v) Labeled dinitrogenase was not observed when the complete reaction mixture was oxidized following the FeMo-co synthesis reaction, but prior to being applied to the gel (data not shown). Note that the C2H2 reduction activities of the various assays (Fig. 1A) are consistent with the conclusion that holodinitrogenase was only formed in the complete system (by FeMo-co synthesis using 55Fe-NifB-co; Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 8) and in the FeMo-co activated sample (by activation of apodinitrogenase with unlabeled FeMo-co; Fig. 1A, lane 3). Similar results were obtained when 35S-labeled NifB-co was used in the various in vitro FeMo-co synthesis reaction mixtures (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1, 2, and 4 (control experiments) with lane 3 (complete system)). The differences in the band intensities in reactions that used 35S-labeled NifB-co compared to those that used 55Fe-labeled NifB-co (Fig. 1, compare A and B) are most likely because the cpm/ml of the 35S-labeled NifB-co was only 14% that of the 55Fe-labeled NifB-co. Together these data show that iron and sulfur from NifB-co were only incorporated into dinitrogenase under conditions where FeMo-co was synthesized and demonstrate that iron and sulfur from NifB-co were specifically incorporated into the FeMo-co of dinitrogenase. These data provide direct biochemical identification of an iron and sulfur precursor of FeMo-co. The lack of 55Fe associated with dinitrogenase in the sample in which apod"

The deduced ATBF1-A protein is 404 kDa in size and differs from ATBF1-B by a 920-amino acid extention at the N terminus.

https://openalex.org/W2036168474,"A rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase (RGAE) was purified to homogeneity from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus aculeatus, and the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was determined. Full-length cDNAs encoding the enzyme were isolated from an A. aculeatus cDNA library using a polymerase chain reaction-generated product as a probe. The 936-base pair rha1 cDNA encodes a 250-residue precursor protein of 26,350 Da, including a 17-amino acid signal peptide. The rha1 cDNA was overexpressed in Aspergillus oryzae, a filamentous fungus that does not possess RGAE activity, and the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized. Mass spectrometry of the native and recombinant RGAE revealed that the enzymes are heterogeneously glycosylated. In addition, the observed differences in their molecular masses, lectin binding patterns, and monosaccharide compositions indicate that the glycan moieties on the two enzymes are structurally different. The RGAE was shown to act in synergy with rhamnogalacturonase A as well as rhamnogalacturonase B from A. aculeatus in the degradation of apple pectin rhamnogalacturonan. RNA gel blot analyses indicate that the expression of rhamnogalacturonan degrading enzymes by A. aculeatus is regulated at the level of transcription and is subjected to carbon catabolite repression by glucose.

The 936-base pair rha1 cDNA encodes a 250-residue precursor protein of 26,350 Da, including a 17-amino acid signal peptide. The rha1 cDNA was overexpressed in Aspergillus oryzae, a filamentous fungus that does not possess RGAE activity, and the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized. Mass spectrometry of the native and recombinant RGAE revealed that the enzymes are heterogeneously glycosylated. In addition, the observed differences in their molecular masses, lectin binding patterns, and monosaccharide compositions indicate that the glycan moieties on the two enzymes are structurally different. The RGAE was shown to act in synergy with rhamnogalacturonase A as well as rhamnogalacturonase B from A. aculeatus in the degradation of apple pectin rhamnogalacturonan. RNA gel blot analyses indicate that the expression of rhamnogalacturonan degrading enzymes by A. aculeatus is regulated at the level of transcription and is subjected to carbon catabolite repression by glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2071967878,"Nitrogenase is the catalytic component of biological nitrogen fixation, and it is comprised of two component proteins called the Fe protein and MoFe protein. The Fe protein contains a single Fe4S4 cluster, and the MoFe protein contains two metallocluster types called the P cluster (Fe8S8) and FeMo-cofactor (Fe7S9Mo-homocitrate). During turnover, electrons are delivered one at a time from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein in a reaction coupled to component-protein association-dissociation and MgATP hydrolysis. Under conditions of optimum activity, the rate of component-protein dissociation is rate-limiting. The Fe protein's Fe4S4 cluster is the redox entity responsible for intermolecular electron delivery to the MoFe protein, and FeMo-cofactor provides the substrate reduction site. In contrast, the role of the P cluster in catalysis is not well understood although it is believed to be involved in accumulating electrons delivered from the Fe protein and brokering their intramolecular delivery to the substrate reduction site. A nitrogenase component-protein docking model, which is based on the crystallographic structures of the component proteins and which pairs the 2-fold symmetric surface of the Fe protein with the exposed surface of the MoFe protein's pseudosymmetric αβ interface, is now available. During component-protein interaction, this model places the P cluster between the Fe protein's Fe4S4 cluster and FeMo-cofactor, which implies that the P cluster is involved in mediating intramolecular electron transfer between the clusters. In the present study, evidence supporting this idea was obtained by demonstrating that it is possible to alter the rate of substrate reduction by perturbing the polypeptide environment between the P cluster and FeMo-cofactor without necessarily disrupting the metallocluster polypeptide environments or altering component-protein interaction.

Insertion into the inner membrane and export of the N- and C-terminal domains require an energized inner membrane. The export of COXII is independent of both maturation by the Imp1p protease and assembly into the cytochrome c oxidase complex. When linked to a mitochondrial matrix-targeting sequence, the N-terminal portion of preCOXII (fused to mouse dihydrofolate reductase) can be imported into the mitochondrial matrix. Following accumulation in the matrix, this chimeric protein can become exported across the inner membrane, delivering the N terminus into the intermembrane space where it undergoes processing by the Imp1p protease.

SAP is a plasma protein present in all amyloid deposits. Recently, SAP was shown to inhibit the complement regulatory functions of C4BP. In this investigation, we have studied the structural requirements for the C4BP-SAP interaction. C4BP was subjected to chymotrypsin digestion, which yielded two major fragments corresponding to the central core (160 kDa) and to the cleaved-off tentacles (48 kDa). SAP-Sepharose specifically bound the 160-kDa fragment, suggesting that the central core of C4BP contains the binding site for SAP. In a quantitative affinity chromatography assay, the dissociation constants for binding of intact C4BP and of the 160-kDa central core fragment to SAP were found to be 30 and 70 nM, respectively. Recombinant C4BP composed of only α-chains bound SAP with similar affinity (Kd= 22 nM), whereas nonglycosylated recombinant α-chain C4BP (synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin) bound SAP with lower affinity (Kd = 126 nM). This suggests that the carbohydrate moiety of the central core of C4BP is important for binding of C4BP to SAP in contrast to the C4BP β-chain, which is not required. EDTA, heparin, and phosphorylethanolamine as well as a peptide comprising amino acids 27-39 of SAP were found to completely displace C4BP from the SAP matrix.

In order to study the function of the HtrB protein in Haemophilus, we generated two isogenic htrB mutants by shuttle mutagenesis using a mini-Tn3.

The htrB gene was first identified in Escherichia coli as encoding a protein essential for cell viability at a temperature above 33°C(2Karow M. Fayet O. Cegielska A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Unlike other heat shock proteins, however, its expression is not regulated by temperature(3Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Bacteria with a mutation in the htrB gene, when exposed to nonpermissive temperatures in rich media, cease to divide and lose viability within 2 h(2Karow M. Fayet O. Cegielska A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). They also show morphological changes similar to those of cells with double mutations in two of the cell wall synthesis genes, pbpA and pbpB, suggesting a role of the HtrB protein in cell wall synthesis(3Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Begg K.J. Donachie W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 615-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli htrB mutation does not affect the mobility of LPS on SDS gels, but the silver-stained LPS has a dramatically reduced intensity and a conversion from a black to a brown coloration(1Schnaitman C.A. Klena J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 655-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One study of htrB suppressor genes has shown that htrB mutant bacteria accumulate a high level of phospholipid at 42°C and that spontaneous mutations in the accBC operon, which is involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, cause a decrease in phospholipid biosynthesis, restoring the balance between the two(5Karow M. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7407-7418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study suggested that htrB may be part of a link between growth rate and the regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis. Haemophilus influenzae is a causative agent of many childhood diseases, including meningitis and respiratory tract infections. Nontypable strains of H. influenzae (NTHi), which are commonly present in the nasopharynx of 50-80% of healthy carriers, are recently recognized to be important human pathogens, and evidence has shown that their lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS) is important in pathogenesis. Haemophilus LOS differs from enterobacterial LPS in that it does not contain repeating O-antigen units and is more similar to those from Neisseria and Bordetella(6Mandrell R.E. Apicella M.A. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 382-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We have been studying genes involved in LOS biosynthesis in Haemophilus. In the process of sequencing the upstream region of the NTHi rfaE gene, which is responsible for ADP-heptose synthesis, we identified the htrB homologue(7Lee N.-G. Sunshine M.G. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 818-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two genes have overlapping promoter regions and are transcribed into diverse orientations. In an effort to understand the function of HtrB in Haemophilus, we constructed and characterized NTHi 2019 htrB mutants. Structural analysis of the LOS from an htrB mutant revealed a modification of the ratio of hexose to phosphoethanolamine in the LOS core structure and the loss of one or both myristic acid substitutions of the lipid A. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1 and Fig. 1. E. coli strains were grown in LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics at 30 or 37°C. NTHi strains were cultured on brain-heart infusion medium agar plates supplemented with 2% Fildes reagent (Difco Laboratories) (sBHI) or in sBHI broth at 30 or 37°C with agitation. For E. coli strains, antibiotics were added when necessary at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for ampicillin, 30 μg/ml for kanamycin, and 40 μg/ml for chloramphenicol. For NTHi strains, 1.5 μg/ml of chloramphenicol or 15 μg/ml of kanamycin was added when needed.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs and Promega. Standard DNA recombinant procedures were performed as described(8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For cloning of DNA fragments made by PCR into a vector DNA, the TA cloning system from Invitrogen was used. Transformation of E. coli strains with plasmid DNA was routinely done by the CaCl2 method (9Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8144) Google Scholar) or by electroporation using the Life Technologies Cell Porator. NTHi strains were transformed by the M IV method (10Herriott R.M. Meyer E.M. Vogt M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 517-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by electroporation(11William J.D. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the htrB gene was carried out by shuttle mutagenesis using a mini-Tn3 as described by Seifert et al.(12Seifert S. Chen E.Y. So M. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The locations of transposon insertion sites were determined by DNA sequencing of plasmids and genomic Southern hybridization. NTHi 2019 genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes, resolved on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Corp.) by capillary blotting overnight, and cross-linked to the membrane using the Stratalinker (Stratagene). After prehybridization in 6 × SSC, 1% SDS, 0.5% dry milk, the membrane was hybridized with a digoxigenin-dUTP-labeled DNA probe at 65°C and washed. The hybridized probe was detected using the DIG Luminescent Detection Kit (Boehringer Mannheim), and the membrane was exposed to a Kodak X-Omat AR film at room temperature. NTHi strains grown overnight in sBHI broth at 30°C were diluted 10-fold with fresh medium, grown to OD600 nm 0.2, and then shifted to the desired temperature and allowed to grow for 1 h. Cells were then harvested, and RNA was extracted as described by Verwoerd et al.(13Verwoerd T.C. Dekker B.M.M. Hoekema A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar), followed by DNase I treatment and ethanol precipitation. The purified RNA was quantitated spectrophotometrically, and the quality of RNA was confirmed on a formaldehyde-agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Oligonucleotides used as primers were synthesized using the 391 DNA Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). Primer extension analysis was carried out using the Promega Primer Extension kit following the manufacturer's suggestions. 20 μg of RNA were used for each reaction, and the reaction products were precipitated in ethanol, dissolved in loading dye, and loaded on a 6% sequencing gel. The gel was dried and exposed to an x-ray film with an intensifying screen at -70°C. The dideoxy-sequencing ladder obtained with the same primer was used as a marker to confirm the position of the primer-extended products. Plasmids were purified by CsCl gradient (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and used for in vitro transcription-translation (Promega). The translation products were labeled using translation grade [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.). The reaction mixtures were separated on a 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel(14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar), which was dried and exposed to an x-ray film. 14C-labeled Rainbow standards (Amersham Corp.) were used as protein molecular weight standards. To determine temperature sensitivity, NTHi strains were grown overnight in 5 ml of sBHI broth at 30°C with agitation, and the cultures were diluted to 45 klett units. 1-ml aliquots of the diluted cultures were inoculated into 50 ml of fresh media and allowed to grow at the desired temperature while being monitored for growth. For kanamycin sensitivity, overnight cultures grown in sBHI broth at 30°C were diluted to 10 Klett units with fresh sBHI and allowed to grow at 30 or 37°C with or without kanamycin (5 μg/ml). To measure sensitivity to deoxycholate, the overnight cultures grown in sBHI broth at 30°C were serially diluted, and 5 μl of each was spotted on a series of sBHI plates containing different concentrations of deoxycholate. The plates were incubated at 30 or 37°C overnight before reading the results. Immunoblot analysis of colonies lifted after overnight growth was performed with monoclonal antibody 6E4. mAb 6E4 recognizes a nonphase varying KDO-like epitope on the LOS of all H. influenzae strains we have studied(15Abu Kwaik Y. McLaughlin R.E. Apicella M.A. Spinola S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2475-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Colonies grown on sBHI plates were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter (Micron Separations Inc.) and air-dried completely. The filter was blocked by soaking in 3% gelatin solution and probed with mAb 6E4 (15Abu Kwaik Y. McLaughlin R.E. Apicella M.A. Spinola S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2475-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) overnight at room temperature. The filter was then incubated with protein A conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories). A chromogenic substrate, 4-chloro-1-naphthol (Bio-Rad), was used as the developing reagent. LPS was prepared by proteinase K digestion as described(16Hitchcock P. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), separated on a 14% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS(14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar), and visualized by silver-staining as described previously (17Tsai C.-M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). Large scale preparations of LOS were obtained using the procedure of Darveau and Hancock(18Darveau R.P. Hancock R.E.W. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 831-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). O-Deacylated LOS was prepared from approximately 2-3 mg of LOS from NTHi 2019 and the isogenic htrB mutant B29 by mild hydrazine treatment (37°C, 20 min) as described previously(19Phillips N.J. John C.M. Reinders L.G. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 19: 731-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine molecular masses, O-deacylated LOS from both strains were subjected to mass analysis by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)(20Gibson B.W. Melaugh W. Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Campagnari A.A. Griffiss J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 175: 2702-2712Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, O-deacylated LOS was first solubilized in water at a concentration of ~10 μg/μl; a 1-μl aliquot of this solution was then taken and diluted with 4 μl of the ESI-MS running solvent prior to injection. Mass analysis was performed using a VG/Fison Platform single quadrupole mass spectrometer operation in the negative ion mode with a running solvent of H2O/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) containing 1% acetic acid at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Mass calibration was accomplished with an external mass reference of CsNO3, which provided cluster masses from m/z 256.9, [Cs(NO3)2]- to m/z 2011.1, [Cs10(NO3)11]-. Preliminary compositions were assigned to the LOS by computer search of potential monosaccharide compositions using the program Gretta Carbos developed by W. Hines. Approximately 32 mg of LOS from NTHi strain 2019 and 6.6 mg of LOS from the isogenic mutant B29 were hydrolyzed in 1% acetic acid for 2 h at 100°C at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. The hydrolysates were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were removed. The pellets were washed twice with 0.5 ml of H2O followed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The water-insoluble crude lipid A fractions were suspended in chloroform/methanol/H2O (2:1:1, v/v/v) and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min, and the lower organic layer plus the middle emulsion layer containing the lipid A were removed and evaporated to dryness. Both lipid A samples were then directly analyzed by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS) in the negative ion mode. Lipid samples were redissolved in CH2Cl2/CH3OH (3:1, v/v), and 1 μl of nitrobenzylalcohol/triethanolamine (1:1, v/v) was applied as the liquid matrix. Samples were then analyzed on a Kratos MS 50S mass spectrometer retrofitted with a cesium ion source operating at a resolution of ~2000 (m/Δm, 10% valley). A primary ion beam of 10 keV was used to ionize the samples, and secondary ions were accelerated at 10 keV. Scans were acquired at 300 s/decade and recorded on a Gould electrostatic recorder. Ultramark® 1206 was used for manual calibration to an accuracy better than ± 0.2 Da. We isolated the rfaE gene from NTHi 2019 by complementing an rfaE mutant of S. typhimurium LT2(7Lee N.-G. Sunshine M.G. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 818-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the upstream region of the rfaE gene revealed an open reading frame (ORF) highly homologous to the E. coli htrB gene. The deduced amino acid sequences of these two genes shared homology (56% identity and 73% similarity). The NTHi 2019 HtrB homologue also showed homology (27% identity and 54% similarity) with the E. coli MsbB protein, which is a multicopy suppressor of the htrB mutation(21Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This is similar to the homology between the E. coli HtrB and MsbB proteins. To construct a plasmid containing the htrB ORF, we carried out PCR using two oligonucleotides, one upstream of the promoter region (5′-aagcatcacatcgcctaatacaa-3′) and the other the universal forward primer, with pHIE2 as a template(7Lee N.-G. Sunshine M.G. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 818-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting 1.3-kb PCR fragment was cloned into a vector, pCRII, yielding pHIH. When the E. coli htrB mutant strains, MLK48 and MLK217, were transformed with pHIH, they were able to grow at 37°C as well as the wild type parent MLK2, indicating that the function of NTHi 2019 HtrB is analogous to that of E. coli HtrB. Disruption of the htrB ORF in pB28 and pB29 by mini-Tn3 abolished the complementing ability of these plasmids (data not shown). In pHIE0 (Fig. 1), we also found a partial ORF located downstream of the htrB gene. A homology search of data banks revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of this partial ORF was highly homologous to E. coli topoisomerase IV subunit B (73% identity and 86% similarity over 100 amino acids) by BESTFIT software analysis. A rho-independent transcription termination sequence was found between these two ORFs, suggesting that htrB is transcribed as a monocistronic message. To confirm that the htrB ORF synthesizes a protein with the molecular mass estimated from the nucleotide sequence, we carried out in vitro transcription-translation analysis (Fig. 2). pCRII, the vector used to construct pHIH, produced two bands corresponding to the 31.5-kDa β-lactamase precursor from its ampicillin resistance gene and the 29.6-kDa aminoglycoside phosphotransferase from its kanamycin resistance gene (Fig. 2, lane 2). pHIH produced one more band, presumably from the htrB gene, above the β-lactamase precursor (Fig. 2, lane 3). The estimated molecular mass of HtrB was 36 kDa, but the peptide synthesized from pHIH migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 32-33 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 3). Based on complementation data (see below), we believe that this is the authentic HtrB. pHIE0 produced three proteins in addition to β-lactamase from the vector pSH-lox-1 (Fig. 2, lane 4), one corresponding to HtrB and another corresponding to RfaE as seen with pHIE7 (Fig. 2, lane 5). In order to investigate the function of HtrB in Haemophilus, we constructed isogenic htrB mutants by shuttle mutagenesis. The 2.4-kb BglII fragment from pHIE0 was cloned into pHSS6, resulting in pHSBglII, which was used for mini-Tn3 mutagenesis(12Seifert S. Chen E.Y. So M. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Two plasmids, pB28 and pB29, each with a mini-Tn3 transposon inserted into the htrB ORF at a different location, were obtained (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis and restriction mapping of these plasmids indicated that in both plasmids, mini-Tn3 was inserted with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in the same orientation as htrB. Both plasmids were used to transform NTHi 2019, and cells were selected on chloramphenicol (1.5 μg/ml) plates. Because the E. coli htrB mutant is temperature-sensitive above 33°C, we incubated cells at 30°C. Mutant strains from each plasmid were designated NTHi B28 and B29, respectively. The locations of the mini-Tn3 insertions in the NTHi 2019 chromosome were confirmed by genomic Southern hybridization using the 2.4-kb BglII fragment as a probe. BglII digestion yielded a 2.4-kb fragment with NTHi 2019 DNA but produced 4.0-kb fragments with NTHi B28 and B29 DNAs, indicating that they contained the 1.6-kb transposon (data not shown). The 2.4-kb band remained the same in NTHi 2019 DNA upon BglII and EcoRI double digestion, but the 4.0-kb BglII bands of NTHi B28 and B29 were cut into two fragments by EcoRI, which is present in mini-Tn3. Primer extension analysis was carried out to determine the promoter region of the htrB gene (Fig. 3A), and a single transcription start site was found using a primer (5′-ccaatatggcgcaaaataggatagggaagac-3′) complementary to the 5′ region of the htrB ORF. The first nucleotide transcribed was a C residue located at 21 base pairs upstream of the putative translation start site ATG. The region upstream of the transcription start site contained a sequence (TAAACT) similar to the consensus -10 region of the bacterial σ70-dependent promoters at an appropriate distance (6 base pairs). An element (TTACCA) resembling the consensus sequence of the -35 region (TTGACA) was found. There was a 16-base pair spacer between this region and the -10 region. This -35 element partially overlapped with the -10 region of the rfaE gene. The E. coli htrB protein is required for cell viability at high temperatures, but it has been reported that htrB gene expression is not under heat shock regulation(3Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine if the same is true in Haemophilus, we measured the htrB transcript level in RNA from NTHi 2019 grown at 30 and 37°C by primer extension analysis. The results indicated that the transcript level of htrB was not affected by temperature (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). Because the E. coli htrB mutation phenotype is very diverse and complex (2Karow M. Fayet O. Cegielska A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol.

Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and our previous data suggested that it may play a role in regulation of gene expression(7Lee N.-G. Sunshine M.G. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 818-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we measured htrB and rfaE expression levels in RNA from NTHi 2109 and B29 grown at 30 and 37°C. Temperature did not affect htrB expression in either strain. The level of expression of htrB, however, increased in B29 as compared with NTHi 2019 at both temperatures by 4-6-fold when quantitated using an Ambis 4000 gel scanner (Ambis Inc, San Diego, CA). Similar results were observed for rfaE in that rfaE expression increased in htrB- cells and was not dependent on temperature (Fig. 3B). The increase in rfaE expression in htrB- cells was 2-2.5-fold higher than that found in htrB+ cells. NTHi B28 and B29 strains were initially selected at 30°C and were not able to grow at 37°C. After they were passed a few times at 30°C, however, they began to lose this temperature sensitivity and showed growth at 37°C. The growth rates of B28 and B29 were comparable with that of 2019 at 30°C, but slower growth was observed at 37°C. The temperature sensitivity of these htrB- strains was greater at 38.5°C, so that their growth reached a maximum at 6 h and then started to decrease, suggesting cell lysis (data not shown). Previous reports have suggested that htrB is involved in LPS synthesis and/or cell wall formation, subsequently changing membrane permeability to various compounds(21Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested NTHi htrB- strains for sensitivity to kanamycin and deoxycholate. Overnight cultures grown at 30°C were diluted and allowed to grow in the absence or presence of kanamycin (5 μg/ml) at 30 or 37°C. At 30°C, no difference was observed in the growth rate between the wild type and htrB- strains B28 and B29 in the absence of kanamycin, but the growth of htrB- cells was significantly inhibited by addition of kanamycin, whereas the wild type cell growth was not affected (Fig. 4A). The effect of kanamycin on the htrB mutant strains was greater at 37°C because there was essentially no growth in the presence of kanamycin (Fig. 4B). The sensitivity pattern of B28 and B29 to deoxycholate was similar to kanamycin. At 30 and 37°C, NTHi 2019 grew well in the presence of 1000 μg/ml of deoxycholate and still showed some growth in the presence of 2500 μg/ml of deoxycholate (data not shown). At 30°C, B28 and B29 cells grew as well as the wild type cells in the presence of 250 μg/ml of deoxycholate but began to show sensitivity at 500 μg/ml and failed to grow at 1000 μg/ml. At 37°C, B28 and B29 began to show growth inhibition at 50 μg/ml of deoxycholate and almost complete inhibition at 250 μg/ml of deoxycholate. To confirm that the htrB gene alone can complement the phenotypes of B28 and B29, we constructed a plasmid expressing htrB. The BamHI-PstI fragment carrying the htrB gene from pHIH was cloned into pGHH. Because strain B29 carried the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in mini-Tn3, we cloned a kanamycin cassette into the PstI site of pGHH, resulting in pKHH. pKHH was transformed into B29 by electroporation and selected on kanamycin (15 μg/ml) at 30°C to increase the probability to rescue transformants. pKHH carries the p15A origin, which is known to replicate in Haemophilus(23Chandler M.S. Plasmid. 1991; 25: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but we were unable to detect any plasmid DNA in mini-plasmid DNA preparations from B29 cells transformed with pKHH. To detect any presence of plasmid DNA, we also transformed these mini DNA preparations into E. coli DH5α with selection for kanamycin resistance but did not get any transformants. A genomic Southern blot of the pKHH-transformed B29 cells, however, indicated that the kanamycin cassette had been integrated into the chromosome (data not shown). B29 transformed with pKHH behaved similarly to NTHi 2019 in sensitivity to deoxycholate at both temperatures. It has been described that LPS of the E. coli htrB mutant silver-stained weakly on SDS-polyacrylamide gels but its migration pattern was not affected(1Schnaitman C.A. Klena J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 655-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LOS from B28 and B29 migrated faster than that from NTHi 2019 on silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 5), and the color of the band had changed from black to brown.

https://openalex.org/W2038792215,"Profilin is an actin- and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding protein that plays a role in the organization of the cytoskeleton and may be involved in growth factor signaling pathways. The subcellular localization of profilin was examined in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Immunoblot analysis showed that profilin was localized in both the plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions of the cell. Actin was bound to the profilin localized in the cytosol. The association of profilin with the membrane was peripheral and mediated through interaction with phospholipid. The phospholipid dependence of profilin for membrane binding was examined in vitro using pure profilin and defined unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. The presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in phospholipid vesicles was required for maximum profilin binding. Moreover, the binding of profilin to phospholipid vesicles was dependent on the surface concentration of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The subcellular localization of profilin was examined in vivo under growth conditions (i.e. inositol starvation of ino1 cells and glucose starvation of respiratory deficient cells) where plasma membrane levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were depleted. Depletion of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels resulted in a translocation of profilin from the plasma membrane to the cytosolic fraction. Profilin translocated back to the membrane fraction from the cytosol under growth conditions where plasma membrane levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were replenished.

INTRODUCTIONProfilin is a ubiquitous actin- and PIP2 1The abbreviations used are: PIP2phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphatePIPphosphatidylinositol 4-phosphatePCphosphatidylcholine. -binding protein found in eucaryotic cells(1Machesky L.M. Pollard T.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 381-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is believed that profilin assists in the regulation of the reorganization of the microfilament cytoskeleton(2Theriot J.A. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 835-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Profilin competes with other actin-binding proteins for globular actin(3Pantaloni D. Carlier M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), catalyzing the exchange of nucleotide phosphates on monomeric actin, thereby activating actin for polymerization(4Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).Profilin has also been shown to bind anionic phospholipids(5Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). However, at physiological salt concentrations, profilin binds exclusively to PIP2(6Machesky L.M. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Pollard T.D. Cell Reg. 1990; 1: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Profilin cannot bind to actin and PIP2 simultaneously(7Metzler W.J. Bell A.J. Ernst E. Lavoie T.B. Mueller L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4620-4625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as the actin- and PIP2-binding sites are sufficiently close as to impart mutually exclusive binding(7Metzler W.J. Bell A.J. Ernst E. Lavoie T.B. Mueller L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4620-4625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of profilin with PIP2 may regulate the availability of profilin for interaction with actin(5Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Another role proposed for profilin's association with PIP2 is to prevent the phospholipase Cg1-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2(8Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Baldassare J.J. Pollard T.D. Science. 1990; 247: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), and thus the generation of the second messengers inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol(9Berridge M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 907: 33-45PubMed Google Scholar). However, tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cg1 allows hydrolysis of PIP2 even in the presence of profilin(10Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Kim J.W. Machesky L.M. Rhee S.G. Pollard T.D. Science. 1991; 251: 1231-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar).We are using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model eucaryote to study profilin. The gene (PFY1) encoding for profilin has been cloned from S. cerevisiae(11Magdolen V. Oechsner U. Muller G. Bandlow W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5108-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae profilin resembles profilins from higher eucaryotes in size (~15 kDa), ability to bind actin, PIP2, and polyproline, and inhibit ATP hydrolysis by monomeric actin (11Magdolen V. Oechsner U. Muller G. Bandlow W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5108-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Haarer B.K. Lillie S.H. Adams A.E.M. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Brown S.S. J.

Moreover, profilin is required for the proper organization of the actin cytoskeleton into actin cables, which occur at regions of active growth and for proper maintenance of cell polarity(12Haarer B.K. Lillie S.H. Adams A.E.M. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Brown S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether these roles for profilin are related to its ability to bind actin and/or PIP2(13Haarer B.K. Petzold A.S. Brown S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7864-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of profilin's ability to bind polyproline is also unclear (13Haarer B.K. Petzold A.S. Brown S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7864-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The fact that binding to actin and PIP2 are mutually exclusive in profilin, and that actin is localized in the cytosol (14Kilmartin J.V. Adams E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 933Crossref Scopus (549) Google Scholar) whereas PIP2 is localized in the plasma membrane(15Patton J.L. Lester R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), raises the suggestion that profilin is localized in these two compartments of the cell. In this report we demonstrated that profilin was indeed localized to the plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions of S. cerevisiae. The majority of profilin was bound to plasma membranes. However, under growth conditions where the plasma membrane levels of PIP2 were depleted, profilin was found to translocate from the membrane to the cytosol. Profilin translocated back to the membrane fraction from the cytosol under growth conditions where plasma membrane levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were replenished. The results of our studies were consistent with the notion that the metabolism of PIP2 played a role in the localization of profilin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll chemicals were reagent grade. Growth medium supplies were purchased from Difco Laboratories. ATP, phospholipids, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, benzamide, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. Protein assay reagent was purchased from Bio-Rad.

Brown (University of Michigan Medical School).Methods Strains and Growth ConditionsStrain W303-1A (MATaade2-1, his3-11, 15, leu2-3,112, trp1-1, ura3-1, can1-100) was from Rodney Rothstein and used for profilin localization studies. Studies on the translocation of profilin in response to changes in phosphoinositide metabolism were performed with the ino1 strain MC13 (MATα ino1-13 lys2) (16Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and respiratory deficient strain SDO44, which was selected on ethidium bromide medium (17Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) using strain Y294 (MATα his3Δ1 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 trp1-289)(18Fedor-Chaiken M. Deschenes R.J. Broach J.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 329-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to the exponential phase of growth at 30°C in synthetic complete medium with 2% glucose as the carbon source(17Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The growth medium for ino1 cells also contained 75 μM inositol. Profilin was purified from strain SDO17 (MATahis3, leu2-3,112, trp1, ura3, pfy1::LEU2) bearing the multicopy plasmid pDO3. Plasmid pDO3 was derived from plasmid pMH101 (19Haffey M.L. Stevens J.T.

Oechsner U. Muller G. Bandlow W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5108-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) under control of the GAL1 promoter. The constructions of strain SDO17 and plasmid pDO3 will be described elsewhere. Cells used for the purification of profilin were grown in synthetic complete medium containing 2% raffinose as the carbon source. Profilin production was induced by the addition of 2% galactose to the growth medium.Purification of Profilin and the Preparation of Anti-profilin AntibodiesProfilin was purified to apparent homogeneity using polyproline affinity chromatography as described by Haarer et al.(12Haarer B.K. Lillie S.H. Adams A.E.M. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Brown S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Antiserum to profilin was raised in New Zealand White rabbits by standard procedures(20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Anti-profilin antibodies were purified from the antiserum as described by Olmsted (21Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using nitrocellulose-bound profilin as an affinity adsorbent.Preparation of Subcellular FractionsAll steps were carried out at 5°C. Cell extracts were prepared by disruption with glass beads using a Bead-Beater (Biospec Products) in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM Na2EDTA, 0.3 M sucrose, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamide, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 6 μg/ml pepstatin) as described previously(22Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 304-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unbroken cells and glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min. Mitochondrial (23Belendiuk G. Mangnall D. Tung B. Westley J. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4555-4565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and microsomal (22Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 304-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) fractions were collected from cell extracts by differential centrifugation. The postmicrosomal supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction. The cytosolic fraction was concentrated with a Centricon-10 concentration filter. Plasma membranes were isolated by the method of Serrano (24Serrano R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) as modified by Monk et al.(25Monk B.C. Kurtz M.B. Marrinan J.A. Perlin D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6826-6836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of plasma membrane (vanadate-sensitive) ATPase activity (26Koland J.G. Hammes G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to assess the purity of plasma membranes. Vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity accounted for 90% of the total ATPase activity in plasma membranes. Membrane fractions were suspended in buffer A to a volume equivalent to that of the cytosolic fraction.Electrophoresis and ImmunoblottingSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) was performed with 10-20% gradient slab gels. Immunoblot assays (28Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) were performed with anti-profilin antibodies and anti-actin antibodies (12Haarer B.K. Lillie S.H. Adams A.E.M. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Brown S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) using a chemiluminescent detection system (29Schaap A.P. Akhavan H. Romano L.J. Clin. Chem. 1989; 35: 1863-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The density of bands on immunoblots were quantitated by scanning densitometry. Protein molecular mass standards were phosphorylase b (92.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa), and lysozyme (14.3 kDa).Preparation of Phospholipid VesiclesLarge (average diameter = 90 nm) unilamellar phospholipid vesicles were prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) by removing octyl glucoside from octyl glucoside/phospholipid (molar ratio of 15:1) mixed micelles (30Mimms L.T. Zamphighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) by Sephadex G-50 superfine column chromatography(31Green P.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14688-14694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Fischl A.S. Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3178-3183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pure phospholipids and phospholipids extracted (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42153) Google Scholar) from yeast plasma membranes were used for the preparation of phospholipid vesicles. The phospholipid composition of the vesicles is indicated in figure legends.Analysis of Profilin Binding to Plasma Membranes and Phospholipid VesiclesPure profilin (5 μg) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the indicated concentrations of plasma membranes or phospholipid vesicles in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) in a total volume of 0.5 ml. Following incubation, the profilin bound to plasma membranes or phospholipid vesicles was separated from unbound profilin by Sephadex G-50 superfine column chromatography (32Fischl A.S. Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3178-3183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Both methods for the separation of bound and unbound profilin gave the same results. The amount of bound and unbound profilin was quantitatively determined by scanning densitometry of immunoblots using pure profilin to generate a standard curve. The curve was linear over the concentration range of 50-5000 ng of profilin. The lower limit of sensitivity for the binding assay was 6 μg of profilin/mg of phospholipid phosphate. Profilin binding assays were conducted in triplicate with an average standard deviation of ±3%. The amount of profilin bound to membranes and phospholipid vesicles was normalized to phospholipid phosphate.Analysis of Protein and Phospholipid PhosphateProtein was determined by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The phosphate concentration of membranes and phospholipid vesicles was determined by the method of Bartlett(35Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSSubcellular Localization of ProfilinAffinity-purified anti-profilin antibodies were prepared and used to examine the subcellular localization of profilin. The anti-profilin antibodies could be used to immunoprecipitate profilin from cell extracts (data not shown) and to analyze profilin by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot signals were optimized by analyzing a number of antigen and antibody concentrations and were in the linear range of detectability. Profilin was localized to the total membrane and cytosolic fractions of the cell (Fig. 1A). About 80% of the total amount of profilin was associated with membranes, whereas the remainder was associated with the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1B). Subcellular membrane fractions were isolated and examined for the association of profilin. Essentially all of the membrane-associated profilin was found with the plasma membrane fraction (Fig. 1C).We next questioned whether the association of profilin to membranes was integral or peripheral. Peripheral membrane proteins are associated with membranes through noncovalent interactions and can be released by treatment with high ionic strength. Integral membrane proteins are more tightly associated and cannot be released by changes in ionic strength. Membranes were treated with NaCl, and the amount of profilin remaining bound to the membrane was analyzed. Treatment with NaCl resulted in a dose-dependent dissociation of profilin from the membranes (Fig. 2). Maximum dissociation was obtained with 0.1 M NaCl. Thus, profilin was a peripheral membrane protein.Figure 2:Effect of NaCl on membrane association of profilin. Total membranes were incubated with the indicated concentrations of NaCl in buffer A for 30 min. After incubation, the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in buffer A. The amount of profilin bound to the membranes was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of profilin bound to membranes incubated in buffer without NaCl was set at 100% in the figure. The data shown are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since profilin is an actin-binding protein(1Machesky L.M. Pollard T.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 381-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we questioned whether the cytosolic-associated profilin was bound to actin in the cytosol. Profilin was purified from the cytosolic fraction by affinity chromatography with polyproline-Sepharose(12Haarer B.K. Lillie S.H. Adams A.E.M. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Brown S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The polyproline-Sepharose chromatography procedure was modified such that the column was not washed with buffer containing 3 M urea prior to the elution of profilin with 6 M urea(12Haarer B.K. Lillie S.H. Adams A.E.M. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Brown S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In this way, if profilin was bound to actin in the cytosol, it should remain bound to actin until dissociated from the polyproline-Sepharose column with 6 M urea. The actin- and polyproline-binding sites on profilin are not the same(13Haarer B.K. Petzold A.S. Brown S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7864-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The purified profilin preparation was subjected to immunoblot analysis using affinity-purified anti-actin antibodies. Indeed, actin was present in the profilin preparation purified from the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Immunoblot analysis of actin from the profilin preparation purified from the cytosol. Profilin was purified from the cytosolic fraction by polyproline-Sepharose chromatography under conditions where actin would remain bound to profilin prior to elution with 6 M urea as described under “Results.” The purified profilin preparation was subjected to immunoblot analysis using affinity-purified anti-profilin (A) and anti-actin (B) antibodies. The positions of profilin and actin are indicated in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding of Pure Profilin to Plasma Membranes and Phospholipid Vesicles Prepared from Plasma Membrane PhospholipidsThe nature of profilin's association with the plasma membrane was examined by binding studies using pure profilin and plasma membranes. Plasma membranes were washed with 0.5 M NaCl to remove profilin and other peripheral membrane proteins. Pure profilin was then incubated with the salt-washed plasma membranes, and the amount of profilin which bound to the membranes was analyzed. Profilin bound to plasma membranes in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Maximum profilin binding was obtained with 80 μg/ml phospholipid phosphate. The concentration of plasma membranes that gave half-maximum binding was 30 μg/ml of phospholipid phosphate. These results indicated that the association of profilin with plasma membranes was not through interaction with other peripheral membrane proteins.Figure 4:Effect of plasma membrane concentration on profilin binding. Plasma membrane-associated profilin was removed from membranes by washing with 0.5 M NaCl. Pure profilin (5 μg) was incubated with the indicated concentrations of NaCl-washed plasma membranes. The amount of profilin bound to the membranes was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data shown are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phospholipids were extracted from plasma membranes and used for the preparation of phospholipid vesicles. These vesicles were used to examine profilin binding using phospholipid phosphate concentrations similar to that used in the experiment shown in Fig. 4. Profilin bound to these phospholipid vesicles in a concentration-dependent manner similar to that found with the salt-washed plasma membranes (Fig. 5). Profilin binding to these vesicles saturated at 80 μg/ml phospholipid phosphate and half-maximum binding was at 38 μg/ml phospholipid phosphate. The results of this experiment indicated that the association of profilin with plasma membranes was not through interaction with integral membrane proteins. Thus, the association of profilin with the plasma membrane was through interaction with membrane phospholipids.Figure 5:Binding of profilin to phospholipid vesicles prepared with plasma membrane phospholipids. Phospholipid vesicles were prepared with phospholipids extracted from plasma membranes. Pure profilin (5 μg) was incubated with the indicated concentrations of phospholipid vesicles.

Phosphatidylcholine vesicles were prepared with phospholipids known to be present in the plasma membranes of S. cerevisiae(36Nickels Jr., J.T. Buxeda R.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2026-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidate are plasma membrane phospholipids that are also localized in most cellular organelles(37Zinser E.

PIP and PIP2 are minor phospholipids localized in the plasma membrane(15Patton J.L. Lester R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The only phospholipid vesicles that showed the ability to bind a significant amount of profilin were those containing PIP2 (Fig. 6). The addition of PIP to PC:PIP2 vesicles did not have a major effect on profilin binding (Fig. 6). Binding to PC:PIP2 vesicles was dependent on the concentration of profilin (Fig. 7). The Kd value for profilin was 0.13 μM.Figure 6:Effect of phospholipid composition on the binding of profilin to phospholipid vesicles. Pure profilin (5 μg) was incubated with the indicated phospholipid vesicles. The amount of profilin bound to the phospholipid vesicles was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The molar ratio of the phospholipids in the vesicles is indicated.

Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Surface dilution kinetics takes into account both the surface and bulk concentrations of lipid when defining kinetic parameters of lipid-dependent enzymes(38Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 39Deems R.A. Eaton B.R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9013-9020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Profilin was analogous to a lipid-dependent enzyme in that it bound to PIP2 at a membrane surface. The surface concentration of PIP2, as opposed to the bulk concentration, should be the relevant concentration when considering the binding of profilin to a membrane in vivo. We examined the dependence of the surface concentration of PIP2 (expressed in mol %) in vesicles on profilin binding. These experiments were performed such that profilin binding was independent of the bulk concentration of phospholipid vesicles (i.e. at a bulk vesicle concentration of 100 μg/ml phospholipid phosphate, Figure 4:, Figure 5:). Profilin binding to PC:PIP2 vesicles was indeed dependent on the surface concentration of PIP2 (Fig. 8). The binding dependence of profilin to PIP2 appeared cooperative with a Hill number of 2. However, these data do not rule out a bimolecular reaction. The concentration of PIP2 that gave half-maximum binding was 8.5 mol %.Figure 8:Effect of PIP2 concentration on the binding of profilin to PC:PIP2 vesicles. Pure profilin (5 μg) was incubated with PC:PIP2 vesicles with the indicated surface concentrations of PIP2. The final phospholipid concentration of the vesicles was 100 μg/ml phospholipid phosphate. The amount of profilin bound to phospholipid vesicles was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data shown are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Inositol Starvation on the Subcellular Localization of ProfilinWe sought evidence that the association of profilin with the plasma membrane was dependent on the concentration of PIP2in vivo. The availability of the ino1 mutant facilitated experiments to address this question. Strain MC13 is auxotrophic for inositol due to a mutation in the INO1 gene encoding for inositol-1-phosphate synthase (40Donahue T.F. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7077-7085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Dean-Johnson M. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1274-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When ino1 cells are deprived of inositol, they undergo changes in their metabolism which ultimately result in a loss of cell viability, commonly referred to as “inositol-less death” (42Henry S.A. Atkinson K.D. Kolat A.J. Culbertson M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 472-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Becker G.W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8684-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the early biochemical consequences of inositol starvation of ino1 cells is a 6-fold decrease in the plasma membrane levels of PIP and PIP2(36Nickels Jr., J.T. Buxeda R.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11018-11024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PIP and PIP2 account for 0.6 and 0.2 mol %, respectively, of the total plasma membrane phospholipids in S. cerevisiae(36Nickels Jr., J.T. Buxeda R.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11018-11024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PIP and PIP2 are derived from inositol via phosphatidylinositol synthase and the phosphoinositide kinases(44Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar). Plasma membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase has been shown to be inhibited during inositol starvation of ino1 cells(36Nickels Jr., J.T. Buxeda R.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11018-11024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inositol-supplemented ino1 cells were grown to the exponential phase of growth. Cells were washed and then incubated for 4 h in fresh growth medium lacking inositol. As reported previously(43Becker G.W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8684-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the inositol-starved cells grew equally as well as the control inositol-supplemented cells during the 4-h incubation period. Following the incubation, the association of profilin with the membrane and cytosolic fractions of the cells was analyzed. This analysis showed that the percentage of profilin bound to membranes decreased from 83% to 66% upon inositol starvation (Fig. 9). At the same time, the amount of profilin associated with the cytosol increased from 17% to 34% (Fig. 9).Figure 9:Effect of inositol starvation on the localization of profilin in ino1 cells. Inositol-supplemented ino1 cells were grown to the exponential phase of growth. Cells were washed and incubated for 4 h in fresh growth medium without inositol. Control cells were incubated in growth medium with inositol. Following the 4-h incubation, the subcellular localization of profilin from inositol-supplemented and inositol-starved cells was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The data shown are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Glucose Starvation on the Subcellular Localization of ProfilinTo further support the notion that PIP2 metabolism played a role in the subcellular localization of profilin, we utilized respiratory deficient cells. Talwalkar and Lester (45Talwalkar R.T. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 306: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have shown that glucose starvation of respiratory deficient cells results in a decrease in the levels of PIP and PIP2 of 3.6- and 9.5-fold, respectively. The addition of glucose to glucose-starved cells has the opposite effect (45Talwalkar R.T. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 306: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Changes in the levels of these phosphoinositides have been ascribed to fluctuations in the cellular levels of ATP and ADP(45Talwalkar R.T. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 306: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These nucleotides regulate plasma membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity needed for the synthesis of PIP and PIP2(46Buxeda R.J. Nickels Jr., J.T. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6248-6255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose-supplemented cells were grown to the exponential phase of growth. Cells were washed and incubated in fresh growth medium without glucose. Glucose starvation resulted in a time-dependent decrease in the amount of profilin bound to the membrane fraction of the cells (Fig. 10). After 20 min of glucose starvation, the percentage of profilin bound to membranes decreased from 81% to 17% (Fig. 10). When glucose was added back to glucose-starved cells, the percentage of profilin bound to membranes increased from 17% to 62% (Fig. 10). Although not shown in Fig. 10, the amount of profilin associated with the cytosolic fraction changed proportionally with the amount of profilin associated with the membranes.Figure 10:Effect of glucose starvation on the localization of profilin in respiratory deficient cells. Glucose-supplemented cells were grown to the exponential phase of growth. Cells were washed and incubated for 30 min in fresh growth medium without glucose. Following the 30-min incubation, the culture was divided and glucose was added back (indicated by the arrow) to one of the cultures. The incubation of the cultures was continued for an additional 30 min. At the indicated time intervals, samples of the cultures were taken and analyzed for the association of profilin with the membrane and cytosolic fractions of the cell as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

The initial aim of this study was to examine the subcellular localization of profilin. About 80% of the cellular profilin was localized to the plasma membrane, whereas the remainder was localized to the cytosol. That profilin could be dissociated from membranes with high ionic strength buffer indicated that profilin was a peripheral membrane protein. Pure profilin bound to salt-washed plasma membranes and to unilamellar phospholipid vesicles prepared from phospholipids extracted from plasma membranes. These results raised the suggestion that profilin's association with plasma membranes was not mediated through interaction with other peripheral membrane proteins or integral membrane proteins. Instead, profilin's peripheral associated with plasma membranes was through interaction with membrane phospholipids. This conclusion would be expected based on profilin's ability to bind PIP2 vesicles(13Haarer B.K. Petzold A.S. Brown S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7864-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PIP2 is a minor phospholipid found in S. cerevisiae that is localized to plasma membranes(15Patton J.L. Lester R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the localization of profilin to plasma membranes would also be expected. Actin was associated with profilin purified from the cytosol. This was consistent with profilin's role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (12Haarer B.K. Lillie S.H. Adams A.E.M. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Brown S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).The phospholipid requirement for profilin binding to membranes was examined with pure profilin and well defined unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. The vesicles were prepared with phospholipids found in S. cerevisiae plasma membranes. Under the conditions of our experiments, binding of profilin to these vesicles was dependent on the presence of PIP2. The dissociation constant for profilin binding to PC:PIP2 vesicles (0.13 μM) was in the range reported for profilin from higher eucaryotes(5Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 8Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Baldassare J.J. Pollard T.D. Science. 1990; 247: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In addition, profilin binding to PC:PIP2 vesicles was dependent on the surface concentration of PIP2. Thus, profilin followed surface dilution kinetics(39Deems R.A. Eaton B.R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9013-9020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a characteristic common to lipid-dependent enzymes that bind lipids at a membrane surface(38Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).The physiological relevance of the dependence of profilin binding on the surface concentration of PIP2 was addressed by two independent approaches using S. cerevisiae strains where the plasma membrane levels of PIP2 are known to fluctuate under certain growth conditions. Inositol starvation of ino1 cells (36Nickels Jr., J.T. Buxeda R.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11018-11024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Becker G.W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8684-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glucose starvation of respiratory deficient cells (45Talwalkar R.T. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 306: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were used to deplete plasma membrane levels of PIP2. After a 4-h starvation period of ino1 cells for inositol, a small but reproducible amount of profilin was found to translocate from membranes to the cytosol. Inositol starvation also causes fluctuations in the plasma membrane levels of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidate, and PIP (36Nickels Jr., J.T. Buxeda R.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11018-11024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was unlikely that the translocation of profilin was due to changes in these phospholipids. None of these phospholipids had a significant effect on binding of pure profilin to vesicles. In a more dramatic fashion, glucose starvation of respiratory deficient cells over a 20-min period caused a significant amount of profilin to translocate from membranes to the cytosol. Moreover, the addition of glucose back to glucose-starved cells caused profilin to translocate back to membranes from the cytosol. These translocations occurred too rapidly to be attributed to a genetic mechanism. Taken together, these results raised the suggestion that the plasma membrane concentration of PIP2 played a role in the regulation of profilin localization. Our studies did not rule out the possible regulation of profilin localization by other plasma membrane-associated components or other cellular factors (e.g. cytoskeleton), which could have changed in response to inositol starvation of ino1 cells or glucose starvation of respiratory deficient cells.In summary, this work addressed the fundamental question of where profilin was localized in the cell. We demonstrated that profilin was localized to the plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions and that profilin binding to the membrane was dependent on PIP2. It is known that PIP2 levels change under various growth conditions. Our studies showed that conditions which affect PIP2 metabolism played a role in profilin's localization. Future studies will be directed toward gaining insight into the role PIP2 metabolism plays in profilin function. INTRODUCTIONProfilin is a ubiquitous actin- and PIP2 1The abbreviations used are: PIP2phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphatePIPphosphatidylinositol 4-phosphatePCphosphatidylcholine. -binding protein found in eucaryotic cells(1Machesky L.M. Pollard T.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 381-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is believed that profilin assists in the regulation of the reorganization of the microfilament cytoskeleton(2Theriot J.A. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 835-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Profilin competes with other actin-binding proteins for globular actin(3Pantaloni D. Carlier M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), catalyzing the exchange of nucleotide phosphates on monomeric actin, thereby activating actin for polymerization(4Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).Profilin has also been shown to bind anionic phospholipids(5Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). However, at physiological salt concentrations, profilin binds exclusively to PIP2(6Machesky L.M. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Pollard T.D. Cell Reg. 1990; 1: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Profilin cannot bind to actin and PIP2 simultaneously(7Metzler W.J. Bell A.J. Ernst E. Lavoie T.B. Mueller L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4620-4625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as the actin- and PIP2-binding sites are sufficiently close as to impart mutually exclusive binding(7Metzler W.J. Bell A.J. Ernst E. Lavoie T.B. Mueller L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4620-4625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of profilin with PIP2 may regulate the availability of profilin for interaction with actin(5Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Another role proposed for profilin's association with PIP2 is to prevent the phospholipase Cg1-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2(8Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Baldassare J.J. Pollard T.D. Science. 1990; 247: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), and thus the generation of the second messengers inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol(9Berridge M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 907: 33-45PubMed Google Scholar). However, tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cg1 allows hydrolysis of PIP2 even in the presence of profilin(10Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Kim J.W. Machesky L.M. Rhee S.G. Pollard T.D. Science. 1991; 251: 1231-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar).We are using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model eucaryote to study profilin. The gene (PFY1) encoding for profilin has been cloned from S. cerevisiae(11Magdolen V. Oechsner U. Muller G. Bandlow W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5108-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae profilin resembles profilins from higher eucaryotes in size (~15 kDa), ability to bind actin, PIP2, and polyproline, and inhibit ATP hydrolysis by monomeric actin (11Magdolen V. Oechsner U. Muller G. Bandlow W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5108-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Haarer B.K. Lillie S.H. Adams A.E.M. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Brown S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Haarer B.K. Petzold A.S. Brown S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7864-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, profilin is required for the proper organization of the actin cytoskeleton into actin cables, which occur at regions of active growth and for proper maintenance of cell polarity(12Haarer B.K. Lillie S.H. Adams A.E.M. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Brown S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether these roles for profilin are related to its ability to bind actin and/or PIP2(13Haarer B.K. Petzold A.S. Brown S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7864-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of profilin's ability to bind polyproline is also unclear (13Haarer B.K. Petzold A.S. Brown S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7864-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The fact that binding to actin and PIP2 are mutually exclusive in profilin, and that actin is localized in the cytosol (14Kilmartin J.V. Adams E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 933Crossref Scopus (549) Google Scholar) whereas PIP2 is localized in the plasma membrane(15Patton J.L. Lester R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), raises the suggestion that profilin is localized in these two compartments of the cell. In this report we demonstrated that profilin was indeed localized to the plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions of S. cerevisiae. The majority of profilin was bound to plasma membranes. However, under growth conditions where the plasma membrane levels of PIP2 were depleted, profilin was found to translocate from the membrane to the cytosol. Profilin translocated back to the membrane fraction from the cytosol under growth conditions where plasma membrane levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were replenished. The results of our studies were consistent with the notion that the metabolism of PIP2 played a role in the localization of profilin."

First, ABP1 cannot be photolabeled in intact cells that have accumulated the auxin and photolabeling reagent 5-[7-3H]azidoindole-3-acetic acid, indicating either that auxin is excluded from the ER and is not available for photolabeling to ABP1 or that binding conditions within the ER lumen are insufficient for photolabeling. Second, at the pH of the ER lumen, auxin binding to ABP1 is not detectable. The pH estimate of the ER lumen is based on an indirect assay, which indicates that the pH is closer to pH 7 than to the binding optimum of pH 5.5. These results indicate that ABP1 does not bind auxin within the ER and point to a site of action that is post-ER. The effect of auxin on its trafficking from the ER was tested in an animal expression system. ABP1 expressed at high levels in COS7 cells is efficiently retained in the ER lumen and is not secreted even in the presence of 190 μM indole-3-acetic acid, an auxin concentration that is 40 times above the Kd for indole-3-acetic acid binding to ABP1.

Hertel et al.(1972) reported auxin-binding in microsomes isolated from corn coleoptile cells and later designated this activity Site I. Several groups (Löbler and Klämbt, 1985; Shimomura et al., 1986; Napier et al., 1988) purified the protein responsible for this Site I activity (cf. Table I in Jones(1994)), and it has been shown directly that this protein binds auxin (Jones and Venis, 1989). Several lines of evidence indicate that ABP1 1The abbreviations used are: ABP1auxin-binding protein 1ERendoplasmic reticulumFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone5-[3H]N3IAAtritiated 5-azidoindole-3-acetic acidIAAindole-3-acetic acidBMSBlack Mexican SweetDMEMDulbecco's minimal essential mediumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisNAAnaphthalene-1-acetic acidPIPES1,4-piperazinediethane sulfonic acid. in maize is an auxin receptor that acts at the plasma membrane. First, among a series of 45 auxins or similar compounds where binding affinity and growth induction was compared, there is a correlation between Kd and pC50, except with some of the substituted phenoxypropionic acids (Ray et al., 1977). A molecular model based on these data, in conjunction with data on the identification of residues in the binding site, point out that auxin binding to ABP1 involves specific molecular interactions, as expected for a receptor (Edgerton et al., 1994; Brown and Jones, 1994). Second, a synthetic peptide encoding the terminal 13 residues of ABP1 significantly modulate the ion current across the plasma membrane of Vicia faba guard cells (Thiel et al., 1993), while synthetic peptides from other regions of ABP1 do not modulate current activity. This suggests that there is a specific interaction between this domain of ABP1 and a plasma membrane component. The behavior of this ABP1 peptide mimics part of the behavior of auxin in the V. faba protoplast (Blatt and Thiel, 1994). Third, antisera directed against ABP1 blocks auxin-induced polarization of the plasma membrane on tobacco mesophyll protoplasts, indicating that ABP1 or an immunochemically similar protein mediates auxin-regulated ion movement (Barbier-Brygoo et al., 1989, 1991; Rück et al., 1993). Recently, one antibody to ABP1 also appears to block an auxin-modulated anion channel (Zimmerman et al., 1994). auxin-binding protein 1 endoplasmic reticulum carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone tritiated 5-azidoindole-3-acetic acid indole-3-acetic acid Black Mexican Sweet Dulbecco's minimal essential medium polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis naphthalene-1-acetic acid 1,4-piperazinediethane sulfonic acid. ABP1 has been shown to be located at the plasma membrane using immunocytochemisty in conjunction with electron (Jones and Herman, 1993) and silver-enhanced fluorescence (Deikmann et al., 1995) microscopies. These data taken together indicate that ABP1 binds auxins in a specific and physiological meaningful manner at the plasma membrane to bring about a rapid hormone response. An unusual feature of ABP1 is that it is localized to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Ray(1977) determined that the auxin-binding activity for ABP1 comigrates with the ER marker cytochrome c reductase during isopynic centrifugation. Subsequently, others (Shimomura et al., 1988; Jones et al., 1989; Napier et al., 1992) demonstrated that most of the microsomal pool of ABP1 comigrates with the ER marker. The localization of ABP1 to the ER is consistent with the presence of an ER-retention signal on ABP1 (Hesse et al., 1989; Inohara et al., 1989; Tillmann et al., 1989) but seems to contradict the results that support a plasma membrane site of action. Jones and Herman(1993) investigated the location of ABP1 immunocytochemically in maize cells and found that ABP1 is located in the endomembrane system but not in any other organelle. Most importantly, some ABP1 was found at the plasma membrane and within the cell wall space providing an explanation of how an ER protein such as ABP1 could potentially have a site of action at the outer face of the plasma membranes of these target cells. Recently, Deikmann et al.(1995) used silver enhancement of immunofluorescence microscopy to visualize ABP1 and found ABP1 clustered at the outer surface of the plasma membrane. An important question is where within or outside the cytoplasm does ABP1 bind auxin? The answer to this question will direct research to the cellular location of the site of action of ABP1, providing clues of its function. For example, an ER site of action suggests a molecular chaperone function, whereas a post-ER site of action suggests that ABP1 is involved in regulated secretion, e.g. of cell wall materials necessary for growth. Alternatively, others have proposed that ABP1 acts on the outer face of the plasma membrane (Barbier-Brygoo et al., 1989; Thiel et al., 1993). Another important question is if auxin causes ABP1 to translocate from the ER. It seems possible that auxin binding causes a cellular redistribution of ABP1 to its site of action, analogous to other well documented cases of ligand-regulated translocation. We formulate this testable hypothesis from observations made by Napier and Venis(1990). They showed that a monoclonal antibody (designated MAC256) detected a ligand-induced conformational change in ABP1 that was subsequently mapped to or very near the carboxyl terminus (Napier et al., 1992). A microtiter plate-based assay was developed to show ligand-dependent recognition of ABP1 by MAC256. Several auxins and structurally-similar compounds were tested for the ability to block recognition of MAC256 to ABP1, and there was a qualitative correlation between auxin activity, but not necessarily binding affinity, and inhibition of MAC256 recognition. Therefore, this raises a potential mechanism by which auxin regulates ABP1 trafficking. Specifically, auxin binds to ABP1 in the lumen of the ER and causes the KDEL retention signal to be masked, consequently allowing the passage of ABP1 to the plasma membrane, its proposed site of action. Our hypotheses are specific and make certain testable predictions. 1) The conditions for auxin binding to ABP1 in the ER lumen are adequate, if not optimal. 2) Auxin is accessible to the ER lumen and to ABP1. 3) The structural information for auxin-regulated trafficking of ABP1 resides in the ABP1 sequence itself, therefore ABP1 should show auxin-regulated trafficking in a nonplant cell. The first and second predictions are tested here by indirect measurements of the pH of and relative auxin concentration in the ER and by photolytic tagging of ER-localized ABP1 by 5-azidoindole-3-acetic acid (5-N3IAA). Because ABP1 expressed in insect cells is native and active (Macdonald et al., 1994), it should be possible to test the third prediction in a nonplant cell. COS7 cells were chosen for this because of the constituent expression of the T antigen enabling high level expression. Moreover, COS7 cells should lack any unique contribution that a plant cell may make in trafficking ABP1. Thus, the effect of auxin directly on ABP1 that causes its translocation from the ER versus some indirect effect occurring in plant cells should be revealed using these animal cells. Hybrid maize (Zea mays L. hybrid B73 X Mo17 and J7710, Jacques Seed, caryopses were grown on wetted vermiculite or cotton for 3-4 days at 27°C in darkness. The maize hybrid used to test the effect of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) was WF9 X BR38 (Custom Farm Seeds, Decatur, IL). Black Mexican Sweet (BMS) maize cells were cultured as described in Jones and Herman (1993). COS7 cells were obtained from the Lineberger Cancer Center, University of North Carolina. COS7 cells were maintained on Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4500 mg/liter L-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (DMEM-10). [3H]IAA (940 GBq/mmol) and [3H]NAA (651 GBq/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Corp., and 5-azido-[3H]IAA (740 GBq/mmol) was synthesized as described in Melhado et al. (1982). Most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The cDNA encoding full-length ABP1 was amplified from pUC800 (Tillmann et al., 1989) using primers containing BamHI restriction sites and subcloned in both directions into pGEM-ex1 (Promega). The orientation and sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. BamHI inserts were cloned into pSG5 (Stratagene), and the orientation was verified by restriction mapping. pSG5 contains the SV40 early promoter followed by a β globulin intron to elevate expression. The SV40 promoter is under the control of the T antigen, which is constitutively expressed in COS7 cells. A green monkey kidney cell line (COS7) was transfected by the DEAE-dextran method as described in Ausubel et al.(1990) with slight modification. Briefly, COS7 cells were grown to approximately 50% confluency in DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh DMEM-1 was added. Plasmid (5 μg) with DEAE-dextran (10 mg/ml) thoroughly suspended in 3 ml of DMEM-1 was added dropwise to the cells and mixed by swirling the plates. After 4 h, the DNA•DEAE-dextran was aspirated off, and the cells were shocked with 10% Me2SO in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 min. Fresh DMEM-1 was added, and the cells were grown for a maximum of 72 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. IAA was added immediately after transfection. The medium and cells were collected at different times for immunoblot analysis. Transfected cells were grown on a glass coverslip. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 1% formaldehyde in 0.1 M PIPES, 10 mM EGTA, 20 mM MgSO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.45, for 10 min. Cells were probed with rabbit anti-ABP1 serum (NC04, 1:1,000) overnight, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to rhodamine for 2 h. Washed cells were then viewed using a Nikon Optiphot with epifluoresence. Approximately 1 μCi of [3H]IAA was added to confluent COS7 cells grown either in T25 flasks (10-ml cultures) or on 12-well plates (1.6-ml cultures). After 24 h, the media were collected, and the cells were washed in an equivalent volume of DMEM and extracted twice with 0.5 ml of methanol. Radioactivity in the media and methanolic extracts was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The methanolic extract was reduced to near dryness by evaporation under streaming nitrogen and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography, silica, ethyl acetate/isopropyl alcohol/concentrated ammonia (45:35:20). Auxin binding in vivo was performed as described in Jones(1990) with the following modifications. The coleoptile was removed from the shoot with special care to avoid any leaf tissue. Coleoptiles (8 g) were cut into 0.5-cm lengths and incubated for 3 h in buffer (5 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5) and then transferred to buffer containing 5 μM 5-[3H]N3IAA in the dark for 3 h. Coleoptile tissue was rinsed with water and irradiated with UV as described in Jones(1990) except that the two UV sources were mounted closer (2 cm) to the tissue. It was not possible to determine the exact amount of energy from the UV sources mounted so closely, but it is well over 10 milliwatts/cm2. Microsomes were prepared from coleoptiles (8 g) as described in Jones et al.(1984), except that the volume of the resuspended microsomal pellet was adjusted so that it had an absorbance at 254 nm equal to that of the tissue. Microsomes were incubated in 5 μM 5-[3H]N3IAA for 30 min at 4°C and irradiated simultaneously with the tissue. ABP1 was enriched by n-butyl alcohol extraction of the microsomes followed by ion-exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Protein concentrations were determined using the method described by Bradford(1976). The auxin-binding assays using crude extracts of maize coleoptile were performed exactly as described in Jones et al.(1984). SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis was performed as described in Jones and Herman(1993). Coleoptile tips 10-15 mm in length were collected, and 1-g samples were treated in 2 ml of 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, plus the indicated radiolabeled auxin for 4 h. Similar treatments were done with BMS cultured corn cells (Jones and Herman, 1993). 0.2 g of loosely packed BMS cells washed free of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid were used per 2 ml of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-free medium plus radiolabeled auxins as indicated for 2-4 h. Samples were homogenized in binding buffer I (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 250 mM sucrose, pH 7.4) within a microcentrifuge tube fitted with a plastic pestle using and parallel samples were homogenized in binding buffer II (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 250 mM sucrose, pH 5.5). Homogenates (1 ml) of each sample plus 1 additional ml used in the wash to assure complete transfer were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant (2.5 ml), designated supernatant 8K (S8), centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 30 min to provide fractions designated supernatants 80K (S80) and the microsomes (M). Radioactivity in each sample was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The hydrated weights of microsomes were measured before resuspension in 0.1 ml of the respective buffer for measuring the radioactivities. Parallel samples without incubation in radiolabeled auxin were homogenized in both binding buffers, supplied with radiolabeled auxins. All further procedures were the same as described above. The concentrations of radioactivity is expressed as disintegrations/min/μl of supernatant or mg of microsomes. The hydrated volume of 1 mg of microsomes is assume to approximate 1 μl. We addressed whether ABP1 in the ER lumen is able to bind auxin using the experimental scheme shown in Fig. 1. Coleoptile tissue, which was incubated in buffer to remove endogenous auxin, accumulated 5-[3H]N3IAA at an external concentration of 5 μM for 3 h in darkness. It has been previously shown that under these conditions that 5-[3H]N3IAA accumulates into the tissue severalfold over the external concentration and that this compound is transported through the tissue in a polar fashion at rates the same as for IAA, the endogenous hormone (Jones, 1990; Jones et al., 1991). After incubation, the tissue was irradiated with intense UV to cross-link ABP1 with the photoaffinity auxin, 5-[3H]N3IAA. The amount of incorporation of tritium was determined and compared with the maximum amount of photolabeled ABP1 in microsomes having the same amount of UV absorbance. Background labeling occurred in both treatments nearly equally (data not shown), indicating that 5-[3H]N3IAA entered cells and that the UV irradiance was sufficient for in vivo photoactivation. Fig. 1 shows that little, if any, ABP1 was photolabeled in vivo. In contrast, isolated microsomes that have been adjusted by buffer to optimal binding conditions contain ABP1 that was efficiently photolabeled by 5-[3H]N3IAA. This indicates that 1) in vivo there is very little auxin in proximity to the major pool of ABP1 and/or 2) the conditions for auxin binding to ABP1 in the ER lumen are not optimal. It has been estimated that the pH of the ER lumen is approximately 7 (discussed below). At this pH, there is no detectable auxin binding to ABP1, as shown in Fig. 2A. We estimate using the following method that the pH of the lumen in vivo is closer to pH 7 than pH 5.5 by taking advantage of the fact that ABP1 half-life (binding activity) is pH-dependent (Shimomura et al., 1986). At pH 5.5, the half-life for auxin binding to ABP1 is considerably shorter than at pH 7, 4°C (Fig. 2) (Shimomura et al., 1986). We show the decay of ABP1 activity in vivo and compared this with the decay of pure ABP1 activity at pH 5.5 and 7.0 in solution. Shoots of maize seedlings were stored in the dark at 4°C, and the auxin binding capacity in the coleoptile was determined over 4 days. Fig. 2 illustrates that the auxin binding activity of ABP1 is unchanged over time during storage. Highly pure ABP1 (shown in Fig. 2B) was stored at pH 5.5 or 7.0 and measured for auxin binding over time. The auxin-binding activity of pure ABP1 stored at pH 7 (4°C) was stable, whereas ABP1 stored at pH 5.5 decayed rapidly (Fig. 2C). Considering the stability of ABP1 in vivo and the cellular localization of ABP1, we conclude that the pH value of the ER lumen is near neutrality. Based on the estimated neutral pH in the ER and the narrow optimum of pH 5.5 for auxin binding to ABP1, we reasoned that the occupancy by auxin of ABP1 in the ER should be low. We therefore attempted to determine if a plant cell compensates for the effect of neutral pH by a mechanism to make the amount of auxin well in excess over ABP1 in the ER lumen. Conceptually, this is the mechanism for driving occupancy of the acetylcholine receptor by acetylcholine, where a low affinity binding is compensated by a ligand concentration well in excess of the receptor concentration. Excised maize coleoptiles and BMS maize cells were incubated with [3H]IAA or [3H]NAA for 4 h in phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and then after homogenization either with pH 5.5 or pH 7.0 buffers, and the amount of radioactivity in the supernatant and the microsome was determined for each (Fig. 3). In addition, an experiment was performed where the radiotracer was added during homogenization of the tissue. The pH of the buffer had no effect on the distribution of auxin between the supernatant and the microsomes. Also, the same distribution of auxin was obtained when the radiotracer was added during grinding. These data suggest that auxin is in equilibrium between the cytosol and the ER lumen, that there is no facilitated uptake, and that the concentration of auxin in the cytosol is similar to the concentration within the ER lumen. We also determined that there is no significant pH gradient across the isolated microsomal membrane. Auxin binding in microsomes was measured in the presence and absence of the protonophore, FCCP. Fig. 4 shows that the total amount of auxin binding and auxin-binding affinity is not affected by FCCP, although the background level of binding is 10% higher in the control samples. An ABP1 cDNA under the control of the SV40 early promoter was used to transfect COS7 cells using the DEAE-dextran method for transient expression (Ausubel et al., 1990). The level of expression was followed for 2 days by immunoblot analysis and is shown in Fig. 5. Adding auxin at a high concentration in these cells had no effect on the expression level of ABP1 (Fig. 5) or on the growth rate and cell morphology (data not shown). The highest level of expression occurred by 36 h and decreased as the cells became over-confluent. As seen in Fig. 6, most of the expressed ABP1 had an identical subunit molecular mass as maize ABP1, suggesting that ABP1 is correctly processed in COS7 cells. The small amount of a 24-kDa protein is also observed in Fig. 6 and may be due to partial glycolytic processing of ABP1.Figure 6:ABP1 is expressed at high levels in COS7 cells and is not detectably secreted. COS7 cells were transfected with pHTa as described under “Materials and Methods” and plated in the presence (+) or absence(-) of 190 μM IAA and grown for 48 h, at which time the cells and media where collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis (top panel). An amount equivalent to 2% of cells or media was loaded per lane. Blots were probed with antiABP serum (NC04, 1:10,000). Purified maize ABP1 was loaded so that the signal was approximately 1% of the signal for ABP1 in COS7 cells. Cells were also fixed and probed with antiABP1 serum (NC04, 1:1,000; middle panel) or the preimune serum (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ABP1 was not detected in the medium (Fig. 6). The addition of 190 μM IAA, added either once after transfection or twice over the time course of the experiment, did not induce ABP1 secretion. The ABP1 standard shown in Fig. 6 represents a signal that is less than 1% of the signal shown for ABP1 present in COS7 cell extracts. Since the same portion of cell extract is compared with medium, this indicates that the steady state amount of ABP1 in the medium over 2 days is well below 1% of the total cellular ABP1 population. The distribution of ABP1 in COS7 cells was examined by immunofluorescent microscopy. ABP1 staining distributed in a typical ER pattern (Fig. 6). Staining of the periphery of the nuclear envelope in addition to punctate and elongated structures suggests ABP1 localization in cisternal and tubular ER and possibly cis Golgi. The preimmune controls (Fig. 6) indicate that the fluorescent signal is solely due to ABP1. IAA was shown to enter COS cells by growing cells in the presence of [3H]IAA and quantitating the uptake of IAA into cells by liquid scintillation. Using packed cell volume, the internal IAA concentration (400,000 dpm/ml) was calculated and found to be approximately equal to the external IAA concentration (335,000 dpm/ml), indicating that IAA is not excluded from COS7 cells. IAA is stable in COS7 cells. The stability of IAA was demonstrated by adding [3H]IAA to confluent cultures and after 24-h methanol extracts of the cells were examined by thin-layer chrmatography as shown in Fig. 7. IAA extracted from COS7 cells had the same radiopurity as authentic [3H]IAA. The lack of ABP1 in the medium (Fig. 6) suggests the following three possibilities. 1) COS7 cells efficiently retain ABP1 even in the presence of auxin. 2) ABP1 is secreted but rapidly degraded outside the cells, or 3) ABP1 is secreted but rapidly taken up. To distinguish between these possibilities, ABP1 purified from maize seedlings was added to confluent cultures of COS7 cells to determine its stability. This stage of cell growth was chosen because it is the time at which there is maximum expression of ABP1 in transfected COS7 cells (Fig. 5) and the most likely time when extracellular proteolysis might occur. The medium was examined for the amount of ABP1 at several times and compared with ABP1 incubated in DMEM-10 alone (no cell controls) at each time point. Fig. 8 illustrates that ABP1 is stable in COS7 medium and that the addition of IAA does not affect this stability. Since the added ABP1 is stable in the presence of COS7 cells (Fig. 8) and the transiently expressed ABP1 is not detectable in the medium (Fig. 6), we conclude that ABP1 is not secreted in COS7 cells. This work addresses the question of whether ABP1 binds auxin in the ER, and whether this binding causes a redistribution of ABP1 from the ER to post-ER compartments. These ideas have been topics of speculation since auxin binding (Site I) was discovered within the ER (Hertel et al., 1972; Ray et al., 1977). For example, “the bucket brigade” model was put forth by Ray(1977) to explain a possible mode of auxin-induced proton excretion. In this model, auxin binds to its receptor in the ER and somehow cause an increase in the exocytosis of acidic vesicles carrying cell wall materials. Cross(1991) has proposed that ABP1 cycles between the ER and the plasma membrane and that elevated auxin accelerates this cycling. In both models, it is proposed that the response of auxin binding to its receptor in the ER stimulates exocytosis of materials/enzymes used to expand the cell walls. Auxin binding to ABP1 in the ER requires that auxin be present in this compartment and that the binding conditions are near optimal. Specifically, because auxin binding is strictly dependent on pH, an ER pH near 5.5 is one requirement for 100% occupancy. Contrary to this, indirect evidence, which is discussed below, support a neutral pH, yet, at this pH, auxin binding to ABP1 does not occur or does so below detection. An argument dealing with this dilemma (Shimomura et al., 1986) has been that the compromise between a low pH for binding optimum, and a neutral pH/oxidative redox state for proper folding (Hwang et al., 1992) has evolved as a part of ABP1 mode of action. A counter argument is simply that ABP1 does not bind auxin in the ER lumen but rather in a post-ER compartment where the pH is at or closer to the optimum for binding. As discussed, patch clamp experiments reveal control of ion channels by ABP1 on the outer face of the plasma membrane (summarized in Goldsmith(1993)). Because the plasma membrane/cell wall space has a pH of 5.5-6.0 (Cleland, 1976; Hoffman et al., 1992; Jacobs and Ray, 1976), this proposed site of auxin perception by ABP1 remains plausible. There is no method currently available to directly measure ER lumenal pH; however, based on indirect measurements and predictions about the ER microenvironment based upon the characteristics of several ER proteins, it is generally accepted that the ER pH is approximately 7. A neutral pH value has been the basis for the structure of some ER proteins and mechanisms of their function (e.g. Wilson et al., 1993; Yoo and Lewis, 1992). The evidence for the ER pH is based on a variety of approaches. For example, 2,4-(dinitroanilino)-3′-amino-N-methylodipropylamine accumulates into acidic compartments but was not found in the ER lumen, suggesting that there is not a pH gradient between the ER and cytosol (Anderson and Pathak, 1985). Acidification of the ER to pH 5.8 disrupts the trafficking of secreted proteins such as lysozyme (Pilarsky and Koch-Brandt, 1992), which is consistent with the recent observation that inhibition of a H+-ATPase disrupts protein trafficking in the post-ER compartments but not ER to Golgi movement (Yilla et al., 1993). The pH dependence for activity of several ER proteins has also indicated a neutral or near neutral ER lumenal pH. For example, the ER isoform of ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase of castor bean endosperm has an optimum pH for activity between 6.5 and 8 (Wang and Moore, 1991). Bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, an ER protein, has a pH optimum that is above 6.4 and has no activity at pH 6.0 (Ritter et al., 1993). Our estimate of ER pH is consistent with the above results, suggesting that the ER lumenal pH is near neutral. This finding suggests that the ER lumen is not the site of perception for auxin by ABP1. Alternative interpretations require assuming that ABP1 somehow remains stable in an acidic subcompartment of the ER. Therefore, it is more likely that post-ER compartments such as the trans Golgi or the outer surface of the plasma membrane, which have a pH that is optimal for auxin binding, is the site of auxin perception by ABP1. The short half-life of ABP1 expected for these cellular locations is consistent with a regulatory role for ABP1. If active receptor accumulates at the plasma membrane, the amount of auxin to obtain half-maximal occupancy becomes unreasonably high (Cheng and Prusoff, 1973). Furthermore, if the response of auxin at the plasma membrane (Thiel et al., 1993) is not first order with respect to bound receptor complex but rather limited by a second effector as has been proposed (Klämbt, 1990; Barbier-Brygoo et al., 1991), then it is necessary that the amount of active receptor be kept low. A short half-life for ABP1 at its site of action based on its instability at acidic pH may provide such a mechanism to prevent accumulation of active receptor. In a variety of cases, ligand binding to its receptor causes a redistribution of the complex receptor or binding protein (Picard and Yamamoto, 1987; Ronne et al., 1983; Shreck et al., 1991). The hypothesis that auxin binding causes a translocation of ABP1 from the ER to its post-ER site of action is attractive because it provides an immediate function of auxin and explains how a receptor carrying an ER retention signal could have an extracytoplasmic site of action. If this hypothesis is true, then the data from Napier and Venis(1990) based on purified ABP1 would suggest that the information for auxin-regulated redistribution resides within the structure of ABP1. This suggestion prompted us to test the hypothesis that auxin causes ABP1 translocation in a heterologous system where specific and unique plant trafficking components would be absent. An observed effect of auxin on ABP1 secretion would support this hypothesis; however, our results show that the expressed ABP1 remains within the ER of the COS7 cells even in the presence of auxin at a concentration 50 times above the Kd for auxin binding to ABP1. This work also indicates that the lower efficiency for ABP1 retention in plant cells relative to immunoglobulin binding protein and protein disulfide isomerase (Jones and Herman, 1993) may be due to a special component of the plant cell and not due to poor presentation of the KDEL sequence at the carboxyl terminus of ABP1 since ABP1 is efficiently retained in a nonplant cell. While the above interpretation of our data is the simplest, we do not exclude other interpretations. For example, translocation of ABP1 to the cell surface is impaired at a certain step in COS7 cells due to an incompatibility of the cellular translocation systems between plant and animal cells. There may be multiple retention mechanisms in animal cells that preclude auxin-regulated translocation of ABP1, whereas this multiplicity may be absent in plant cells. While the concept of multiple retention mechanisms has been proposed, such as the “first line of defense” hypothesis of Rothman and Orci(1992), there is yet no evidence that retention of ER proteins in plant cells is substantially different than in animal cells. The mechanism by which a small percentage of the ABP1 population is found at the plasma membrane and in the cell wall space is not known (Jones and Herman, 1992; Deikmann et al., 1995). This small amount of extracytoplasmic ABP1 may be solely the result of an inefficient retention mechanism for ABP1 in plant but not animal cells. This unique property of ABP1 may have coevolved with (or selected for) the mechanism of ABP1 action at the plasma membrane. Alternatively, there may be a specific mechanism regulating ABP1 movement differently than other KDEL sequences in plant cells. To different degrees, all ER/Golgi proteins are expected to be found on the plasma membrane since retention and targeting is not 100% efficient, and in some cases small amounts of these proteins also have specific functions on the plasma membrane. For example, 5-10% of the mannose-phosphate receptor, a protein whose role in prelysozomes has clearly been established, is found on the plasma membrane where it serves to anchor acid hydrolases (Kornfeld, 1992). An ER protein having a specific function in a post-ER compartment is not unique to ABP1. Animals cells have a soluble (39-44 kDa) protein containing an ER retention signal that interacts with three members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family (VLDP, gp330, and LRP receptors), which are located on the plasma membrane (Battey et al., 1994; Kounnas et al., 1992a, 1992b; Orlando et al., 1992; Strickland et al., 1991). This protein, designated RAP for receptor-associated protein, is found predominantly in the ER (Abbate et al., 1993), but small amounts have been localized to the plasma membrane using radioidionation to tag cell surface proteins (Strickland et al., 1991) and by immunoelectron microscopy (Pietromonaco et al., 1990; Abbate et al., 1993). Interaction of RAP with very low density lipoprotein, gp330, or LRP receptors inhibits uptake by these membrane receptors of serum ligands such as specific lipoproteins, proteases, protease/inhibitor complexes (Strickland et al., 1994), and also the Pseudomonas exotoxin (Kounnas et al., 1992b), which itself contains an ER retention signal (Chaudhary et al., 1990). Little is known about how RAP translocates to the plasma membrane or its potential regulatory role at the plasma membrane. By excluding the endoplasmic reticulum, these results narrow the cellular site of perception of auxin by ABP1. While current data are consistent with the view that ABP1 has a site of action at the plasma membrane (Goldsmith, 1993), these or previously published data do not exclude an intracellular post-ER site of action. Nor do they exclude a function within the ER that does not require auxin binding.

NK cells are CD3- large granular lymphocytes and can be functionally defined as cells that mediate non-histocompatibility-restricted killing of some target cells. These lymphocytes are spontaneously cytotoxic against some tumors and virally infected cells via nonspecific mechanisms.

Although there has been extensive characterization of many features of NK cells, the NK cell receptors and their ligands on the target cell surface have remained elusive for a long time. Thus, the sensitivity of target cells has been considered alternatively as being due to the expression of immature structures and viral antigens (2Arora D.J.S. House M. Justewicz D.M. Mandeville R. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 839-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or to an increased expression on the cell surface of normal glycoproteins such as transferrin receptor (CD71) and CD32 antigen(3Alarcon B.

Conversely, it has been shown that a high level of cell membrane sialylation decreases the sensitivity of target cells(6Yogeeswaran G. Grönberg A. Hansson M. Dalianis T. Kiessling R. Welsh R.M. Int.

More recently, it has been demonstrated that the expression of MHC class I molecules protects tumor cells (predominantly those of lymphoid origin) against NK cell attack(11Storkus W.J. Howell D.N. Salter R.D. Dawson J.R. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1657-1659PubMed Google Scholar, 12Quillet A. Presse F. Marchiol-Fournigault C. Harel-Bellan A. Benbunan M. Ploegh H. Fradelizi D. J.

Moreover, inhibitory receptors for NK cell activation have been identified, and they bind MHC class I molecules(14Moretta L. Ciccone E. Moretta A. Höglund C. Öhlén P. Kärre K. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 300-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15Kärre K. Science. 1995; 267: 978-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finally, in the past year, a natural killer cell receptor proved to be specific for ubiquitous oligosaccharides and triggers the NK cell cytolytic mechanism(16Bezouska K. Yuen C.-T. O'Brien J.

In conclusion, the target molecules involved in recognition of target cells by NK cells may contain peptidic or carbohydrate residues that can activate or inhibit the NK cell-mediated killing(17Mc Coy Jr., J.P. Chambers W.H. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition to specific NK ligand(s), cell adhesion molecules (such as CD54, CD58, CD56, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, and CD2) are also involved in cellular cytotoxic mechanisms(18Quillet-Mary A. Cavarec L. Kermarrec N. Marchiol-Fournigault C. Gil M.L. Conjeaud H. Fradelizi D. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 47: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Patarroyo M. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1991; 60: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, these accessory molecules do not appear to represent NK ligands by themselves, but rather as strengthening target cell-effector cell conjugates after the initial cognate interaction between the target cell and the NK cell(19Patarroyo M. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1991; 60: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been established that resistance of K562 cells to NK cells can be correlated with an increase of glycophorin A on the cell surface(20Benoist H. Madulet C. Trentesaux C. Carpentier Y. Joly P. Jardillier J.C. Desplaces A. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 42: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21Benoist H. Joly P. Broglio C. Jeannesson P. Idoine O. Dufer J. Desplaces A. Immunol. Lett. 1992; 34: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, it has never been suggested that this glycoprotein was capable of protecting tumor cells against lysis by NK cells. The insertion of this molecule into the membrane of cells sensitive to NK cell attack gives a direct measure of its involvement in NK cell-mediated lysis. In addition, the abundant glycosylation of this molecule allows us to use an experimental approach to determine the role of the glycoprotein sugars in the mechanism of resistance to NK cell-mediated lysis. In this report, glycophorin A was inserted into the K562 cell membrane. This was achieved by electroinsertion, which has recently been used to insert proteins with a membrane spanning sequence into mouse red blood cell membranes (22Zeira M. Tosi P.F. Mouneimne Y. Lazarte J. Sneed L. Volsky D.J. Nicolau C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and into nuclear cells(23El Ouagari K. Gabriel B. Benoist H.

Biochem. 1994; 219: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that such modified cells are resistant to NK cell-mediated lysis. The carbohydrate nature of the molecular entity that is involved in this modulation has also been determined. K562 cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The culture medium was Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM 0111, Eurobio, Paris) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and L-glutamine (0.58 mg/ml). The cell density was maintained between 2 × 105 and 1.6 × 106 cells/ml. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal human volunteers were isolated on Ficoll-Hypaque (MSL, Eurobio). Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were obtained after peripheral blood mononuclear cell depletion of adherent cells by 1 h of incubation at 37°C in plastic Petri dishes. The pulsing buffer contained 125 mM sucrose, 69 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Its low ionic content reduced the joule heating associated with the electric field pulse. The washing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) contained 42 mM K2HPO4, 8.3 mM NaH2PO4/H2O, and 125 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. All chemicals were from Sigma. Glycophorin A type MN (GPA) and asialoglycophorin were obtained from Sigma. Electroinsertion was carried out as described previously for Chinese hamster ovary cells (24El Ouagari K. Benoist H. Sixou S. Teissié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using a CNRS electropulser (Jouan, St. Herblain, France) able to deliver square wave pulses, the parameters of which (voltage, pulse duration, and number and frequency of pulses) can all be adjusted separately. The pulses were monitored using a 15-MHz oscilloscope (Enertec, St. Etienne, France). Electrodes were parallel and flat with an anode-cathode distance of 1.5 mm. Since electroinsertion is a back-effect of electropermeabilization(24El Ouagari K. Benoist H. Sixou S. Teissié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), various values of field intensity and pulse number and duration were applied to K562 cells to obtain both maximum viability and membrane permeabilization. Optimal conditions were one square wave pulse of 7-ms duration at 0.6 kV/cm. Consequently, electroinsertion was performed using K562 cells (107), which were incubated at 37°C for 15 min with glycophorin A or asialoglycophorin in a total volume of 18 μl and then submitted to a permeabilization pulse. After pulse application, the cells were washed three times in PBS (400 × g for 4 min at room temperature) and analyzed by immunofluorescence. A control sample was subjected to all these steps, except that no pulse was applied. Cell viability was checked by using the trypan blue exclusion test after pulsing (always >95%) and by observing cell growth and cell viability 24 h (always >98%) after pulsing. GPA, asialoglycophorin, transferrin receptor (CD71), CD15 antigen, MHC class I antigen, and cellular adhesion molecules were detected by an indirect staining method using, respectively, an anti-GPA mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) that also stains the asialoglycophorin and that binds to amino acids 27-39 of GPA (Immunotech, France), anti-CD71 mAb and anti-CD15 mAb (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), anti-MHC class I W6/32 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), and anti-adhesion molecules, anti-CD54 mAb, anti-CD58 mAb, anti-CD29 mAb, anti-CD18 mAb, and anti-CD56 mAb (Immunotech, Marseille, France). Purified mouse IgG was used as a control reagent. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled (F(ab′)2) goat antibodies against mouse immunoglobulins were used as a second-step reagent for indirect staining. The cells were then washed in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (Fac Scan, Becton Dickinson). Two parameters were used: the percentage of fluorescent cells after autofluorescence background subtraction and the mean of fluorescence intensity of positive cells expressed in arbitrary units. After fluorescence intensity calibration of the cytofluorometer using quantitative fluorescent microbead standards, we used Simply Cellular™ microbeads (Becton Dickinson) to quantify the inserted glycophorin. These microbeads may be considered as “model lymphocytes” since they are approximately the size of lymphocytes. They bind mouse monoclonal antibodies (such as goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies) that are covalently bound to the microbead surface. The beads were calibrated in terms of the number of monoclonal mouse IgG molecules they bind, allowing determination of the effective fluorescence/protein ratio. We applied the same method of antibody labeling to these microbeads as the one used for cells. Glycophorin A is composed of 60% carbohydrate by weight, with most of the sugars being 15 O-linked tetrasaccharides that are attached to serine or threonine and that have the structure shown in Fig. Z1(25Dill K. Hu S. Berman E. Pavia A.A. Lacombe J.M. J. Protein Chem. 1990; 9: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A single complex N-linked oligosaccharide is also present. Its structure is as shown in Fig. Z2.Figure Z2:Structure 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) O-Glycanase (TEBU, Le Perray, France) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the Gal-GalNAc disaccharide core attached to serine or threonine residues of asialoglycoproteins. In this experiment, we used asialoglycophorin since sialic acid was observed to inhibit the enzyme activity(26Umemoto J. Bhavanadan V.P. Davidson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8609-8614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (3 × 106) were mixed with 25 milliunits/ml O-glycanase. The mixture was then incubated for 12 h at 37°C. Endoglycosidase F (Sigma, St. Quentin, France) cleaves the link between the two N-acetylglucosamine residues linking the glycan moiety to the asparagine of the protein backbone(27Elder J.H. Alexandre S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4540-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Cells (3 × 106) were mixed with 60 milliunits/ml of enzyme. Incubation was then conducted at 37°C for 12 h. These conditions were chosen to reach complete deglycosylation of susceptible asparagine-, serine-, or threonine-linked oligosaccharides. After enzyme treatment, the cells were washed, checked for staining with fluorescent lectins, and used in the cytotoxicity assay. From knowledge of GPA oligosaccharide structures, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated lectins (Dolichos biflorus or Lens culinaris (Sigma)) were used to evaluate glycosylation patterns in control and endoglycosidase-treated cells. To evaluate the efficiency of endoglycosidase F treatment, K562 cells were incubated for 15 min with L. culinaris lectin (25 μg/ml), which is known to react specifically with α-D-mannose. The cells were then washed in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. In the case of O-glycosylation, K562 cells were incubated for 15 min with D. biflorus lectin (50 μg/ml), which is known to react specifically with α-D-GalNAc. The cells were then washed in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. These conditions were chosen (after testing various lectin concentrations) to demonstrate almost complete staining (>95% of positive cells) of K562 cells. The NK cell activity of PBL from healthy donors was tested in a standard 4-h 51Cr release assay against target cells labeled with 51Cr as described previously(20Benoist H. Madulet C. Trentesaux C. Carpentier Y. Joly P. Jardillier J.C. Desplaces A. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 42: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, various numbers of PBL (effector cells) were mixed in triplicate with 104 labeled target cells in microtiter plates. After 4 h at 37°C, 100 μl of the supernatants were counted in a g-counter. The percentage of cell-mediated lysis was calculated as follows: % cell-mediated lysis = ((cpmexp - cpmspont)/(cpmmax - cpmspont)) × 100. cpmmax was determined by counting an aliquot of labeled target cells, and cpmspont (spontaneous release) by counting the supernatant from wells without effectors. Cytotoxicity calculated from individual effector cell/target cell curves is expressed as lytic units (LU25)/106 effector cells. One LU25 is defined as the number of lymphoid cells required to lyse 25% of 104 target cells under the assay conditions used. PBL were depleted of CD3+ cells by using anti-CD3 reactive magnetic microbeads (Immunotech). The percentage of effectors conjugated to target cells was determined using the procedure of Grimm and Bonavida (28Grimm E. Bonavida B. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 2861-2869PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl (106/ml) of cells from suspension of the effector and target cell populations in culture medium + 10% fetal calf serum were mixed in centrifuge tubes. The tubes were placed in a water bath for 5 min at 30°C. The cells were then centrifuged for 5 min at 400 × g at room temperature to promote conjugate formation. Then the pellet was resuspended 10 times with a micropipette. A small drop of this suspension was removed, and the percentage of the conjugates was determined in a hemocytometer. When K562 control cells were examined with our anti-GPA mAb, ~10% of the cells were weakly positive (~1000 molecules of GPA/cell). Electroinsertion of GPA into the plasma membrane was mediated by submitting a GPA/K562 cell mixture to an electric field pulse (one pulse of 7-ms duration at 0.6 kV/cm). Electrical field application allowed us to insert the GPA, detected by anti-GPA monoclonal antibody, on >90% of the K562 cells. However, a relatively large percentage (44 ± 5% for 89 μM GPA; n = 3) of fluorescent cells was detected even in the absence of electric field and for weak field intensities. In this cell population, the number of stained GPA molecules was always ~104/cell. With an electrical pulse, the number of detectable glycophorin molecules/fluorescent cell rose with the increase in glycophorin concentration in medium to reach ~6 × 104 molecules in the cell membrane when there was 89 μM GPA in the pulsing medium (Fig. 1A). We previously demonstrated using Chinese hamster ovary cells that electropermeabilization mediates a stable insertion of GPA into the cell membrane(24El Ouagari K. Benoist H. Sixou S. Teissié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To determine the stability of the interaction between GPA and pulsed or non-pulsed K562 cells, the GPA molecules were stained by mAb at 0, 24, and 48 h after pulsing. The percentage of fluorescent cells strongly decreased when the cells were not electropulsed and cultured for 24 and 48 h (27 ± 4 and 6 ± 1%, respectively, versus 41 ± 5% at 0 h), whereas it was stable at 24 and 48 h after electroinsertion (83 ± 6 and 79 ± 6%, respectively, versus 89 ± 5% directly after the pulse). In addition, the number of bound GPA molecules/cell decreased from 12,000 to 2500 after 1 day of non-pulsed cell culture and only decreased by a 2-fold factor every 24 h after electropulsation. Since the growth rate of K562 cells is one doubling/24 h, the above results indicate that (i) the GPA molecules bound to the cell membrane (termed electroinserted GPA) were shared between the daughter cells (Fig. 1B) and (ii) the GPA-cell membrane interaction is stable after pulsing. Consequently, the nature of the interaction with the membrane of electropulsed cells is likely to be different from that of the control cell membrane. Fig. 2(A1 and A2) shows a representative experiment of the effect of glycophorin insertion on susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis. The sensitivity of K562 cells to NK cell attack increased when the cells were pulsed without GPA (Fig. 2A1), whereas the presence of ~104 GPA molecules at the surface of 40% of the non-electropulsed cells did not alter susceptibility to lysis. Considering that the electropulsed cells were the effective target control, glycophorin had an inhibiting effect at all concentrations tested, and the resistance to NK cell lysis increased with the number of glycophorin molecules on the cell surface (Fig. 2A2). NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, calculated from individual effector cell/target cell curves, was cumulated and expressed as lytic units (LU25) (Fig. 2B). The sensitivity of the K562 cells with electroassociated GPA (termed GPA+ cells) was reduced by a factor of ~2 as compared with the electropulsed K562 cells in the absence of GPA (P-K562; p < 0.001) and with the non-pulsed K562 cells with or without GPA in the pulsing medium (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 2B). In addition, no effect was observed when GPA was directly added at different concentrations (from 8.9 to 89 μM) to the NK cell cytotoxicity assay (data not shown). The spontaneous lysis of target cells induced by natural killer cell activity is accomplished in two main distinguishable steps: binding between target and effector cells and post-binding events leading to target cell destruction. To examine the possibility that the decreased lysis was due to a defect in the first step of binding, direct conjugate-forming cell assays were performed after CD3+ cell depletion from PBL suspensions. Table 1 illustrates that the GPA+ K562 cells were as efficient in binding NK cells as the control samples.TABLE I Open table in a new tab To determine whether electroinsertion of GPA into K562 cell membranes triggers a modulation of the expression of negative or positive signals for NK cells, CD71, CD15, and MHC class I antigens and certain adhesion molecules were stained by specific mAbs. No significant difference was observed between GPA+ cells and the control samples (Table 2). Similar results were obtained when the cell positivity to mAbs was expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (data not shown). These results indicate that the resistance to NK cell attack induced by glycophorin insertion into the membrane depends neither on the triggering of MHC class I antigen expression nor on the modulation of the expression of other molecules. In addition, they demonstrate that insertion of GPA in the cell membrane does not interfere with accessibility of mAbs to natural epitopes of the cell surface.TABLE II Open table in a new tab It has been reported that cell-surface sialic acid may contribute to the development of NK cell resistance directly or by masking the target structure(s) to NK cells(6Yogeeswaran G. Grönberg A. Hansson M. Dalianis T. Kiessling R. Welsh R.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1981; 28: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Werkmeister J.A. Pross H.F. Roder J.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1983; 32: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As GPA is a highly sialylated protein, we tested the hypothesis that the resistance induced by GPA insertion could be correlated to a simple contribution from the sialic acid. Asialoglycophorin was electroinserted into K562 cells. Fig. 3 shows that the same number of asialoglycophorin and GPA molecules induced the same resistance of target cells to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. We were also interested in determining whether changes, other than sialic acid, in glycosylation of the inserted glycophorin would alter the resistance of GPA+ cells to NK cell-mediated lysis. After GPA electroinsertion into the cell membrane, N- and O-glycosylation were eliminated by enzymatic treatment as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” A comparative study of lectin binding to enzyme-treated and -untreated K562 cells (GPA+ and K562) revealed a significant reduction of binding after treatment of GPA+ cells, suggesting a decrease of N-linked (Fig. 4A) or O-linked (Fig. 4B) oligosaccharides, whereas the enzyme treatment did not affect the glycosylation of control cells. The effect of enzyme treatments on the susceptibility of K562 cells to NK cell-mediated lysis was then determined while fluorescein-labeled lectins were used in parallel to control deglycosylation on the target cells. K562 cells treated with endoglycosidase F or O-glycanase were as sensitive to NK cell lysis as the control samples. GPA+ cells treated with the O-glycanase enzyme were lysed at the same level as the untreated GPA+ cells (Fig. 5A), whereas the elimination of N-linked oligosaccharides led to the restoration of the K562 cell sensitivity to NK cell attack (Fig. 5B).Figure 5:Effect of glycosidases on K562 cell sensitivity to NK cell-mediated lysis. K562 cells (107) were subjected to electropulsation (one pulse of 7-ms duration at 0.6 kV/cm) in the presence (89 μM) (▵ and ▲) or absence (•) of GPA or were incubated without pulsing in pulsing buffer (○ and □). K562 cells (□) and K562 cells with electroinserted GPA (▵) were treated with O-glycanase (5.4 × 104 GPA molecules/cell) (A) or endoglycosidase F (5.9 × 104 GPA molecules/cell) (B). Samples were then tested in the 51Cr cytotoxicity assay. A and B are results (S.D. < 10% of the mean of triplicates) from two separate experiments performed with effector cells from two different donors. Each is representative of three separate experiments using PBL from different donors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this report, we have shown the direct involvement of glycophorin A in the NK cell-mediated lysis mechanism by electroinserting this molecule into the K562 cell membrane. In our system, ~6 × 104 GPA molecules/cell were correctly oriented so as to be detected by an anti-GPA monoclonal antibody that reacts with an extracellular epitope of GPA. As previously demonstrated with Chinese hamster ovary cells(23El Ouagari K. Gabriel B. Benoist H. Teissié J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24El Ouagari K. Benoist H. Sixou S. Teissié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the inserted protein was stable in the membrane, was transferred from mother to daughter cells, and was able to diffuse freely across the surface of the cell membrane (data not shown). On the non-electropulsed cell membrane, it is likely that the GPA molecule was only adsorbed, as previously reported(24El Ouagari K. Benoist H. Sixou S. Teissié J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). On these control cells, the presence of ~104 GPA molecules did not induce resistance to lysis, suggesting that the putative inhibitive structure is not efficiently presented to NK cells when GPA was only adsorbed on the target cell surface. Our present data show that the resistance to natural killer cells correlates with the increase in the number of GPA molecules on the K562 cell membrane. A significant resistance to NK cell attack was observed with ~3 × 104 electroinserted molecules/cell (i.e. 1 GPA molecule/2 × 104 nm2 of cell surface or 1 GPA molecule/2 × 104 phospholipids). Consequently, the resistance to NK cell-mediated lysis can be effective when the GPA number is higher than a threshold value of between 104 and 3 × 104 molecules. On the other hand, the target resistance induced by electroinserted GPA may be attributed, at least partly, to the stabilization of the membrane. Indeed, a GPA molecule incorporated into experimental bilayers interacts with ~500-1000 phospholipids(29Dluhy R.A. Mendelsohn R. Casal H.L. Mantsch H.H. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Kapitza H.G. Rüppel D.A. Galla H.G. Sackmann E. Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which could alter the membrane stability. However, this possibility seems somewhat unlikely since (i) the interaction between GPA and phospholipids would involve only 5-10% of the membrane phospholipids; (ii) GPA electroinserted into Chinese hamster ovary cell membrane showed a free lateral diffusion with a diffusion coefficient in agreement with what would be expected for an intrinsic protein embedded in a viable cell membrane(23El Ouagari K. Gabriel B. Benoist H. Teissié J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); and (iii) removal of N-linked oligosaccharide moieties suppresses the resistance. This relationship between the resistance to NK cell-mediated lysis and the inserted glycophorin A level is in accordance with previous results that showed a reduced sensitivity to NK cell lysis of (i) K562 cells differentiated in vitro by drugs that increased the levels of GPA on the cell surface (10Werkmeister J.A. Pross H.F. Roder J.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1983; 32: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Benoist H. Joly P. Broglio C. Jeannesson P. Idoine O. Dufer J. Desplaces A. Immunol. Lett. 1992; 34: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and (ii) a K562 cell clone expressing a very high number of GPA molecules (21Benoist H. Joly P. Broglio C. Jeannesson P. Idoine O. Dufer J. Desplaces A. Immunol. Lett. 1992; 34: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It is important to stress that the presence of ~6 × 104 glycophorin molecules on the cell surface does not confer total resistance to NK cell lysis. This can be explained by the intervention of several NK cell subsets using different mechanisms to lyse K562 cells in chromium assay or by the choice of each effector cell between different recognition strategies. Moreover, the resistance to NK cells might only be partial because GPA+ cells maintain malignant features, i.e. positive signals for NK cells such as the absence of MHC class I antigens and/or the presence of ligands able to activate NK cells such as CD71 and CD15 antigens or some carbohydrate determinants (3Alarcon B. Fresno M. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 1286-1291PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lazarus A.H. Baines M.G. Cell. Immunol. 1985; 96: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 5Perl A. Looney R.J. Ryan D.H.

Pospisil M. Feizi T. Nature. 1995; 372: 150-151Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In our system, the protective effect of GPA might be due to masking (i) of cellular adhesion molecules involved in NK cell mechanisms and/or (ii) of putative epitopes able to deliver an activating signal to NK cells. Both explanations are unlikely because we demonstrated that GPA electroinsertion did not alter the accessibility of cell adhesion molecules (CD18, CD29, CD54, CD56, and CD58), CD71, and CD15 by mAbs. In addition, no consistent reduction of target cell binding to NK cells was recorded in the experiments using GPA+ cells. However, it is well known that conjugate formation measures integrin binding and represents an early stage of binding that is followed by a cellular reorientation and firm adhesion that probably uses other molecules. Consequently, GPA might modulate a limiting step at the level of the membrane molecular interactions involved in post-conjugating mechanisms, such as in the stabilization of binding and/or in the lethal hit (e.g. it is quite possible that GPA blocks perforin adherence). GPA is a sialoglycoprotein made up of 131 amino acid residues with no disulfide bonds and is composed of 60% carbohydrate by weight. The sugar chains contain ~45% sialic acid by weight(25Dill K. Hu S. Berman E. Pavia A.A. Lacombe J.M. J. Protein Chem. 1990; 9: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, several works have shown that the level of sialic acid on target cells may modulate their sensitivity to NK cell-mediated lysis, e.g. neuraminidase mediates an increase of the susceptibility to NK cell lysis(10Werkmeister J.A. Pross H.F. Roder J.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1983; 32: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, in agreement with previous data(20Benoist H. Madulet C. Trentesaux C. Carpentier Y. Joly P. Jardillier J.C. Desplaces A. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 42: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that sialic acid is not an essential residue in the inhibition of NK cell-mediated lysis due to inserted GPA. On the contrary, this work indicates a role for the N-linked oligosaccharide of GPA in NK cell activity modulation because endoglycosidase F, which eliminates N-linked oligosaccharide structure, completely reverses the resistance to NK cells. On the other hand, the glycophorin O-linked oligosaccharide seems to have no effect on NK cell activity. However, glycosidase treatment of control K562 cells did not clearly alter their reactivity to lectins or their sensitivity to NK cells. This is probably due to the biosynthesis of new sugar chains for the membrane molecules, whereas these mechanisms cannot act on electroinserted GPA. The GPA molecule contains 15 O-linked tetrasaccharides and a single complex N-linked oligosaccharide (13 monosaccharide residues). Several works have emphasized the importance of carbohydrate molecules in target cell-effector cell interactions(17Mc Coy Jr., J.P. Chambers W.H. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). According to the structures and the location of the extra sugar residues added to a pentasaccharide common core, all the N-linked sugar chains are classified into three subgroups(31Kobata A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 483-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) : (i) complex-type sugar chains, (ii) high mannose-type sugar chains, and (iii) hybrid-type sugar chains. Recently, by using N-glycan processing inhibitors, it has been demonstrated that the presence of high mannose-type glycans on K562 cells correlates with increased binding of effectors and a greater susceptibility to lysis. The high mannose-type glycans can influence the NK cell-target cell interaction at the level of the adhesion molecules(32Ahrens P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 385-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the N-linked sugar chain of GPA belongs to the complex-type sugar chain, and its presence on the target cell surface decreases the susceptibility to NK cells without altering the conjugate formation. Thus, two types of sugar chain with strong differences in their structure can modulate the NK cell activity in opposite directions. As mentioned above, NK cell receptors have been identified that bind MHC class I molecules and inhibit natural killer cell activation(14Moretta L. Ciccone E. Moretta A. Höglund C. Öhlén P. Kärre K. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 300-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15Kärre K. Science. 1995; 267: 978-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and it is possible that carbohydrates of the MHC glycoprotein participate in the inhibition of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity(15Kärre K. Science. 1995; 267: 978-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has recently been shown in mice that members of the type II transmembrane lectin family are preferentially expressed on NK cells and can deliver either positive (NKR-P1 protein) (33Giorda R. Rudert W.A. Vanassori C. Chambers W.H. Hiserodt J.C. Trucco M. Science. 1990; 249: 1298-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) or negative (Ly49 protein) signals to the effector cell(34Yokoyama W.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, NKR-P1 binds a diversity of oligosaccharides that activate NK cells and cytotoxicity(16Bezouska K. Yuen C.-T. O'Brien J. Childs R.A. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Drbal K. Fiserova A. Pospisil M. Feizi T. Nature. 1995; 372: 150-151Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In humans, the same type of membrane proteins (named NKG2 proteins and with carbohydrate-binding external domains) was also detected on NK cells(34Yokoyama W.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Their ligands and their effect on natural killing are unknown(34Yokoyama W.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is possible that sugar residues of the N-linked sugar chain, shared by several glycoproteins, fulfill the role of ligand molecule for these putative NK cell receptors or for other unknown molecules characterized by lectin activity. From this point of view, sugar residues of the N-linked oligosaccharide of GPA could be a ligand for a putative receptor that delivers a negative signal to NK cells. We thank Dr. J. J.

https://openalex.org/W2032076061,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase are ubiquitous kinases conserved from fungi to mammals. Their activity is regulated by phosphorylation on both threonine and tyrosine, and they play a crucial role in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. We report here the cloning of the murine p44 MAP kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1) gene, the determination of its intron/exon boundaries, and the characterization of its promoter. The gene spans approximately eight kilobases (kb) and can be divided into nine exons and eight introns, each coding region exon containing from one to three of the highly conserved protein kinase domains. Primer extension analysis reveals the existence of two major start sites of transcription located at -183 and -186 base pairs (bp) as well as four discrete start sites for transcription located at -178, -192, -273, and -292 bp of the initiation of translation. However, the start site region lacks TATA-like sequences but does contain initiator-like sequences proximal to the major start sites obtained by primer extension. 1 kb of the promoter region has been sequenced. It contains three putative TATA boxes far upstream of the main start sites region, one AP-1 box, one AP-2 box, one Malt box, one GAGA box, one half serum-responsive element, and putative binding sites for Sp1 (five), GC-rich binding factor (five), CTF-NF1 (one), Myb (one), p53 (two), Ets-1 (one), NF-IL6 (two), MyoD (two), Zeste (one), and hepatocyte nuclear factor-5 (one). To determine the sites critical for the function of the p44 MAPK promoter, we constructed a series of chimeric genes containing variable regions of the 5′-flanking sequence of p44 MAPK gene and the coding region for luciferase. Activity of the promoter, measured by its capacity to direct expression of a luciferase reporter gene, is strong, being comparable with the activity of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Progressive deletions of the ~ 1 kb (-1200/-78) promoter region allowed us to define a minimal region of 186 bp (-284/-78) that has maximal promoter activity. Within this context, deletion of the AP-2 binding site reduces by 30-40% the activity of the promoter. Further deletion of this minimal promoter that removes the major start sites (-167/-78) surprisingly preserves promoter activity. This result implicates a major role of this region that contains the Sp1 sites. Finally, removal of the major start sites of transcription as well as the Sp1 sites reveals additional promoter activity at the upstream transcription minor start sites (-240/-167), an activity that is enhanced by the upstream cis-acting elements. In summary, our findings reveal a complex pattern of transcriptional regulation of the mouse p44 MAPK promoter. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase are ubiquitous kinases conserved from fungi to mammals. Their activity is regulated by phosphorylation on both threonine and tyrosine, and they play a crucial role in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation.

The gene spans approximately eight kilobases (kb) and can be divided into nine exons and eight introns, each coding region exon containing from one to three of the highly conserved protein kinase domains. Primer extension analysis reveals the existence of two major start sites of transcription located at -183 and -186 base pairs (bp) as well as four discrete start sites for transcription located at -178, -192, -273, and -292 bp of the initiation of translation. However, the start site region lacks TATA-like sequences but does contain initiator-like sequences proximal to the major start sites obtained by primer extension. 1 kb of the promoter region has been sequenced. It contains three putative TATA boxes far upstream of the main start sites region, one AP-1 box, one AP-2 box, one Malt box, one GAGA box, one half serum-responsive element, and putative binding sites for Sp1 (five), GC-rich binding factor (five), CTF-NF1 (one), Myb (one), p53 (two), Ets-1 (one), NF-IL6 (two), MyoD (two), Zeste (one), and hepatocyte nuclear factor-5 (one). To determine the sites critical for the function of the p44 MAPK promoter, we constructed a series of chimeric genes containing variable regions of the 5′-flanking sequence of p44 MAPK gene and the coding region for luciferase. Activity of the promoter, measured by its capacity to direct expression of a luciferase reporter gene, is strong, being comparable with the activity of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Progressive deletions of the ~ 1 kb (-1200/-78) promoter region allowed us to define a minimal region of 186 bp (-284/-78) that has maximal promoter activity. Within this context, deletion of the AP-2 binding site reduces by 30-40% the activity of the promoter. Further deletion of this minimal promoter that removes the major start sites (-167/-78) surprisingly preserves promoter activity. This result implicates a major role of this region that contains the Sp1 sites. Finally, removal of the major start sites of transcription as well as the Sp1 sites reveals additional promoter activity at the upstream transcription minor start sites (-240/-167), an activity that is enhanced by the upstream cis-acting elements. In summary, our findings reveal a complex pattern of transcriptional regulation of the mouse p44 MAPK promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2038129713,"The contribution of the catalytic and noncatalytic domains of factor IXa to the interaction with its cofactor, factor VIIIa, was evaluated. Two proteolytic fragments of factor IXa, lacking some or all of the serine protease domain, failed to mimic the ability of factor IXa to enhance the reconstitution of factor VIIIa from isolated A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit. Both fragments, however, inhibited this factor IXa-dependent activity. Selective thermal denaturation of the factor IXa serine protease domain eliminated its effect on factor VIIIa reconstitution. Modification of factor IXa with dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone (DEGR-IXa) stabilized this domain, and heat-treated DEGR-IXa retained its ability to enhance factor VIIIa reconstitution. These results indicate the importance of the serine protease domain as well as structures residing in the factor IXa light chain (g-carboxyglutamic acid and/or epidermal growth factor domains) for cofactor stabilizing activity. In the presence of phospholipid, the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer produced a saturable increase in the fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein-Phe-Phe-Arg chloromethyl ketone-modified factor IXa (Fl-FFR-IXa). This effect was inhibited by a factor IXa fragment comprised of the g-carboxyglutamic acid and epidermal growth factor domains. The difference in Fl-FFR-IXa anisotropy in the presence of A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (Δr = 0.043) compared with factor VIIIa (Δr = 0.069) represented the contribution of the A2 subunit.

Noncovalent subunit associations are denoted by (/) and covalent associations are denoted by(-). The A1 and A3-C1-C2 subunits retain the Me2+ ion linkage and can be isolated as a stable dimer(8Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol.

The A2 subunit is weakly associated with the dimer primarily through electrostatic forces (10Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol.

Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar) for review). In the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway, factor IX is activated to factor IXa by factor XIa and Ca2+(15Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the 35-residue activation peptide is released to yield factor IXa light chain, comprised of the Gla and two EGF domains, linked via a disulfide bond to the heavy chain which contains the serine protease domain(16Bajaj S.P. Birktoft J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 96-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). g-carboxyglutamic acid epidermal growth factor 2,6-dansyl glutamyl-L-glycyl-L-arginyl-chloromethyl ketone factor IXa modified with DEGR-CK factor IXa modified with fluorescein D-phenylalanyl-D-phenylalanyl-L-arginyl chloromethyl ketone D-phenylalanyl-L-propyl-L-arginyl-chloromethyl ketone factor IXa modified with PPACK phosphatidylserine phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine. Factor VIIIa functions as a cofactor for the serine protease factor IXa, which in the presence of Ca2+ and a membrane surface, converts factor X to factor Xa. Factor VIIIa increases the kcat for this reaction by several orders of magnitude(17van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Association of factor VIIIa with factor IXa in the presence of phospholipid stabilizes cofactor activity(18Lollar P. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Blood. 1984; 63: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While reconstitution of heterotrimer factor VIIIa from the isolated A2 subunit and A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer is enhanced severalfold in the presence of factor IXa and phospholipid(14Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prolonged incubation of factor VIIIa with factor IXa results in a loss of factor VIIIa activity due to proteolytic cleavage within the A1 domain(19Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, stable enhancement of factor VIIIa reconstitution can be achieved in the presence of active site-inhibited factor IXa(14Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sites of interaction between factor IXa and its cofactor are not well defined. In addition to its role in binding phospholipid (20Schwalbe R.A. Ryan J. Stern D.M. Kisiel W. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20288-20296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and endothelial cell (21Toomey J.R. Smith K.J. Roberts H.R. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1806-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) surfaces, the isolated factor IX Gla domain has also been shown to inhibit the factor VIIIa-dependent conversion of factor X to Xa by factor IXa(22Astermark J. Hogg P.J. Bjork I. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3249-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody specific for an epitope within the heavy chain of factor IXa was shown to interfere with the binding of factor VIIIa to factor IXa suggesting the serine protease domain also interacts with factor VIIIa(23Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Maki S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11574-11580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, little information is known about sites within factor VIII(a) involved in its interaction with factor IXa. Recently it has been shown that the light chain of factor VIII (likely within the A3 domain) contains a high affinity binding site for factor IXa(24Lenting P.J. Donath M.-J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, peptides corresponding to the sequence surrounding the activated protein C cleavage site in the A2 subunit of factor VIIIa (Arg562)(8Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibit the factor IXa-dependent enhancement of factor VIIIa reconstitution (25Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, interaction of factor IXa and factor VIIIa appears to involve multiple sites on each protein. In this study we demonstrate that the serine protease domain of factor IXa is essential for stabilizing the structurally labile, factor VIIIa heterotrimer and likely contributes to this association by interaction with the A2 subunit. Additional results obtained with proteolytic fragments of factor IX indicate that the Gla and/or EGF domains contain an interactive site for the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer factor VIIIa. These results support a model for the factor VIIIa-factor IXa interaction consistent with proposed surface proximal and surface distal regions of the molecules. The reagents DEGR-CK and PPACK (Calbiochem), phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma) were purchased from the indicated vendors. Phospholipid vesicles (PSPCPE) composed of 20% phosphatidylserine, 40% phosphatidylcholine, and 40% phosphatidylethanolamine were prepared using octyl glucoside as described previously(26Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide SVDQRGNQ which corresponds to factor VIII residues 558-565 was prepared by Quality Controlled Biochemicals. Recombinant human factor VIII was a generous gift from Debra Pittman of the Genetics Institute. Human factor VIIIa was obtained following CM-Sepharose chromatography of thrombin-activated human factor VIII(27Curits J.E. Helgerson S.L. Parker E.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6246-6251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of factor VIIIa subunits from recombinant factor VIII was as described previously(28Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human factor IXa and human α-thrombin were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories. Factor IX was isolated from fresh-frozen human plasma by affinity chromatography on a column of immobilized anti-factor IX monoclonal antibody (anti-FIX-Sepharose) according to Tharakan et al.(29Tharakan J. Strickland D. Burgess W. Drohan W.N. Clark D.B. Vox Sang. 1990; 58: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using the same affinity matrix. The 45-kDa fragment consisting of the Gla and two EGF domains plus the amino-terminal half of the serine protease domain was prepared by digestion of factor IX with thrombin followed by affinity chromatography on the anti-FIX-Sepharose. The 25-kDa fragment containing the Gla and two EGF domains was prepared by digestion of factor IX with chymotrypsin followed by affinity chromatography on the same column. The conditions for digestion and purification were as described previously(30Vysotchin A. Medved L.V. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8436-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both fragments were subjected to 10 cycles of NH2-terminal sequence analysis on a Hewlett Packard model G1000S sequenator. The sequences were exactly the same as determined previously(30Vysotchin A. Medved L.V. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8436-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor IXa was modified with active site specific reagent DEGR-CK as described elsewhere(31Lollar P. Fass D.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fluorescein-Phe-Phe-Arg-factor IXa (Fl-FFR-IXa) was purchased from Molecular Innovations, Wayne MI. Factor VIIIa activity was measured by a one stage clotting assay using substrate plasma that has been chemically depleted of factor VIII activity(32Casillas G. Simonetti C. Pavlovsky A. Coagulation. 1971; 4: 107-111Google Scholar). Reconstitution of factor VIIIa activity from the isolated A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit was performed at room temperature in buffer A (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 20) with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mg/ml phospholipid in the form of inosithin. Fluorescence measurements of the thermal unfolding of factor IXa and DEGR-IXa were performed with a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml by monitoring the ratio of intrinsic fluorescence intensity at 350 nm to that at 320 nm with excitation at 280 nm in an SLM 8000-C fluorometer. The temperature was controlled with a circulating water bath programmed to raise the temperature at ⋍1°C/min. Changes in the ratio parameter provide a sensitive method for detecting melting transitions and determination of their midpoints (Tm). Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were made using a SPEX Fluorolog 212 spectrometer operated in the L format. The excitation wavelength was 495 nm (5-nm band pass) and the emission wavelength was 520 nm (14.4-nm band pass). Reactions were carried out at room temperature in buffer A with 0.1 mg/ml phospholipid in the form of PSPCPE in a quartz micro cell (200 μl, final volume). Anisotropy measurements were made by manually rotating the polarizers and monitoring fluorescence for 10 s at each position. Three determinations were made at each position and the average value obtained. Prior to addition of Fl-FFR-IXa, blank readings for the buffer containing phospholipid were made and subtracted from subsequent determinations. Following addition of Fl-FFR-IXa (20 nM) the initial anisotropy was determined as described above. Anisotropy measurements were made following successive additions of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer. The data were fit to a model described previously for the binding of porcine factor VIIIa to fluorescently modified factor IXa (33Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the following equations: r=ro+fB(rsat−ro)(Eq. 1) where ro is the anisotropy of Fl-FFR-IXa in the absence of added A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer, rsat is the anisotropy of Fl-FFR-IXa in the presence of saturating levels of dimer. fB is the fraction of Fl-FFR-IXa binding sites that are occupied by the dimer and is defined as, fB=BnEo(Eq. 2) where B is the concentration of bound A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and Eo is the total concentration of Fl-FFR-IXa. The concentration of the bound dimer is given by the quadratic equation B=(nEo+Kd+Co)−(nEo+Kd+Co)2−4nEoCo2(Eq. 3) where Ko is the dissociation constant and Co is the total concentration of A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer. For experiments in which FPR-IXa or the 25-kDa factor IX fragment were added to displace Fl-FFR-IXa, reactions initially contained Fl-FFR-IXa (20 nM) in buffer A with 0.1 mg/ml PSPCPE. The change in Fl-FFR-IXa anisotropy upon addition of A1/A3-C1-C2 (50 nM) was determined. Subsequent anisotropy measurements were made following successive additions of either FPR-IXa or the 25-kDa factor IX fragment. The serine protease domain of factor IX is structurally labile and melts at a temperature of 42-55°C depending on pH with an irreversible loss of esterolytic activity(30Vysotchin A. Medved L.V. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8436-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the Gla and EGF modules of factor IX melt at much higher temperatures(30Vysotchin A. Medved L.V. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8436-8446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modification of the active site of several serine proteases with peptidylchloromethyl ketone inhibitors stabilizes the serine protease domain thus increasing their melting temperatures to variable extents(34Novokhatny V.V. Medved L.V. Mazar A. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17211-17218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence detected thermal denaturation indicated that factor IXa melts with a midpoint (Tm) near 58°C, while factor IXa that has been modified with the active site inhibitor dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone (DEGR-IXa) melts with a midpoint (Tm) of 65°C (Fig. 1). Incubation of factor IXa at 60°C for 10 min followed by fluorescence detected thermal denaturation revealed the complete elimination of the characteristic transition curve indicating that unfolding was irreversible. However, identical treatment of DEGR-IXa resulted in a transition curve similar to the original, although the magnitude was somewhat decreased, indicating that at least 40% of the molecules retained their native structures (data not shown). To examine the role the serine protease domain of factor IXa serves in its interaction with factor VIIIa, we took advantage of the sensitivity of this domain to elevated temperature and monitored the capacity of factor IXa to enhance reconstitution of factor VIIIa from isolated subunits. Factor IXa or DEGR-IXa was incubated for 5 min at 60°C prior to reaction with factor VIIIa subunits. This treatment destroyed greater than 98% of the proteolytic activity of factor IXa as determined by its inability to convert factor X to factor Xa in the presence of factor VIIIa and phospholipid (data not shown). Reconstitution of factor VIIIa activity from the isolated A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and the A2 subunit was carried out in the presence of the various factor IXa forms (Fig. 2). Untreated, native factor IXa resulted in a transient enhancement of factor VIIIa reconstitution that decayed over the time course of the reaction, consistent with our previously reported observation(14Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transient nature of this reaction reflects the subsequent inactivation of factor VIIIa following factor IXa-catalyzed cleavage within the A1 subunit(19Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35O'Brien D.P. Johnson D. Byfield P. Tuddenham E.G.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Modification of the factor IXa active site by DEGR-CK yields catalytically inactive enzyme that still retains its ability to enhance factor VIIIa reconstitution (14Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, diamonds). Furthermore, the enhancement activity observed with DEGR-IXa is stable and occurs to a greater extent since the protease activity is nonfunctional. However, heat-treated factor IXa was unable to enhance the reconstitution of factor VIIIa activity while heat treated-DEGR-IXa, whose serine protease domain was stabilized by the active site modification, retains its ability to enhance factor VIIIa reconstitution. These results suggest that the serine protease domain is necessary for the factor IXa-dependent enhancement of this factor VIIIa intersubunit interaction. Fragments of factor IX were prepared following limited proteolysis and used to further investigate the structural requirements for the interaction of factor IXa with factor VIIIa. A 45-kDa fragment consisting of the Gla and two EGF domains plus the NH2-terminal portion of the serine protease domain and a 25-kDa fragment containing only the Gla and two EGF domains were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” Neither the 45-kDa fragment nor the 25-kDa factor IX fragment was able to enhance the reconstitution of factor VIIIa activity when present at micromolar concentrations (data not shown). This result was consistent with the above data, suggesting the importance of a structurally intact serine protease domain for this activity. To determine whether the Gla and/or EGF domains participate in the interaction between factor IXa and factor VIIIa, competition experiments were performed in which the ability of the 25-kDa factor IX fragment to inhibit the DEGR-IXa-dependent enhancement of factor VIIIa reconstitution was examined. As shown in Fig. 3, factor VIIIa reconstitution from 10 nM subunits was enhanced approximately 8-fold in the presence of 10 nM DEGR-IXa. However, the 25-kDa fragment was able to inhibit this DEGR-IXa-dependent effect with 50% inhibition occurring at ~4 μM. The 45-kDa fragment, which contained the Gla and EGF domains as well as the amino-terminal portion of the serine protease domain, also inhibited the DEGR-IXa-dependent enhancement of reconstitution with 50% inhibition seen at ~3 μM (data not shown). This effect did not result from titration of the phospholipid vesicles by the high levels of fragment in the reaction since increasing the phospholipid concentration 10-fold failed to reverse the inhibition (data not shown). This result suggests that the Gla and/or EGF domains of factor IX interact with one or more factor VIIIa subunits, and this interaction, like the interaction with the serine protease domain, is necessary for the factor IXa-dependent stabilization of factor VIIIa. Fluorescence anisotropy was used to examine the interaction of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer with fluorescently modified factor IXa (Fl-FFR-IXa) in the presence of PSPCPE vesicles. Titration with A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer produced a saturable increase in the fluorescence anisotropy of Fl-FFR-IXa in the presence of PSPCPE (Fig. 4), suggesting that the dimer was capable of binding factor IXa and altering its active site. The data were fit to a model that has been used previously to describe the binding of porcine factor VIIIa to fluorescently labeled factor IXa (33Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model assumes reversible binding to n identical noninteracting sites on Fl-FFR-IXa. Nonlinear least squares fit of the data to this equation yielded an apparent Ko~11 nM and a stoichiometry of ~5 A1/A3-C1-C2 molecules/Fl-FFR-IXa. The greater than unity stoichiometry has been observed previously using purified factor VIIIa preparations (27Curits J.E. Helgerson S.L. Parker E.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6246-6251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may reflect a high mole fraction of inactive dimer molecules, possibly resulting from chromatographic procedures. The ability of a nonfluorescent, active site modified factor IXa molecule, FPR-IXa to inhibit the binding of Fl-FFR-IXa to the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer was examined. The fluorescence anisotropy of 20 nM Fl-FFR-IXa and 50 nM A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml PSPCPE was determined. Addition of increasing concentrations of FPR-IXa produced a decrease in the anisotropy demonstrating that binding to the active site-modified factor IXa was reversible (Fig. 5). To determine the role of the Gla and/or EGF domains in the interaction of factor IXa and the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer, the 25-kDa factor IX fragment was used as an inhibitor of the dimer-dependent increase in anisotropy. Successive additions of the factor IX fragment produced a decrease in the fluorescence anisotropy in a reaction containing 20 nM Fl-FFR-IXa and 50 nM A1/A3-C1-C2 in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml PSPCPE vesicles. A 50% inhibition of the anisotropy increase occurred at ~1 μM. This fragment was observed to be about 10-fold less potent of an inhibitor of Fl-FFR-IXa anisotropy compared with the intact FPR-IXa molecule. The fluorescence anisotropy of Fl-FFR-FIXa is increased in the presence of factor VIII, with a further incremental increase observed when the factor VIII is converted to factor VIIIa(33Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results in Table 1 show that the increase in anisotropy observed in the presence of factor VIIIa exceeds that observed in the presence of the A1/A3-C1-C2. Thus, the difference in factor VIIIa and A1/A3-C1-C2 anisotropy values may be used as an indicator for the contribution made by the A2 subunit.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Recently, we observed that a peptide corresponding to factor VIII residues 558-565 of the A2 subunit noncompetitively inhibited factor Xase activity (KI~ 100 μM) as well as eliminated the factor IXa-dependent enhancement of factor VIIIa reconstitution from isolated subunits(25Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result indicated an interaction of factor VIIIa A2 subunit with factor IXa. The ability FVIII558-565 to affect the fluorescence anisotropy of Fl-FFR-IXa upon association of factor VIIIa or the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer was examined. As shown in Table 1, in the presence of 300 μM peptide, the anisotropy of Fl-FFR-IXa alone was unaffected, whereas the magnitude of the increase in anisotropy observed upon association of Fl-FFR-IXa and factor VIIIa was reduced to a value similar to that seen when the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer is used. Furthermore, inclusion of the FVIII558-565 peptide had no effect on the anisotropy value measured in presence of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer. That FVIII558-565 blocks the A2-dependent incremental increase in anisotropy rather than abolishing the total factor VIIIa (or A1/A3-C1-C2)-dependent anisotropy increase suggests that the A2 subunit may interact within the serine protease domain, at or near the active site of factor IXa. The interaction of factor IXa with its cofactor, factor VIIIa, was investigated by evaluating the contribution of both the catalytic (serine protease) and noncatalytic (Gla and two EGF) domains of the molecule. In the present study, we demonstrate that a structurally intact serine protease domain is required for interaction with factor VIIIa, as judged by the factor IXa-dependent enhancement of factor VIIIa reconstitution. Two proteolytic fragments of factor IX in which all or part of the serine protease domain are deleted, failed to enhance factor VIIIa reconstitution. Furthermore, selective thermal denaturation of the serine protease domain abolished the ability of the molecule to enhance factor VIIIa reconstitution. Modification of the factor IXa active site with DEGR-CK stabilized this domain, preventing the irreversible denaturation at the elevated temperature. This heat-treated DEGR-IXa retained the ability to enhance factor VIIIa reconstitution. The above results indicate the importance of the serine protease domain for the cofactor stabilizing activity and are consistent with previous studies that proposed a factor VIIIa-interactive site on the factor IXa heavy chain. Earlier studies described a monoclonal antibody that binds an epitope within factor IXa heavy chain (serine protease domain) residues 181 and 310 (36Frazier D. Smith K.J. Cheung W.-F. Ware J. Lin S.-W. Thompson A.R. Reisner H. Bajaj S.P. Stafford D.W. Blood. 1989; 74: 971-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and interferes with subsequent binding of factor VIIIa(23Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Maki S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11574-11580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of this inhibition is unknown since creation of recombinant factor IX molecules, in which surface residues in this region were individually replaced with factor X residues from the homologous position, eliminated or reduced affinity for the antibody yet retained normal clotting activity(37Hamaguchi N. Bajaj S.P. Smith K.J. Stafford D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A role for the noncatalytic domains of factor IXa in the interaction with its cofactor was indicated by the capacity of the 25-kDa factor IX fragment to inhibit the DEGR-IXa-dependent enhancement of factor VIIIa reconstitution. Localization of factor VIIIa interactive sites within these domains remains controversial. Lin et al.(38Lin S.-W. Smith K.J. Welsh D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 144-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that recombinant factor IX in which the two EGF-like domains have been replaced by the corresponding domains of factor X possessed only 4% normal biological activity, while recombinant factor IX, in which only the first EGF domain was replaced with the corresponding region from factor X, retained normal activity. This suggests that the first EGF domain is not likely to be involved in the interaction with factor VIIIa. In contrast, mutational analysis has indicated that Tyr69, located within the first EGF domain, is essential for the factor VIIIa-dependent conversion of factor X by factor IXa(39Hughes P.E. Morgan G. Rooney E.K. Brownlee G.G. Handford P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17727-17733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence that the Gla domain may be required for interaction with factor VIIIa is based on the observation that a fragment of bovine factor IX consisting of the isolated Gla domain weakly inhibited (KI~ 10 μM) the factor VIIIa-dependent conversion of factor X to Xa(22Astermark J. Hogg P.J. Bjork I. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3249-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence anisotropy has been used to investigate the interaction of factor IXa and factor VIIIa(33Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Regan L.M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8546-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the binding of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer to Fl-FFR-IXa in the presence of phospholipid is a high affinity interaction (Kd = 11.1 ± 6.7 nM) which is capable of altering the active site. Previous work from our laboratory suggested that the presence of both the A2 subunit and the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer were required for the observed increase in the fluorescence polarization of DEGR-IXa (14Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This disparity may be attributed to fluorophore sensitivity, since a greater increase in factor VIIIa-dependent anisotropy was observed when fluorescein (Δr = 0.09) rather than dansyl (Δr = 0.03) was the reporter group (33Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The similar affinity of the above interaction to interactions of factor IXa with the free factor VIII light chain (Ko~14 nM) (24Lenting P.J. Donath M.-J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human factor VIIIa (Ko~ 23 nM) (27Curits J.E. Helgerson S.L. Parker E.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6246-6251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests little if any contribution of factor VIII heavy chain-derived subunits (A1 and A2) to the binding energy. However, factor VIII light chain produces a fractional increase the fluorescence anisotropy of Fl-FFR-IXa 3L. M. Regan, L. M. O'Brien, T. L. Beattie, K. Sudhakar, F. J. Walker, and P. J. Fay, unpublished results. compared with the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer, suggesting that the A1 subunit may contribute to the change in conformation near the active site. FPR-IXa eliminated the dimer-dependent anisotropy increment by displacing Fl-FFR-IXa. The 25-kDa factor IX fragment was also able to displace Fl-FFR-IXa from the complex demonstrating a direct physical interaction of the Gla and/or EGF domains with the A1/A3-C1-C2 subunit. The observed 10-fold reduction in inhibitor potency of the fragment compared with the intact FPR-FIXa molecule could result from partial denaturation of the fragment during isolation and/or indicate that additional sites of dimer interaction are located within the serine protease domain. Heterotrimeric factor VIIIa produces a greater increase in the anisotropy of Fl-FFR-IXa than the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer, thus suggesting a role for the A2 subunit in modulating the factor IXa active site. Recently, Duffy et al.(33Duffy E.J. Parker E.T. Mutucumarana V.P. Johnson A.E. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17006-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the fluorescence anisotropy of factor IXa is increased in the presence of factor VIII and that a further incremental increase is observed upon thrombin-catalyzed activation. This incremental increase likely reflects contribution from cleavage of both the light chain (Arg1689) and the heavy chain (Arg372) of factor VIII. A hybrid factor VIII molecule possessing a native heavy chain plus thrombin-cleaved light chain increased the anisotropy of Fl-FFR-IXa to a value that was intermediate to that of factor VIII and factor VIIIa(40Regan L.M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8546-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, addition of thrombin to fully activate the hybrid was required to observe the maximal anisotropy effect. Recently, we reported that residues 558-565 of the A2 subunit contained a factor IXa interactive site based upon the observation that a peptide corresponding to this region was able inhibit the factor VIIIa-dependent conversion of factor X to Xa as well as inhibit the factor IXa-dependent enhancement of factor VIIIa reconstitution (25Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that this peptide can block the interaction of the A2 subunit with factor IXa based upon its capacity to eliminate the A2-dependent contribution of the anisotropy increase of Fl-FFR-IXa in the presence of factor VIIIa. The ability of A2 subunit to alter the conformation around the active site is compatible with the localization of this interaction to the serine protease domain of factor IXa. Based upon the above results we suggest the following model for the relative orientation of factors VIIIa and IXa and surface in the intrinsic tenase complex. Factor IXa is an elongated molecule with its light chain (Gla domain) involved in binding the phospholipid surface, whereas the heavy chain contains the serine protease domain (see (41Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) for review). Recently, Mutucumarana et al.(42Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) determined that the active site of factor IXa is located high above the membrane surface (>70 Å), and this distance is unaffected by the presence of factor VIIIa. However, the conformation around the active site of factor IXa is altered by the cofactor(42Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A3-C1-C2 subunit of factor VIIIa contains the binding site for phospholipid (C2 domain) (43Foster P.A. Fulcher C.A. Houghten R.A. Zimmerman T.S. Blood. 1990; 75: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the high affinity site for factor IXa (A3 domain)(24Lenting P.J. Donath M.-J.S.H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since this factor VIIIa subunit is also surface proximal, it is reasonable to speculate an interaction between the A3 domain and the light chain of factor IXa. This inference is supported by the inhibition of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer-dependent anisotropy increase of Fl-FFR-IXa by the 25-kDa fragment. The factor VIIIa A1 subunit is linked by divalent metal ion(s) to the A3-C1-C2 subunit and is likely oriented above the surface since its presence is required for the anisotropy effect and it contains a site (Arg336) (19Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proteolyzed by factor IXa. We predict that the factor VIIIa A2 subunit is also localized above the surface since it contains a primary cleavage site for activated protein C (Arg562)(8Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an homologous enzyme to factor IXa (see (41Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) for review) whose active site is likely similarly positioned. Additional support for the surface distal positioning of A2 subunit is inferred from its direct effect on the magnitude of the factor VIIIa-dependent anisotropy of Fl-FFR-IXa when the contribution of A2 is eliminated. Thus, we propose that factor IXa contains at least two interactive sites for factor VIIIa and include: (i) a surface-proximal site possessing a high affinity interaction and involving the light chain of factor IXa and the factor VIII A3-C1-C2 subunit and (ii) a weak affinity, surface-distal site(s) involving participation of the serine protease domain of factor IXa and the A2 (plus possibly A1) subunit(s) of factor VIIIa.

James Brown and George Mitra of Miles Laboratories for the therapeutic concentrates used to prepare factor VIII subunits and Debra Pittman and the Genetics Institute for the gift of recombinant factor VIII.

https://openalex.org/W2071656852,"Cultured fibroblasts from patients affected with the genetic metabolic disorder named neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) exhibit a dramatic accumulation of cytoplasmic triacylglycerols (Radom, J., Salvayre, R., Nègre, A., Maret, A., and Douste-Blazy, L.(1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 164, 703-708). We compared here the metabolism of radiolabeled short-, medium- and long-chain fatty acids in these cells. Short/medium-chain fatty acids (C4-C10) were incorporated into polar lipids (60-80%) and triacylglycerols (20-40%) at a lower rate (5-10 times lower) than long-chain fatty acids. Pulse-chase experiments allowed to evaluate the degradation rate of cytoplasmic triacylglycerols in normal and NLSD fibroblasts and to discriminate between two catabolic pathways of cytoplasmic triacylglycerols. Short/medium-chain (C4-C10) triacylglycerols were degraded at a normal rate in NLSD fibroblasts, whereas long-chain (C12 and longer) triacylglycerols remained undegraded. These data are confirmed by mass analysis. The use of diethylparanitrophenyl phosphate (E600) and parachloromercuribenzoate (PCMB) inhibitors allows to discriminate between the two triacylglycerol degradation pathways. E600 inhibited selectively the in situ degradation of short/medium-chain triacylglycerols without inhibition of the degradation of long-chain triacylglycerols, whereas PCMB inhibited selectively the in situ hydrolysis of long-chain triacylglycerols without affecting the degradation of long-chain triacylglycerols. This was correlated with the in vitro properties of cellular triacylglycerol-hydrolyzing enzymes characterized by their susbtrate specificity and their susceptibility to inhibitors; the neutral lipase specific to long-chain triacylglycerols is inhibited by PCMB, but not by E600, in contrast to short/medium-chain lipase, which is inhibited by E600 but not by PCMB. The data of in vitro and in situ experiments suggest the existence in fibroblasts of two separate acyl chain length-dependent pathways involved in the degradation of cytoplasmic triacylglycerols, one mediated by a neutral long-chain lipase and another one mediated by a short/medium-chain lipase. Cultured fibroblasts from patients affected with the genetic metabolic disorder named neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) exhibit a dramatic accumulation of cytoplasmic triacylglycerols (Radom, J., Salvayre, R., Nègre, A., Maret, A., and Douste-Blazy, L.(1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 164, 703-708). We compared here the metabolism of radiolabeled short-, medium- and long-chain fatty acids in these cells. Short/medium-chain fatty acids (C4-C10) were incorporated into polar lipids (60-80%) and triacylglycerols (20-40%) at a lower rate (5-10 times lower) than long-chain fatty acids. Pulse-chase experiments allowed to evaluate the degradation rate of cytoplasmic triacylglycerols in normal and NLSD fibroblasts and to discriminate between two catabolic pathways of cytoplasmic triacylglycerols. Short/medium-chain (C4-C10) triacylglycerols were degraded at a normal rate in NLSD fibroblasts, whereas long-chain (C12 and longer) triacylglycerols remained undegraded. These data are confirmed by mass analysis. The use of diethylparanitrophenyl phosphate (E600) and parachloromercuribenzoate (PCMB) inhibitors allows to discriminate between the two triacylglycerol degradation pathways. E600 inhibited selectively the in situ degradation of short/medium-chain triacylglycerols without inhibition of the degradation of long-chain triacylglycerols, whereas PCMB inhibited selectively the in situ hydrolysis of long-chain triacylglycerols without affecting the degradation of long-chain triacylglycerols. This was correlated with the in vitro properties of cellular triacylglycerol-hydrolyzing enzymes characterized by their susbtrate specificity and their susceptibility to inhibitors; the neutral lipase specific to long-chain triacylglycerols is inhibited by PCMB, but not by E600, in contrast to short/medium-chain lipase, which is inhibited by E600 but not by PCMB. The data of in vitro and in situ experiments suggest the existence in fibroblasts of two separate acyl chain length-dependent pathways involved in the degradation of cytoplasmic triacylglycerols, one mediated by a neutral long-chain lipase and another one mediated by a short/medium-chain lipase."

https://openalex.org/W2100581933,"The activation of prothrombin is catalyzed by prothrombinase, a complex of factor Xa and factor Va assembled on a negatively charged phospholipid membrane. We used a tubular flow reactor to identify the relative contributions of factor Va, prothrombin, and the negatively charged phosphatidylserine to the assembly of prothrombinase. Perfusion of phospholipid-coated capillaries with a mixture of factor Xa, factor Va, and prothrombin resulted in a steady-state rate of thrombin production that increased with (i) the phosphatidylserine content of the phospholipid bilayer, (ii) the factor Va concentration, and, most interestingly, (iii) the prothrombin concentration of the perfusion solution. Incorporation of 20 mol % phosphatidylethanolamine, a phospholipid with poor ability to promote prothrombinase activity, into a 5 mol % phosphatidylserine membrane also increased the steady-state rate of thrombin production. Direct measurements of the amount of prothrombinase in the flow reactor demonstrated that increased catalytic activities were the result of an increased steady-state amount of membrane-associated prothrombinase. Thus, similar turnover numbers of prothrombin activation (3100 min-1) were calculated, irrespective of the phosphatidylserine content of the membrane. We established for membranes with low phosphatidylserine content (<10 mol%) a linear relationship between the prothrombinase activity and the arithmetical product of the factor Va concentration in the perfusion solution and the prothrombin concentration near the catalytic surface. Our results indicate that, in addition to factor Va, prothrombin also is essential to the assembly of prothrombinase at macroscopic surfaces with low phosphatidylserine content. The data further suggest that the prothrombin concentration near the surface, controlled by the prothrombinase activity and mass transfer, is an important regulator of the prothrombinase surface density.

INTRODUCTIONProthrombinase, the enzyme complex that converts prothrombin into thrombin, is composed of the serine protease factor Xa, the protein cofactor factor Va, and phospholipids(1Hemker H.C.

Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies have indicated that the reversible protein-phospholipid and protein-protein interactions in the prothrombinase complex all contribute to the 105-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of factor Xa(3Esmon C.T.

It is generally accepted that the interaction of factor Xa with factor Va enhances the turnover number of factor Xa about 3000-fold(5Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that the interaction of prothrombin with the membrane is responsible for a dramatic decrease in the Km for prothrombin activation, namely from ~90 μM in the absence of phospholipid (5Rosing J.

Haemorrh. 1974; 17: 273-293Google Scholar). Optimum prothrombinase activity has been reported for membranes that contain at least 10 mol % phosphatidylserine(11van Rijn J.L.M.L. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4557-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Gerads I. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Tans G. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10319-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is rationalized that this dependence is the result of the lower binding affinity of membranes with low phosphatidylserine content for the protein constituents of the enzyme complex (factor Xa and factor Va) as well as for its substrate prothrombin(15Nelsestuen G.L. Broderius M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4172-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Bloom J.W. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G.

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2427-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Consequently, membranes with a low phosphatidylserine content require higher concentrations of fluid phase factor Va to incorporate the same amount of factor Xa into membrane-associated prothrombinase than membranes with a high phosphatidylserine content(11van Rijn J.L.M.L. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4557-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Lindhout T. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. van de Waart P. Hemker H.C. Rosing J.

The reported kcat values, therefore, do not always reflect the true catalytic ability(13Pei G. Powers D.D. Lentz B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3226-3233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Comfurius P. Smeets E.F. Willems G.M. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10319-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Because factor Va also interacts with phospholipid-bound prothrombin (20van de Waart P. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2838-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Luckow E.A. Lyons D.A. Ridgeway T.M. Esmon C.T. Laue T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2348-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), one cannot a priori exclude the possibility that prothrombin contributes to the stability of the prothrombinase complex. The consequence of such an effect is that increasing amounts of factor Xa will be incorporated into the prothrombinase complex with increasing prothrombin concentrations(22Jesty J. Thromb. Res. 1988; 50: 745-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). It has been shown, though, that prothrombin does not contribute to the assembly of prothrombinase at membranes with 25 mol % phosphatidylserine, under conditions that were considered to be physiologically relevant with respect to the factor Va and factor Xa concentrations(19Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no information is available about the role of prothrombin under conditions that are less optimal for prothrombinase assembly, e.g. low phosphatidylserine content and nonsaturating conditions with respect to reactant concentrations. Such a situation might prevail when coagulation takes place at the surface of activated platelets or other cells in flowing blood(23Mann K.G. Krishnaswamy S. Lawson J.H. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 213-226PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a stabilizing effect of a substrate on its membrane-bound cofactor-enzyme complex has been reported, namely that of factor X on the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex(24Nemerson Y. Gentry R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4020-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).In the present study, we used a tubular flow reactor to assess the contribution of prothrombin to the assembly of prothrombinase and the kinetics of prothrombin activation at low phosphatidylserine membranes. In earlier studies with prothrombinase in a tubular flow reactor, we demonstrated that the kinetics of prothrombinase assembly and the kinetics of thrombin production can be described adequately using a simple model for mass transport for immobilized enzymes(8Billy D. Speijer H. Willems G. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1029-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, the tubular flow reactor may have some clear advantages over the experimental settings using unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. Firstly, the prothrombin concentration near the catalytic surface can be calculated easily from the flow conditions, the concentration of prothrombin in the bulk solution, and the thrombin production in the flow reactor. Secondly, the amount of prothrombinase in the flow reactor can be estimated readily from the amount of phospholipid-bound factor Xa. This paper reports in detail on the relative contributions of prothrombin, factor Va, and the phosphatidylserine content to the assembly of prothrombinase and their implications for the kinetics of prothrombin activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (DOPS), 1The abbreviations used are: DOPS1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserineDOPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholineDOPE1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamineBSAbovine serum albumin. 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. S2238, the chromogenic substrate for thrombin, was obtained from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from Sigma. Bovine factor V and factor Va were prepared and quantitated as described previously(18Lindhout T. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. van de Waart P. Hemker H.C. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5495-5502Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Human prothrombin was purified as described (25Hendrix H. Lindhout T. Mertens K. Engels W. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3637-3644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the molar concentration was determined after complete activation with Echis carinatus venom (Sigma) by active site titration with p-nitrophenyl p‘-guanidinobenzoate hydrochloride(26Chase T. Shaw E. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Human factor Xa was prepared by activation of purified factor X (27Mertens K. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with the factor X activating protein from Russell's viper venom (Sigma) and isolated as described for bovine factor Xa(28Lindhout T. Kop-Klaassen B.H.M. Hemker H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 533: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The molar concentration was determined by active site titration with p-nitrophenyl p‘-guanidinobenzoate hydrochloride(29Smith R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2418-2423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles of mixed phospholipids were prepared as described before(30Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Janssen M.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10000-10008Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Throughout this paper, the mixed phospholipids are described with their mol % of the negatively charged phospholipid; the remainder of the phospholipid is DOPC.The Flow ReactorThe capillary flow reactor used in this study has been described(8Billy D. Speijer H. Willems G. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1029-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, microcapillary tubes (length of 127 mm and inner diameter of 0.65 mm) obtained from Brand AG (Wertheim, Germany) were cleaned and coated with a bilayer of phospholipids. Thereafter, the phospholipid-coated capillaries were perfused with a reaction mixture containing factor Xa, factor Va, and prothrombin in Tris buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 175 mM NaCl, 3 mM CaCl2, pH 7.9, containing 0.5 mg of BSA/ml). Samples (60 μl) were collected at the outlet of the flow reactor into cuvettes containing 500 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 175 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg of BSA/ml, pH 7.9, and assayed for thrombin 2The amidolytic assay does not discriminate between thrombin, meizothrombin, and meizothrombin-des-fragment 1. Previous work from our laboratory (31Schoen P. Lindhout T. Willems G. Hemker H.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) has shown that under the conditions used, the major amidolytic activity is thrombin. Therefore, throughout this paper, the amidolytic activity is referred to as thrombin activity. after addition of 60 μl of S2238 (2.4 mM) as described(8Billy D. Speijer H. Willems G. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1029-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The rate of thrombin production in the flow reactor, picomoles of thrombin/min, is calculated from the thrombin concentration at the outlet (P) and the volumetric flow rate (Q): v = PQ. All experiments were performed at 37°C and at a flow rate of 30 μl/min (wall shear rate of 20 s-1).Determination of Prothrombinase Density in the Flow ReactorAt the end of a perfusion experiment, the capillaries containing 42 μl of perfusion solution were emptied in 42 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 175 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg of BSA/ml, pH 7.9, and thoroughly rinsed with the combined solutions. An additional rinse with 42 μl of Tris/EDTA buffer was performed to ensure a quantitative recovery of phospholipid-bound factor Xa. After dilution of the eluant, 30 μl was added to a cuvette with 420 μl of Tris buffer that contained factor Va (0.6 nM), phospholipid vesicles (25 mol % DOPS/75 mol % DOPC; 12 μM), and the chromogenic substrate S2238 (0.24 mM). After 4 min at 37°C, 50 μl of prothrombin (5 μM) was added. The progress curve of optical density at 405 nm was analyzed according to a quadratic function to yield the amount of factor Xa present in the sample. Reference curves were prepared from known amounts of factor Xa. The amount of phospholipid-bound factor Xa was obtained by subtracting the known amount of factor Xa in the perfusion solution present in the capillary from the measured amount of factor Xa in the sample. Control experiments revealed that the amount of factor Xa bound to the membrane but not complexed with factor Va was negligible. Capillaries with 10 mol% DOPS/90 mol% DOPC were perfused with factor Xa (2 pM) and prothrombin (200 nM) in the absence of factor Va. The total amount of factor Xa in the capillary at the end of the perfusion did not differ significantly from the amount that was present in the fluid phase of the capillary.Kinetics for the Transport-limited Prothrombin ConversionThe rate of conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by membrane-bound prothrombinase equals the rate at which prothrombin can be supplied from the bulk solution to the catalytic surface(32Levich V.G. Physicochemical Hydrodynamics. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1962: 112-116Google Scholar) : V=Δ(Cb−Co)(Eq. 1) where Δ is the mass transfer coefficient, Cb is the prothrombin concentration in the bulk solution, and Co is the prothrombin concentration near the catalytic surface. The mass transfer coefficient is a function of the geometry of the capillary, the volumetric flow rate, the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and the diffusion coefficient of the protein. For a flow rate of 30 μl/min and the capillary (length 12.7 cm and inner diameter of 0.065 cm) used in this study, the mass transfer coefficient, Δ, for prothrombin equals 0.01 cm3/min (cf. (8Billy D. Speijer H. Willems G. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1029-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)).The maximum rate of prothrombin activation, Vmax=ΔCb(Eq. 2) is thus obtained when the membrane-bound enzymatic activity causes a total depletion of the prothrombin concentration near the surface (Co = 0). For intermediate situations when the rate of prothrombin activation is smaller than the prothrombin mass transfer rate, the prothrombin concentration at the capillary wall can be calculated from : Co=Cb−V/Δ(Eq. 3) RESULTSThe Assembly of Prothrombinase from Perfusion Mixtures Containing Factor Xa, Factor Va, and ProthrombinPhospholipid-coated capillaries were perfused (30 μl/min) with Tris buffer containing 2 pM factor Xa, 50 pM factor Va, and 100 nM prothrombin. Fig. 1 shows that the rate of thrombin production increased until a steady state was reached of 0.2 pmol/min for the membrane containing 5 mol % DOPS and a maximum of 1 pmol/min for the membrane containing 25 mol % DOPS. Measurement of the amount of factor Xa bound to the phospholipid bilayer in the flow reactor at the end of the perfusion experiments showed that 0.06 fmol and 0.66 fmol of prothrombinase were assembled at the 5 mol % and 25 mol % DOPS membranes, respectively. The turnover numbers of prothrombin activation are thus 2970 min-1 and 1500 min-1, respectively. As pointed out under “Experimental Procedures,” the steady-state rate of thrombin production under the conditions of the experiment cannot exceed 1 pmol/min (Equation 2). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that in the latter case the transport-limited supply of prothrombin causes the lower turnover number. Interestingly, the turnover number measured for the 5 mol% DOPS membrane is close to the kcat previously reported for 25 mol % phosphatidylserine membranes(8Billy D. Speijer H. Willems G. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1029-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Another interesting feature of the flow experiment with the 5 mol % DOPS membrane is that, in spite of a continuous perfusion with a mixture of 2 pM factor Xa, 50 pM factor Va, and 100 nM prothrombin, not more than 0.06 fmol of prothrombinase could be assembled. Based on reported binding parameters for the factor Va-factor Xa complex (cf. (13Pei G. Powers D.D. Lentz B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3226-3233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), we estimated that the binding capacity of the 5 mol % DOPS membrane is at least 104-fold higher. It is apparent that an equilibrium was established between membrane-associated prothrombinase and the reactants in the perfusion solution.The Steady State Rate of Thrombin Production as a Function of the DOPS Content of the MembraneCapillaries with phospholipid bilayers that contained varying mol % DOPS (2-10 mol %) were perfused with factor Xa (2 pM), factor Va (50 pM), and prothrombin (100 nM). The perfusion was continued until a steady-state rate of thrombin production was reached. At the end of the perfusion, we measured the amount of prothrombinase present in the capillary. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between the rate of thrombin production and the amount of prothrombinase as a function of the DOPS content of the membrane. It is apparent that both the steady-state rate of thrombin production and the amount of prothrombinase increased equally with the DOPS content of the membrane. As a result, the turnover number (3100 min-1) did not change with the DOPS content of the membrane. We note that in all experiments the steady-state rate of thrombin production was below the transport-limited rate of 1 pmol/min. The results obtained so far indicate that if the thrombin production reaches a steady state, the amount of prothrombinase in the flow reactor is in equilibrium with the reactants in the perfusion solution. It is concluded that under these conditions the thrombin production is proportional to the amount of prothrombinase assembled at the phospholipid-coated capillary wall.Figure 2:The steady-state rate of thrombin formation as function of the DOPS content of the membrane. Capillaries with membranes of varying DOPS content were perfused as described for Fig. 1.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5495-5502Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar).To examine the contribution of factor Va to the assembly of an equilibrium concentration of prothrombinase in the flow reactor, phospholipid (5 mol % DOPS)-coated capillaries were perfused with Tris buffer containing 2 pM factor Xa, 100 nM prothrombin, and varying concentrations of factor Va (0.01-2 nM) until a steady state rate of thrombin production was reached. The steady-state rate of thrombin production increased with the factor Va concentration in the perfusion solution until a maximum of 0.9 pmol/min (Fig. 3). This value is close to the transport rate limit of 1 pmol of thrombin/min.Figure 3:The steady-state rate of thrombin formation as function of the factor Va concentration in the perfusion solution. Phospholipid-coated (5 mol % DOPS-95 mol % DOPC) capillaries were perfused with Tris buffer containing 2 pM factor Xa, 100 nM prothrombin, and varying factor Va concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Steady State Rate of Thrombin Production as a Function of the Prothrombin Concentration and the DOPS Content of the MembraneTo investigate the contribution of prothrombin to the assembly of prothrombinase at a macroscopic phospholipid surface, capillaries coated with membranes of varying DOPS content (5-10 mol %) were perfused with mixtures that contained factor Xa (2 pM), factor Va (50 pM), and varying prothrombin concentrations (50, 100, and 200 nM). The steady-state rate of thrombin production increased with increasing prothrombin concentrations in the perfusion solution and with increasing DOPS content of the membrane (Table 1). It is important to note that the observed rates of thrombin production were well below the transport limited rate of prothrombin conversion. The increase of the steady-state rates of thrombin production with increasing prothrombin concentration and increasing DOPS content was due to an increased assembly of prothrombinase (Table 1). It appeared that the turnover numbers calculated from the rate of thrombin production and the prothrombinase content of the flow reactor did not vary significantly with the prothrombin concentration and the DOPS content of the membrane. As a matter of fact, the turnover numbers thus obtained were close to the values reported earlier (8Billy D. Speijer H. Willems G. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1029-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) for membranes with 25 mol % phosphatidylserine.TABLE I Open table in a new tab The Steady State Rate of Thrombin Production as a Function of the Prothrombin and Factor Va ConcentrationWe already demonstrated that the amounts of prothrombinase assembled at the time that a steady-state rate of thrombin production was reached increased with the DOPS content of the membrane as well as with the factor Va and prothrombin concentration in the perfusion solution. Next we designed experiments to unravel the relative contributions of factor Va and prothrombin to the assembly of membrane-associated prothrombinase. Fig. 4 shows the thrombin production in capillaries containing 5 mol % DOPS as function of the prothrombin concentration. It is apparent that at fixed factor Xa and factor Va concentrations the rate of prothrombin activation increased linearly with the prothrombin concentration in the perfusion solution. The slopes of these lines clearly increased with increasing factor Va concentrations in the perfusion solution. The interesting question that remains to be answered is whether the slopes of the lines depicted in Fig. 4 increased linearly with the factor Va concentration. If so, then factor Va and prothrombin contribute equally to the assembly of the prothrombinase complex.Figure 4:The steady-state rate of thrombin formation as function of the prothrombin concentration in the perfusion solution. Capillaries that contained a phospholipid bilayer composed of 5 mol % DOPS-95 mol % DOPC were perfused with Tris buffer containing 2 pM factor Xa, prothrombin at the indicated concentrations, and, from bottom to top, 10, 20, 100, 300, 1000, and 2000 pM factor Va. The steady-state rates of thrombin production are plotted versus the prothrombin concentration in the perfusion solution. The dotted line represents the transport-limited rate of thrombin production under the conditions of the flow experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)From Fig. 5 it is clearly seen that the slopes of the lines of Fig. 4 do not increase linearly with the factor Va concentration in the range of 10 to 300 pM (closed squares). However, as noted under “Experimental Procedures” (Equation 3), the presence of prothrombinase can easily cause a severe depletion of prothrombin near the catalytic surface. As a matter of fact, predicts that with a constant prothrombin concentration in the perfusion solution (Cb), the prothrombin concentration near the surface (Co) will decrease in parallel with the factor Va-dependent increase of the rate of thrombin production. The slope of the lines shown in Fig. 4, therefore, should be corrected for the true prothrombin concentration, i.e. Co. The closed circles in Fig. 5 are the result of this correction. It is now clearly seen that the rate of thrombin production, normalized for the prothrombin concentration near the catalytic surface, linearly increased with the factor Va concentration. The observed linear relationships indicate that for a constant amount of factor Xa in the perfusion solution, the equilibrium amount of membrane-associated prothrombinase is proportional to the arithmetical product of the factor Va concentration in the bulk solution and the prothrombin concentration near the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2126536319,"In vitro synthesis and post-translational prenylation of Rab5 is accomplished using reticulocyte lysate supplemented with prenyl precursors (Sanford, J. C., Pan, Y., and Wessling-Resnick, M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 23773-23776). When Rab5 is translated in the presence of biotin-lysine-tRNA, it incorporates biotin-lysine into its peptide backbone and is efficiently prenylated; since this modification is dependent on guanine nucleotide binding, biotin-Rab5's functional integrity must be maintained. Prenylated biotin-Rab5 associates with a 45-kDa reticulocyte GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI), sedimenting as a approximately 70-kDa particle on 5-20% sucrose density gradients. The GDI-Rab5 complex can be captured using streptavidin-linked agarose beads. Only Rab5 peptides that are substrates for prenylation are found to cosediment with the lysate GDI on sucrose gradients. Post-translational association of Rab5 and GDI is a novel finding, since previous reports suggested Rab5 remains associated with Rab escort protein (REP) after prenylation (Alexandrov, K., Horiuchi, H., Steele-Mortimer, O., Seabra, M. C., and Zerial, M. (1994) EMBO J. 13, 5262-5273). Since post-translational prenylation is catalytically mediated by REP, our study suggests that a complex between Rab5 and this factor is transient in nature. Thus, newly synthesized and prenylated Rab5 is most likely escorted to its target membrane by a GDI acceptor molecule. Biotin-Rab5 provides a novel tool for future efforts to capture and characterize additional accessory factors required for Rab protein function in vesicle transport."

M., Moccio, D. M., and Yang, C.-H.(1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13139-13144). Growth of one of these variants (L1210/R69), with metoprine in the presence of decreasing concentrations of l,L5-CHO-folateH (natural diastereoisomer of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate), resulted in the selection of other variants (L1210/R82, R83, and R84) with further reduction in one-carbon, reduced folate transport and in two cases (L1210/R83 and R84) with 3-8-fold increased folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity and folate compound polyglutamate formation in situ. Metoprine resistance was further increased, and the requirement for exogenous folate during growth was decreased as well in these variants. The increase in FPGS activity observed in L1210/R83 and R84 was characterized by 3- and 8-fold increases in value for Vmax with no change in K and the same increase in a 60-61-kDa protein as shown by immunoblotting. Northern blotting revealed the same increases in these two variants in the level of a 2.3-kilobase FPGS mRNA when compared with control, while Southern blotting of genomic DNA did not reveal any increase in FPGS gene-copy number or restriction polymorphisms. Also, no difference in stability of FPGS mRNA was found between parental and variant cells. In contrast, nuclear run-on assays revealed differences among these cell types in the rate of FPGS mRNA transcription that correlated with increased FPGS activity, protein, and mRNA level in the variants. Similar studies with a transport-defective, methotrexate-resistant L1210 cell variant (L1210/R25) documented a 2-3-fold decrease in FPGS activity, protein, and mRNA levels that was accounted for by a decrease in FPGS mRNA transcription. These results provide the first examples of constituitively altered transcriptional regulation of FPGS activity associated with acquired resistance to antifolates."

The heat shock response, the increased transcription of a set of genes in response to heat or other environmental stresses, is a highly conserved biological response, occurring in all organisms so far examined.

Of the heat shock genes, hsp70 is the most highly stress-inducible. It was therefore quite surprising to find several rodent cell lines where this gene exhibited minimal, if any, activation in response to stress. This finding was initially reported in mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells(11Aujame L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 66: 691-701Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), a mouse plasmacytoma line (MPC-11, (12Aujame L. Morgan C. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1987; 124: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)). More recently, the same deficiency was found in a glucocorticoid-resistant rat hepatoma clone (14Pirity M. Nguyen V.T. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Hever-Szabo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 210: 793-800Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and in the murine lymphoma line CH1, where, interestingly, hsp70 heat shock responsiveness was restored when the cells were grown as a tumor and heated in situ(15Davidson S. H⊘j P. Gabriele T. Anderson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on results of gel shift analyses and/or transfection studies, a trans-acting defect, possibly in HSF, was proposed as the cause for the lack of hsp70 responsiveness in the MEL, MPC-11, PCC4, and PCC7 mouse lines(11Aujame L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 66: 691-701Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Aujame L. Morgan C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1780-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Mezger V. Bensaude O. Morange M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 124: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the case of the rat hepatoma clone, a defect specific to the hsp70 gene itself was one of the possibilities considered(14Pirity M. Nguyen V.T. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Hever-Szabo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 210: 793-800Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and, in the case of CH1 cells, a requirement for additional regulatory factors to activate hsp70 expression was suggested(15Davidson S. H⊘j P. Gabriele T. Anderson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). None of the previous studies has identified the exact nature of the defect, however. In mouse (as well as in human), duplicated genes comprise the hsp70 locus, which is located in the MHC class III region(16Milner C.M. Campbell R.D. Immunogenetics. 1990; 32: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 17Sargent C.A. Dunham I. Trowsdale J. Campbell R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1968-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The murine hsp70.1 and hsp70.3 genes are highly homologous, although the nucleotide sequences completely diverge in the 3′-untranslated regions (UTR), encode identical proteins, and are both expressed only in response to stress(18Hunt C. Calderwood S. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 87: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 19Perry M.D. Aujame L. Shtang S. Moran L.A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 146: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The genes are in the same transcriptional orientation and are approximately 7 kb apart in mouse(20Snoek M. Janssen M. Olavesen M.G. Duncan Campbell R. Teuscher C. van Vugt H. Genomics. 1993; 15: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Methodology used in some of the previous studies of mouse lines lacking an hsp70 heat shock response would have detected expression of either gene; one can therefore surmise that in these lines, both hsp70 genes are completely unresponsive to heat shock. Using probes which distinguish transcription from each of the hsp70 genes, we formally demonstrate that in MEL, MPC-11, and PCC4 cells, neither hsp70 gene responds to heat shock. Furthermore, examination of additional, randomly selected mouse lines reveals that transcriptional repression of one or both hsp70 genes is very widespread. The deficit appears to reside in the hsp70 locus itself, as we find that HSF1 is activated normally by heat shock in all lines deficient for activation of one or both hsp70 genes and that another heat shock gene, hsp86, exhibits normal heat shock induction. In the case of the hsp70.1 gene, we have used genomic footprinting and Southern blot analyses to demonstrate that unresponsiveness to heat shock is consistently associated with a complete loss of promoter accessibility and extensive CpG methylation; these alterations apparently constitute the common basis for the nonresponsive phenotype. We also find detectable but reduced (relative to primary mouse cells) hsp70.1 promoter accessibility and partial hsp70.1 gene methylation in three additional mouse cell lines. Two of these three cell lines show a clearly attenuated hsp70.1 transcriptional response to heat shock. In every cell line which exhibits hsp70.1 methylation, the adjacent hsp70.3 gene is also methylated and shows no or a very weak response to heat shock. The tandem hsp70 genes are thus concomitantly methylated and transcriptionally repressed with high frequency in cultured murine cells.

The dissociated cells were expanded over several days in DME supplemented with 10% FBS, and the cells were pooled and cryopreserved.

Antibody perturbation experiments were performed exactly as described previously; dilutions (1 μl) of rabbit antiserum specific for HSF1 or HSF2 were preincubated with whole cell extracts for 20 min at room temperature prior to initiating the binding reactions(10Sarge K.D.

Unstressed and heat-shocked cells (approximately 2 × 107 cells) were exposed to dimethyl sulfate (DMS), 0.2% final concentration in culture medium, for 3 min at room temperature. For adherent cells, spent medium was removed, DMS was resuspended in 10 ml of this medium by vortexing, and the mixture was added back to the cells. Suspension cells were pelleted and resuspended in 3 ml of spent medium containing DMS. Duplicate samples were exposed to DMS, and replicate experiments were performed with each cell line to ensure reproducibility of results. Genomic DNA was isolated(26Becker P.B. Schutz G. Genomic Footprinting. Plenum Press, New York1988: 1-19Google Scholar), digested with EcoRI, cleaved with piperidine, and used for footprinting. Footprinting was also carried out on DNA which was isolated from NIH3T3 cells, deproteinized (naked DNA), and treated with DMS in vitro. Genomic footprinting analysis was performed using a ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction method(27Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Primers for footprinting of the coding strand of the hsp70.1 gene were derived from noncoding strand sequences located just downstream of the TATA element(18Hunt C. Calderwood S. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 87: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The sequence of primer 1 was 5′CTTCGCTTGTCTCTGGATGG3′; the sequence of primer 2 was 5′AGTAGCTGTCAGCGTCTGGTGCCCT3′. Primer 3, used for end labeling, had the same sequence as primer 2 but included four additional bases at the 3′ end: 5′GCTC3′. The hsp70.3 sequence corresponding to primer 2 is 5′AGTAGCTGTCAGCGTCTGGTGACCGT3′(19Perry M.D. Aujame L. Shtang S. Moran L.A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 146: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); it thus contains both a base change and a base insertion near the 3′ end and should not be recognized by footprinting primer 2 in the amplification step of the ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction procedure, which is carried out at 2°C above the Tm of the primers. We detected labeled product of the expected size when mouse DNA, the hsp70.1 footprinting primer 2 and an opposite strand hsp70.1-specific primer of equivalent Tm (derived from sequences upstream of the distal HSE) were subjected to the same amplification conditions used in the genomic footprinting analysis and then labeled using genomic footprinting primer 3, but we did not detect any labeled product when an opposite strand hsp70.3-specific primer of equivalent Tm was used instead, thus verifying that, under these conditions, the hsp70.1 footprinting primer 2 does not recognize the hsp70.3 gene. Genomic DNA (100 μg) isolated from MEL, CH27, and MPC-11 cells was amplified with the primer 5′GCTCGCTCTGCTTCTCTTGTCTTCGC3′, which overlaps footprinting primer 1, and 5′CTCCCCCTCAGGAATCCGTACTCTCT3′, derived from sequences upstream of the distal HSE of the hsp70.1 promoter. Polymerase chain reaction conditions were 40 cycles of 94°C, 1 min, 64°C, 1 min, and 72°C, 1 min. Each of the DNAs yielded the expected 310-bp amplimer, which was cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen). Several clones derived from each of the cell lines were subjected to dideoxy sequencing. One hundred μg of genomic DNA, isolated as for genomic footprinting, was incubated with 5 units/μg of BglII (BRL) for at least 4 h, followed by a second incubation with an additional 2-5 units/μg of enzyme. To specifically analyze hsp70.1 gene methylation, the digests were electrophoresed on 0.8% Seaplaque (FMC) agarose gels, and DNA fragments which comigrated with an 1135-bp molecular size marker (from AatII-digested l-DNA) were recovered by melting, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation. This DNA was then subjected to further digestion with MspI (New England Biolabs), its methylation-sensitive isoschizomer HpaII (BRL), or HhaI (New England Biolabs), again utilizing two applications of restriction endonuclease to ensure complete digestion. In some experiments, completeness of digestion was checked further by adding 2 ng of the 2.25-kb BamHI fragment of pMSGCAT (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to an aliquot of the digestion mixture and using Southern blot analysis to determine that this plasmid fragment was digested to completion. Following electrophoresis of the digested genomic DNA on 1.2% agarose gels, DNA was transferred to Zeta-Probe GT membranes (Bio-Rad) and hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe prepared by random-primed labeling (Life Technologies, Inc.) of a 1.2-kb fragment of the hsp70.1 gene, using protocols recommended by the manufacturers. Bands were visualized by autoradiography. The plasmids RSVCAT or pHBCAT (28Wu B. Hunt C. Morimoto R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) were introduced into MEL cells by liposome-mediated transfection using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The DNA-liposome complex was incubated with 2.5 × 106 cells overnight in Opti-Mem (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the transfection was stopped by addition of an equal volume of DME, 30% FBS. Eight hours later, cells were pelleted, resuspended in DME, 15% FBS, and aliquoted into two dishes. The next morning, one dish was heat-shocked for 30 min at 42°C, and, 8 h later, unstressed and heat-shocked cells were harvested for CAT assays. CAT assays were performed as described previously(29Gorman C. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar), and results were quantitated with a Fuji PhosphorImager. Sequences from the 3′-UTRs of the mouse hsp70.1 and hsp70.3 genes were cloned and used as gene-specific probes in transcription run-on assays of primary mouse embryo cells, three cell lines which had previously been shown to exhibit no hsp70 response to heat shock, and five additional, randomly chosen mouse cell lines present in our laboratory or obtained from colleagues. The eight cell lines fell into three categories with respect to the transcriptional response of the hsp70 genes to heat shock. Only F9 cells showed a pronounced heat shock inducibility of both hsp70 genes, similar to that seen in primary mouse embryo cells (Fig. 1 and Table 1). In all three of the previously studied cell lines, MEL, MPC-11, and PCC4, and in the B-cell lymphoma line CH27, neither hsp70 gene showed a transcriptional response to heat shock. NIH3T3 cells, the mouse hybridoma line LK35.2, and the lymphocytic leukemia line L1210 exhibited an intermediate phenotype: the hsp70.3 gene was weakly or not at all heat shock-responsive, while the hsp70.1 gene consistently exhibited a heat shock response, although in LK35.2 and especially in L1210 cells, this response was reproducibly weaker than in mouse embryo cells (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Transcriptional repression of one or both hsp70 genes is therefore very widespread in mouse cell lines.TABLE I Open table in a new tab With the exception of L1210 cells, transcription of another heat shock gene, hsp86, was induced by thermal stress in all of the cell lines in which one or both hsp70 genes was heat shock unresponsive (Fig. 1), suggesting that the overall heat shock pathway is intact in these cells. This premise was further supported by the results of gel retardation assays for HSF activation. Using an HSE oligonucleotide derived from the mouse hsp70 promoter, an HSE•HSF complex was detectable after heat shock in all of the cell lines examined (Fig. 2A). Our laboratory has previously reported that heat-shocked F9 and PCC4 cells contain equivalent amounts of HSE DNA binding activity and that this activity consists solely of HSF1(30Murphy S.P. Gorzowski J.J. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5309-5317Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Antibody perturbation experiments carried out in this study demonstrated that the HSE binding activity in heat-shocked MEL, CH27, L1210, and MPC-11 cells also consists solely of HSF1, since it was recognized by HSF1 antisera but not by HSF2 antisera (Fig. 2B, not shown). While the levels of HSE binding activity in heat-shocked cells varied considerably among the cell lines (Fig. 2A), there was no correlation between these levels and the presence or absence of an hsp70 heat shock response. For example, MEL cells contain high levels of HSE binding activity after heat shock yet fail to transcribe either hsp70 gene, suggesting, as did our previous findings of similar levels of HSF1 DNA binding activity in heat-shocked PCC4 and F9 cells, that the deficit is unrelated to HSF1 levels. Furthermore, there were no cell line-specific differences in the mobilities of the HSE•HSF complexes which might suggest alterations in HSF1 itself or in its oligomeric state. Another prediction of the tenet that the heat shock response machinery functions normally in cell lines with a deficient hsp70 response is that a transfected heat shock promoter should be activatable by heat shock in these lines. Previous studies where HSE-containing promoters were introduced into such cell lines transiently or permanently have yielded conflicting results(11Aujame L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 66: 691-701Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Mezger V. Bensaude O. Morange M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 124: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Pirity M. Nguyen V.T.

Biol. 1990; 10: 1600-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the present study, a CAT reporter gene under the control of the human hsp70 promoter was introduced into MEL cells using liposome-mediated transfection. Two HSEs are present in this promoter, the most proximal of which has previously been shown to be required for stress inducibility(32Wu B.J. Kingston R.E. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Two days post-transfection, the cells were heat-shocked and then harvested for CAT assays. The results (Fig. 3) show a clear induction (6-13-fold) of promoter activity in the heat-shocked cells. This was true at three levels of introduced plasmid and was not seen when the cells were transfected with RSVCAT. A similar result was obtained with L1210 cells (not shown), suggesting that the heat shock response pathway is functional in this line as well, despite the unresponsiveness to heat shock of the hsp86 gene. These data, coupled with the results of the gel retardation assays, suggest that a feature peculiar to the endogenous hsp70 genes, rather than a deficiency in the overall heat shock response, is responsible for their lack of heat shock responsiveness. Genomic footprinting studies of the human hsp70 promoter have shown dramatic changes in the regions corresponding to the HSEs during heat shock, suggesting interaction of a factor, presumably HSF1, with this site (33Abravaya K. Phillips B. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This technique, which detects the binding of regulatory factors to endogenous sequences because bound factors alter the susceptibility of guanines within these sequences to methylation by DMS, was used to examine the occupancy of the HSEs in the murine hsp70.1 promoter during heat shock. A 200-nt region of the coding strand of the proximal hsp70.1 promoter was examined; this region contains two consensus HSEs, a proximal HSE approximately 80 bp upstream of the TATA element and a more distal HSE located 80 bp further upstream of the proximal HSE (Fig. 4A). Just downstream of each HSE is a GC box (GGGCGG), a putative binding site for the transcription factor Sp1; the most proximal of these GC boxes is part of a decanucleotide, 5′TGGGCGGGGC3′, which constitutes an especially good binding site for Sp1(34Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar). A CCAAT box is located between the proximal HSE and Sp1 sites. For primary mouse embryo cells and for each cell line, the methylation pattern in DNA isolated from heat-shocked cells was compared to that in DNA isolated from unstressed cells as well as to the pattern in protein-free (naked) genomic DNA which had been methylated in vitro. Similar to their assignment with regard to hsp70 heat shock responsiveness, primary mouse cells and the eight cell lines could be grouped into the same three categories with respect to their methylation patterns (Table 1). Only DNA from F9 cells showed patterns similar to those in DNA isolated from primary mouse cells (Fig. 4B). As has been previously reported for F9 cells(30Murphy S.P. Gorzowski J.J. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5309-5317Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the band patterns in regions corresponding to the proximal and distal HSEs were identical in naked DNA and in DNA isolated from unstressed cells, suggesting that no factor is bound to these sequences in unstressed cells; however, the HSE band patterns in DNA isolated from heat-shocked F9 and mouse embryo cells were considerably different. In the proximal HSE, six guanine residues protected from methylation during heat shock were flanked by two guanines which were hypersensitive to methylation, while in the distal HSE, protected and hypersensitive guanines were interspersed (Fig. 4B). The changes in the methylation pattern of the mouse hsp70.1 promoter HSEs after heat shock in F9 and mouse embryo cells were strikingly similar to those previously seen in the proximal and distal HSEs of the human hsp70 promoter(33Abravaya K. Phillips B. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 35Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Such changes suggest the binding of a factor, presumably HSF1, to the HSEs during heat shock. By contrast, the band patterns in these regions were absolutely identical in naked DNA and in DNA isolated from both unstressed and heat-shocked CH27 and MEL cells (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the HSEs are not occupied by factors either prior to or during heat shock. The same result was obtained with DNA isolated from unstressed and heat-shocked MPC-11 and PCC4 cells (not shown). These results suggest a common basis for the lack of heat shock responsiveness of the hsp70.1 gene in these four cell lines, viz. HSF1, although activated, does not bind to the hsp70.1 promoter during heat shock. In DNA isolated from L1210 cells, where the hsp70.1 gene shows a low level of heat shock responsiveness, there were only subtle differences in the HSE methylation pattern following heat shock (Fig. 4C). The guanine residues at both boundaries of the proximal HSE were hypersensitive to methylation after heat shock, although not nearly to the extent seen in F9 and mouse embryo cells, and, of the intervening guanines, only"

Appropriate neuron-specific and physiological regulation was observed in mice bearing transgene bOT3.5, which consists of the oxytocin structural gene flanked by 0.6 kilobase pair (kbp) of upstream and 1.9 kbp of downstream sequences. bOT3.5 is expressed in oxytocin magnocellular neurons in the mouse supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, but transgene RNAs are excluded from vasopressin neurons. Replacement of the drinking diet of the transgenic mice with 2% (w/v) NaCl for 7 days significantly increased the abundance of bovine oxytocin transcripts in the supraoptic nucleus, but not in the paraventricular nucleus, in parallel with the endogenous mouse oxytocin RNA. Surprisingly, mimicry of the endogenous oxytocin gene expression pattern was lost with larger transgenes. Addition of 0.7 kbp of contiguous downstream sequences (transgene bOT) or linkage to the bovine vasopressin gene (transgene VP-B/bOT3.5) repressed hypothalamic expression. No mice were derived bearing transgene bOT6.4, which consists of the oxytocin structural gene flanked by 3 kbp of upstream and 2.6 kbp of downstream sequences, suggesting that the presence of this DNA is detrimental to normal embryonic development. These data suggest that while bOT3.5 contains sufficient cis-acting sequences to mediate expression to particular subsets of hypothalamic neurons, the overall regulation of the oxytocin gene is governed by multiple interacting enhancers and repressors. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that restrict the expression of the oxytocin gene to anatomically defined groups of neurons in the hypothalamus, we generated transgenic mice bearing bovine oxytocin genomic fragments.

Ever since pioneering studies demonstrated that the posterior pituitary contains activities that stimulate uterine contraction (1Dale H.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1906; 34: 165-206Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and milk ejection(2Ott I. Scott J.C. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

OT is synthesized as a prepropeptide in the cell bodies of anatomically defined groups (nuclei) of hypothalamic magnocellular neurons. This precursor is subject to cleavage and other modifications as it is transported down the axon to terminals located in the posterior pituitary(3Brownstein M. Russel J. Gainer H. Science. 1980; 207: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The mature peptide products (the nonapeptide OT and a putative carrier molecule termed neurophysin) are stored until neural inputs governed by physiological stimuli elicit their release into the general circulation (4Renaud L.P. Bourque C.W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1991; 36: 131-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Through an interaction with OT receptors located in the uterus and mammary gland, OT stimulates smooth muscle contraction, leading to parturition or milk ejection. oxytocin kilobase pair(s) supraoptic nucleus paraventricular nucleus vasopressin. The single-copy structural gene encoding the OT prepropeptide consists of three exons and encompasses <1 kbp(5Schmitz E. Mohr E. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The OT gene is highly homologous at both the structural and sequence level to the gene encoding the related neuropeptide vasopressin (VP). In mammals, the two genes are separated by a short intergenic region of 11 kbp in the rat (5Schmitz E. Mohr E. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and of 3 kbp in the mouse (6Hara Y. Battey J. Gainer H. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and are transcribed toward each other from opposite strands of the DNA duplex. An attractive feature of the OT system is that, within the hypothalamus, the expression of the OT gene is confined to anatomically defined groups of magnocellular neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). VP is also expressed in hypothalamic magnocellular neurons, but VP and OT are rarely found in the same cell(7Mohr E. Bahnsen U. Kiessling C. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Kiyama H. Emson P.C. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1990; 2: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Mezey E. Kiss J.Z. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1814-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The OT gene is also expressed in a number of peripheral tissues(10Murphy D. Funkhouser J. Ang H.-L. Foo N.-C. Carter D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 689: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Studies on the physiological regulation of OT gene expression in the hypothalamus have benefited from the exploitation of well established paradigms for the modulation of the activity of OT neurons. These experiments have revealed that OT gene expression in magnocellular cells is increased in response to functional demand. Thus, during pregnancy and lactation, when pituitary stores of OT are depleted, the abundance of the OT mRNA in the hypothalamus increases(11van Tol H.H.M. Bolwerk E.L.M. Liu B. Burbach J.P.H. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite being expressed in distinct magnocellular neurons, the VP mRNA also increases in abundance during pregnancy and lactation(11van Tol H.H.M. Bolwerk E.L.M. Liu B. Burbach J.P.H. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Conversely, osmotic stimuli (such as salt loading) that result in functional demand for VP and an increase in VP gene transcription (12Murphy D. Carter D.A. Mol.

Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Little is known about the regulation of OT gene expression in the hypothalamus in terms of either the synaptic regulation of phenotype and physiological status or their mediation by second messengers, transcription factors, and cognate OT gene cis-acting elements. In vitro studies have described cis-elements in the OT gene promoter that are able to mediate transcriptional regulation, but the physiological relevance of these findings remains to be determined. For example, Richard and Zingg (19Richard S. Zingg H.H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1991; 2: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have shown that the human OT promoter is able to direct the high level expression of a reporter in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro 2A. The sequences mediating this effect have been shown to consist of at least three cooperating elements located within the 50 base pairs upstream of the mRNA cap site. Both rat and human OT promoters contain direct and inverted repeats of an AGGTCA nuclear hormone receptor-binding site. Transfections into heterologous cultured cells have shown that these sequences can mediate transcriptional up-regulation of the OT promoter in response to the ligand-dependent binding of the estrogen(20Burbach J.P.H.

Science. 1992; 256: 1553-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) is estrogen-responsive (26Lefebvre D.L. Farookhi R. Larcher A. Neculcea J. Zingg H.H.

The bovine OT promoter is not responsive to estrogen(28Adan R.A.H. Walther N. Cox J.J. Ivell R. Burbach J.P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To define broad regulatory regions required for appropriate expression, we have generated transgenic mice bearing the bovine OT gene. Here, we describe a bovine OT transgene that is expressed in a cell type-specific manner in the mouse hypothalamus, within which it is subject to physiological regulation. The hypothalamic expression of this transgene is repressed by downstream sequences and by sequences in the VP gene. All transgenes were derived from bovine genomic sequences isolated and kindly donated by Siegfried Ruppert and colleagues(29Ruppert S. Scherer G. Schutz G. Nature. 1984; 308: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the extent of the transgenes described in this study. bOT6.4 is a 6.4-kbp transgene fragment consisting of the OT structural gene flanked by ~3 kbp of upstream (defined by a PstI site) and ~2.5 kbp of downstream (defined by an EcoRI site) sequences. bOT, a 4.2-kbp EcoRI OT gene fragment, consists of the structural gene flanked by ~0.6 kbp of upstream and ~2.5 kbp of downstream sequences(31Ang H.-L. Carter D.A. Murphy D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2397-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). bOT3.5 is a 3.5-kbp transgene consisting of the OT structural gene flanked by ~0.6 kbp of upstream (defined by an EcoRI site) and ~1.8 kbp of downstream (defined by an XbaI site) sequences. VP-B is a 3.45-kbp VP transgene fragment consisting of the structural gene flanked by ~1.25 kbp of upstream (defined by an HhaI site converted to a SalI site) and ~0.2 kbp of downstream (defined by an XbaI site) sequences(31Ang H.-L. Carter D.A. Murphy D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2397-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). bOT3.5 and VP-B were joined at their respective downstream XbaI sites to generate transgene VP-B/bOT3.5 (see Fig. 1). The VP and OT genes in VP-B/bOT3.5 are thus arranged in a 3′ to 3′ transcriptional orientation. Fragments were freed from vector sequences prior to their use as transgenes. Animals were cared for in accord with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Transgenic mice were generated by microinjecting fertilized one-cell eggs obtained from crosses between F1 (CBA/J × C57BL/10) mice. All procedures have been described(32Murphy D. Carter D.A. Transgenic Techniques: Principles and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar). Only Southern blot positive heterozygous transgenic animals were used for expression analysis. Salt loading of mice involved the replacement of the normal tap water drinking diet with 2% (w/v) NaCl in tap water for 7 days. Except for the ovary and uterus when virgin females were used, male mice were used throughout. The extraction of RNA using guanidinium isothiocyanate and its analysis by Northern blotting have been described(32Murphy D. Carter D.A. Transgenic Techniques: Principles and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar). In one experiment (shown in Fig. 2B and Table 2, Experiment 2), RNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies Inc.). Northern blots were controlled for equal loading and even transfer in two ways. First, following transfer, the ethidium bromide-stained filter was viewed and photographed under ultraviolet light. Second, filters were routinely reprobed with oligonucleotides corresponding to the mRNAs encoding either glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or α-tubulin. The abundance of these RNAs does not change in the hypothalamus following physiological stimulation and thus can be used as quantitation standards. Note that α-tubulin and glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase RNAs are expressed at different levels in different tissues and that the relative pattern of expression observed is consistent between animals. The oligonucleotide probes specific for the rodent and bovine OT and VP RNAs have been described(30Ang H.-L. Ungefroren H. de Bree F. Foo N.-C. Carter D.A. Burbach J.P. Ivell R. Murphy D.

Northern blot autoradiograms from salt loading experiments were subjected to quantitative analysis. Linear range exposures were scanned by laser densitometry (Pharmacia Biotech Ultroscan or Millipore Bio Image Visage 110), and the levels of bovine OT, mouse OT, or mouse VP RNA were determined relative to the level of the α-tubulin or glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase RNAs and are expressed as a percentage of the mean of the control groups (±S.E.). Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. In situ hybridization of radiolabeled oligonucleotides to RNA in brain sections has been described(31Ang H.-L. Carter D.A. Murphy D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2397-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Murphy D. Carter D.A. Transgenic Techniques: Principles and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar). In situ slides from salt loading experiments were subjected to quantitation. 10-μm coronal sections were cut through the entire hypothalamus of control or salt-loaded mice. Every fourth slide was probed with the bovine-specific oligonucleotide OT probe, while the adjacent slide was probed with the mouse-specific (rodent) oligonucleotide OT probe. Images of linear range exposures were captured using a Nikon Microphot FXA microscope equipped with a linear video camera (Eastman Kodak Megaplus Model 1.4). Captured images were analyzed using the Voxelview/ULTRA 2.1 software (Vital Images Inc., Fairfield, IA) on a Silicon Graphics Unix workstation. The number of expressing cells and the mean of the summated hypothalamic expression level were expressed as a percentage of the mean of the control groups (±S.E.). Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. In some experiments, sections were simultaneously hybridized with radiolabeled and digoxygenin-labeled probes to reveal the localization of two different RNA species(33Zeng Q. Carter D.A. Murphy D. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1994; 6: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).TABLE II Open table in a new tab We have previously shown (30Ang H.-L. Ungefroren H. de Bree F. Foo N.-C. Carter D.A.

Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2110-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that bOT, a 4.2-kbp transgene consisting of the OT structural gene flanked by 0.6 kbp of upstream and 2.6 kbp of downstream sequences (Fig. 1), is expressed in testicular Sertoli cells and in the lung. No expression of bOT was detected in the hypothalamus (Fig. 2A). To identify sequences that are able to direct transgene expression to central and peripheral sites, we have introduced bovine OT transgenes into mice that are both larger and smaller than bOT. bOT6.4 is the same as bOT, except that it has a total of ~3.0 kbp of upstream sequence of the structural gene (Fig. 1). bOT3.5 is the same as bOT, except that it lacks ~0.7 kbp of distal downstream sequence (Fig. 1). We have also investigated possible regulatory interactions between the VP and OT genes by introducing transgene VP-B/bOT3.5 into mice (Fig. 1). Fertilized one-cell mouse eggs were injected with the three transgene fragments (Table 1). Transgenes bOT3.5 and VP-B/bOT3.5 yielded transgenic mice at a high efficiency. However, despite injecting a large number of fertilized one-cell mouse eggs with construct bOT6.4, no transgenic animals were identified among the resulting pups (Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Northern analysis demonstrated that transgene bOT3.5, like bOT, was expressed in the testis and lung (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, and unlike bOT, expression of bOT3.5 was also found in the hypothalamus (Fig. 2A and Fig. 3). Within the hypothalamus, in situ hybridization analysis revealed that transgene expression was confined to magnocellular neurons of the PVN and SON (Fig. 4). Neither the endogenous mouse OT RNA nor the transgene RNA was detected in the SCN (data not shown). As in the rat(7Mohr E. Bahnsen U. Kiessling C. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the endogenous mouse VP and OT genes are expressed in mutually exclusive sets of magnocellular neurons (Fig. 5A). Similarly, bOT3.5 expression was found in neurons expressing the endogenous OT RNA (Fig. 5B), but was generally excluded from neurons expressing the endogenous VP RNA (Fig. 5C). However, as in the rat(8Kiyama H. Emson P.C. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1990; 2: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Mezey E. Kiss J.Z. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1814-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), a small number of neurons expressing the mouse VP RNA also showed expression of the mouse OT RNA and the bOT3.5 transgene RNA.Figure 4:Expression of the endogenous OT gene and of the bOT3.5 transgene in the murine hypothalamus is confined to the SON and PVN. Coronal brain sections from transgene bOT3.5 line 1 (BOT3.5) and wild-type (WT) mice were probed with labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the rodent (ROT) or bovine (BOT) OT RNAs.

The oligonucleotides used were rodent OT (ROT), bovine OT (BOT), and rodent VP (RVP). Representative areas of the SON and PVN are shown. The digoxygenin probe is revealed by brown coloration of the cell body cytoplasm (in focus in the upper panel). The radioactive probe is revealed by grains that are in a different focal plane to the nonradioactive probe (shown in focus in the lower panel).

C, bovine OT is excluded from neurons expressing rodent VP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that transgene VP-B is expressed throughout the nervous system(31Ang H.-L. Carter D.A. Murphy D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2397-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, when linked to bOT3.5 in transgene VP-B/bOT3.5, no expression of the VP component was detected (data not shown), and transcripts from the OT component were seen in the testis and lung (Fig. 6), but not in the hypothalamus (Fig. 2A and Fig. 6). We asked if expression of bOT3.5 in the hypothalamus is regulated by a stimulus that modulates the expression of the endogenous OT gene. Replacement of the drinking diet of mice with 2% (w/v) NaCl for 7 days increased the hypothalamic level of the endogenous mouse OT and VP RNAs, as assayed by Northern blotting (Fig. 2B and Table 2). However, Northern blotting revealed no significant change in the level of the transgene RNA (Fig. 2B and Table 2). Quantitative in situ hybridization analysis (Fig. 7) revealed that the transgene RNA level was modulated in only one group of magnocellular OT neurons; an effect was masked from detection using Northern blotting. Thus, while salt loading had no significant effect on the levels of either the endogenous or transgene OT RNAs in the PVN (Fig. 7, B and C), both were significantly elevated in the SON (Fig. 7, A and B). Salt loading had no effect on the number of cells expressing either transgene or endogenous RNAs in either the SON or PVN (data not shown). The expression of the endogenous murine OT RNA and the transgene RNA was generally excluded from VP neurons in salt-loaded animals (Fig. 5). While the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell-specific and physiological regulation of the OT gene are the subject of much interest(34Ivell R. Burbach J.P.H. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1991; 3: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), mechanistic understanding has lagged behind descriptive studies because of the lack of appropriate cell culture systems. To circumvent this obstacle(35Murphy D. Carter D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we have applied transgenesis to the OT system. We have previously described the expression in mice of the 4.2-kbp transgene bOT(30Ang H.-L. Ungefroren H. de Bree F. Foo N.-C. Carter D.A. Burbach J.P. Ivell R. Murphy D. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2110-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 36Ang H.-L. Ivell R. Walther N. Nicholson H. Ungefroren H. Millar M. Carter D.A. Murphy D. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 140: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). bOT RNAs were detected in the testis and lung, but not in the hypothalamus. Initially, we thought that bOT must be missing elements crucial for expression in OT neurons. However, we now show that bOT contains too much sequence information, rather than too little. Surprisingly, bOT3.5, which differs from bOT only in that it lacks 0.7 kbp of distal downstream flanking sequence, is expressed consistently in the hypothalamus, within which transgene expression is confined to magnocellular cells in the PVN and SON that also express the endogenous mouse OT gene. Transgene RNAs, like the endogenous OT transcripts, are excluded from neurons expressing mouse VP RNAs. We suggest that the downstream sequences present in bOT (but absent from bOT3.5) contain one or more repressor elements that prevent the detectable expression of the former transgene in hypothalamic oxytocinergic neurons. It follows that in the normal genomic context of the OT gene, the activity of the putative repressors must be repressed or overridden. We were unable to generate any transgenic mice bearing construct bOT6.4 (Table 1). bOT6.4 differed from bOT only in that the sequence upstream of the start of transcription consisted of 3.0 kbp, rather than the 0.6 kbp found in the latter transgene. Young et al.(37Young W.S. Reynolds K. Shepard E.A. Gainer H. Castel M. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1990; 2: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have described a similar situation with a rat OT transgene. No transgenic mice were represented in the pups resulting from the injection of fertilized one-cell mouse eggs with ROT1.63, which consisted of the entire rat OT structural gene flanked by 0.36 kbp of upstream and ~0.4 kbp of downstream sequences (Fig. 1). Both rat and cattle OT genes contain sequences that are detrimental to normal development. In the bovine gene, these sequences must reside in the 2.4 kbp of distal upstream sequences, present in bOT6.4, but absent in bOT. Presumably, ectopic OT expression, mediated by these sequences at an inappropriate time, is incompatible with embryogenesis. In the context of the normal OT gene, this toxic effect must be repressed. Because of the close linkage between the VP and OT genes, it has been suggested that interactions between the two transcription units may be important in locus control. Here, we show that the bovine VP and OT genes can affect the expression of each other. The VP-B/bOT3.5 transgene consists of the VP-B and bOT3.5 constructs linked 3′ to 3′ (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that VP-B, consisting of the bovine VP structural gene flanked by 1.25 kbp of upstream and 0.2 kbp of downstream sequences, is expressed in all neuronal tissues examined (31Ang H.-L. Carter D.A. Murphy D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2397-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As described above, bOT3.5 is expressed in OT neurons, testis, and lung. In mice containing the VP-B/bOT3.5 transgene, expression of the VP component could not be detected in any central or peripheral tissue, while expression of transgene OT RNA was seen only in the testis and lung. Thus, sequences within the OT component of the transgene prevented expression of the VP portion in neuronal cells, while sequences within VP-B repressed the hypothalamic expression of bOT3.5. Support for the concept of cross-talk between the VP and OT genes has also come from the experiments of Young et al.(37Young W.S. Reynolds K. Shepard E.A. Gainer H. Castel M. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1990; 2: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These authors described mice bearing a minilocus transgene (V2) consisting of construct ROT1.63 (see above and Fig. 1) linked to sequences from the rat VP gene (transgene RVP3.55) (Fig. 1). No transgenic mice were derived from the microinjection of fertilized one-cell mouse eggs with ROT1.63 (see above). On its own, RVP3.55, consisting of the structural gene flanked by ~1.4 kbp of upstream and 0.4 kbp of downstream sequences (Fig. 1), was not expressed. 2W. S. Young III, personal communication. In the V2 minilocus transgene, the two genes were arranged in the opposite transcriptional orientation (VP 3′ to OT 5′) to the native genes (VP 3′ to OT 3′). The VP component of the V2 minilocus was again silent. However, the OT transcription unit present in V2 was expressed in oxytocinergic magnocellular neurons(37Young W.S. Reynolds K. Shepard E.A. Gainer H. Castel M. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1990; 2: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Belenky M. Castel M. Young III, W.S. Gainer H. Cohen S. Brain Res. 1992; 583: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Gainer H. Wray S. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1994: 1099-1129Google Scholar). Thus, elements within the VP component must repress the deleterious effects of the OT portion, allowing transgenic mice to be generated. Thus, the close linkage of the VP and OT genes may be important for overall locus control, perhaps by coordinating responses of the two genes to developmental or regulatory cues. However, it should be noted that our data also suggest that there is redundancy in the regulatory elements contained within the two transcription units as the bOT3.5 transgene, consisting only of OT gene sequences and proximal flanks, is expressed autonomously in oxytocinergic neurons. Similarly, we have described bovine VP transgenes that are properly regulated in the hypothalamus(31Ang H.-L. Carter D.A. Murphy D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2397-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Physiological stimuli are known to affect the pattern of OT gene expression in the hypothalamus, and we asked if these same stimuli altered the expression of the bOT3.5 transgene. We have shown that the level of bovine OT RNA increased in the hypothalamus during salt loading, in parallel with the endogenous mouse OT RNA. Thus, the sequences mediating the physiological up-regulation of bovine OT gene expression reside within the confines of the bOT3.5 transgene. Interestingly, while salt loading resulted in a significant increase in both the endogenous mouse and transgenic bovine OT RNAs in the SON, no change in either RNA could be seen in the PVN. These data suggest that in the mouse, unlike in the rat(16Lightman S.L. Young III, W.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 394: 23-39Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar), the two nuclei respond differentially to an osmotic stimulus. In summary, transgene bOT3.5 contains sufficient sequence information to direct expression to murine oxytocinergic magnocellular neurons, within which it is subject to physiological regulation. However, this expression pattern is not found when the same bOT3.5 sequences are linked either to the contiguous 0.7 kbp of downstream sequence (in bOT) or to the VP gene (in VP-B/bOT3.5), which is closely linked to the OT gene in mammals(5Schmitz E. Mohr E. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Hara Y. Battey J. Gainer H. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).

We tested this by measuring the rate of excision repair of guanine adducts formed in the HPRT gene of diploid human fibroblasts and in the overall genome by two structurally related polycyclic carcinogens, 1-nitrosopyrene (1-NOP) and N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (N-AcO-AAF) and comparing the results with those we found previously using benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE). We also measured the degree of interference with in vitro transcription by these adducts. Our results showed that, although BPDE adducts are four times more effective than 1-NOP adducts in blocking transcription, the preferential and strand-specific repair of 1-NOP adducts was twice as fast as that of BPDE adducts. Excision repair of N-AcO-AAF adducts was significantly slower than that of BPDE adducts and was not strand-specific. The efficiency of blocking of transcription by deacetylated N-AcO-AAF adducts was similar to 1-NOP adducts.

In Escherichia coli, transcription and repair are coupled by the mfd gene product(6Selby C.P. Witkin E.M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11574-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and mutations in the human homolog have been postulated to be the genetic defect in some patients with Cockayne syndrome, a disorder of development and DNA repair(7Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J.

To explain this preferential and transcription-coupled repair, models have been proposed in which RNA polymerase that is stalled at a CPD acts as a signal to the mfd-like gene product, which releases the stalled RNA polymerase, or causes it to back up, thus exposing the damage and targeting the excision repair apparatus to the lesion(9Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 10Donahue B. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This model predicts that the rate of preferential excision repair of a specific type of DNA lesion in the transcribed strand of an active gene will be proportional to the extent to which the lesion blocks transcription. To test this hypothesis, and to determine whether structurally related polycyclic adducts are preferentially repaired and exhibit strand-specific repair in diploid human fibroblasts in culture, we measured the rate of repair of adducts formed by 1-nitrosopyrene (1-NOP) and N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (N-AcO-AAF) from the individual strands of the HPRT gene and from the overall genome, and compared the results with those we had obtained with BPDE-induced adducts. We also compared the degree of interference with T7 RNA polymerase transcription caused by adducts formed by these carcinogens. All three agents bind principally to guanine. BPDE, a reactive intermediate of benzo[a]pyrene, binds to the N2 position of guanine by a covalent bond between the nitrogen and the carbon at position 10 where the epoxide was located (dG-N2-BP)(11Weinstein I.B.

The adduct is pentacyclic and lies in the minor groove of the DNA molecule(12Cosman M. de los Santos C. Fiala R. Hingerty B.E. Singh S.B. Ibanez V. Margulis L.A. Live D. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S.

Mutat. Res. 1982; 101: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). 1-NOP must undergo a further intracellular reduction step before it forms an unstable reactive intermediate that binds covalently to the C-8 position of guanine to form the stable tetracyclic adduct N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-1-aminopyrene (dG-C8-AP) (14Beland F.A. Ribovich M. Howard P.C. Heflich R.H. Kurian P. Milo G.E. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). N-AcO-AAF is a direct acting compound that spontaneously loses the acetoxy ester, generating a reactive electrophilic intermediate that also binds principally (>95%) to the C-8 position of guanine(15Beland F.A. Dooley K.L. Casciano D.A. J. Chromatogr. 1979; 174: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In human cells, N-AcO-AAF is rapidly deacetylated before binding so that its principal adduct is the tricyclic deacetylated AF residue on the C-8 position of guanine, i.e. N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene (dG-C8-AF) (16Poirier M.C. Williams G.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 18: 581-587PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Both dG-C8-AP and dG-C8-AF lie in the major groove of the DNA molecule(17Nolan S.J. Vyas R.R. Hingerty B.E. Ellis S. Shapiro R. Carcinogenesis. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 18Cho B.P. Beland F.A. Marques M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1373-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). dG-C8-AP was much less effective than dG-N2-BP in blocking T7 RNA polymerase transcription. Repair of dG-C8-AP was preferential, strand-specific, and very rapid, i.e. twice as fast as repair of dG-N2-BP. In contrast dG-C8-AF, which blocked transcription to the same extent as dG-C8-AP, was repaired slowly, and the repair was not strand-specific. The results indicate that the extent to which an adduct arrests transcription in vitro does not predict its rate of transcription-coupled repair.

Marcel Dekker, New York1981: 501-521Google Scholar) were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium modified as described previously (20Wang Y. Parks W.C. Wigle J. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mutation Res. 1986; 175: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) containing 10% supplemented calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Cells were driven into G0 by density inhibition and nutrient deprivation as described previously(21Watanabe M. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mutat. Res. 1985; 146: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To allow the cells to re-enter the cell cycle, they were released from confluence and replated at a density of 104 cells/cm2. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into acid-insoluble material indicated that under these conditions the time of onset of S-phase after release from G0 was approximately 16 h. To determine the rate of excision from the overall genome, we measured loss of radiolabeled adducts as a function of time posttreatment. Generally tritiated 1-NOP (specific activity, 177 mCi/mmol) was a generous gift from Dr. Frederick Beland, National Center for Toxicological Research (Jefferson, AR). The compound was dissolved in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored at -20°C under N2 until just prior to use. Generally tritiated N-AcO-AAF (specific activity, 484 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Chemsyn Science Laboratories (Lenexa, KS) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran. The culture medium on the cells was removed, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was replaced with serum-free medium. The compound diluted in Me2SO was delivered into the individual dishes by micropipette. Preliminary studies showed that, unlike what happens with N-AcO-AAF adducts, with 1-NOP-induced damage at a level of about 0.5 adducts/20 kb (25/106 nucleotides), the onset of S-phase was delayed long enough to allow measurements over a 16-h period. Therefore, for repair of 1-NOP adducts from the overall genome, the cells were synchronized and treated for 1 h in early G1 phase. Immediately following treatment or after 5 or 16 h of incubation in fresh culture medium, the cells were harvested, and the DNA was isolated as described previously(22McCormick J.J. Yang D. Maher V.M. Farber R.A. Neuman W. Peterson Jr., W.D. Pollack M.S. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 2073-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The number of covalently bound residues (adducts) per 106 nucleotides was determined from the A260 of the DNA solution and the specific radioactivity. To avoid possible interference with repair studies as the result of S-phase DNA replication, for N-AcO-AAF a double-label technique was used. The DNA in asynchronously growing cells was labeled with [14C]thymidine (specific activity, 59 mCi/mmol) for 48 h. Then, the cells were exposed to tritiated N-AcO-AAF for 30 min and harvested immediately or after 18, 40, or 72 h of incubation in fresh culture medium, and the DNA was isolated as described previously(22McCormick J.J. Yang D. Maher V.M. Farber R.A. Neuman W. Peterson Jr., W.D. Pollack M.S. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 2073-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The initial number of AF residues bound was determined as above, and the percentage remaining on parental DNA at the indicated times was calculated from the 3H/14C ratio at these times divided by the ratio at time zero, as described previously(23Yang J.-L. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The methods used are essentially those we employed previously to measure strand-specific repair of BPDE adducts in human fibroblasts(3Chen R.-H. Maher V.M. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5413-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, synchronized populations of cells were treated with 1-NOP or N-AcO-AAF for 1 h in early G1-phase and harvested immediately or after the indicated times for repair. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer. The cell lysates were incubated at 56°C for 8-12 h. DNA was extracted as described previously(22McCormick J.J. Yang D. Maher V.M. Farber R.A. Neuman W. Peterson Jr., W.D. Pollack M.S. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 2073-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), precipitated, resuspended in TE buffer, and treated with RNase A. The DNA was re-extracted as above, precipitated with EtOH, and dissolved in TE buffer at 0.2 mg/ml. The purified DNA was digested with BamHI (5 units/μg DNA) overnight at 37°C; the completion of digestion was verified by electrophoresis, and the digested DNA was purified by extraction and precipitation as above. Purified DNA (12 μg) was used for repair analysis. As an internal standard, 10 pg of the plasmid used to synthesize the riboprobe was added to each sample. The samples were divided in half; one half was exposed to UvrABC excinuclease (17 pmol of each subunit); the other to excinuclease buffer alone. The enzyme subunits were a generous gift from Dr. P. van de Putte (Leiden University, The Netherlands). After 1 h at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of proteinase K and SDS, and the DNA was purified by ultrafiltration and precipitated with EtOH. The DNA samples were denatured in 90% formamide and analyzed by electrophoresis in Tris borate/EDTA buffer as described previously(3Chen R.-H. Maher V.M. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5413-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide, acid-depurinated, equilibrated with 0.4 N NaOH, and transferred for 40-48 h to a Zeta Probe GT membrane (Bio-Rad) under alkaline conditions(3Chen R.-H. Maher V.M. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5413-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Plasmid pG2pa(24Lin D. Chinault A.C. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1988; 14: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), constructed by subcloning a 1.4 kb of EcoRI-XhoI fragment containing sequences from intron I of the human HPRT gene into the vector pGEM2, was kindly provided by A. C. Chinault (Baylor College, Houston, TX). It contains the SP6 and T7 promoters on either side of the insert. RNA transcripts hybridizing strand-specifically were generated as described previously(3Chen R.-H. Maher V.M. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5413-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 25Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K.G. Green M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4042) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed in 5 ml of solution as described previously(3Chen R.-H. Maher V.M. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5413-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), using ~107 cpm of 32P-labeled probe at 42°C for 20-24 h. After hybridization, the membranes were washed as described and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 x-ray films with intensifying screens or to phosphor storage cassettes. The intensities of the bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The intensity of the full-length fragment band was normalized with the internal standard band. The average number of UvrABC-sensitive sites/fragment was calculated by the Poisson distribution(26Bohr V.A. Okumoto D.S. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. 3. Marcel Dekker, New York1988: 347-366Google Scholar). These calculations took into consideration the very low number of nonspecific incisions produced by the UvrABC excinuclease. For dG-C8-AP, plasmid pG2pa was dissolved in helium-purged sodium citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 5.0) at a concentration of 250 μg/ml. A 5-μl aliquot of a freshly prepared solution of ascorbic acid (20 mM in H20) was added to provide needed reduction of 1-NOP, followed by 0-15 μl of a 0.5 mM stock solution of generally tritiated 1-NOP dissolved in Me2SO. The final reaction volume was 200 μl. The samples were mixed and incubated for 3 h at 37°C. For dG-C8-AF, plasmid pG2pa was treated with generally tritiated N-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene exactly as described for 1-NOP, except ascorbic acid was omitted. The stock concentration was 1.4 mM, and the compound was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol. For BPDE, plasmid pG2pa was dissolved in 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, at a concentration of 500 μg/ml. Aliquots (0-12 μl) of 0.7 mM [3H]BPDE (specific activity, 0.885 Ci/mmol), dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, were added to 200 μl of the plasmid solution. The samples were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Unbound carcinogen was removed by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by four successive ethanol precipitations. The mol of 3H-labeled adduct bound per mol of plasmid was calculated from the A260 of the DNA and the specific activity, and the average number of adducts per transcribed strand of the 1.4-kb HPRT fragment was estimated. The plasmid was digested with EcoRI followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Completion of digestion was confirmed by electrophoresis in an agarose minigel. Plasmid DNA (600 ng) with an adduct level of 0-10.5 dG-C8-AP, 0-9.6 dG-C8-AF, or 0-2.6 BPDE adducts/transcribed strand was used as a template in the transcription reaction as described previously (3Chen R.-H. Maher V.M. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5413-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) except that the reaction was terminated after 15 min by passing the reaction mixture through a Sephadex G-50 spin column to remove unincorporated nucleotides. A 5-μl aliquot was taken for determination of incorporation of [α-32P]UTP into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts. The rate of repair of carcinogen adducts from DNA is determined from the frequency of adducts initially formed in DNA and that remaining in DNA after particular periods of time. Two methods are used, one measures the frequency of UvrABC excinuclease-sensitive sites in the 5′-half of the HPRT gene and the other measures the frequency of radiolabeled adducts in total DNA. With either method, S-phase replication of DNA by the cells following treatment with carcinogen will dilute pre-existing parental DNA and give the appearance of a decrease in the frequency of adducts. For the majority of the experiments to be discussed, S-phase DNA replication did not occur because the target population was synchronized and exposed to carcinogen in early G1-phase, and the rate of repair was determined during the period prior to the onset of S-phase DNA synthesis. Watanabe et al.(21Watanabe M. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mutat. Res. 1985; 146: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in this laboratory showed that diploid human fibroblasts synchronized by being released from the density-inhibited G0-state by being plated at 104 cells/cm2 begin DNA replication after ~16 h. Treatment with polycyclic aromatic carcinogens causes a delay in the onset of such replication. To determine the extent of delay caused by the concentrations of 1-NOP or N-AcO-AAF to be used in the majority of the DNA repair studies, i.e. concentrations designed to introduce approximately one adduct/20-kb fragment of the HPRT gene (50 adducts/106 nucleotides), we released cells from the densityinhibited resting state by plating them into a series of dishes at 104 cells/cm2, treated them 5 h later (in early G1-phase) with 1-NOP or N-AcO-AAF, and assayed the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into acid-insoluble material at various times after treatment. As expected, in the control populations DNA replication began ~16 h after release. Cells treated with 0.3 μM 1-NOP showed no incorporation of [3H]thymidine whatsoever during the 20-h period examined posttreatment. Cells treated with 1.2 μM N-AcO-AAF began DNA replication approximately 19 h after treatment, i.e. 24 h after release. This is at least an 8-h delay in the scheduled onset of S-phase. The absence of DNA replication during the period of interest, i.e. up to 19 h after exposure to N-AcO-AAF and up to at least 20 h after exposure to 1-NOP, simplified most of the assays of repair reported here because there was no dilution of parental DNA with nascent DNA during those times. Synchronized cells were exposed to 0.5 μM3H-labeled 1-NOP in early G1-phase. The cells exhibited a survival of 30% and an initial adduct frequency of 27/106 nucleotides. The rate of repair is shown in Table 1. In the case of repair of N-AcO-AAF adducts in the overall genome, a double label technique was used to control for DNA replication. Asynchronously-growing cells, prelabeled with [14C]thymidine to be able to distinguish preexisting parental DNA, were treated with 0.6 μM or 1.6 μM3H-labeled N-AcO-AAF. These cells exhibited an initial adduct frequency of 18 or 38/106 nucleotides, respectively. Their slower rate of repair is also shown in Table 1. This difference in rate did not reflect a greater cytotoxic effect (Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Synchronized populations of cells were treated with 0.3 μM 1-NOP or 1.2 μM N-AcO-AAF in early G1-phase (5 h post release from G0). The UvrABC excinuclease-sensitive sites initially induced in the individual strands of the 20-kb BamHI fragment of the human HPRT gene or remaining after various lengths of time for repair were determined using Southern blotting(3Chen R.-H. Maher V.M. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5413-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This fragment, which is in the 5′-portion of the gene, is entirely within the transcription unit(3Chen R.-H. Maher V.M. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5413-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To avoid detection of pseudogenes, it was probed with a 1.4-kb strand-specific riboprobe that anneals to an intron sequence(27Chinault A.C. Caskey C.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 31: 295-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Representative autoradiograms of such repair studies are presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The intensities of the full-length (20 kb) fragments were determined by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms and/or by analysis of the image left on storage phosphor cassettes by the blots using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The two methods yielded equivalent results.Figure 3:Autoradiograms illustrating the extent of repair of dG-C8-AF in the transcribed (T) and the nontranscribed (NT) strand of the HPRT gene. Cells were incubated for the indicated number of hours (H) following treatment with 1.2 μM N-AcO-AAF (C). Analysis of UvrABC-sensitive (E) sites as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results are shown in Table 2 and are compared with each other and with the rates for overall genome in Fig. 4. In each instance, repair of adducts induced by 1-NOP was rapid and strand-specific; 80% of the dG-C8-AP in the transcribed strand had been removed in 8 h, and repair was virtually complete in 16-20 h. Repair in the nontranscribed strand was slower but was also close to completion (85%) by 16-20 h. The greatest difference in repair of the two strands was found after 4 h, when repair of the transcribed strand was 60-64% complete and of the nontranscribed strand was 30-31% complete. This 2-fold difference is equal to, or greater than, that of CPD in the same gene(2Tung B.S. McGregor W.G. Wang Y.-C. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mutation Research: DNA Repair. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Although this difference is less striking than in rodent cells, which have minimal repair of the nontranscribed strand, CPD in active genes of human cells are widely recognized to be strand-specifically repaired. In addition, the rate of repair of dG-C8-AP adducts in the HPRT gene was faster than that in the overall genome. In contrast, little if any repair of dG-C8-AF was detected after 5 h of repair. After 15 h, only 33% of these adducts had been removed, and the rate of repair of adducts in the transcribed strand was not faster than in the nontranscribed strand. This rate was only slightly faster than the rate of repair from the genome overall during the same time period.TABLE II Open table in a new tab If the degree of interference with transcription is a predictor of the rate at which a particular type of DNA damage is excised from active genes, then dG-C8-AP ought to be an even more effective block to transcription than dG-N2-BP. dG-C8-AF ought to block transcription minimally, if at all. To test this, we treated plasmid pG2pa with various concentrations of tritiated 1-NOP, N-OH-AF, or BPDE and determined the number of adducts per plasmid and the degree of interference with the extent of incorporation of 32P-labeled UTP into nascent transcripts. The results (Fig. 5) showed that the prediction does not hold true. It required an average of 6.8 to 7.0 dG-C8-AP or dG-C8-AF in the transcribed strand to reduce transcription to 37% of the untreated control, whereas with dG-N2-BP, 1.6 was sufficient. The basis of the use of Southern blotting as a method to determine rates of repair in specific sequences is the ability of the fragment of interest to remain full-size, i.e. the probability that the fragment of interest does not contain any damage that would cause it to be cut into a smaller sized fragment. If one can assume that such damage is randomly distributed among the population of HPRT genes and is sensitive to enzymatic excision, the Poisson distribution function, i.e. P(0) = e-x, where P(0) is the percentage of fragments with no damage and x is the average number of enzyme- sensitive sites/fragment, yields information on the frequency of adducts. To interpret the blots, one must introduce a sufficient level of damage to evaluate the P(0). Under our experimental conditions, 0.3 μM 1-NOP and 1.2 μM N-AcO-AAF resulted in this level of adduct formation/20-kb strand of the HPRT gene (Table 2). This level of damage reduced the colony-forming ability (i.e. the survival) of treated cells to 8% in the case of 1-NOP and 51% in the case of N-AcO-AAF. These results are in excellent agreement with previous results from this laboratory correlating survival of colony-forming ability with the frequency of such adducts induced in the overall genome of excision repair-proficient fibroblasts as determined using labeled carcinogen(28Heflich R.H. Hazard R.M. Lommel L. Scribner J.A. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1980; 29: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Patton J.D. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). If the level of adduct formation in the 5′-half of the HPRT gene is similar to that in the overall genome, the data indicate that under the conditions used in the present study, UvrABC recognized and incised the majority of the adducts induced by either agent. We determined the rate of nucleotide excision repair of adducts induced in DNA by the carcinogens 1-NOP and N-AcO-AAF in the individual strands of the HPRT gene and in the overall genome (global repair). Our results indicate that dG-C8-AP is repaired rapidly and that the excision repair is preferential and strand-specific and twice as rapid as the rate of excision of corresponding dG-N2-BP. In contrast, we found that excision of dG-C8-AF proceeded very slowly, much slower that dG-N2-BP, and was not strand-specific. Yet our data on interference with transcription (Fig. 5), showed that only 1.6 dG-N2-BP were required to reduce transcription to 37% of that directed by the unmodified template while 6.8-7.0 dG-C8-AP or dG-C8-AF were required to do so. These data are in good agreement with the degree of interference with elongation by T7 RNApolymerase presented by site specifically placed dG-N2-BP(30Choi D.-J. Marino-Alessandri D.J. Geacintov N.E. Scicchitano D.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), or dG-C8-AF(31Chen Y.-H. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5849-5855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Caution must be exercised in extrapolating from in vitro transcription assays to the behavior of human RNA polymerases in vivo. However, Sorcher and Cordeiro-Stone (32Soscher D.H. Cordeiro-Stone M. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1093-1096Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) showed that the absence of excision repair, 2.1 dG-N2-BP reduced transcription by human RNA polymerases of a transfected reporter gene to 37% of control. This is in agreement with the value of 1.6 found in the in vitro assay reported in this study for the same adduct. Xenopus RNA polymerase III has been reported to be blocked to a greater extent by site-specifically placed dG-C8-AF than predicted from in vitro assays(33Chen Y.-H. Matsumato Y. Shibutani S. Bogahagen D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9583-9587Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, if human RNA polymerase II were also blocked by such lesions to a greater extent than predicted, our conclusions would still hold, namely, that the rate at which cells carry out preferential, strand-specific repair is not determined solely by the degree to which the adducts being excised block transcription. Comparison of the structure of these adducts (Fig. 1) reveals that they are quite similar, although dG-C8-AP has four aromatic rings, whereas dG-C8-AF has two aromatic rings connected by a cyclopentane ring. NMR analysis of the conformation adopted by duplex DNA containing dG-C8-AF shows that the adduct does not cause substantial helix perturbation (34Broyde S. Hingerty B. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2423-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The adducted guanine remains in the normal anti conformation and is available for base pairing(35Hingerty B. Broyde S. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1986; 4: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The adduct preferentially resides in the major groove of a relatively undisturbed B-type DNA(34Broyde S. Hingerty B. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2423-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 35Hingerty B. Broyde S. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1986; 4: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). More recently, Cho et al.(18Cho B.P. Beland F.A. Marques M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1373-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported that the planar arylamine has minor conformers that may represent stacking interactions with neighboring bases, which could cause significant local conformational perturbation. Much less information on the conformation adopted by DNA containing dG-C8-AP is available, but Nolan et al.(17Nolan S.J. Vyas R.R. Hingerty B.E. Ellis S. Shapiro R. Carcinogenesis. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) showed that such adducts also lie in the major groove of DNA and cause little helical distortion but that there may be significant stacking interactions with neighboring bases. Despite the apparent structural similarity of the two kinds of adducts, previous studies from this laboratory have shown marked differences in their cytotoxic and mutagenic effects. In a shuttle vector system, in which dG-C8-AP (23Yang J.-L. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or dG-C8-AF(36) were formed in plasmid pZ189 in vitro and the plasmid was allowed to replicate in repair-proficient human cells and then analyzed for mutations induced in a bacterial target gene carried on the plasmid, dG-C8-AP was found to be 4 times as effective in interfering with bacterial transformation than dG-C8-AF. Nevertheless, the frequency of mutations induced in the supF gene during replication of the plasmid in human cells was similar, as were the kinds of mutations seen. The location of base substitutions in the target gene (spectrum) was not identical(23Yang J.-L. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Mah M.C.-M. Maher V.M. Thomas H. Reid T.M. King C.M. McCormick J.J. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Earlier studies in this laboratory on the cytotoxic and mutagenic effect of dG-C8-AP and dG-C8-AF in repair-proficient human cells showed that a level of 25 dG-C8-AP/106 nucleotides reduces the surviving fraction of a population of treated cells to 37% (29Patton J.D. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); dG-C8-AF is much less cytotoxic, i.e. 50 such adducts/106 nucleotides are needed to reduce survival to 37% in these cells(28Heflich R.H. Hazard R.M. Lommel L. Scribner J.A. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1980; 29: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). What is more, at a level of 25 adducts/106 nucleotides, dG-C8-AP yields 4 times as many HPRT mutants as dG-C8-AF(28Heflich R.H. Hazard R.M. Lommel L. Scribner J.A. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1980; 29: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 37Aust G.A. Drinkwater N.R. Debien K. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mutat. Res. 1984; 125: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the observed differences in cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and rates of repair of structurally-related adducts may well lie in the local conformational alterations induced by DNA-adduct formation. Although limited data exist on the structure of dG-C8-AP and dG-C8-AF, general structural features that influence the biological response to these adducts can be inferred by comparison to the extensively studied BPDE adducts. In contrast to dG-C8-AP or dG-C8-AF, BPDE adducts form primarily at the N2 position of guanine, a site of base pairing, but the reorientation of the adducted guanine causes the (+)-anti-BPDE adduct to lie in the minor groove, with the pyrenyl ring oriented toward the 5′-end of the modified strand where it causes little helical distortion(12Cosman M. de los Santos C. Fiala R. Hingerty B.E. Singh S.B. Ibanez V. Margulis L.A. Live D. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

BPDE adducts (39Yang L.-L. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mutat. Res. 1982; 94: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) are significantly more cytotoxic and more mutagenic than dG-C8-AP (29Patton J.D. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J.

Res. 1984; 125: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Like dG-C8-AP, BPDE-induced adducts are repaired from the human HPRT gene in a strand-specific manner(3Chen R.-H. Maher V.M.

(The half-life of 1-NOP adducts in the transcribed strand was 4 h; in the nontranscribed strand was 8 h; and in the overall genome was 10 h, compared with 7.5, 15, and 24 h, respectively, for BPDE adducts.) Sancar and colleagues (40Huang J.-C. Hsu D.S. Kazantsev A. Sancar A. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12213-12217Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) have recently proposed a model to explain the substrate specificity of the human repair excinuclease system in which the recognition subunit forms a stable complex with DNA in the region of adducted bases. Formation of the stable complex includes melting of the DNA in the region of the adduct. Such local unwinding is facilitated by adducts that interfere with base pairing, such as the N2-guanine adduct formed by BPDE. However, this model does not explain why an adduct such as dG-C8-AP, which lies in the major groove and does not interfere with base pairing, is repaired so efficiently, nor why the structurally related dG-C8-AF is repaired so poorly. Our data indicate that the rate and mode (i.e. global versus transcription-coupled mechanisms) of excision repair are determined by a complex interplay of adduct structure, its accessibility to repair enzymes, its ability to arrest transcription, and local DNA conformation.

Polymerization of deoxy-Hb S-Kempsey, which shows high oxygen affinity and increased dimer dissociation, required about 2- and 6-fold higher hemoglobin concentrations than deoxy-Hb S for polymerization in low and high phosphate concentrations, and its kinetic pattern of polymerization was biphasic. In contrast, oxy- or CO Hb S-Kansas, which shows low oxygen affinity and increased dimer dissociation, polymerized at a slightly higher critical concentration than that required for polymerization of deoxy-Hb S in both low and high phosphate buffers. Polymerization of oxy- and CO Hb S-Kansas was linear and showed no delay time, which is similar to oversaturated oxy- or CO Hb S. These results suggest that nuclei formation, which occurs during the delay time prior to deoxy-Hb S polymerization, does not occur in T state oxy-Hb S-Kansas, even though the critical concentration for polymerization of T state oxy-Hb S-Kansas is similar to that of T state deoxy-Hb S.

Oxygen binding has a dramatic effect on Hb S polymerization. Deoxygenated Hb S forms gels, while oxygenated Hb S does not(1Harris J.W. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1950; 75: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The reason for this difference between oxy and deoxy forms of Hb S is the marked change in quaternary conformation of the hemoglobin molecule upon deoxygenation(2Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 288: 726-739Crossref Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 3Bunn H.F. Forget B. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1986: 452-564Google Scholar). When normal hemoglobin is fully deoxygenated, most of the molecules assume the T 1The abbreviations used are: TtenseRrelaxed. structure, which has a relatively low affinity for oxygen and other heme ligands. Conversely, normal oxyhemoglobin exists almost exclusively in the R conformation and has a relatively high affinity for heme ligands such as oxygen. Structural alterations that affect the equilibrium between T and R states are expected to have a marked effect on hemoglobin function as well as Hb S polymerization. X-ray crystallographic studies show that hemoglobin can assume two different quaternary structures: one characteristic of unliganded (T) and the other of liganded (R) hemoglobin(2Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 288: 726-739Crossref Scopus (2220) Google Scholar). tense relaxed. The key to Hb S polymerization is the presence of Val-β6 and the formation of a hydrophobic acceptor pocket between E and F helices that occurs in the T state but is absent in the R state(3Bunn H.F. Forget B. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1986: 452-564Google Scholar, 4Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution and Pathology. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Inc., Menlo Park, CA1983: 125-164Google Scholar). However, if a specific amino acid substitution decreases stability of the T structure, then transition to the R state is favored and the molecule exhibits increased oxygen affinity and decreased heme-heme interaction. This has been demonstrated for a number of chemically modified hemoglobins as well as for many hemoglobin variants(3Bunn H.F. Forget B. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1986: 452-564Google Scholar). Hb Kempsey (α2β2Asn-99) and Hb Kansas (α2β2Thr-102) are well studied examples(3Bunn H.F. Forget B.

Hb Kempsey is a β-chain variant in which Asp-β99 is replaced by Asn(5Reed C.S. Hampson R. Gordon S. Jones R.T. Novy M.J. Brimhall B. Edwards M.J. Koler R.D. Blood. 1968; 31: 623-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In deoxy-Hb A, Asp-β99 normally forms an important hydrogen bond with Tyr-α42 at the α1β2 interface(11Perutz M.F. Ten Eyck L.F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1971; 36: 295-310Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Upon oxygenation, the two subunits shift in a dovetail fashion, so that the β99-α42 hydrogen bond is broken and another one forms between Asp-α94 and Asn-β102. In Hb Kempsey, substitution of Asp with Asn at β99 prevents formation of the former hydrogen bond with Tyr-α42 and therefore decreases stability of “deoxy” or T state structures. Thus, when this tetramer is fully deoxygenated, it remains partially in the R state. In contrast, Hb Kansas is a β-chain variant in which Asn-β102 is replaced by Thr(14Greer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 59: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This position is also an important site at the α1β2 interface, which is involved in the transition between the oxy and deoxy conformation of hemoglobin. Hb Kansas has a low oxygen affinity because the hydrogen bond that usually occurs between Asn-β102 and Asp-α94 in normal Hb A, which functions to stabilize the oxy conformation, is absent, thus shifting the equilibrium toward the deoxy (T) conformation(3Bunn H.F. Forget B. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1986: 452-564Google Scholar, 12Bonventura J. Riggs A. J. Biol.

Asp-β99 and Asn-β102 in Hb S are located internally at the α1β2 interface and are not exposed to the surface of tetrameric hemoglobin. These positions are involved in αβ interactions, which lead to formation of tetramers, and are not defined as interaction sites in Hb S polymers. These amino acids do affect the R to T quaternary structural transition of hemoglobin tetramers. In this report, we have studied polymerization of R state deoxy-Hb S and T state oxy or CO Hb S by preparing Hb S-Kempsey (α2β2Val-6, Asn-99) and Hb S-Kansas (α2β2Val-6, Thr-102) using a yeast expression system (19Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) in an attempt to clarify the role that quaternary structural changes associated with T to R state transition play in polymerization of Hb S. The plasmid pGS389 Hb S contains the full-length human α- and βS-globin cDNAs under transcriptional control of dual GGAP promoters as well as a partially functional yeast LEU2d gene and the URA3 gene for selection in yeast(19Adachi K.

Stetler G.L. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGS189 βS contains a single GGAP promoter and βS-globin cDNA and was constructed by mutagenesis and subcloning as described previously(19Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The basic strategy for site-specific mutagenesis at β99 or β102 involves recombination polymerase chain reaction as described previously(19Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Asn-β99 and Thr-β102 βS-chain variants were subjected to DNA sequence analysis of the entire β-globin cDNA using site-specific primers and fluorescently tagged terminators in a cycle sequencing reaction in which extension products were analyzed on an automated DNA sequencer(19Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The mutated β-globin cDNA region was then excised by XhoI digestion and subcloned back into the XhoI site of the expression vector pGS389(19Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Yeast growth, plasmid transformation, induction, and purification of recombinant hemoglobin tetramers were described previously(19Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol.

Abnormal forms of the recombinant hemoglobins, which include sulfhaem-containing hemoglobin and/or misfolded hemoglobin, were eliminated by chromatographic purification(21Adachi K. Konitzer P. Lai C.H. Kim J. Surrey S. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The purified α- and β-chains of the Hb S variants containing Asn-β99 or Thr-β102 were subjected to electrospray mass analysis (Fisons Instruments, VG Biotech, Altricham, UK) using the multiply charged ion peaks from the α-globin chain (Mr = 15,126.4) as an external reference for mass scale calibrations(22Shackleton C.H. Witkowska H.E. Desiderio D.M. Mass Spectrometry: Clinical and Biomedical Applications. 2. Plenum Press, New York1994: 135-199Google Scholar). Val-β6 and N-terminal amino acid sequences of purified α- and β-chains were directly confirmed by Edman degradation employing a pulsed liquid, protein sequencer (ABI 477A, Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Absorption spectra of the purified hemoglobin variants were recorded using a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer. Circular dichroism spectra of the variants were recorded using an Aviv model 62 DS instrument employing a 0.1-cm light path cuvette at ~10 μM Hb concentrations. Methods for determination of oxygen dissociation curves and electrophoretic analysis of hemoglobins and their kinetics of polymerization in high phosphate buffers were performed as reported previously(19Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 23Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12273-12276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetics of polymerization and solubility of hemoglobins in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, as well as measurements of minimum concentrations required for gel formation were performed as described previously with slight modification(24Hofrichter J. Ross P.D. Eaton W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3035-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 25Richard A.J. Mehanna A.S. Abraham D.J. Hemoglobin. 1991; 15: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The time course for the gelation of deoxy-Hb S in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 30°C was done by the temperature jump method by monitoring change in optical density at 800 nm using an anaerobic cylindrical cuvette with a 2-mm diameter. Solubility of deoxy-Hb S was measured by the determination of soluble deoxy-Hb S concentration after centrifugation at 30°C for 3 h at 130,000 × g. Tetramer-dimer dissociation properties of hemoglobins were evaluated by monitoring fluorescence changes of haptoglobin using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (26Yanase H. Cahill S. Martin De LLano J.J. Manning L.R. Schneider K. Chait B.T. Vandegriff K.D. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant Hb S variants containing Asn-β99 or Thr-β102 (Hb S Dβ99N and Hb S Nβ102T, respectively) migrated as single bands following cellulose acetate electrophoresis at pH 8.6 with mobilities intermediate between Hb S and Hb C (Fig. 1). The β99 Hb S variant demonstrated a higher positive surface charge than the β102 Hb S variant and migrated closer to Hb C. It is interesting to note that isoelectric focusing of a recently reported recombinant Hb A variant containing Lys-β99 made using the same yeast expression system showed two bands(26Yanase H. Cahill S. Martin De LLano J.J. Manning L.R. Schneider K. Chait B.T. Vandegriff K.D. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), while both β99 and β102 Hb S variants in our study migrated as single bands on isoelectric focusing. The reason for the existence of two electrophoretic forms for the Hb A variant containing Lys-β99 is not known(26Yanase H. Cahill S. Martin De LLano J.J. Manning L.R. Schneider K. Chait B.T. Vandegriff K.D. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mass spectral analysis of Hb S variants containing Asn-β99 or Thr-β102 showed the expected β-globin chain molecular masses, 15,835.1 and 15,823.8 Da, respectively, which corresponded to expected masses of 15,836 and 15,824 Da, respectively. Absorption spectra of these two Hb S variants were the same as those of native and recombinant Hb S(19Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra in the region from 190 to 290 nm for the Hb S variants were also similar to that of native Hb S (Fig. 2), indicating that these substitutions do not significantly affect globin folding and/or overall secondary structure of hemoglobin tetramers. It is known that Hb Kempsey and Hb Kansas have higher and lower oxygen affinity than normal Hb A, respectively(6Bunn H.F. Wohl R.C. Bradley T.B. Cooley M. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7402-7409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bonventura J. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 980-991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxygen affinities of Hb S Dβ99N and Hb S Nβ102T differed from Hb S as anticipated; the former had higher and the latter lower oxygen affinity than Hb S or Hb A (Fig. 3). P50 values in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 20°C for the Asn-β99 and Thr-β102 Hb S variants were 0.8 and 18, respectively, compared with 6.5 for recombinant Hb S(19Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Hill coefficients for both variants were reduced to 1.2 and 1.5 for Hb S Dβ99N and Hb S Nβ102T, respectively, compared with 2.6 for Hb S (Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Differences in oxygen affinity for Hb S Dβ99N and Hb S Nβ102T compared with Hb S should be correlated with differences in kinetics of dimer formation as has been shown for deoxy-Hb Kempsey and oxy-Hb Kansas(6Bunn H.F. Wohl R.C. Bradley T.B. Cooley M. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7402-7409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bonventura J. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 980-991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tetramer-dimer dissociation properties of the two Hb S variants were measured by monitoring quenching of haptoglobin fluorescence caused by existing hemoglobin dimers (Table 2). Deoxy-Hb S Nβ102T showed similar dimer formation properties to that of deoxy-Hb S, while deoxy-Hb S Dβ99N exhibited increased dimer formation. In contrast, oxy-Hb S Nβ102T showed a slightly increased tendency, while oxy-Hb S Dβ99N showed a similar tendency for dimer formation as oxy-Hb S.TABLE II Open table in a new tab Polymerization properties of the deoxy forms of the two Hb S variants were studied in vitro by the temperature jump method employing 1.8 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 30°C(23Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12273-12276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerization of deoxy-Hb S is characterized by a delay time prior to polymer formation whose length depends on hemoglobin concentration: the lower the concentration, the longer the delay time(23Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12273-12276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deoxy (T) structure of Hb Kempsey (α2β2Asn-99) is destabilized by the Asn for Asp substitution at β99, which results in Hb Kempsey remaining partially in the R state upon deoxygenation(3Bunn H.F. Forget B. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1986: 452-564Google Scholar, 6Bunn H.F. Wohl R.C. Bradley T.B. Cooley M. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7402-7409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deoxy-Hb S Dβ99N was deoxygenated in the presence of more than 100-fold excess Na2S204 after exposure to nitrogen(23Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12273-12276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The optical absorption spectrum of deoxygenated Hb S Dβ99N was characteristic of hemoglobin in the deoxy form. Deoxy-Hb S Dβ99N required about a 6-fold higher hemoglobin concentration than deoxy-Hb S for polymerization. At higher concentrations (more than 10-fold that of deoxy-Hb S), deoxy-Hb S Dβ99N polymerization occurred without a delay time by a linear and not a nucleation-controlled mechanism (Fig. 4). At lower hemoglobin concentrations (<330 mg/dl), kinetics of polymerization of deoxy-Hb S Dβ99N were biphasic, occurred without a delay time, reached a plateau, and then continued following sigmoidal kinetics (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the time required to reach the plateau of the second phase of polymer formation was longer than that of the first. Logarithmic plots of the initiation time for the second phase of polymerization for deoxy-Hb S Dβ99N versus hemoglobin concentration showed a straight line (Fig. 5), and polymerization was reversed after exposure to CO or by lowering the temperature to 0°C. We also performed gelation studies of deoxy-Hb S Dβ99N in 0.1 M phosphate buffer in order to assess polymerization properties near more physiological conditions. Under these conditions, deoxy-Hb S Dβ99N required about a 2-fold higher (47 g/dl) concentration than deoxy-Hb S for polymerization (Table 3).Figure 5:Relationship between log of reciprocal delay time and hemoglobin concentration. Polymerization studies of hemoglobins at different concentrations were performed in 1.8 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 30°C. •, ▵, and □ refer to native deoxy-Hb S, deoxy-Hb S Dβ99N, and deoxy-Hb S Nβ102T, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE III Open table in a new tab In contrast to Hb Kempsey, the deoxy form of Hb S Nβ102T (Hb S-Kansas) polymerized like deoxy-Hb S (Fig. 6); however, a small amount of detectable polymers formed prior to the major phase of polymerization. Logarithmic plots of delay time versus hemoglobin concentration for the major phase of deoxy-Hb S Nβ102T polymerization showed a straight line slightly shifted to the right of the line for deoxy-Hb S (Fig. 5). It is known that the oxy structure is destabilized in Hb Kansas, which favors the low oxygen affinity T (deoxy) state(3Bunn H.F. Forget B. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1986: 452-564Google Scholar, 12Bonventura J. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 980-991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerization of liganded oxy- and CO-Hb S-Kansas occurred at a slightly higher concentration than that required for deoxy-Hb S polymerization; however, polymer formation was not accompanied by a delay time prior to polymerization, and oxy-Hb S Nβ102T polymerized linearly like oxy- and CO-Hb S (27Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1824-1830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). A hemoglobin concentration 20 times less than that for oxy-Hb S was, however, required to initiate polymerization. The CO form of Hb S Nβ102T also polymerized linearly like the oxy form(27Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1824-1830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerization of oxy, CO, and deoxy-Hb S Nβ102T was reversed by decreasing the temperature to 0°C; however, when deoxy-Hb S Nβ102T polymers were exposed to CO, about 60% of the polymers depolymerized (Fig. 8) in contrast to complete depolymerization for deoxy-Hb S polymers(19Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that polymerization of oxy-Hb S Nβ102T in 1.8 M phosphate buffer was not affected by addition of inositol hexaphosphate, even though organic phosphates are known to stabilize the T state of liganded Hb Kansas(18Ogawa S.

Depolymerization of deoxy-Hb S Nβ102T (98 mg/dl) polymers in 1.8 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 30°C was evaluated after exposure to CO and cooling the temperature to 0°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also evaluated gelation and polymerization of CO Hb S Nβ102T at room temperature in low phosphate concentration (0.1 M) buffer, pH 7.0, under more physiological conditions. CO Hb S Nβ102T formed gels at a concentration of 25.7 g/dl compared with 24 g/dl for deoxy-Hb S and 24.5 g/dl for deoxy-Hb SNβ102T (Table 2). CO Hb S Nβ102T polymerized linearly without a delay time in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 30°C (Fig. 9), which is similar to results in 1.8 M phosphate buffer (Fig. 7). Solubility after polymerization of CO Hb S Nβ102T in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 30°C was 19.2 versus 17 g/dl for deoxy-Hb S. Depolymerization of CO Hb S Nβ102T in low phosphate buffer was also observed upon lowering the temperature to 0°C. Total polymer formed in 1.8 M phosphate buffer as a function of hemoglobin concentration was also determined in order to evaluate effects of the Asn-β99 and Thr-β102 substitutions on the critical concentrations required for polymerization. Critical concentration depends on deoxyhemoglobin solubility: the higher the solubility, the higher the concentration required for polymerization. Polymer formation for the two variants increased linearly with increases in initial hemoglobin concentration (Fig. 10). Critical concentration for polymer formation was then determined by extrapolation of the lines to zero turbidity(19Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Values for deoxy-Hb SNβ102T, CO Hb SNβ102T, and deoxy-Hb SDβ99N were 1.2-, 1.6-, and 6.3-fold higher, respectively, than that for deoxy-Hb S. The functional properties of normal Hb A and polymerization of Hb S depend on transition of their three-dimensional conformation, which accompanies the addition and removal of oxygen. X-ray crystallographic studies show that hemoglobin tetramers exist in equilibrium between two quaternary conformations: R and T(2Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 288: 726-739Crossref Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 11Perutz M.F. Ten Eyck L.F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1971; 36: 295-310Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The change from T to the R conformation involves a well defined series of structural changes, including rupture of the salt bridges that stabilize the T conformation and rotation of the β-chains relative to the α-chains(3Bunn H.F. Forget B. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1986: 452-564Google Scholar, 11Perutz M.F. Ten Eyck L.F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1971; 36: 295-310Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Intramolecular “movements” also occur during conformational isomerization at the α1β2 interface. Structural alterations that affect the equilibrium between R and T states are expected to have marked effects on hemoglobin function and Hb S polymerization. Thus, if a specific amino acid substitution decreases T structure stability, then transition to the R state would be expected to occur at an earlier stage in ligation, and this hemoglobin would exhibit increased oxygen affinity and decreased heme-heme interaction. In contrast, substitutions that decrease R structure stability result in tetramers with decreased oxygen affinity and increased heme-heme interaction. These results have been observed for a number of hemoglobin variants. Both Hb Kempsey and Hb Kansas, which have amino acid substitutions at the α1β2 interface, are well studied examples(5Reed C.S.

In most respects, deoxy-Hb Kempsey with high oxygen affinity bears more resemblance to oxyhemoglobin A than to deoxyhemoglobin A and is partially in the R conformation(6Bunn H.F. Wohl R.C. Bradley T.B. Cooley M. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7402-7409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lindstrom T.R. Baldassare J.J. Bunn H.F. Ho C.

Recombinant Hb S-Kempsey exhibited high oxygen affinity with low cooperativity. Polymerization of deoxy-Hb S-Kempsey occurred at higher concentrations than deoxy-Hb S, and kinetic studies suggested polymerization by linear as well as nucleation-controlled mechanisms (19Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 27Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1824-1830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that Hb S-Kempsey is not completely converted to the R state upon deoxygenation. Asp-β99 is located in the interior of Hb S, but yet the change from Asp-β99 to Asn in Hb S-Kempsey inhibits polymerization, no doubt by affecting the quaternary structure. These results indicate that inhibition and/or acceleration of polymerization of Hb S is not always controlled by residues at direct interaction sites of deoxy-Hb S polymers. We are now attempting to define effects of this substitution at the allosteric interface of Hb S on polymer and crystal structure. Hb Kansas contains Thr instead of Asp at β102, which is also a site at the α1β2 interface (3Bunn H.F. Forget B. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1986: 452-564Google Scholar, 12Bonventura J. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 980-991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to Hb Kempsey, Hb Kansas has decreased oxygen affinity, which is due in part to a relatively unstable R structure, thereby shifting the equilibrium to that of the T structure. Our results with Hb S-Kansas showed low oxygen affinity, and liganded forms had decreased solubility, thereby facilitating polymerization like deoxy-Hb S. The critical concentrations for polymerization of liganded forms of Hb S-Kansas were similar to the deoxy form of Hb S-Kansas. Facilitation of polymerization of liganded hemoglobin can be explained by shifting conformational equilibrium to favor the T state like Hb Kansas. However, the kinetics of polymerization of liganded Hb S-Kansas were different from those of deoxy-Hb S and deoxy-Hb S-Kansas, which were accompanied with a delay time prior to polymerization. These results suggest that the surface structure of liganded Hb S-Kansas resembles that of the T structure of Hb A or Hb S. The lack of nucleation during polymerization of oxy or CO Hb S-Kansas, even though the T-state is favored, may be caused by insufficient protein-protein interactions that are required to form deoxy-Hb S or deoxy-Hb S-Kansas nuclei. There are seven known natural hemoglobin variants with substitutions for Asp-β99(5Reed C.S. Hampson R. Gordon S. Jones R.T. Novy M.J. Brimhall B. Edwards M.J. Koler R.D.

Recently, recombinant Hb A containing Asp-β99 → Lys and a double mutant (Asp-β99 → Asn and Tyr-α42 → Asp), which were produced in yeast and Escherichia coli expression systems, respectively, were characterized(26Yanase H.

All these variants show increased oxygen affinity with reduced cooperativity. There are also three known natural hemoglobin variants with substitutions at β102, and recombinant Hb A Dβ102A made in yeast was also recently reported(36Nagel R. Lynfield J. Johnson J. Landau L. Bookchin R.M. Harris M.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 295: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Arous N. Braconnier F. Thillet J. Blouquit Y. Galacteros F. Chevrier M. Bordahandy C.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These variants show decreased oxygen affinity with reduced cooperativity. Functional properties of hemoglobin variants with substitutions at β99 and β102, which involve the α1β2 contact, have been attributed to increased dissociation of the variant tetrameric hemoglobin dimers. Deoxy-Hb S-Kempsey and oxy-Hb S-Kansas show increased dissociation to dimers like Hb Kempsey and Hb Kansas(6Bunn H.F. Wohl R.C. Bradley T.B. Cooley M. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7402-7409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bonventura J. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 980-991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies of recombinant Hb A Dβ99K and Hb A Nβ102A indicated that dimerization properties of these variants depended on hemoglobin concentration: the higher the concentration, the lower the tetramer-dimer dissociation constant of hemoglobin(26Yanase H. Cahill S. Martin De LLano J.J. Manning L.R. Schneider K. Chait B.T. Vandegriff K.D. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38Yanase H. Manning L.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although polymerization properties of dimeric forms of Hb S are not known, the effect of dimerization on polymerization of Hb S-Kansas and Hb S-Kempsey should be negligible, since hemoglobin concentrations used for polymerization in both high and low phosphate buffers (50-100 μM and 1.5-6 mM, respectively) are too high to favor dimer formation. Polymerization properties of oxy- or CO Hb S-Kansas and deoxy-Hb S-Kempsey in low and high phosphate buffers can therefore be attributed to the quaternary and tertiary structural differences from deoxy-Hb S rather than dimerization differences. It is interesting to note that deoxy-Hb Kansas crystallizes like deoxy-Hb A and that exposure of these crystals to CO results in formation of two new crystal forms that are not identical to crystals formed upon deoxygenation(15Anderson L. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, deoxy-Hb A crystals dissolve upon exposure to CO. These results are similar to those of exposure of deoxy-Hb S-Kansas polymers to CO. Polymers of CO Hb S-Kansas may also remain in the T state conformation, which may not favor CO-induced depolymerization. Structural analyses of these Hb S variants are now required to further our understanding of the relationship between quaternary structure, hemoglobin function, and polymerization of Hb S.
