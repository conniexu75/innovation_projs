https://openalex.org/W2886563621,"Enhancing global food security by increasing the productivity of green revolution varieties of cereals risks increasing the collateral environmental damage produced by inorganic nitrogen fertilizers. Improvements in the efficiency of nitrogen use of crops are therefore essential; however, they require an in-depth understanding of the co-regulatory mechanisms that integrate growth, nitrogen assimilation and carbon fixation. Here we show that the balanced opposing activities and physical interactions of the rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 4 (GRF4) transcription factor and the growth inhibitor DELLA confer homeostatic co-regulation of growth and the metabolism of carbon and nitrogen. GRF4 promotes and integrates nitrogen assimilation, carbon fixation and growth, whereas DELLA inhibits these processes. As a consequence, the accumulation of DELLA that is characteristic of green revolution varieties confers not only yield-enhancing dwarfism, but also reduces the efficiency of nitrogen use. However, the nitrogen-use efficiency of green revolution varieties and grain yield are increased by tipping the GRF4-DELLA balance towards increased GRF4 abundance. Modulation of plant growth and metabolic co-regulation thus enables novel breeding strategies for future sustainable food security and a new green revolution."
https://openalex.org/W2885633614,"The olfactory system must recognize and discriminate amongst an enormous variety of chemicals in the environment. To contend with such diversity, insects have evolved a family of odorant-gated ion channels comprised of a highly conserved co-receptor (Orco) and a divergent odorant receptor (OR) that confers chemical specificity. Here, we present the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of an Orco homomer from the parasitic fig wasp Apocrypta bakeri at 3.5 Å resolution, providing structural insight into this receptor family. Orco possesses a novel channel architecture, with four subunits symmetrically arranged around a central pore that diverges into four lateral conduits that open to the cytosol. The Orco tetramer has few inter-subunit interactions within the membrane and is bound together by a small cytoplasmic anchor domain. The minimal sequence conservation among ORs maps largely to the pore and anchor domain, shedding light on how the architecture of this receptor family accommodates its remarkable sequence diversity and facilitates the evolution of odour tuning. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the insect Orco subunit, which forms ion channels with diverse olfactory receptors, reveals a tetrameric cation channel and sheds light on insect olfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2886311882,"Living organisms rely on simultaneous reactions catalysed by mutually compatible and selective enzymes to synthesize complex natural products and other metabolites. To combine the advantages of these biological systems with the reactivity of artificial chemical catalysts, chemists have devised sequential, concurrent, and cooperative chemoenzymatic reactions that combine enzymatic and artificial catalysts1–9. Cooperative chemoenzymatic reactions consist of interconnected processes that generate products in yields and selectivities that cannot be obtained when the two reactions are carried out sequentially with their respective substrates2,7. However, such reactions are difficult to develop because chemical and enzymatic catalysts generally operate in different media at different temperatures and can deactivate each other1–9. Owing to these constraints, the vast majority of cooperative chemoenzymatic processes that have been reported over the past 30 years can be divided into just two categories: chemoenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolutions of racemic alcohols and amines, and enzymatic reactions requiring the simultaneous regeneration of a cofactor2,4,5. New approaches to the development of chemoenzymatic reactions are needed to enable valuable chemical transformations beyond this scope. Here we report a class of cooperative chemoenzymatic reaction that combines photocatalysts that isomerize alkenes with ene-reductases that reduce carbon–carbon double bonds to generate valuable enantioenriched products. This method enables the stereoconvergent reduction of E/Z mixtures of alkenes or reduction of the unreactive stereoisomers of alkenes in yields and enantiomeric excesses that match those obtained from the reduction of the pure, more reactive isomers. The system affords a range of enantioenriched precursors to biologically active compounds. More generally, these results show that the compatibility between photocatalysts and enzymes enables chemoenzymatic processes beyond cofactor regeneration and provides a general strategy for converting stereoselective enzymatic reactions into stereoconvergent ones. A cooperative chemoenzymatic reaction combines photocatalytic alkene isomerization with enzymatic reduction to generate enantioenriched products in a stereoconvergent manner."

We present an in silico approach to identifying neoepitopes derived from intron retention events in tumor transcriptomes. Using mass spectrometry immunopeptidome analysis, we show that retained intron neoepitopes are processed and presented on MHC I on the surface of cancer cell lines. RNA-derived neoepitopes should be considered for prospective personalized cancer vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2885750548,"In zebrafish, Müller glia (MG) are a source of retinal stem cells that can replenish damaged retinal neurons and restore vision1. In mammals, however, MG do not spontaneously re-enter the cell cycle to generate a population of stem or progenitor cells that differentiate into retinal neurons. Nevertheless, the regenerative machinery may exist in the mammalian retina, as retinal injury can stimulate MG proliferation followed by limited neurogenesis2-7. Therefore, there is still a fundamental question regarding whether MG-derived regeneration can be exploited to restore vision in mammalian retinas. Gene transfer of β-catenin stimulates MG proliferation in the absence of injury in mouse retinas8. Here we report that following gene transfer of β-catenin, cell-cycle-reactivated MG can be reprogrammed to generate rod photoreceptors by subsequent gene transfer of transcription factors essential for rod cell fate specification and determination. MG-derived rods restored visual responses in Gnat1rd17Gnat2cpfl3 double mutant mice, a model of congenital blindness9,10, throughout the visual pathway from the retina to the primary visual cortex. Together, our results provide evidence of vision restoration after de novo MG-derived genesis of rod photoreceptors in mammalian retinas."
https://openalex.org/W3105034142,"The chemical composition of an exoplanet is a key ingredient in constraining its formation history. Iron is the most abundant transition metal, but has never been directly detected in an exoplanet due to its highly refractory nature. KELT-9b (HD 195689b) is the archetype of the class of ultra-hot Jupiters that straddle the transition between stars and gas-giant exoplanets and serve as distinctive laboratories for studying atmospheric chemistry, because of its high equilibrium temperature of 4050 +/- 180 K. These properties imply that its atmosphere is a tightly constrained chemical system that is expected to be nearly in chemical equilibrium and cloud-free. It was previously predicted that the spectral lines of iron will be detectable in the visible range of wavelengths. At these high temperatures, iron and several other transition metals are not sequestered in molecules or cloud particles and exist solely in their atomic forms. Here, we report the direct detection of atomic neutral and singly-ionized iron (Fe and Fe+), and singly-ionized titanium (Ti+) in KELT-9b via the cross-correlation technique applied to high-resolution spectra obtained during the primary transit of the exoplanet."

https://openalex.org/W2885441485,"Immunotherapy strategies have been emerging as powerful weapons against cancer. Early clinical trials reveal that overall response to immunotherapy is low in breast cancer patients, suggesting that effective strategies to overcome resistance to immunotherapy are urgently needed. In this study, we investigated whether epigenetic reprograming by modulating histone methylation could enhance effector T lymphocyte trafficking and improve therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in breast cancer with focus on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. In silico analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data shows that expression of histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is inversely associated with the levels of cytotoxic T cell-attracting chemokines (C–C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), C–X–C motif chemokine ligand 9 and 10 (CXCL9, CXCL10)) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in clinical TNBC specimens. Tiling chromatin immunoprecipitation study showed that re-expression of chemokines by LSD1 inhibition is associated with increased H3K4me2 levels at proximal promoter regions. Rescue experiments using concurrent treatment with small interfering RNA or inhibitor of chemokine receptors blocked LSD1 inhibitor-enhanced CD8+ T cell migration, indicating a critical role of key T cell chemokines in LSD1-mediated CD8+ lymphocyte trafficking to the tumor microenvironment. In mice bearing TNBC xenograft tumors, anti-PD-1 antibody alone failed to elicit obvious therapeutic effect. However, combining LSD1 inhibitors with PD-1 antibody significantly suppressed tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis, which was associated with reduced Ki-67 level and augmented CD8+ T cell infiltration in xenograft tumors. Overall, these results suggest that LSD1 inhibition may be an effective adjuvant treatment with immunotherapy as a novel management strategy for poorly immunogenic breast tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2887478137,"Common genetic contributions to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reside in risk gene variants that individually have minimal effect sizes. As environmental factors that perturb neurodevelopment also underlie idiopathic ASD, it is crucial to identify altered regulators that can orchestrate multiple ASD risk genes during neurodevelopment. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins 1-4 (CPEB1-4) regulate the translation of specific mRNAs by modulating their poly(A)-tails and thereby participate in embryonic development and synaptic plasticity. Here we find that CPEB4 binds transcripts of most high-confidence ASD risk genes. The brains of individuals with idiopathic ASD show imbalances in CPEB4 transcript isoforms that result from decreased inclusion of a neuron-specific microexon. In addition, 9% of the transcriptome shows reduced poly(A)-tail length. Notably, this percentage is much higher for high-confidence ASD risk genes, correlating with reduced expression of the protein products of ASD risk genes. An equivalent imbalance in CPEB4 transcript isoforms in mice mimics the changes in mRNA polyadenylation and protein expression of ASD risk genes and induces ASD-like neuroanatomical, electrophysiological and behavioural phenotypes. Together, these data identify CPEB4 as a regulator of ASD risk genes."
https://openalex.org/W2887179852,"The follicular ovarian reserve, constituted by primordial follicles (PMFs), is established early in life, then keeps declining regularly along reproductive life. The maintenance of a normal female reproductive function implies the presence of a vast amount of dormant PMFs. This process involves a continuous repression of PMF activation into early growing follicle through the balance between factors activating the initiation of follicular growth, mainly actors of the PI3K signaling pathway, and inhibiting factors such as anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). Any disruption of this balance may induce follicle depletion and subsequent infertility. It has been recently proposed that cyclophosphamide (Cy), an alkylating agent commonly used for treating breast cancer, triggers PMF activation, further leading to premature ovarian insufficiency. Preventing chemotherapy-induced ovarian dysfunction might represent an interesting option for preserving optimal chances of natural or medically assisted conceptions after healing. The aim of the present study was to evaluate, in a model of Cy-treated pubertal mice, whether AMH administration might restrain PMF depletion. The counting of the total PMF number within mouse ovaries showed that recombinant AMH prevented Cy-induced PMF loss. Western blot analysis revealed activation of PI3K signaling pathway after Cy administration. After AMH injection, FOXO3A phosphorylation, a main actor of PMF activation, was significantly decreased. Taken together, these results support a protective role of AMH against Cy-induced follicular loss. We also provide evidence for a possible role of autophagy in the preservation of follicular pool reserve. Therefore, concomitant recombinant AMH administration during chemotherapy might offer a new option for preserving young patients' fertility.—Sonigo, C., Beau, I., Grynberg, M., Binart, N.

https://openalex.org/W2886367545,"The enteric viruses shed by different populations can be influenced by multiple factors including access to clean drinking water. We describe here the eukaryotic viral genomes in the feces of Ethiopian children participating in a clean water intervention trial.Fecal samples from 269 children with a mean age of 2.7 years were collected from 14 villages in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, half of which received a new hand-dug water well. Feces from these villages were then analyzed in 29 sample pools using viral metagenomics. A total of 127 different viruses belonging to 3 RNA and 3 DNA viral families were detected. Picornaviridae family sequence reads were the most commonly found, originating from 14 enterovirus and 6 parechovirus genotypes plus multiple members of four other picornavirus genera (cosaviruses, saliviruses, kobuviruses, and hepatoviruses). Picornaviruses with nearly identical capsid VP1 were detected in different pools reflecting recent spread of these viral strains. Next in read frequencies and positive pools were sequences from the Caliciviridae family including noroviruses GI and GII and sapoviruses. DNA viruses from multiple genera of the Parvoviridae family were detected (bocaviruses 1-4, bufavirus 3, and dependoparvoviruses), together with four species of adenoviruses and common anelloviruses shedding. RNA in the order Picornavirales and CRESS-DNA viral genomes, possibly originating from intestinal parasites or dietary sources, were also characterized. No significant difference was observed between the number of mammalian viruses shed from children from villages with and without a new water well.We describe an approach to estimate the efficacy of potentially virus transmission-reducing interventions and the first complete (DNA and RNA viruses) description of the enteric viromes of East African children. A wide diversity of human enteric viruses was found in both intervention and control groups. Mammalian enteric virome diversity was not reduced in children from villages with a new water well. This population-based sampling also provides a baseline of the enteric viruses present in Northern Ethiopia against which to compare future viromes."
https://openalex.org/W2887232259,"Tramadol is an analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pain caused by cancer, osteoarthritis, and other musculoskeletal diseases. Cytochrome P450 system metabolizes tramadol and induces oxidative stress in different organs. Therefore, the present study aims at investigating the changes in the activities and the protein expressions of CYPs isozymes (2E1, 3A4, 2B1/2), antioxidants status, free radicals levels after pretreatment of rats with Curcumin and/or Gallic as single- and/or repeated-doses before administration of tramadol. In repeated-dose treatments of rats with tramadol, the activities of cytochrome P450, cytochrome b5, and NADPH-cytochrome-c-reductase, and the antioxidant enzymes including glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and levels of glutathione were inhibited in the liver and the kidney of rats. Interestingly, such changes caused by tramadol restored to their normal levels after pretreatment of rats with either Curcumin and/or Gallic acid. On the other hand, repeated-dose treatment of rats with tramadol increased the activities of both dimethylnitrosamine N-demethylase I (DMN-dI), and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) compared to the control group. However, pretreatment of rats with Curcumin and/or Gallic acid prior to administration of tramadol restored the inhibited DMN-dI activity and its protein expression (CYP 2E1) to their normal levels. On the other hand, tramadol inhibited the activity of ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (ECOD) and suppressed its protein marker expression (CYP2B1/2), whereas Curcumin, Gallic acid and/or their mixture restored such changes to their normal levels. In conclusion, Curcumin and/or Gallic acid alleviated the adverse effects caused by tramadol. In addition, patients should be advice to take Curcumin and/or Gallic acid prior to tramadol treatment to alleviate the hepatic and renal toxicities caused by tramadol."
https://openalex.org/W2886535415,"We investigated the relationship of H. pylori stratified by cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA) status with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the general population of the United States (US). We utilized the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1988 to 1994 in this study. NAFLD was defined by ultrasonographic detection of hepatic steatosis in the absence of other known causes of liver diseases and significant alcohol consumption. Hepatic steatosis was assessed by parenchymal brightness, liver to kidney contrast, deep beam attenuation, bright vessel walls and gallbladder wall definition. Antibodies to H. pylori and cagA of participants were measured using H. pylori IgG and anti-cagA IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Among 5,404 participants, the prevalence of NAFLD was higher in H. pylori positive subjects (33.5±1.8%) compared to H. pylori negative subjects (26.1±1.7%, p <0.001). In terms of cagA protein status stratification, while cagA positive H. pylori group did not demonstrate an association with NAFLD (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.81–1.37), cagA negative H. pylori group was noted to have a significant association with NAFLD in a multivariable analysis (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.01–1.67). In conclusion, our study demonstrated that cagA negative H. pylori infection was an independent predictor of NAFLD in the US general population."
https://openalex.org/W2886100313,"Chemokine signaling regulates cell migration and tumor metastasis. CXCL12, a member of the chemokine family, and its receptor, CXCR4, a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), are key mediators of prostate-cancer (PC) bone metastasis. In PC cells androgens activate CXCR4 gene expression and receptor signaling on lipid rafts, which induces protease expression and cancer cell invasion. To identify novel lipid-raft-associated CXCR4 regulators supporting invasion/metastasis, we performed a SILAC-based quantitative proteomic analysis of lipid-rafts derived from PC3 stable cell lines with overexpression or knockdown of CXCR4. This analysis identified the evolutionarily conserved phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIα (PI4KIIIα), and SAC1 phosphatase that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate as potential candidate CXCR4 regulators. CXCR4 interacted with PI4KIIIα membrane targeting machinery recruiting them to the plasma membrane for PI4P production. Consistent with this interaction, PI4KIIIα was found tightly linked to the CXCR4 induced PC cell invasion. Thus, ablation of PI4KIIIα in CXCR4-expressing PC3 cells reduced cellular invasion in response to a variety of chemokines. Immunofluorescence microscopy in CXCR4-expressing cells revealed localized production of PI4P on the invasive projections. Human tumor studies documented increased PI4KIIIα expression in metastatic tumors vs. the primary tumor counterparts, further supporting the PI4KIIIα role in tumor metastasis. Furthermore, we also identified an unexpected function of PI4KIIIα in GPCR signaling where CXCR4 regulates PI4KIIIα activity and mediate tumor metastasis. Altogether, our study identifies a novel cross-talk between PI4KIIIα and CXCR4 in promoting tumor metastasis and suggests that PI4KIIIα pharmacological targeting may have therapeutic benefit for advanced prostate cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2886730163,"Prompt identification of causative pathogenic bacteria is imperative for the treatment of patients suffering from infectious diseases, including sepsis and pneumonia. However, current culture-based methodologies have several drawbacks including their limitation of use to culturable bacterial species. To circumvent these problems, we attempted to detect bacterial DNA in blood using next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) technology. We conducted metagenomic and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing of DNA extracted from bacteria-spiked blood using an Ion Personal Genome Machine. NGS data was analyzed using our in-house pipeline Genome Search Toolkit and database GenomeSync. The metagenomic sequencing analysis successfully detected three gram-positive and three gram-negative bacteria spiked in the blood, which was associated with a significant portion of non-bacterial reads, even though human blood cells were separated by low-speed centrifugation prior to DNA extraction. Sequencing analysis of seven variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon also successfully detected all six bacteria spiked in the blood. The methodology using 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis was verified using DNA from the blood of six patients with sepsis and four healthy volunteers with potential pathogenic bacteria in the blood being identified at the species level. These findings suggest that our system will be a potential platform for practical diagnosis in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2887615497,"Elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) among people who inject drugs (PWID) is a costly investment, so strategies should not only focus on eliminating the disease, but also on preventing disease resurgence. The aims of this study are to compute the minimum necessary antiviral therapies to achieve elimination with and without the additional expansion of harm reduction (HR) programs and to examine the sustainability of HCV elimination after 2030 if treatment is discontinued.We considered two types of epidemic (with low (30%) and high (50%) proportion of PWID who engage in sharing equipment (sharers)) within three baseline chronic HCV (CHC) prevalence settings (30%, 45% and 60%), assuming a baseline HR coverage of 40%. We define sustainable elimination strategies, those that could maintain eliminations results for a decade (2031-2040), in the absence of additional treatment.The model shows that the optimum elimination strategy is dependent on risk sharing behavior of the examined population. The necessary annual treatment coverage to achieve HCV elimination under 45% baseline CHC prevalence, without the simultaneous expansion of HR programs, ranges between 4.7-5.1%. Similarly, under 60% baseline CHC prevalence the needed treatment coverage varies from 9.0-10.5%. Increasing HR coverage from 40% to 75%, reduces the required treatment coverage by 6.5-9.8% and 11.0-15.0% under 45% or 60% CHC prevalence, respectively. In settings with ≤45% baseline CHC prevalence, expanding HR to 75% could prevent the disease from rebounding after elimination, irrespective of the type of the epidemic. In high chronic HCV prevalence, counseling interventions to reduce sharing are also needed to maintain the HCV incident cases in low levels.Harm reduction strategies have a vital role in HCV elimination strategy, as they reduce the required number of treatments to eliminate HCV and they provide sustainability after the elimination. The above underlines that HCV elimination strategies should be built upon the existing HR services, and argue for HR expansion in countries without services."
https://openalex.org/W2887212557,"It is unknown whether urban versus rural residency affects pancreatic cancer survival in a universal tax-financed healthcare system. We conducted a nationwide, population-based cohort study of all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in Denmark from 2004–2015. We used nationwide registries to collect information on characteristics, comorbidity, cancer-directed treatment, and vital status. We followed the patients from pancreatic cancer diagnosis until death, emigration, or 1 October 2017, whichever occurred first. We truncated at five years of follow up. We stratified patients into calendar periods according to year of diagnosis (2004–2007, 2008–2011, and 2012–2015). We used Cox proportional hazards model to compute hazard ratios (HRs) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of death, comparing patients in urban and rural areas. HRs were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, tumor stage, and localization. In a sub-analysis, we also adjusted for cancer-directed treatment. We included 10,594 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Median age was 71 years (inter-quartile range: 63–78 years), and half were men. The majority (61.7%) lived in an urban area at the time of diagnosis. When adjusting for potential confounders, we observed a better survival rate among pancreatic cancer patients residing in urban areas compared with rural areas (adjusted HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.87–0.98). When taking treatment into account, the association was unclear (adjusted HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.88–1.04). Pancreatic cancer patients residing in urban areas had a slightly better survival rate compared with patients in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2885774371,"To compare different anthropometric indices, Body composition analysis and lipid profile markers in terms of their ability to predict prediabetes (PD).We enrolled 83 subjects with PD and 84 normoglycemic subjects who were matched for age and gender. The diagnosis of prediabetes was done according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. All subjects were aged between 30-55 years of age and visited the outpatient department of tertiary care hospital. Anthropometric and lipid profile measurements were obtained. Analysis of body composition was done using Bodystat 1500MDD Instrument. Backward logistic regression was performed for detecting the predictors of PD. A receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) with area under curve (AUC) was utilized for the accuracy of the predictors of PD.Comparison of anthropometric measurement and body composition analysis parameters between the two groups showed that Waist circumference (WC), Body mass index, Body Fat% were significantly higher whereas Extracellular water and Dry lean weight in percentage (ECW% and DLW%) were found to be lower in PD (p< 0.05). Higher triglyceride (TG) levels and lower high-density cholesterol (HDL-C) with high TG/HDL-C were seen in subjects with PD. Backward logistic regression analysis found the combination of Body Fat % with WC, TG, ECW% and DLW% as strong predictors of PD. In ROC analysis, ECW% (AUC = 0.703) was the most predictive measure, followed by WC (AUC = 0.702).This study demonstrated that estimation of Body Fat % combined with waist circumference, Extracellular water and Dry lean weight in percentage are valuable in screening and diagnosis of prediabetes. Plasma levels of TG in lipid profile measurements can also serve as an additional marker for prediction of prediabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2886169597,"Although classified as an African taurine breed, the genomes of Sheko cattle are an admixture of Asian zebu and African taurine ancestries. They populate the humid Bench Maji zone in Sheko and Bench districts in the south-western part of Ethiopia and are considered as a trypanotolerant breed with high potential for dairy production. Here, we investigate the genome of Sheko cattle for candidate signatures of adaptive introgression and positive selection using medium density genome-wide SNP data. Following locus-ancestry deviation analysis, 15 and 72 genome regions show substantial excess and deficiency in Asian zebu ancestry, respectively. Nine and 23 regions show candidate signatures of positive selection following extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH)-based analyses (iHS and Rsb), respectively. The results support natural selection before admixture for one iHS, one Rsb and three zebu ancestry-deficient regions. Genes and/or QTL associated with bovine immunity, fertility, heat tolerance, trypanotolerance and lactation are present within candidate selected regions. The identification of candidate regions under selection in Sheko cattle warrants further investigation of a larger sample size using full genome sequence data to better characterise the underlying haplotypes. The results can then support informative genomic breeding programmes to sustainably enhance livestock productivity in East African trypanosomosis infested areas."
https://openalex.org/W2886850821,"The use of recombinant proteins has revolutionized the development of biologic pharmaceuticals; however, they are not free of complications. Some have very high molecular weight, some demonstrate in vivo instability, and the high cost of producing them remains a major problem. On the other hand, it has been shown that peptides derived from active domains keep their biologic activity and can trigger events, such as osteogenesis and bone regeneration. Small peptides are advantageous because of their ease of synthesis and handling and their low immunogenic activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functions of a synthetic peptide, cementum protein 1-peptidel (CEMP-1-p1), both in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that CEMP-1-p1 significantly enhanced the proliferation and differentiation of human periodontal ligament cells toward a mineralizing-like phenotype, as evidenced by increasing alkaline phosphatase (ALP)–specific activity and osterix, runt-related transcription factor (RUNX)-2, integrin binding sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein-2, osteocalcin, and cementum protein (CEMP)-1 expression at mRNA and protein levels. In vivo assays performed through standardized critical-size calvarial defects in rats treated with CEMP-1-p1 resulted in newly formed bone after 30 and 60 d. These data demonstrate that CEMP-1-p1 is an effective bioactive peptide for bone tissue regeneration. The application of this bioactive peptide may lead to implementing new strategies for the regeneration of bone and other mineralized tissues.—Correa, R., Arenas, J., Montoya, G., Hoz, L., López, S., Salgado, F., Arroyo, R., Salmeron, N., Romo, E., Zeichner-David, M., Arzate, H.

https://openalex.org/W2886860007,"Sophora japonica L. (Faboideae, Leguminosae) is an important traditional Chinese herb with a long history of cultivation. Its flower buds and fruits contain abundant flavonoids, and therefore, the plants are cultivated for the industrial extraction of rutin. Here, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genome of S. japonica ‘JinhuaiJ2’, the most widely planted variety in Guangxi region of China. The total length of the mtDNA sequence is 484,916 bp, with a GC content of 45.4%. Sophora japonica mtDNA harbors 32 known protein-coding genes, 17 tRNA genes, and three rRNA genes with 17 cis-spliced and five trans-spliced introns disrupting eight protein-coding genes. The gene coding and intron regions, and intergenic spacers account for 7.5%, 5.8% and 86.7% of the genome, respectively. The gene profile of S. japonica mitogenome differs from that of the other Faboideae species by only one or two gene gains or losses. Four of the 17 cis-spliced introns showed distinct length variations in the Faboideae, which could be attributed to the homologous recombination of the short repeats measuring a few bases located precisely at the edges of the putative deletions. This reflects the importance of small repeats in the sequence evolution in Faboideae mitogenomes. Repeated sequences of S. japonica mitogenome are mainly composed of small repeats, with only 20 medium-sized repeats, and one large repeat, adding up to 4% of its mitogenome length. Among the 25 pseudogene fragments detected in the intergenic spacer regions, the two largest ones and their corresponding functional gene copies located in two different sets of medium-sized repeats, point to their origins from homologous recombinations. As we further observed the recombined reads associated with the longest repeats of 2,160 bp with the PacBio long read data set of just 15 × in depth, repeat mediated homologous recombinations may play important role in the mitogenomic evolution of S. japonica. Our study provides insightful knowledge to the genetic background of this important herb species and the mitogenomic evolution in the Faboideae species."
https://openalex.org/W2887531326,"The invasive eucalyptus tortoise beetle, Paropsis charybdis, defoliates plantations of Eucalyptus nitens in New Zealand. Recent efforts to identify host specific biological control agents (parasitoids) from Tasmania, Australia, have focused on the larval parasitoid wasp, Eadya paropsidis (Braconidae), first described in 1978. In Tasmania, Eadya has been reared from Paropsisterna agricola (genus abbreviated Pst.), a smaller paropsine that feeds as a larva on juvenile rather than adult foliage of Eucalyptus nitens. To determine which of the many paropsine beetle hosts native to Tasmania are utilized by E. paropsidis, and to rule out the presence of cryptic species, a molecular phylogenetic approach was combined with host data from rearing experiments from multiple locations across six years. Sampling included 188 wasps and 94 beetles for molecular data alone. Two mitochondrial genes (COI and Cytb) and one nuclear gene (28S) were analyzed to assess the species limits in the parasitoid wasps. The mitochondrial genes were congruent in delimiting four separate phylogenetic species, all supported by morphological examinations of Eadya specimens collected throughout Tasmania. Eadya paropsidis was true to the type description, and was almost exclusively associated with P. tasmanica. A new cryptic species similar to E. paropsidis, Eadya sp. 3, was readily reared from Pst. agricola and P. charybdis from all sites and all years. Eadya sp. 3 represents the best candidate for biological control of P. charybdis and was determined as the species undergoing host range testing in New Zealand for its potential as a biological control agent. Another new species, Eadya sp. 1, was morphologically distinctive and attacked multiple hosts. The most common host was Pst. variicollis, but was also reared from Pst. nobilitata and Pst. selmani. Eadya sp. 1 may have potential for control against Pst. variicollis, a new incursion in New Zealand, and possibly Pst. selmani in Ireland. Our molecular data suggests that Pst. variicollis is in need of taxonomic revision and the geographic source of the beetle in New Zealand may not be Tasmania.

This study aimed to elucidate the intrauterine programming mechanisms of adult hypercholesterolemia. The results showed that prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) caused intrauterine growth retardation and hypercholesterolemia in male adult offspring rats. Hepatic cholesterol synthesis and output were deceased in utero but increased in adults; hepatic reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) persistently deceased before and after birth. Meanwhile, PNE elevated serum corticosterone level and decreased hepatic IGF1 pathway activity in male fetuses, whereas converse changes were observed in male adults. The chronic stress model and cortisol-treated HepG2 cells verified that excessive glucocorticoid (GC)-induced GC-IGF1 axis programming enhanced hepatic cholesterol synthesis and output. In addition, PNE decreased the expression of specific protein 1 and P300 enrichment and H3K27 acetylation at the promoter region of genes responsible for RCT both in fetal and adult, male livers and reduced expression of those genes, similar alterations were also confirmed in cortisol-treated HepG2 cells, suggesting that excessive GC-related programming induced continuous RCT reduction by epigenetic modification. Taken together, the ""2-programming"" approach discussed above may ultimately contribute to the development of hypercholesterolemia in male adult offspring.-Zhou, J., Zhu, C., Luo, H., Shen, L., Gong, J., Wu, Y., Magdalou, J., Chen, L., Guo, Y., Wang, H.

Vaccinia virus (VACV) encodes proteins that antagonize these host innate immune responses, and elucidating the mechanisms of action of these viral proteins helped shed light on PRR signaling mechanisms. The VACV virulence factor E3 is one of the most intensely studied VACV proteins and has multiple effects on host cells, many of which cannot be explained by the currently known cellular targets of E3. Here, we report that E3 expression in human monocytes alters TLR2- and TLR8-dependent cytokine induction, and particularly inhibits interleukin (IL)-6.

Although DHX9 has previously been implicated as a PRR for sensing nucleic acid in dendritic cells, we found no role for DHX9 as a nucleic acid-sensing PRR in monocytes. Rather, DHX9 suppression in these cells phenocopied the effects of E3 expression on TLR2- and TLR8-dependent cytokine induction, in that DHX9 was required for all TLR8-dependent cytokines measured, and for TLR2-dependent IL-6. Furthermore, DHX9 also had a cell- and stimulus-independent role in IL-6 promoter induction. DHX9 enhanced NF-κB–dependent IL-6 promoter activation, which was directly antagonized by E3.

PAMP and DAMP sensors are mainly pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which when activated signal via transcription factors such as NF-κB and interferon regulatory factors to induce innate immune effectors genes (1Gürtler C.

These genes encode interferons, chemokines (e.g. IP10 and RANTES), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β), which mobilize both innate immune cells and T cells to control infection. The prototypical PRR family are the membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that bind conserved molecules from bacteria, viruses, and parasites (2O'Neill L.A. Golenbock D. Bowie A.G.

Studying how these viral proteins interact with host molecules provides an understanding of viral pathogenesis but can also reveal important aspects of host immune signaling mechanisms, which have been selected for viral antagonism over evolutionary time. For example, we and others have discovered several poxviral proteins that target host proteins subsequently implicated in PRR signaling pathways (6Bowie A.G. Unterholzner L.

One such host protein is the DEAD box RNA helicase DDX3, which vaccinia virus (VACV) protein K7 interacts to inhibit RLR responses (8Schröder M. Baran M. Bowie A.G. Viral targeting of DEAD box protein 3 reveals its role in TBK1/IKKvarϵ-mediated IRF activation.EMBO J. 2008; 27 (18636090): 2147-215710.1038/emboj.2008.143Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). VACV protein E3 is a multifunctional protein that is vital for viral replication and pathogenesis (9Kwon J.A. Rich A. Biological function of the vaccinia virus Z-DNA-binding protein E3L: gene transactivation and antiapoptotic activity in HeLa cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

E3 is comprised of an N-terminal Z-DNA–binding domain (DNABD) and a C-terminal dsRNA–binding motif (DSRM), both of which are required for virulence (10Brandt T.A. Jacobs B.L. Both carboxy- and amino-terminal domains of the vaccinia virus interferon resistance gene, E3L, are required for pathogenesis in a mouse model.J.

E3 inhibits dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) function by sequestering dsRNA via the DSRM, but also by directly binding to PKR (11Chang H.W. Watson J.C. Jacobs B.L. The E3L gene of vaccinia virus encodes an inhibitor of the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Other functions of the DSRM include inhibition of the RNA Pol III dsDNA sensing pathway (13Valentine R. Smith G.L. Inhibition of the RNA polymerase III-mediated dsDNA-sensing pathway of innate immunity by vaccinia virus protein E3.J. Gen. Virol. 2010; 91 (20519457): 2221-222910.1099/vir.0.021998-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and antagonism of the antiviral protein ISG15 (14Guerra S. Cáceres A. Knobeloch K.P. Horak I. Esteban M. Vaccinia virus E3 protein prevents the antiviral action of ISG15.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4 (18604270): e100009610.1371/journal.ppat.1000096Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A recent study revealed that many of E3's biological functions do not involve dsRNA binding because mutants of E3 that no longer bound dsRNA were still able to affect viral replication in cell culture, modulate apoptosis, and inhibit production of PRR-stimulated cytokines such as IL-6 (15Dueck K.J. Hu Y.S. Chen P. Deschambault Y. Lee J. Varga J. Cao J. Mutational analysis of vaccinia virus E3 protein: the biological functions do not correlate with its biochemical capacity to bind double-stranded RNA.J. Virol. 2015; 89 (25740987): 5382-539410.1128/JVI.03288-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that more host protein targets remain to be identified for E3, which would shed further light on how viruses modulate cellular signaling pathways. Here we show that expression of E3 in human monocytes led to altered PRR-dependent cytokine production, and in particular suppression of IL-6 induction by TLRs. Using MS, the RNA helicase DHX9 (also called RNA helicase A) was identified as an E3-interacting protein. DHX9 has previously been implicated as a PRR for sensing nucleic acid in DCs. However, here we found no role for DHX9 in nucleic acid sensing in monocytes. Rather, suppression of DHX9 expression phenocopied the effect of E3 expression on cytokine and chemokine production stimulated by TLR2, TLR8, and TLR4. Further work showed a role for DHX9 in NF-κB–dependent IL-6 promoter induction, which was antagonized by E3. These results suggest a new role for DHX9 in innate immune cytokine regulation and reveal a further mechanism whereby VACV via E3 disrupts innate immunity, via targeting of DHX9. E3 has previously been shown to modulate cytokine induction in virally-infected cells (15Dueck K.J. Hu Y.S. Chen P. Deschambault Y. Lee J. Varga J. Cao J. Mutational analysis of vaccinia virus E3 protein: the biological functions do not correlate with its biochemical capacity to bind double-stranded RNA.J.

To determine whether E3 directly regulated PRR-stimulated cytokine production, we wanted to express E3 in isolation from virus, in an immune-relevant cell line model. Therefore, we generated human THP-1 monocytes cells stably expressing E3 using a retroviral expression system (Fig. 1A). PRR-stimulated cytokine production (TNFα, IL-6, IP10, and RANTES) was assessed in these cells by ELISA. To focus on the effects of E3 independent of sequestering of nucleic acids, the nonnucleic acid PRR ligands Pam3Csk4, CL075, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to stimulate TLR2-, TLR8-, and TLR4-dependent gene induction, respectively. CL075 is a specific agonist for TLR8 in human monocytes (18Gorden K.B. Gorski K.S. Gibson S.J. Kedl R.M. Kieper W.C. Qiu X. Tomai M.A. Alkan S.S. Vasilakos J.P. Synthetic TLR agonists reveal functional differences between human TLR7 and TLR8.J. Immunol. 2005; 174 (15661881): 1259-126810.4049/jimmunol.174.3.1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of E3 in cells affected cytokine production in stimulus- and gene-specific manners. Compared with the other ligands, LPS only stimulated low production of TNFα, IP-10, and RANTES, which was not affected by E3 expression, whereas LPS-stimulated IL-6 was barely detectable (Fig. 1, B–E). Upon TLR2 stimulation of E3-expressing cells, IL-6 production was strongly inhibited, TNFα production was enhanced, and chemokine induction (IP-10, RANTES) was unaffected (Fig. 1, B–E). In contrast, all TLR8-stimulated cytokines measured (TNFα, IL-6, IP10, and RANTES) were potently inhibited in cells expressing E3 compared with cells transduced with empty vector (Fig. 1, B–E). Thus, E3 antagonizes specific PRR-stimulated cytokine induction in monocytes. The varied effects of E3 on some cytokines and lack of effect on others implied that inhibitory effects were not due to toxicity or a general suppression of all genes. E3 has been shown to interact with both host nucleic acid and proteins, as described above. The fact that specific Pam3Csk4 and CL075 responses were affected by E3 suggested that E3 was targeting host protein(s) to modulate TLR signaling outcomes. To explore what protein targets of E3 in cells might explain E3 modulation of cytokine production, we infected murine embryonic fibroblasts with vaccinia virus (WR, Western reserve strain), and used an anti-E3 antibody to immunoprecipitate E3-associated proteins. As a control, we compared the anti-E3 antibody immunoprecipitate from WR-infected cells to that derived from cells infected with vaccinia virus WR lacking the gene that encodes E3 (ΔE3L). Immunoprecipitated proteins from WR- and ΔE3L-infected cells were then separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A), and gel slices were prepared and trypsinized. Peptides eluted from gel slices were analyzed by LC–MS. Several potential E3-interacting proteins were identified, by nature of them being detected in the resolved immunoprecipitate from WR- but not ΔE3L-infected cells. One such protein, DHX9, was of particular interest because it was highly abundant in the WR sample (Fig. 2A), and because it has been implicated in the regulation of gene transcription and translation (19Ranji A. Boris-Lawrie K. RNA helicases: emerging roles in viral replication and the host innate response.RNA Biol. 2010; 7 (21173576): 775-78710.4161/rna.7.6.14249Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, here we focused on DHX9 as a potential protein target to explain E3 immunomodulation. We confirmed that E3 could interact with DHX9 in human cells by endogenous IP of E3 from virally-infected HEK293T cells followed by immunoblot for DHX9 (Fig. 2B, top panel). Importantly, in THP-1 cells, where expression of E3 affected cytokine induction (Fig. 1), after vaccinia virus infection a clear interaction was seen between endogenous DHX9 and virally expressed E3 (Fig. 2C). Ectopically expressed E3 in isolation from virus also interacted with endogenous DHX9 (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, both full-length E3 and the isolated DSRM of E3 interacted with DHX9, whereas the isolated DNABD of E3 did not (Fig. 2E). Hence E3 interacts with host DHX9 via the DSRM. To determine whether DHX9 had a role in production of cytokines affected by E3, DHX9 loss-of-function studies were employed. Because DHX9 is an essential gene in both mouse and human (20Lee C.G. da Costa Soares V. Newberger C. Manova K. Lacy E. Hurwitz J. RNA helicase A is essential for normal gastrulation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95 (9811865): 13709-1371310.1073/pnas.95.23.13709Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Wang T. Birsoy K. Hughes N.W. Krupczak K.M. Post Y. Wei J.J. Lander E.S.

Thus, an inducible shRNA lentiviral expression system was used to reduce DHX9 expression in real time. Cell lines were generated using a pTRIPZ lentiviral system in which doxycycline-inducible shRNA could be introduced into THP-1 cells. Three stable shRNA-expressing cell lines were generated: Fig. 3A shows that 72 h treatment of cells with doxycycline led to strong suppression of DHX9 protein expression in cells transduced with lentiviruses encoding two distinct DHX9-targeting shRNAs (A7 and G2), but not in cells transduced with lentiviruses encoding a nonsilencing control (NSC). Similar to E3-expressing monocytes (Fig. 1), these cells were stimulated with TLR agonists and cytokine production was monitored. A remarkably similar profile of regulation of TLR-stimulated cytokines was observed in cells expressing DHX9 shRNA, compared with cells expressing E3 (Fig. 1) in that suppression of DHX9 expression inhibited production of all four TLR8-stimulated cytokines, and of TLR2-stimulated IL-6 production, whereas TLR2-stimulated TNFα production was enhanced, and IP-10 and RANTES unaffected (Fig. 3, B–E). The low LPS responses were unaffected by suppression of DHX9 expression, except in the case of IL-6, which was inhibited (Fig. 3, B–E). The correlation between the effects of expression of E3 (Fig. 1) and suppression of DHX9 expression (Fig. 3), which exactly phenocopied each other, strongly suggest that E3 modulated TLR-stimulated cytokines via targeting of DHX9. Previous work implicated DHX9 as a cytosolic nucleic acid sensor for both DNA and RNA in DCs, operating upstream of either the TLR adaptor protein MyD88 for DNA, or the RLR adaptor MAVS for RNA (22Kim T. Pazhoor S. Bao M. Zhang Z. Hanabuchi S. Facchinetti V. Bover L. Plumas J. Chaperot L. Qin J. Liu Y.J. Aspartate-glutamate-alanine-histidine box motif (DEAH)/RNA helicase A helicases sense microbial DNA in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

DHX9 pairs with IPS-1 to sense double-stranded RNA in myeloid dendritic cells.J. Immunol. 2011; 187 (21957149): 4501-450810.4049/jimmunol.1101307Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also tested whether suppression of DHX9 expression impacted DNA and RNA sensing in monocytes. Cytokine production was assessed from THP-1 cells transfected with two types of immune stimulatory DNA to activate cytosolic DNA sensing pathways, and also with cGAMP, which is a direct ligand for STING, the adaptor protein for cGAS. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in RANTES or IP10 production from cells expressing DHX9 shRNA compared with cells expressing NSC shRNA for any of the agonists tested (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting no role for DHX9 in DNA sensing or in STING function in monocytes. RNA sensing was examined by stimulating cells with Sendai virus, whose defective interfering particles are sensed by RLRs in human cells. There was no difference in responses between NSC cells and two lines expressing DHX9 shRNA, except in the case of IL-6, where potent inhibition was observed (Fig. 4, C–F). These results suggest that DHX9 does not function as a nucleic acid sensor in human monocytes, but rather has more “downstream” gene-specific roles. Of note, we found that IL-6 production by all ligands tested (TLR2, TLR8, TLR4, and RNA virus) depended on DHX9. We tested whether the requirement of DHX9 for IL-6 production was true in other human cell types. For this, BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells were used, because they produce IL-6 in response to PAMPs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The lentiviral pTRIPZ system was again employed to generate cell lines stably expressing doxycycline-inducible DHX9 shRNAs (A7 and D11) or a NSC shRNA. Similar to THP-1 cells, doxycycline treatment strongly reduced DHX9 protein expression in the DHX9 shRNA-expressing BEAS-2B cells compared with the NSC cell line (Fig. 5A). Doxycycline-treated cells were stimulated with a range of IL-6-inducing ligands for 24 h (Pam3Csk4 for TLR2 and IL-1, dsRNA for TLR3, transfected dsRNA and transfected dsDNA). In all cases, IL-6 secretion depended on DHX9 because significant inhibition of IL-6 production was seen in A7 and D11 cells compared with NSC cells for all ligands tested (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, an alternative gain-of-function approach to assessing DHX9 also provided evidence of a role for DHX9 in IL-6 production, because transfection of HeLa cells with an expression vector encoding DHX9 led to a plasmid dose-dependent enhancement of MyD88-stimulated IL-6 production (Fig. 5C). Thus, DHX9 is required for IL-6 production by diverse innate immune ligands, and in different human cell types. Because production of IL-6 by every stimulus tested depended on DHX9, we focused on understanding the role of DHX9 in IL-6 regulation. DHX9 has been shown to regulate both transcription and translation (19Ranji A. Boris-Lawrie K. RNA helicases: emerging roles in viral replication and the host innate response.RNA Biol. 2010; 7 (21173576): 775-78710.4161/rna.7.6.14249Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), so we first determined whether IL-6 mRNA induction in response to TLR ligands was DHX9-dependent. In NSC THP-1 cells, TLR2 or TLR8 stimulation led to time-dependent induction of IL-6 mRNA, and for both TLR ligands this was significantly impaired in the two independent cell lines expressing DHX9 shRNA, A7 and G2 (Fig. 6, A and B). This suggested a requirement of DHX9 in transcriptional induction of the IL-6 gene. The IL-6 promoter is regulated and induced by TLRs upon activation of both p38 MAP kinase and NF-κB (24Jiménez-Dalmaroni M.J. Gerswhin M.E. Adamopoulos I.E. The critical role of Toll-like receptors: from microbial recognition to autoimmunity: a comprehensive review.Autoimmun. Rev. 2016; 15 (26299984): 1-810.1016/j.autrev.2015.08.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), so therefore we tested whether activation of these signaling pathways by TLR2 were affected by loss of DHX9 expression. Fig. 7 shows that this was not the case, because the time course of appearance of phospho-p38 in NSC and G2 cells stimulated with TLR2 ligand was very similar. Also, NF-κB activation, measured both by monitoring IκBα degradation, and p65 phosphorylation, was normal in G2 cells (Fig. 7). These data, together with the lack of effect of suppression of DHX9 expression on other TLR-dependent p38- and NF-κB–regulated genes (Fig. 3) strongly suggested a role for DHX9 in IL-6 induction downstream of cytosolic signaling pathways.Figure 7.DHX9 is not required for TLR2-stimulated NF-κB or p38 MAPK activation. THP-1 cells expressing doxycycline-inducible DHX9-specific shRNA (G2) or NSC shRNA, were incubated with 1 μg/ml of doxycycline for 72 h, and then stimulated with 2 μg/ml of Pam3CSK4 (PAM3) for the indicated times. Cell lysates were harvested and immunoblotted for DHX9, IκB, β-actin, phospho-p65, total p65, phospho-p38, and total p38 as indicated. These data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We therefore next focused on the IL-6 promoter itself. To assess the direct effects of DHX9 on this promoter, an IL-6 promoter-dependent luciferase reporter was employed (Fig. 8A). Ectopic expression of DHX9 alone led to a small but significant induction of this reporter, as did expression of MyD88 (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, co-expression of DHX9 and MyD88 led to a synergistic induction of the IL-6 promoter (Fig. 8B), and this stimulation was largely reduced when the NF-κB element (Fig. 8C) but not the AP-1 element (Fig. 8D) was deleted from the IL-6 promoter. These data indicate that DHX9 has a promoter-proximal role in induction of the IL-6 promoter, which depends on the presence of the NF-κB element within that promoter. The ability of DHX9 to enhance TLR-stimulated NF-κB–dependent transcription was further explored by use of a reporter gene under the control of an isolated NF-κB element. Fig. 9, A and B, shows that induction of this reporter by TLR8 and TLR2 ligands was synergistically enhanced by ectopic expression of DHX9. This synergistic effect of DHX9 expression was also apparent when the NF-κB–dependent reporter was induced by direct expression of MyD88 (Fig. 9C). To confirm that the positive effects of DHX9 on NF-κB–dependent gene induction were proximal to NF-κB at the promoter, the effect of DHX9 on direct induction of the reporter by NF-κB subunit p65 was examined. Fig. 9D shows that similar to the case for MyD88 expression, direct expression of p65 induced the NF-κB–dependent reporter, and this was synergistically enhanced by DHX9. Furthermore, the ability of p65 to transactivate a Gal4-dependent promoter reporter was also positively affected by DHX9 because MyD88-dependent p65 transactivation was also synergistically enhanced by DHX9 expression (Fig. 9E). Together these data reveal a promoter-proximal role for DHX9 in stimulation of the IL-6 promoter, and of NF-κB–dependent transactivation. Finally, we assessed the effect of expression of E3 on the ability of DHX9 to stimulate NF-κB–dependent gene induction events, to determine whether E3 directly inhibited the positive effect of DHX9 on NF-κB–dependent transactivation. E3 expression was found to significantly suppress the ability of DHX9 to synergize with MyD88 for IL-6 production (Fig. 10A). We also found that E3 could significantly inhibit the positive effect of DHX9 on TLR8-stimulated NF-κB–dependent reporter gene induction (Fig. 10B). Finally, we observed a direct effect of E3 on DHX9-dependent NF-κB transactivation because E3 significantly suppressed the enhancement of p65-stimulated NF-κB–dependent reporter gene induction by DHX9 (Fig. 10C). Together, these data reveal a role for DHX9 in PRR-stimulated gene regulation, and strongly suggest that E3 antagonizes DHX9-dependent innate immune gene induction. Because poxviruses target critical nodes in innate immune signaling, determining the host targets of VACV proteins with immunomodulatory properties has proved useful in elucidating in detail innate immune signaling mechanisms. In this regard, E3, which is one of the most intensely studied VACV proteins, has multiple effects on host cells, many of which cannot be explained by the known cellular targets of E3. Here we identify DHX9 as a new target for E3 in human cells, and propose that E3 antagonism of DHX9 function is a viral strategy to modulate innate immune cytokine production, and in particular to suppress IL-6 induction. DHX9 belongs to the DExD/H-box family of proteins, originally shown to function in RNA metabolism, but now known to have broad roles in viral replication, innate immunity, cell signaling, and gene induction (19Ranji A. Boris-Lawrie K. RNA helicases: emerging roles in viral replication and the host innate response.RNA Biol. 2010; 7 (21173576): 775-78710.4161/rna.7.6.14249Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). DHX9 is a case in point, having been shown to bind both ssRNA and ssDNA, to unwind double-stranded nucleic acids (25Lee C.G. Hurwitz J.

https://openalex.org/W2887528274,"In the biopharmaceutical sector, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have become the host of choice to produce recombinant proteins (r-proteins) due to their capacity for correct protein folding, assembly, and posttranslational modification. However, the production of therapeutic r-proteins in CHO cells is expensive and presents insufficient production yields for certain proteins. Effective culture strategies to increase productivity (qp) include a high glucose concentration in the medium and mild hypothermia (28-34 °C), but these changes lead to a reduced specific growth rate. To study the individual and combined impacts of glucose concentration, specific growth rate and mild hypothermia on culture performance and cell metabolism, we analyzed chemostat cultures of recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rh-tPA)-producing CHO cell lines fed with three glucose concentrations in feeding media (20, 30 and 40 mM), at two dilution rates (0.01 and 0.018 1/h) and two temperatures (33 and 37 °C). The results indicated significant changes in cell growth, cell cycle distribution, metabolism, and rh-tPA productivity in response to the varying environmental culture conditions. High glucose feed led to constrained cell growth, increased specific rh-tPA productivity and a higher number of cells in the G2/M phase. Low specific growth rate and temperature (33 °C) reduced glucose consumption and lactate production rates. Our findings indicated that a reduced specific growth rate coupled with high feed glucose significantly improves r-protein productivity in CHO cells. We also observed that low temperature significantly reduced qp, but not cell growth when dilution rate was manipulated, regardless of the glucose concentration or dilution rate. In contrast, we determined that feed glucose concentration and consumption rate were the dominant aspects of the growth and productivity in CHO cells by using multivariate analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2885115781,"Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is the most important cause of human encephalitis throughout Asia and the Pacific. Although JE is a vector-borne disease, it has been demonstrated experimentally that transmission between pigs can occur through direct contact. Whether pig-to-pig transmission plays a role in the natural epidemiological cycle of JE remains unknown. To assess whether direct transmission between pigs may occur under field conditions, we built two mathematical models of JE transmission incorporating vector-borne transmission alone or a combination of vector-borne and direct transmission. We used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to estimate the parameters of the models. We fitted the models to (i) two serological datasets collected longitudinally from two pig cohorts (C1 and C2) during two periods of four months on a farm on the outskirts of Phnom-Penh, Cambodia and to (ii) a cross-sectional (CS) serological survey dataset collected from 505 swine coming from eight different provinces of Cambodia. In both cases, the model incorporating both vector-borne and direct transmission better explained the data. We computed the value of the basic reproduction number R0 (2.93 for C1, 2.66 for C2 and 2.27 for CS), as well as the vector-borne reproduction number Rpv and the direct transmission reproduction number Rpp. We then determined the contribution of direct transmission on R0 (11.90% for C1, 11.62% for C2 and 7.51% for CS). According to our results, the existence of pig-to-pig transmission is consistent with our swine serological data. Thus, direct transmission may contribute to the epidemiological cycle of JE in Cambodia. These results need to be confirmed in other eco-climatic settings, in particular in temperate areas where pig-to-pig transmission may facilitate the persistence of JE virus (JEV) during cold seasons when there are no or few mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W2886049549,"Ubiquitinylation drives many cellular processes by targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitin conjugation enzymes promote ubiquitinylation and, thus, degradation of protein substrates. Ubiquitinylation is a well-known posttranslational modification controlling cell-cycle transitions and levels or/and activation levels of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes change during development and cell cycle. Progression through the cell cycle is tightly controlled by CDK inhibitors such as p27Kip1. Here we show that, in contrast to promoting its degradation, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH7/UBE2L3 specifically protects p27Kip1 from degradation. Overexpression of UBCH7/UBE2L3 stabilizes p27Kip1 and delays the G1-to-S transition, while depletion of UBCH7/UBE2L3 increases turnover of p27Kip1. Levels of p21Cip1/Waf1, p57Kip2, cyclin A and cyclin E, all of which are also involved in regulating the G1/S transition are not affected by UBCH7/UBE2L3 depletion. The effect of UBCH7/UBE2L3 on p27Kip1 is not due to alteration of the levels of any of the ubiquitin ligases known to ubiquitinylate p27Kip1. Rather, UBCH7/UBE2L3 catalyzes the conjugation of heterotypic ubiquitin chains on p27Kip1 that are proteolytically incompetent. These data reveal new controls and concepts about the ubiquitin proteasome system in which a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme selectively inhibits and may even protect, rather than promote degradation of a crucial cell-cycle regulatory molecule.-Whitcomb, E.

https://openalex.org/W2887565357,"Emerging evidence indicates that proximity to unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD) is associated with health outcomes. There is intense debate about “How close is too close?” for maintaining public health and safety. The goal of this Delphi study was to elicit expert consensus on appropriate setback distances for UOGD from human activity. Three rounds were used to identify and seek consensus on recommended setback distances. The 18 panelists were health care providers, public health practitioners, environmental advocates, and researchers/scientists. Consensus was defined as agreement of ≥70% of panelists. Content analysis of responses to Round 1 questions revealed four categories: recommend setback distances; do not recommend setback distances; recommend additional setback distances for vulnerable populations; do not recommend additional setback distances for vulnerable populations. In Round 2, panelists indicated their level of agreement with the statements in each category using a five-point Likert scale. Based on emerging consensus, statements within each category were collapsed into seven statements for Round 3: recommend set back distances of <¼ mile; ¼—½ mile; 1–1 ¼ mile; and ≥ 2 mile; not feasible to recommend setback distances; recommend additional setbacks for vulnerable groups; not feasible to recommend additional setbacks for vulnerable groups. The panel reached consensus that setbacks of < ¼ mile should not be recommended and additional setbacks for vulnerable populations should be recommended. The panel did not reach consensus on recommendations for setbacks between ¼ and 2 miles. The results suggest that if setbacks are used the distances should be greater than ¼ of a mile from human activity, and that additional setbacks should be used for settings where vulnerable groups are found, including schools, daycare centers, and hospitals. The lack of consensus on setback distances between 1/4 and 2 miles reflects the limited health and exposure studies and need to better define exposures and track health."
https://openalex.org/W2887616201,"An important task of human visual cognition is to make inferences about properties of objects. One such property is an object's causal history: what happened to the object in its past (e.g., ""this paper has been folded""). There is relatively little research on whether and how we make such inferences. We took photographs of objects from six different materials ('wax', 'aluminum foil', 'gold foil', 'chicken wire', 'putty', 'cardboard') transformed by one of four shape-altering transformations ('folded', 'bent', 'crumpled', 'twisted'). By varying execution of transformation and viewpoint, we obtained 30 images of each material/transformation combination (720 images). We asked different groups of participants to: (1) name transformations and materials, (2) rate images with respect to the extent they belonged to each transformation or material class, and (3) classify images into the four transformation classes. Our results show that participants can infer transformations from object shape-with accuracy being modulated by object material. This inference of causal history from observed object shape shows that we can distinguish between intrinsic (material) and extrinsic (transformation) properties of the object. The separation of observed shape features by their causal origin ('shape scission') presumably involves both perceptual and cognitive abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2949924125,"Background Diabetic patients are susceptible to renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, which leads to perioperative complications. Activation of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome participates in the development of diabetes, and contributes to renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a highly selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist, shows renoprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We aimed to elucidate the effects, underlying mechanisms, and optimal timing of DEX treatment in diabetic rats. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 12 per group) were randomly divided into normal-sham, diabetes-sham, diabetes-ischemia-reperfusion-control, diabetes-ischemia-reperfusion-DEX-pre-treatment, and diabetes-ischemia-reperfusion-DEX-post-treatment groups. Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced in diabetic rats by occlusion of both renal arteries for 45 min, followed by reperfusion for 24 h. DEX (10 μg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 1 h before ischemia (pre-treatment) or upon reperfusion (post-treatment). After reperfusion, renal tissue was biochemically and histopathologically evaluated. Results DEX treatment attenuated ischemia reperfusion-induced increase in NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, phospho-AKT, and phospho-ERK signaling. Moreover, oxidative stress injury, inflammatory reactions, apoptosis, and renal tubular damage were favorably modulated by DEX treatment. Furthermore, post-reperfusion treatment with DEX was significantly more effective than pre-treatment in modulating NLRP3 inflammasome, AKT and ERK signaling, and oxidative stress. Conclusions This study shows that the protective effects of DEX in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury are preserved in diabetic conditions and may potentially provide a basis for the use of DEX in clinical treatment of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury."
https://openalex.org/W2887486736,"Aims Our aim was to evaluate, in a second data analysis of the prospective randomized controlled trial conducted by Austrian Urogynaecology Working Group, the effect of age, BMI and parity at the time of surgery on short- and long-term outcomes of women primarily treated for SUI (stress urinary incontinence) with midurethral slings. Methods In the original study 554 patients received randomly a retropubic (TVT) or a transobturator midurethral (TVT-O) sling procedure. 480 (87%) and 277 (50%) patients were available for a follow-up efficacy evaluation at 3 months and 5 years respectively. Results Higher age and BMI at surgery appear to lead to a larger probability to have a positive stress test 5 years after surgery, but not after 3 months. Older patients seem to have a worse perception of improvement 5 years after surgery as compared to younger ones, as described by the PGI-I score. Age and BMI do not affect significantly the quality of life of women surgically treated for SUI, as reflected by the results of King´s Health Questionnaire. Parity does not seem to have any effect on objective and subjective surgical outcomes. Conclusions Higher age and BMI at surgery have a detrimental influence on the objective cure rate at 5 years after midurethral sling surgery; higher age also has a negative influence on subjective long-term outcomes. However, these demographic parameters do not influence significantly the quality of life of patients after anti-incontinence surgery. Parity does not show any significant influence on success rate of midurethral sling."
https://openalex.org/W2887656633,"The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are increasing worldwide. IBD is known to be multifactorial, but inflammatory signaling within the intestinal epithelium and a subsequent failure of the intestinal epithelial barrier have been shown to play essential roles in disease pathogenesis. CaMKIV is a multifunctional protein kinase associated with inflammation and cell cycle regulation. CaMKIV has been extensively studied in autoimmune diseases, but a role in idiopathic intestinal inflammation has not been described. In this study, active CaMKIV was highly expressed within the intestinal epithelium of humans with ulcerative colitis and wild-type (WT) mice with experimental induced colitis. Clinical disease severity directly correlates with CaMKIV activation, as does expression of proinflammatory cytokines and histologic features of colitis. In WT mice, CaMKIV activation is associated with increases in expression of 2 cell cycle proarrest signals: p53 and p21. Cell cycle arrest inhibits proliferation of the intestinal epithelium and ultimately results in compromised intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, further perpetuating intestinal inflammation during experimental colitis. Using a CaMKIV null mutant mouse, we demonstrate that a loss of CaMKIV protects against murine DSS colitis. Small molecules targeting CaMKIV activation may provide therapeutic benefit for patients with IBD.-Cunningham, K. E., Novak, E. A., Vincent, G., Siow, V. S., Griffith, B.

https://openalex.org/W2887670719,"This study aimed to determine the accuracy of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score in predicting mortality among prehospital patients with and without infection. This single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted among patients who arrived via the emergency medical services (EMS). We calculated the qSOFA score and Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) from prehospital records. We identified patients as infected if they received intravenous antibiotics at the emergency department or within the first 24 hours. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate and compare the performance of the qSOFA score, each physiological parameter, and the MEWS in predicting admission and in-hospital mortality in patients with and without infection. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the qSOFA score and other risk factors. Out of 1574 prehospital patients, 47.1% were admitted and 3.2% died in the hospital. The performance of the qSOFA score in predicting in-hospital mortality in noninfected patients was 0.70, higher than for each parameter and the MEWS. The areas under the curve for the qSOFA+ model vs. the qSOFA- model was 0.77 vs. 0.68 for noninfected patients (p <0.05) and 0.71 vs. 0.68 for infected patients (p = 0.41). The likelihood ratio test comparing the qSOFA- and qSOFA+ groups demonstrated significant improvement for noninfected patients (p <0.01). Multivariate regression analysis for in-hospital mortality demonstrated that the qSOFA score is an independent prognosticator for in-hospital mortality, especially among noninfected patients (odds ratio, 3.60; p <0.01). In conclusion, the prehospital qSOFA score was associated with in-hospital mortality in noninfected patients and may be a beneficial tool for identifying deteriorating patients in the prehospital setting."

Recently, some NPHPs, including NIMA-related kinase 8 (NEK8) and centrosomal protein 164 (CEP164), have been found to act in the DNA-damage response pathway and to contribute to genome stability.

The ciliopathy-typical manifestations of NME3 depletion in two vertebrate in vivo models, the biochemical association of NME3 with validated NPHPs, and its localization to the basal body reveal a role for NME3 in ciliary function.

However, the localization of NPHPs into distinct subciliary zones is not mutually exclusive. For example, NEK8 and INVS have also been observed both in the proximal axoneme and at the basal body (5Sang L. Miller J.J. Corbit K.C. Giles R.H. Brauer M.J. Otto E.A. Baye L.M. Wen X. Scales S.J.

Despite the rapid discovery of novel disease-causing genes, about 30% of patients with NPH do not have a mutation in any of the known NPHP genes. The majority of mutations are found in NPHP1 and account for ∼20% of total cases. With the exception of NPHP1 and NPHP4, all other identified loci only account for less than 3% of total cases worldwide (16Halbritter J. Porath J.D. Diaz K.A. Braun D.A. Kohl S. Chaki M. Allen S.J.

This has made detection of novel disease genes increasingly difficult and demonstrates the need for testing of even larger patient cohorts. One of the main challenges remains in identifying the “missing NPHPs” that account for the large number of genetically undiagnosed cases. Novel functional protein partners of known NPHPs may shed new light on the pathogenesis of disease and might serve as candidates for screening genetically undiagnosed patients with NPH. Although the pathogenesis of ciliopathies is still elusive, it is increasingly recognized that the response to DNA-damage and replication stress is affected by mutations in some ciliopathy genes. The NPHPs NEK8 (NPHP9), SDCCAG8 (NPHP10; BBS16), ZNF423 (NPHP14; JBS19), and CEP164 (NPHP15) have all been linked to aberrant responses to DNA damage (17Abeyta A. Castella M. Jacquemont C.

In particular, NEK8 has been shown to be a critical component in the replication stress response. It promotes the progression and stability of the replication fork, thus preventing double-strand breaks during replication stress. Indeed, cystic kidneys of Nek8 mutant mice (jck) show increased levels of γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage (19Choi H.J. Lin J.R. Vannier J.B. Slaats G.G. Kile A.C. Paulsen R.D. Manning D.K. Beier D.R.

NEK8 binds to components of the ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) pathway and enables the replication fork protector RAD51 to assemble at sites of DNA repair (17Abeyta A. Castella M. Jacquemont C. Taniguchi T. NEK8 regulates DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci formation and replication fork protection.Cell Cycle. 2017; 16 (27892797): 335-34710.1080/15384101.2016.1259038Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The nucleoside-diphosphate kinase NME3 (NM23-H3; DR-NM23) belongs to a family of 10 nucleoside-diphosphate kinases (NDPKs, NMEs, or NM23), which catalyze the phosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphates (e.g. GDP) to nucleoside triphosphates (e.g. GTP) using ATP as an energy source (21Parks Jr., R.E. Aganwal R.P. Nucleoside diphosphokinases.Enzymes. 1973; 8: 307-33310.1016/S1874-6047(08)60069-4Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Recently, NME3 was found to directly bind to TIP60 and generate dNTPs at DNA-damage sites, thus supplying necessary nucleotides for subsequent repair (22Tsao N. Yang Y.C. Deng Y.J. Chang Z.F. The direct interaction of NME3 with Tip60 in DNA repair.Biochem. J. 2016; 473 (26945015): 1237-124510.1042/BCJ20160122Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here, we uncover a surprising role for NME3 in cilia and show that NME3 physically interacts with NEK8, ANKS6, and other NPHPs of distinct NPHP modules. We demonstrate that Nme3 depletion in two vertebrate model organisms causes renal developmental defects and that Nme3 is required for determining left-right body axis specification and ciliogenesis. The detection of endogenous NME3 at the basal bodies of primary cilia and its physical interaction with ciliary components, including the centrosomal protein NEK6, further support a ciliary function. Because both NME3 and NEK6 are essential components of the DNA-damage response pathway, our data further strengthen the link between NPH and maintenance of genomic stability. We previously identified ANKS6 as a novel NPHP (NPHP16) by screening for potential protein interactors of NEK8 (NPHP9) (6Hoff S. Halbritter J. Epting D. Frank V. Nguyen T.M. van Reeuwijk J.

When using NEK8 as bait in an affinity purification screen, we identified by MS analysis several additional binding partners. As NEK8 is a member of the ANKS6 module, the potential interactors were further validated by coimmunoprecipitation with ANKS6 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. Among the proteins identified in the NEK8 pulldown, which also bound to ANKS6, were the centriolar protein DZIP1 that has been linked to ciliogenesis in zebrafish and the BBSome (23Tay S.Y. Yu X.

The RP2 protein (also known as NME10) is encoded by a gene that when mutated causes retinitis pigmentosa in humans (30Schwahn U. Lenzner S. Dong J. Feil S. Hinzmann B. van Duijnhoven G. Kirschner R.

Because many members of the NME protein family are essential for ciliary function and their loss leads to various manifestations within the spectrum of ciliopathic disorders, we focused on NME3 in further analyses. We first investigated whether NME3 could also function as a binding partner for other NPHPs. We observed that NME3 binds to NPHP3, NEK8, and ANKS6 but also to NPHP1 and NPHP4 in coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1B). Fragment analysis demonstrated that the N-terminal 17 amino acids of NME3 are essential for the interaction with NEK8 and ANKS6 (Fig. 1, C, D, and E). We previously showed that NPHP3, NEK8, and ANKS6 belong to a distinct NPHP module similar to NPHP1, NPHP4, and NPHP8 (6Hoff S. Halbritter J. Epting D. Frank V. Nguyen T.M. van Reeuwijk J. Boehlke C. Schell C. Yasunaga T. Helmstädter M. Mergen M. Filhol E. Boldt K. Horn N. Ueffing M. et al.ANKS6 is a central component of a nephronophthisis module linking NEK8 to INVS and NPHP3.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45 (23793029): 951-95610.1038/ng.2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Because NME3 interacts with members of both modules, we asked whether it acts as a link between these protein groups. Therefore, we tested whether the presence of NME3 facilitates binding of NPHP1/NPHP4 to ANKS6, two proteins that do not interact directly. Immunoprecipitation of either NPHP1 or NPHP4 revealed that coexpression of NME3 facilitated binding to ANKS6 (Fig. 2, A and B). These findings suggest that NME3 may stabilize the interactions between components of the two NPHP modules. Next, we tested a number of recently identified and less well characterized NPHPs for interaction with NME3 (Fig. 2C). We detected binding of NME3 to TMEM67, TTC21B, WDR19, CEP164, and IFT172. IFT172, WDR19, and TTC21B are members of the IFTA system in cilia, whereas CEP164 is localized in the basal body (9Bredrup C. Saunier S. Oud M.M. Fiskerstrand T. Hoischen A. Brackman D. Leh S.M.

Knockdown of Anks6 in an inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) 3 cell line that expresses an inducible shRNA did not alter the intensity of γH2AX staining at baseline (Fig. S1B). However, aphidicolin-mediated replication stress led to significantly increased γH2AX signal intensity in Anks6 knockdown cells compared with the intensity in the noninduced condition or that in cells expressing a control shRNA (Fig. 2D, Luci-i). The close biochemical association with known NPHPs and the previously reported function of NME family members in ciliary biogenesis prompted us to analyze the function of NME3 in two different vertebrate model systems, zebrafish and Xenopus laevis. First, the expression pattern of nme3 was determined by in situ hybridization at different embryonic stages. In Xenopus as well as in zebrafish, the expression was ubiquitous with above average expression in the central nervous system and the developing kidney in Xenopus embryos (Fig. S2, A and B). For loss-of-function experiments, we designed two individual translation-blocking antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) targeting the two different homeologs that exist for nme3 in Xenopus. The injection of either MO alone or a combination of both did not affect the gross morphology of nme3 morphants (Fig. S2C) but had pronounced effects on the elongation of the embryonic renal tubule (Fig. 3, A and B). The strongest phenotype was observed by knockdown of nme3a alone. Addition of nme3b MO did not decrease tubule length further, indicating that the presence of Nme3a is the rate-limiting factor and that Nme3b acts in addition, but not redundantly, to Nme3a (Fig. 3, A and B). The tubule-shortening phenotype has been observed as a result of knocking down a number of known NPHPs genes such as invs, nphp3, nek8, and anks6. Accordingly, in situ hybridization of different pronephric segment markers showed a result similar to that already seen after depletion of nek8, nphp3, and invs in Xenopus embryos (6Hoff S.

We used logistic regression models to identify the determinants of care-seeking outside the home and subsequent antibiotic use among the surveyed residents.Overall, 1103 valid questionnaires were collected, and 458 households reported that they had had experienced at least one acute illness in the previous 2 weeks. Of these households, 97.2% of individuals with acute conditions sought care outside their homes and 40.1% of individuals who took medicine received antibiotics. Only 15.9% of the individuals with acute conditions reported that the medical insurance reimbursement covered at least one medicine. According to the multivariate analyses, women were less likely to seek care outside the home compared to men. Among those who sought outside care, fever and upper respiratory symptoms increased the odds of taking antibiotics, and visiting a private hospital also increased antibiotic use. Low-income households were less likely to receive antibiotics. Symptoms were strong determinants of antibiotic use when patients sought outside care.The accessibility of medicine for acute illness among households in western China was favorable; however, medical insurance reimbursement must be improved. The nature of the symptoms and patterns of care-seeking had the greatest influence on the decision to take antibiotics among residents with acute conditions. The percentage of antibiotic use in patients with acute illness has declined, but the indications for using antibiotics must be standardized."
https://openalex.org/W2885050890,"Emotions are signaled by complex arrays of face and body actions. The main point of contention in contemporary treatments is whether these arrays are discrete, holistic constellations reflecting emotion categories, or whether they are compositional—comprised of smaller components, each of which contributes some aspect of emotion to the complex whole. We address this question by investigating spontaneous face and body displays of athletes and place it in the wider context of human communicative signals and, in particular, of language. A defining property of human language is compositionality—the ability to combine and recombine a relatively small number of elements to create a vast number of complex meaningful expressions, and to interpret them. We ask whether this property of language can be discerned in a more ancient communicative system: intense emotional displays. In an experiment, participants interpreted a range of emotions and their strengths in pictures of athletes who had just won or lost a competition. By matching participants’ judgements with minutely coded features of face and body, we find evidence for compositionality. The distribution of participants’ responses indicates that most of the athletes’ face and body features contribute to displays of dominance or submission. More particular emotional components related, for example, to positive valence (e.g. happy) or goal obstruction (e.g. frustrated), were also found to significantly correlate with certain face and body features. We propose that the combination of features linked to broader components (i.e, dominant or submissive) and to more particular emotions (e.g, happy or frustrated) reflects more complex emotional states. In sum, we find that the corporeal expression of intense, unfiltered emotion has compositional properties, potentially providing an ancient scaffolding upon which, millions of years later, the abstract and constrained compositional system of human language could build."
https://openalex.org/W2886898556,"Objective To determine whether the expression of IL17A and CD21L genes in inflamed rheumatoid synovia is associated with the neogenesis of ectopic lymphoid follicle-like structures (ELS), and if this aids the stratification of rheumatoid inflammation and thereby distinguishes patients with rheumatoid arthritis that might be responsive to specific targeted biologic therapies. Methods Expression of IL17A and CD21L genes was assessed by RT-PCR, qRT-PCR and dPCR in synovia from 54 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A subset of synovia (n = 30) was assessed by immunohistology for the presence of CD20+ B-lymphocytes and size of CD20+ B-lymphocyte aggregates as indicated by maximum radial cell count. The molecular profiles of six IL17A+/CD21L+ and six IL17A-/CD21L- synovia were determined by complementary DNA microarray analysis. Results By RT-PCR, 26% of synovia expressed IL17A and 52% expressed CD21L. This provided the basis for distinguishing four subgroups of rheumatoid synovia: IL17A+/CD21L+ (18.5% of synovia), IL17A+/CD21L- (7.5%), IL17A-/CD21L+ (33.3%) and IL17A-/CD21L- (40.7%). While the subgroups did not predict clinical outcome measures, comparisons between the synovial subgroups revealed the IL17A+/CD21L+ subgroup had significantly larger CD20+ B-lymphocyte aggregates (P = 0.007) and a gene expression profile skewed toward B-cell- and antibody-mediated immunity. In contrast, genes associated with bone and cartilage remodelling were prominent in IL17A-/CD21L- synovia. Conclusions Rheumatoid synovia can be subdivided on the basis of IL17A and CD21L gene expression. Ensuing molecular subgroups do not predict clinical outcome for patients but highlight high inflammation and the predominance of B-lymphocyte mediated mechanisms operating in IL17A+/CD21L+ synovia. This may provide a rationale for more refined therapeutic selection due to the distinct molecular profiles associated with IL17A+/CD21L+ and IL17A-/CD21L- rheumatoid synovia."
https://openalex.org/W2886061806,"The objective of this study was to assess the clinical value of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy (IC) in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LASCCHN).A prospective, single-arm, single center study was performed, with patients enrolled between February 2010 and July 2013.Patients (n = 49) with stage III/IVA-B LASCCHN who underwent IC with taxanes, cisplatin, and fluorouracil were recruited. Staging procedures included loco-regional and chest imaging, endoscopic examination, and PET/CT scan. On day 14 of the first cycle, a second PET/CT scan was performed. Patients with no early increase in regional lymph node maximum 18F-FDG standard uptake value (SUV), detected using 18F-FDG PET/CT after first IC had better progression-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.18, 95%, confidence interval (CI) 0.056-0.585; p = 0.004) and overall survival (HR = 0.14, 95% CI 0.040-0.498; p = 0.002), and were considered responders. In this subgroup, patients who achieved a reduction of ≥ 45% maximum primary tumor SUV experienced improved progression-free (HR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.062-0.854; p = 0.028) and overall (HR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.013-0.96; p = 0.046) survival.These results suggest a potential role for early response evaluation with PET/CT examination in patients with LASCCHN undergoing IC. Increased regional lymph node maximum SUV and insufficient decrease in primary tumor uptake predict poorer outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2887594674,"Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases play critical roles in the repair of abasic sites and strand breaks in DNA. Complete genome sequences of Helicobacter pylori reveal that this bacterial specie has a single AP endonuclease. An H. pylori homolog of Xth (HpXth) is a member of exonuclease III family, which is represented by Escherichia coli Xth. Currently, it remains unknown whether this single AP endonuclease has DNA repair activities similar to those of its counterpart in E. coli and other bacteria. We report that HpXth possesses efficient AP site cleavage, 3’-repair phosphodiesterase, and 3’-phosphatase activities but not the nucleotide incision repair function. Optimal reaction conditions for HpXth’s AP endonuclease activity are low ionic strength, high Mg2+ concentration, pH in the range 7–8, and temperature 30 °C. The kinetic parameters measured under steady-state conditions showed that HpXth removes the AP site, 3’-blocking sugar-phosphate, and 3’-terminal phosphate in DNA strand breaks with good efficiency (kcat/KM = 1240, 44, and 5,4 μM–1·min–1, respectively), similar to that of E. coli Xth. As expected, the presence of HpXth protein in AP endonuclease—deficient E. coli xth nfo strain significantly reduced the sensitivity to an alkylating agent and H2O2. Mutation of active site residue D144 in HpXth predicted to be essential for catalysis resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activities. Several important structural features of HpXth were uncovered by homology modeling and phylogenetic analysis. Our data show the DNA substrate specificity of H. pylori AP endonuclease and suggest that HpXth counteracts the genotoxic effects of DNA damage generated by endogenous and host-imposed factors."
https://openalex.org/W2886542366,"Amphibians are the vertebrate group with the highest number of species threatened with extinction, and habitat loss and fragmentation are considered to be among the leading causes of their declines and extinctions. Little is known of the population biology of amphibian species inhabiting montane forests in Central and West Africa, where anthropogenic activities such as farming and cattle raising are major threats to native biodiversity. We used Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) to assess the population genetic structure of two poorly known species, Cardioglossa schioetzi and Leptodactylodon bicolor (both in the Arthroleptidae), in and around Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve on the Mambilla Plateau in eastern Nigeria. The landscape comprises continuous forest on steep slopes and small riparian forest fragments in a grassland matrix. While increased fragmentation is well documented for these and other forests in the mountains of Cameroon and Nigeria over the past century, there are no previous assessments of the impact of forest fragmentation on montane amphibian populations in this region. Our estimates of genetic diversity are similar across populations within each species with levels of heterozygosity values consistent with local population declines. Except for a pair of populations (C. schioetzi) we did not observe genetic differentiation between forest and riparian forest fragment populations, nor across sites within continuous forest (L. bicolor). Our results demonstrate recent gene flow between forest fragments and the adjacent protected forests and suggest that small forest corridors connecting these may lessen the genetic consequences of at least 30 years of intense and severe fragmentation in Ngel Nyaki."
https://openalex.org/W2885444811,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical developmental disability in childhood with a prevalence of 2 to 3 per 1000 live births. β2-adrenoreceptor agonist (β2AA) are widely used for the treatment of asthma. Maternal use of β2AAs may increase the risk of adverse neuro-psychiatric health outcomes in the offspring. No study, however, has evaluated the effect of prenatal exposure to β2AAs on the risk of CP.To examine the association between prenatal exposure to β2AAs and the risk of childhood cerebral palsy.This population-based cohort study included all live singleton births in Denmark from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2003. The information on outpatient prescriptions of β2AAs was extracted from Danish National Prescription Registry. Children born to mothers who used β2AAs from 30 days before pregnancy until delivery were categorized as the exposed. To differentiate the effect of β2AAs from the underlying indications, the exposure window was further extended to 2 years before pregnancy and the exposed groups were re-defined to represent different periods of exposure to maternal use of β2AAs (use only before pregnancy, use only during pregnancy, and use both before and during pregnancy). Cases of CP were identified from the Danish Cerebral Palsy Register. Logistic regression was used to estimate incidence odds ratio (OR) of CP.Among all the 442,278 singletons, 19,616 (4.44%) were exposed to β2AAs in utero (from 30 days before pregnancy until delivery). The risk of childhood CP was 0.21% in exposed and 0.19% in unexposed group, yielding an adjusted OR (aOR) 1.12 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82, 1.53). When extending the exposure time window to 2 years prior to pregnancy, no overall significant association was observed regardless of the exposure period. However, an increased risk of CP (aOR = 1.41, 95%CI: 0.92, 2.18) for maternal β2AAs use during pregnancy was observed in female offspring, especially in those born at term (aOR = 1.65, 95%CI: 1.02, 2.67). This increase was mainly attributed to an increased risk in those born to mothers who used β2AAs both before and during pregnancy (aOR = 1.81, 95%CI: 0.99, 3.33).We observed an association between maternal β2AAs use during pregnancy and an increased risk of CP in female offspring, but we could not rule out confounding by the underlying indications for β2AAs."
https://openalex.org/W2886160074,"The knowledge of genetic trends and trade-offs between growth and reproductive traits might be useful to understand the evolution of these traits in livestock and natural populations of animals. We estimated the genetic trends and trade-offs between pre-weaning growth and calving intervals of Nellore animals from a commercial farm. Two-trait animal models were used to estimate covariance components and breeding values (EBV) for direct and maternal genetic effects of pre-weaning growth and direct genetic effects of calving intervals. Regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between direct and maternal EBV of pre-weaning growth and direct EBV of calving intervals (dependent variables) and the coefficient of generation of each animal (independent variable). We also performed regression analyses to examine the relationship between direct EBV of calving intervals (dependent variables) and direct and maternal EBV of pre-weaning growth (independent variables). The genetic trends for direct and maternal genetic effect for pre-weaning growth were significant and presented genetic evolution in the studied Nellore herd. The genetic trends for the reproductive traits were also significant but indicated genetic changes in an unfavorable way. The genetic correlations between direct effects of pre-weaning growth and calving intervals traits and the genetic correlations between maternal effects of pre-weaning growth traits and direct effects of calving interval traits were not different from zero. The presence of trade-offs between the direct effects of growth and reproductive traits were confirmed through regression from direct EBV of calving intervals over EBV of pre-weaning growth traits. In addition, regression analyses showed that selection to increase pre-weaning growth also increased calving intervals. Our results showed that pre-weaning growth and calving intervals are increasing over generations and that trade-offs occurred between those traits in the studied Nellore herd."
https://openalex.org/W2886510557,"Background Although cancer management in dialysis patients has become a commonly encountered issue, known as “onco-nephrology”, few evidence-based clinical recommendations have been proposed. Here, we examined the variation in referral behaviors adopted by dialysis physicians on encountering dialysis patients with signs/symptoms suggestive of cancer. Methods We conducted a vignette-based study in August 2015. We sent a 14-page questionnaire to 191 dialysis physicians, including the representative dialysis facilities participating in a Japanese dialysis cohort (the Japan Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study). Using vignette scenarios for respiratory, digestive, and urological areas, we assessed the referral behaviors (expert referral or not) adopted by dialysis physicians on encountering dialysis patients with symptoms suggestive of cancer. Each scenario contained three patient functional factors: age (60 or 75 years), performance status (PS 0 or 1), and cognitive dysfunction (absence or presence). We examined the association between physician factors, patient factors, and referral behaviors. Results We obtained 94 replies (response rate: 49.2%). For the respiratory scenarios, 38.3% and 51.9% of physicians reported watchful waiting when encountering bilateral and unilateral pleural effusion, respectively. In digestive and urologic scenarios, most physicians (>85%) selected expert referral. We detected differences in referral behaviors between scenarios with different cancer biological factors. However, we found consistency in referral behaviors within the same scenario, even with different patient functional factors (intra-class correlation coefficients within each scenario all >0.7). Conclusions Physicians’ referral behaviors for dialysis patients suspected of having cancer vary for different cancer biological factors (probability of having cancer). However, the referral behaviors are similar for different patient functional factors (age, PS, and cognitive dysfunction)."
https://openalex.org/W2886969188,"Background Lumefantrine is a long-acting antimalarial drug with an elimination half-life of over 3 days and protein binding of 99 percent. Correlation of lumefantrine concentrations from capillary plasma via fingerprick (Cc) versus venous plasma (Cv) remains to be defined. Methods Venous and capillary plasma samples were collected simultaneously from children, pregnant women, and non-pregnant adults at 2, 24, 120hr post last dose of a standard 3-day artemether-lumefantrine regimen they received for uncomplicated malaria. Some of the enrolled children and pregnant women were also HIV-infected. Samples were analyzed via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Linear regression analysis was performed using the program Stata® SE12.1. Results In children, the linear regression equations for Cc vs Cv at 2, 24, and 120hr (day 7) post dose are [Cc] = 1.05*[Cv]+95.0 (n = 142, R2 = 0.977), [Cc] = 0.995*[Cv]+56.7 (n = 147, R2 = 0.990) and [Cc] = 0.958*[Cv]+18.6 (n = 139, R2 = 0.994), respectively. For pregnant women, the equations are [Cc] = 1.04*[Cv]+68.1 (n = 43, R2 = 0.990), [Cc] = 0.997*[Cv]+37.3 (n = 43, R2 = 0.993) and [Cc] = 0.941*[Cv]+11.1 (n = 41, R2 = 0.941), respectively. For non-pregnant adults, the equations are [Cc] = 1.05*[Cv]-117 (n = 32, R2 = 0.958), [Cc] = 0.962*[Cv]+9.21 (n = 32, R2 = 0.964) and [Cc] = 1.04*[Cv]-40.1 (n = 32, R2 = 0.988), respectively. In summary, a linear relationship with a slope of ~1 was found for capillary and venous lumefantrine levels in children, pregnant women and non-pregnant adults at 2hr, 24hr and 120hr post last dose, representing absorption, distribution, and elimination phases. Conclusions Capillary and venous plasma concentration of lumefantrine can be used interchangeably at 1:1 ratio. Capillary sampling method via finger prick is a suitable alternative for sample collection in clinical studies."
