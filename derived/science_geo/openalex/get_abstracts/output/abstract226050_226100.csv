https://openalex.org/W1966638707,"Draper and Whitehead and their co-workers1 have described a phenomenon which they have called ‘diffusion respiration’. In experiments with dogs, they have shown that the blood under certain conditions will be normally oxygenated from the lungs without respiratory movements and without rhythmical changes of pressure in the lungs. They explain this phenomenon as follows. Owing to the affinity of oxygen for hæmoglobin, the amount of oxygen removed from the alveoli during apnea exceeds the amount of carbon dioxide that simultaneously enters from the blood. The pressure within the alveoli is therefore reduced below that of the atmosphere, and a continuous inward movement of the dead-space air and the external atmosphere takes place. Essential conditions, however, for diffusion respiration are a high percentage of oxygen in the lungs and in the dead space, a free airway and an adequate circulation. During the first thirty minutes of diffusion respiration the uptake of oxygen is not reduced. After this time the oxygen consumption and the oxygen content of the blood decrease due, probably, to the Bohr effect produced by retention of carbon dioxide, with respiratory acidosis and low blood pH."

https://openalex.org/W2988922472,"THERE has been a lively discussion, in Nature1 and elsewhere2, on the classification of recent fossil finds in South Africa. Prof. S. Zuckerman has rightly stressed the need for basing such decisions on statistical tests. But his findings have been at odds with those based on classical comparisons; so that anthropologists must now be in doubt whether their science has, indeed, anything to learn from statistics."

https://openalex.org/W48424506,"THAT alterations in the functional interrelationships of the liver and spleen may cause changes in the formed elements of the blood is suggested by the syndrome of portal vein hypertension. In this connexion, the experimental work of Bock and Frenzel1 is noteworthy. These workers reported that ligation of the splenic and gastric coronary veins leads to anæmia and leukopænia in the rabbit."

https://openalex.org/W2064151168,"FROM the leaves of Lespedeza cyrtobotrya Miquel, a deciduous shrub of the natural family Leguminosae, M. Hasegawa and I isolated a kaempferol glycoside which we named lespedin1,2, its structure being shown to be kaempferol 3,7-dirhamnoside. It has also been isolated from Celastrus orbiculatus Thunberg (family Celastraceae) by M. Kanao and M. Shimokoriyama3. When crystallized from water, lespedin had melting point 195° with or without water of crystallization (3½H2O), whereas from ethanol it melted at 234°. It thus appeared to be different from kaempferitrin, melting point 201–203° 4."

In collaboration with Happey4, they have further claimed to have demonstrated that the new component is a β-type protein, that is, allied in molecular structure to stretched hair, silk, etc., and that this β-type molecular structure accounts for the stability and resistance of the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2039901917,"THE importance of a knowledge of the effect of temperature on the metabolic activities of the soil microflora can scarcely be questioned, especially in the case of tropical soils. Furthermore, the temperature characteristic of the metabolic activities calculated by the Arrhenius's law: V = exp(−μ/RT), where V is the rate of the process, R the gas constant and T the absolute temperature, may be considered as the activation energy of the slowest or ‘pacemaking’ process in the chain of enzymatic mechanisms1. In this case it would be possible to use this method as a kinetic analysis of the slowest enzymatic processes in the metabolism of the soil microflora."

https://openalex.org/W2055386704,"IN some preliminary experiments it was observed that the administration of cortisone to twelve-day old chick embryos caused their gall bladders to become distended and bile to flow prematurely into their intestines. Accordingly a substantial experiment was performed to confirm or deny these preliminary findings, and since there are certain difficulties associated with obtaining either rapid or complete absorption of substances injected into chick embryos, comparatively large doses of cortisone were employed. A dose of 5 mgm. of cortisone (‘Cortone acetate’) was given to each of sixty White Leghorn chick embryos on the twelfth day of incubation, either by injecting it into the yolk or on to the chorioallan-toic membrane. For controls, seventy-five embryos were similarly injected with the same volume of normal saline. The eggs were harvested on the fifteenth day of incubation. The diameters and the lengths of the gall bladders were measured with calipers and their volumes were determined by assuming them to be cylinders. Observations were made in each instance on whether or not bile had reached the intestine to colour it green."
https://openalex.org/W2087519488,"SALT1 has reviewed the literature on the effect of hosts upon their insect parasites. Knight2 found that a carotinoid pigment of the bug Perillus was obtained from its prey, the potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata). Toumanoff3 discovered that in Dixippus morosus the pigmentation may be transmitted by the female to the eggs and so to the offspring. I have not come across any record of the effect of hosts upon the pigmentation of the eggs of the parasite."
