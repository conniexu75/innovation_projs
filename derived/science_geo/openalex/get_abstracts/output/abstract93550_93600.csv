https://openalex.org/W1566845757,"A method is described for the affinity purification of antibodies using protein samples that have been electrophoretically transferred to diazotized paper. Using differentiated neuroblastoma cells as the protein sample and a heterogeneous anti-microtubule protein serum, antibodies were isolated that specifically bound only to tubulin on blots and that stained microtubule networks in cells. The general utility of this method for various types of applications is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1674727977,"Tryptase, the predominant neutral protease in human mast cell secretory granules, was purified to homogeneity from dissociated and concentrated pulmonary mast cells by sequential chromatography on Dowex 1-X2, DEAE-Sephadex, and heparin-agarose. Purified tryptase gave a single stained protein band on polyacrylamide gels after electrophoresis at pH 4.3 in the presence of 4 M urea. The enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 120,000 to 140,000 by gel filtration chromatography. Electrophoresis of purified tryptase under denaturing conditions revealed subunits with molecular weights of 37,000 and 35,000 in a molar ratio of 1:1, consistent with a tetrameric subunit structure for the holoenzyme of Mr = 144,000. Both subunits bind [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate as assessed by the correspondence of radioactivity with the two stained protein bands in a polyacrylamide gel after electrophoresis of purified tryptase under denaturing conditions, indicating that all four subunits of the holoenzyme may have active site capacity. Purified tryptase has a specific activity for tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester of 97 units/mg (1 unit = 1 mumol of substrate cleaved/min at 22 degrees C). Human pulmonary mast cells contain tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester-esterase at levels more than 100-fold higher than those of human neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes. One million mast cells contain about 1.1 units, or 6 to 19 micrograms of tryptase, and have the capacity to contribute dominant levels of this enzyme at tissue sites of mast cell degranulation."

https://openalex.org/W1784665074,"The lactose carrier protein of Escherichia coli was purified by a simple procedure employing differential solubilization and ion-exchange chromatography and reconstituted into liposomes by octylglucoside dilution. The proteoliposomes exhibited both membrane potential-driven lactose transport and lactose counterflow. Furthermore, the purified protein was identified as the product of the lac y gene. These and other results demonstrate that the lactose carrier is the only polypeptide species essential for energy-coupled lactose transport and counterflow."
https://openalex.org/W1509070024,Protein synthesis initiation factor levels are measured in crude cell lysates of Escherichia coli MRE600 by use of a sensitive immunoblotting method. The method involves electrophoretic transfer of protein from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels onto nitrocellulose paper and subsequent incubation with a specific antiserum and radioactive iodinated second antibody. The measurement of iodinated antibody attached to known amounts of initiation factor is determined by densitometric scanning of autoradiographs or counting radioactivity in excised protein bands. Linear standard curves over the range 1 to 300 ng of factor are obtained by these methods. Unknown amounts of initiation factor in crude cell lysates are measured accurately; values agree with previous radioimmune assay data. The immunoblotting method serves as an alternative to the radioimmune assay in measuring small quantities of protein in complex mixtures. Immunoblotting enjoys three major advantages: it is simple and rapid to execute; it is sensitive; and it is capable of distinguishing multiple forms of the antigen which separate in the gel system employed.

Immunoreactive axons and cell bodies were mainly located in cortical, limbic, and hypothalamic areas. Immunostaining of serial sections of the brain and pituitary showed that the Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 immunoreactive neurons were different from neurons labeled by antibodies to either Met-enkephalin or the putative Met-enkephalin precursor Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Phe, which is structurally related to Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2. Control staining by antiserum absorption and radioimmunoassay indicated that the antibodies that caused the specific immunofluorescence recognized peptides with an amidated Arg-Phe sequence at the carboxyl terminus."

https://openalex.org/W1485774101,"gcr is a mutation considerably decreasing the assayed amounts of most glycolysis enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Clifton, D., Weinstock, S. B., and Fraenkel, D. G. (1978) Genetics 88, 1-11). We show here that although in the wild type strain the amounts of these enzymes do not greatly differ between cells from different media, in the gcr mutant strain most of the enzyme amounts are 5% or less, relative to wild type, from cells grown without sugars, but 20-50% from cells grown with sugars. Lower relative values were found for phosphoglycerate mutase and enolase. A corresponding alteration in the mutant in the intensities of several major protein bands could even be seen in stained gels after electrophoresis of crude extracts: the profiles were otherwise normal. Results of titration of phosphoglycerate kinase with antibody accorded with activity. Transfer of cells between the two types of media did not lead to a more rapid adjustment of enzyme amounts than expected from the steady state levels. gcr is not allelic to GPM (the gene for phosphoglycerate mutase) or to RNA1 (which affects transport of RNA from the nucleus). Translation of total RNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate gave a pattern of polypeptides similar to the in vivo one. Thus, gcr is likely to affect somehow mRNA synthesis or lifetime for a discrete number of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1503286836,"To characterize metabolic factors potentially associated with alcohol-induced heart disease, myocardial ethanol intermediary metabolism was studied in isolated, perfused rabbit hearts and whole heart homogenates. Results showed that intact rabbit hearts and homogenates of rabbit left ventricle incorporate carbon-14-labeled ethanol at 20 and 59 nmol/g/h, respectively, into a neutral lipid species that co-migrates with triacylglycerides in standard chromatographic solvent systems. After isolation and purification by thin layer chromatography in an apolar solvent system, the labeled species were identified by gas chromatographic-mass spectral analysis to be a family of fatty acid ethyl esters. Heat inactivation of incorporation and the kinetics of formation of products suggest that the process is enzymatic. Gas chromatography identified the fatty acid components as predominantly unsaturated moieties, especially oleic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids. These results provide insight into potential biochemical mechanisms contributing to the triacylglyceride accumulation, decreased beta oxidation of fatty acids, and other lipid abnormalities typical of effects of ethanol on the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1482788902,"The technique of small angle x-ray scattering has been employed to study the effect of sugars on the radius of gyration of the L-arabinose-binding protein, a component of the high affinity L-arabinose transport system in Escherichia coli. We find that the binding of L-arabinose to the sugar-free protein in solution causes a 0.94 +/- 0.33 A decrease in the radius of gyration while D-glucose, a nonbinder, produces no such effect. The radius of gyration calculated from the complete atomic co-ordinates of the crystal structure of L-arabinose-binding protein (solved with bound L-arabinose) corresponds to the experimentally determined value for the radius of gyration in the presence of L-arabinose. This reduction in radius of gyration can be best accounted for in terms of a substrate-induced cleft closure in which one lobe rotates relative to the other lobe. A compute modeling study indicates that a rotation of 18 degrees about a hinge deep in the base of the sugar-binding cleft between the two domains would produce the observed decrease in the radius of gyration. The findings (Newcomer, M. E., Gilliland, G. L., and Quiocho, F. A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 13213-13222) that the L-arabinose molecule embedded in the cleft between two domains is completely inaccessible to the solvent is consistent with a closing of the cleft between the two lobes."
https://openalex.org/W1562010057,"The region of yeast mitochondrial DNA between 10.7 and 17.9 map units has been characterized by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. The DNA sequence was obtained from the partially overlapping genomes of the two rho- mutants DS200/A1 and DS302. Two tRNA genes have been found in the sequence upstream of the oxi1 gene. The deduced secondary structures indicate that the genes code for the methionine (5'-CAU-3') and the asparagine (5'-GUU-3') tRNAs of yeast mitochondria. The region between 10.7 and 17.9 units contains two reading frames. One of these corresponds to the oxi1 gene previously shown to code for subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase (Coruzzi, G., and Tzagoloff, A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254,. 9324-9330; Fox, T. D. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76, 6534-6538). The second reading frame can potentially code for a basic protein with 386 amino acid residues. It is not known at present if this putative gene is translated in vivo. Northern blots of wild type mitochondrial RNA were hybridized to single-stranded probes from the oxi1 gene and flanking regions. The results of these analyses indicate that the primary transcript of the oxi1 region is a high molecular weight RNA (larger than 3 kilobase pairs) which is processed in discrete steps to a mature 850-nucleotide messenger. The 5' leader of the messenger has been established to be 54 nucleotides long and to have a sequence identical with that of the genomic DNA immediately upstream of the oxi1 gene."

https://openalex.org/W1534571178,"Kinetic experiments were performed to determine the effects of insulin receptor occupancy on insulin binding. The following results were obtained: (a) the rate constant (k1) for uptake of 125I-insulin by liver plasma membranes was 2 X 10(6) M-1 s-1 and invariant at applied hormone concentrations of 7.5 to 100 X 10(-11) M. 125I-Insulin dissociated from membranes in a biphasic manner with rapid (k-1 = 2-4 X 10(-3) s-1) and slow (k-1 = 2-3 X 10(-4) s-1) components of release when dissociation was initiated by dilution into excess medium. Under all dissociation conditions employed, 125I-insulin was the radioactive species bound to and released from membranes. (b) Native insulin (100 nM) or 131I-insulin (5 nM) in the dissociation medium enhanced the dilution-induced dissociation of bound 125I-insulin. In the latter experiment, total receptor occupancy (bound 125I-insulin and 131I-insulin) decreased during dissociation. The enhanced dissociation effect was therefore not necessarily due to increased site occupancy. (c) As association time prior to dissociation was increased, the dissociability of bound 125I-insulin diminished. Decreased dissociability resulted from an increase in the slow component of hormone release at the expense of the rapid component. 131I-insulin was bound to membranes to which 125I-insulin had been prebound. The dissociation of 131I-insulin had been prebound. The dissociation of 131I-insulin was unaffected by the presence of 125I-insulin dissociating at either rapid or slow rates. The data suggest that there are no cooperative interactions between binding sites and that the hormone-receptor complex converts to a higher affinity state subsequent to occupancy since KD = k-1/k1 and K-1 decreased. A two-state model for the hepatic insulin receptor is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1526405599,"A photosystem I reaction center was isolated from Chlamydomonas reinhardii chloroplasts. It consists of four different polypeptides with Mr approximately 70,000 (subunit I), 19,000 (subunit II), 10,000 (subunit III), and 8,000 (subunit IV). In the presence of salts, the purified reaction center was active in cytochrome 552 photooxidation. Short term labeling experiments with [35S]sulfate revealed that subunit III contains no cysteine or methionine. Subunits I and IV were shown to be chloroplast translation products, while subunit II appears to be synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes. The site of synthesis of the subunits to the proton-ATPase complex was studied. A differential effect of cycloheximide on the assembly of photosystem I reaction center and the proton-ATPase complex was indicated."
https://openalex.org/W1573529104,"L-Threonine dehydrogenase (L-threonine:NAD+ oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.103) has been purified to apparent homogeneity from chicken liver mitochondria. The presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and glycerol is necessary for stabilizing the enzyme during purification and storage. The enzyme is a monomer and has Mr approximately equal to 88,000. The pH optimum is 8.6 to 8.7, and the isoelectric point of the enzyme is 5.9. The enzyme is specific for L-threonine and NAD+. The Km values for L-threonine and NAD+ are 8.4 and 0.98 mM, respectively. Kinetic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds through an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism where NAD+ is added first, followed by L-threonine. Chicken liver mitochondria contain aminoacetone synthase (acetyl-CoA:glycine C-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.29)). The enzyme has been partially purified. In the presence of L-threonine dehydrogenase and aminoacetone synthase, L-threonine is cleaved to glycine and acetyl-CoA via 2-amino-3-oxobutyrate. The result suggests that L-threonine dehydrogenase and aminoacetone synthase have a physiological role in L-threonine metabolism in vertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W1573631938,"The major desamido form of human growth hormone (hGH) results from deamidation of asparagine 152. Peptide mapping and amino acid sequencing were used in the identification. This desamido form (hGHAsp152) could be produced by incubation of the undeamidated hormone in an alkaline medium. Another minor deamidated form which contained glutamic acid at 137 (hGHGlu137) also was identified in preparations of hGH. This form was not produced by alkaline treatment of hGH. Limited hydrolysis of hGH with subtilisin produced two cleaved forms, one with cleavages at positions 139 and 149 and another with cleavages at 139 and 146. hGHAsp152 underwent only one type of modification, cleavage at positions 139 and 146. Hydrolysis of hGHGlu137 resulted in cleavages in the region of 139 to 149 identical with those noted with hGH, but in addition, proteolysis had occurred in the region of 95 to 127, an area where hGH was not attacked by subtilisin. That Glu at 137 modified cleavage points was also indicated by the greater resistance of hGHGlu137 to hydrolysis by subtilisin as compared to hGH. The results demonstrate that deamidation can alter points of proteolytic cleavage. If proteolytic processing of hGH is found to be of physiologic significance, deamidation may be a way of directing specific cleavages."

The ability of the two parasites to infect HeLa cells increased as the HeLa cells proceeded from the G1 phase to the S phase of their growth cycle and decreased as the cells entered G2-M.

https://openalex.org/W2157593554,"The L-arabinose molecule (in the C1 pyranose chair conformation) has been fitted to the electron density corresponding to the bound sugar in the 2.4 A resolution Fourier map of the L-arabinose-binding protein. The sugar molecule is buried in the cleft between the two lobes of the bilobate protein. All sugar hydroxyls are hydrogen-bonded to side chain residues: beta-OH(1) to Lys-10 and Asp-90, OH(2) to Lys-10, OH(3) to Asn-205 and Glu-14 (possibly via a water molecule), and OH(4) to Asn-232. Lys-10, Glu-14, and Asp-90 are associated with one domain while Asn-205 and Asn-232 are lodged in the other. Protein structural change accompanying binding is indicated by the inaccessibility of the bound L-arabinose to the aqueous environment."
https://openalex.org/W1548736145,"We have previously reported that incubation of rat hepatoma cells with insulin causes a complete and reversible loss of responsiveness to insulin. In order to determine the role of the insulin receptor in desensitization, we have examined the effect of insulin on insulin binding. Exposure of rat hepatoma cells to insulin causes a time-dependent decrease in insulin binding capacity which is detectable at 30 min and maximal at 4-6 h, after which time insulin binding remains 40-50% that of untreated cells. Scatchard analysis indicates that insulin causes a decrease in the number of receptors with little change in the binding affinity. Insulin-induced down regulation of receptors, observable at insulin concentrations as low as 3 ng/ml, is half-maximal at 10-20 ng/ml and is maximal at 100 ng of insulin/ml. When insulin is removed from the culture medium, the cells slowly recover insulin binding capacity; recovery is minimal at 2-4 h but nearly complete after 24 h. Recovery of insulin responsiveness, in contrast, is complete as early as 2 h after insulin is removed. The extent of down regulation of receptors (50-60%) is not sufficient to account for the complete insulin desensitization. In addition, recovery of maximal responsiveness to insulin occurs long before recovery of insulin binding. Therefore, insulin-induced desensitization to insulin is not caused by down regulation of receptors but must involve a post-receptor mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1583988104,"By growing a sterol-requiring strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the presence of pairs of sterols differing by a single structural change, the in vivo specificity of sterol uptake and esterification was measured. Uptake specificity was demonstrated for the delta 5-, delta 7-, and delta 22- bonds as well as the 24 beta-methyl. Sterol uptake was shown to depend on the metabolic state of the cell, and the apparent Km of uptake for ergosterol (11.1 microM) was lower than that of cholesterol (66.7 microM). This difference in apparent Km can explain the preferential utilization of ergosterol. The selectivity for esterification showed that sterols lacking the delta 7- or delta 22- bond or the 24 beta-methyl were preferentially esterified. However, sterols lacking the delta 5-bond were not preferentially esterified. This specificity of uptake and esterification did not change significantly with alterations in the fatty acid source. These results suggest that both uptake and esterification are used to control the types of sterols in the free sterol fraction, resulting in the enrichment of ergosterol-like sterols in cellular membranes. An additional finding was that cells supplemented with sterols which have a delta 5,7-diene (7-dehydrocholesterol and ergosterol) had much reduced levels of steryl ester. This may be attributable to inhibition by a breakdown product(s) of these sterols."

https://openalex.org/W1666516032,"In the presence of ATP and an excess of recA protein, superhelical closed circular DNA (form I DNA) and homologous single-stranded fragments paired to form D-loops in the early stage of incubation and dissociated during subsequent incubation. RecA protein that was not bound to single-stranded DNA (free recA protein) was shown to be responsible for the dissociation of D-loops. Larger amount of free recA protein gave a lower final yield of D-loops. When the concentration of form I DNA was increased in the presence of a fixed amount of single-stranded DNA, larger amounts of free recA protein were required to produce a certain extent of dissociation. When form I DNA, excess recA protein, and ATP were incubated without single-stranded DNA, or with heterologous single-stranded fragments before the addition of homologous single-stranded fragments, formation and subsequent dissociation of D-loops were observed as in the case when all components of the reaction were added from the start. Therefore, the dissociation of D-loops is a result of the stoichiometric interaction between free recA protein and form I DNA bearing D-loops. In the process of formation and dissociation of D-loops, form I DNA was converted to an inactive substrate without any apparent damage to the DNA. The concentration of free recA protein appeared to decrease during the reaction. These observations revealed that formation and dissociation of D-loops are sequential reactions when form I DNA is the substrate and recA protein is present in excess. The dissociation of D-loops and the inactivation of form I DNA can be explained by a model in which recA protein cooperatively binds to form I DNA from the site of D-loop, resulting in stimulation of unidirectional unwinding of the double helix."
https://openalex.org/W1481360568,"The biosynthesis of carboxypeptidase Y, which is located in the lysosome-like vacuole of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been studied in vitro in a cell-free translation system from wheat germ and in vivo in intact spheroplasts. When a wheat germ system was programmed with yeast RNA, a translation product was immunoprecipitated by anti-carboxypeptidase Y antibodies, which had a slightly smaller molecular weight (Mr = 59,000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis than the authentic glycoprotein (Mr = 60,000). In the presence of dog pancreatic microsomal membranes, an additional cross-reacting translation product of Mr = 68,000 was formed, which in contrast to the 59,000-dalton form was not susceptible to digestion by externally added proteinases, suggesting its segregation within the microsomal vesicles. The observed increase in molecular weight may be consistent with a core glycosylation of the translocated protein. During a pulse-chase labeling of spheroplasts, the antibody initially precipitated a form of carboxypeptidase Y, which co-migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels with the 68,000-dalton in vitro translation product. Following a chase of 60 min, this early labeled immunoreactive protein was completely converted into the authentic enzyme (Mr = 60,000) and is therefore coincident with the in vivo precursor of carboxypeptidase Y previously described (Hasilik, A., and Tanner, W. (1978) Eur. J. Biochem. 85, 599-608). These data suggest that a vacuolar yeast enzyme is synthesized via a cotranslational segregation of its nascent polypeptide chain within the endoplasmic reticulum giving rise to a proenzyme, which is further processed in vivo into the vacuole-located mature enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1568640694,"We have previously established that preincubation of guinea pig macrophages with crude preparations of macrophage glycolipids enhances their response to a mediator of cellular immunity, migration inhibitory factor.

This component was purified to homogeneity by phase partition, ion exchange, adsorption, and thin layer chromatography. It migrates in the ganglioside region on thin layer plates, contains sialic acid and sphingosine. There is no apparent identity with any of the common gangliosides possessing the gangliotetraose structure. Homogeneity was demonstrated by rechromatography in four additional solvent systems. These results are discussed in the context of their implications for a deeper understanding of the putative receptor function of this glycolipid."
https://openalex.org/W1578715445,The reconstitution of binding protein-dependent glutamine transport in isolated membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli is described. The reconstituted glutamine transport is shown to be energy-dependent and does not involve the metabolism of glutamine or the trapping of liganded binding protein with the vesicles. The preparation of vesicles capable of transporting glutamine in a binding protein-dependent manner required the incorporation of NAD into vesicles and the use of a binding protein point mutant as the source of the vesicles.
https://openalex.org/W1556564924,"The reverse reaction of aspartate transcarbamylase in which phosphate or arsenate is first coupled to carbamyl aspartate, followed by elimination of aspartate, has been studied under conditions in which one product, aspartate, is removed. Aspartate is converted to oxalacetate by glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase, and the resulting oxalacetate is converted to malate by the NADH, NAD+ oxidoreductase enzyme malate dehydrogenase. Phosphate and carbamyl aspartate saturation curves are nonsigmoidal. The transition state analogue, N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate, activates this reverse reaction substantially. Reverse kinetic parameters of the Haldane type are characteristic of the T-state and correlated with the parameters of the usual forward reaction of the T-state. Phosphate and carbamyl aspartate do not alter the thiol reactivity or sedimentation coefficient of the enzyme. These five results indicate that, under the conditions of these experiments, the reverse reaction does not cause the allosteric transition. In a new assay for the forward reaction we couple phosphate production with NADP reduction using phosphorylase a, phosphoglucomutase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1484427909,"Two structurally different classes of oligonucleotides accumulate in vitro in cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV) transcription mixtures in molar excess as compared to the completed RNA products. The first class consists of oligonucleotides which correspond to the 5'-terminal sequence of the virus mRNAs (referred to as initiator oligonucleotides). The major species of initiator oligonucleotides are (p)ppApG and (p)ppApGpN together with smaller amounts of homologous capped structures (Furuichi, Y. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 483-493). In addition to initiator oligonucleotides, CPV transcription mixtures yielded a second new class of compounds which were radiolabeled by [alpha-32P]GTP and resistant to phosphatase digestion. Their structures were identified as G(5')pppp(5')A, G(5')pppp(5')C, G(5')pppp(5')G, and G(5')pppp(5')U. With the exception of G(5')pppp(5')G, these compounds have not been observed previously. The mechanism of synthesis of these unique compounds was elucidated as pppG + pppN leads to GppppN + PPi. The reaction resembles, in principle, a guanylylation reaction which occurs during cap formation in CPV and other eukaryotic mRNA syntheses. It is likely that these compounds are formed in a similar way by a condensation reaction involving a viral guanylyltransferase-pG intermediate complex and ribonucleoside triphosphate. When the amounts of G(5')pppp(5')N were measured, it was found that G(5')pppp(5')N reached maximum concentrations (0.4 to 0.7 microM) shortly after the onset of RNA synthesis (1 h) and these levels were maintained or diminished gradually. By contrast, mRNA and (p)ppApG were continuously synthesized. The relative molar ratios of total G(5')pppp(5')N and (p)ppApG versus mRNA were comparable (74:24:1 and 30:27:1 during 1 to 4 h transcription, respectively). The results imply that these unusual compounds G(5')pppp(5')N as well as initiator oligonucleotides may be produced reiteratively during initiation when RNA chain elongation and capping are uncoupled."
https://openalex.org/W1530571361,"Upon treatment of Escherichia coli cells with globomycin, precursors of Braun's lipoprotein, a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) and several new species of lipoproteins accumulated in the cell envelope (Hussain, M. Ichihara, S., and Mizushima, S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3707-3012; and Ichihara, S., Hussain, M., and Mizushima, S. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3125-3129). The precursors of the Braun's lipoprotein and PAL thus accumulated were able to interact with the peptidoglycan layer. A considerable fraction of the precursor of Braun's lipoprotein was covalently bound to the peptidoglycan layer through its COOH-terminal lysine residue in the same manner as in the mature form. The manner of interaction of the precursor of PAL with the peptidoglycan layer was also the same as that of its mature form in which the central to COOH-terminal region of the lipoprotein is important for the interaction. Both precursors were localized in the cytoplasmic membrane when the outer and cytoplasmic membranes were separated after digestion by lysozyme of the peptidoglycan layer. When the cell envelope fraction was incubated, these precursors were chased to the corresponding mature forms. These results indicate that these proteins can be exported through the cytoplasmic membrane while they still retain the signal peptide that is most probably held in the cytoplasmic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1533201729,"Thymidylate synthetase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified over 20,000-fold to apparent homogeneity by a procedure involving two new affinity methods and several precautions for avoiding proteolysis. Molecular weight of the native enzyme was about 65,000, as determined by gel filtration and velocity sedimentation. Electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate yielded a single band of molecular weight 30,000, suggesting that thymidylate synthetase is a dimer of very similar or identical subunits. The purified enzyme exhibited normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics toward both substrates, with apparent Km values for dUMP and for (--)-5,10-methylene-tetrahydropteroylglutamate of 5 microM and 70 microM, respectively. When the pentaglutamyl form of the cofactor was used, its apparent Km was lower (7 microM), but Vmax was unaltered. Reaction kinetics and product inhibition studies were most consistent with an ordered mechanism, wherein dUMP is the first substrate to bind and 7,8-dihydropteroylglutamate is the first product released. Halogenated analogs of the nucleotide substrate were competitive inhibitors of the yeast enzyme, with apparent Ki values for 5-fluoro-dUMP of 5 nM and for 5-Br-dUMP of 10 microM. Analogs of the cofactor were also competitive inhibitors, with apparent Ki values for both methotrexate and aminopterin of about 20 microM. Cibacron blue, a dye used as the ligand in an affinity adsorbent for one of the purification steps, was a potent competitive inhibitor with respect to either substrate, yielding apparent Ki values of 4 nM for the nucleotide binding site and 40 nM for the cofactor binding site."

With these reconstituted vesicles, a steady state internal Na+ concentration was established by oxaloacetate decarboxylation which was about 30 times higher than that of the external medium. The presence of low concentrations of the Na+-carrying ionophores nigericin or trinactin almost completely abolished the oxaloacetate-dependent Na+ transport, whereas the uncoupler, carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, was without effect. The results are in accord with the function of oxaloacetate decarboxylase as a primary active Na+ pump converting the energy of the decarboxylation reaction into a Na+ gradient."
https://openalex.org/W1508199184,"Two forms of tetanus toxin have been purified from Clostridium tetani cultures. These forms, obtained from filtrate and cellular extracts, were characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation using both conventional and meniscus-depletion sedimentation equilibrium. The molecular weight of filtrate toxin was found to be 128,000 +/- 3,000, while the extract toxin, which tended to self-associate, appeared somewhat larger, 140,000 +/- 5,000. The heavy and light chains were prepared from filtrate toxin, and their molecular weights were estimated to be 87,000 and 48,000, respectively, using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The circular dichroic spectra of the extract and filtrate toxins are quite similar between 200-300 nm indicating that no major conformational difference exists between the two. The toxins contain both alpha-helicity and beta-structure. Interestingly, the isolated chains contain appreciable helicity (e.g., the sum of the chain helicities is over 80% of that found in filtrate toxin), but they appear to have relatively low contents of beta-structure. The sum of the spectra of the chains in both the near- and far-ultraviolet does not yield that found for filtrate toxin, although the similarity is far more striking than the difference. The prominent 293.5 nm negative circular dichroic band of tetanus toxin can be assigned to tryptophanyl residues almost exclusively in the heavy chain. The similarity in the magnitude of this band in the separated chain and toxin suggests that the microenvironments of the contributing tryptophans change very little when toxin is dissociated into its constituent chains."
https://openalex.org/W1582864562,"Renin-binding protein (RBP) in hog kidney was characterized and identified as a renin inhibitor. The molecular weight (Mr) of rBP is 56,000 when estimated by gel filtration. Its isoelectric point is 4.9. Upon binding to renin, it forms a renin.RBP complex with Mr = 113,000 as revealed by sedimentation equilibrium using an air-driven ultracentrifuge (Airfuge). The renin.RBP complex, formed by incubating hog kidney extract at 37 degrees C, is inactive when assayed with little dilution. On extensive dilution, however, this complex dissociates and acquires renin activity. The equilibrium between renin and renin.RBP complex and the equilibration rate were also studied by high performance liquid chromatographic gel filtration. The equilibrium was shifted to the complex, suggesting that RBP is present in an excess of renin in the kidney. The complex was shown to dissociate during the gel filtration due to rapid equilibration. Therefore, the elution position of the complex varied depending on flow rates, thereby making it difficult to determine the Mr of the complex by gel filtration. The renin.RBP complex is unlikely to occur in the normal kidney because renin and RBP are localized in the granule and cytosol fractions, respectively. RBP may provide security against accidental rupture of renin granules under abnormal circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W1499795242,The effects of binding inducer and anti-inducer of the Escherichia coli lac operon to the lac repressor were examined by taking advantage of fluorine-19 NMR. The fluorine nucleus was biosynthetically incorporated into the lac repressor with either 5-fluorotryptophan or 3-fluorotyrosine. It is suggested that these small effector molecules influence the operator-binding properties of the tetrameric lac repressor by altering the intersubunit relationships in the protein.
https://openalex.org/W18981587,"Cleavage of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is catalyzed by an endopeptidase associated with a partially purified membrane preparation from bovine kidney cortex. This enzyme was found to have an acid pH optimum and to be easily extracted from the membranes by a single freeze-thaw cycle. The cleavage is remarkable in that it appears to be restricted to a small region of the PTH peptide chain, generating fragments which are not further degraded. The dominant products are a large fragment, COOH-terminal in origin, and a small fragment from the NH2 terminus. The small fragment is biologically active and its activity establishes that it contains at least the first 29 amino acids in PTH. The large fragment has no biological activity. The cleavage of PTH was demonstrated both with iodinated PTH and with unlabeled hormone by immunoassay and by labeling the large fragment after its production. Microsequencing of the large fragment showed that, in fact, two products are produced: one with its NH2 terminus at position 38 of PTH and one with its NH2 terminus at position 35. These fragments are remarkably similar to those generated in both the liver and the kidney in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1567381181,"Protein synthesis in isolated yeast mitochondria incubated in the presence of GTP is stimulated 2-fold by addition of dialyzed postpolysomal supernatant (S-150) at the start of the incubation. Incubation of the yeast S-150 with 5'-nucleotidase had no effect on the stimulatory activity suggesting that the increased protein synthesis does not result from guanine nucleotides. A partial purification of the protein factors which stimulate mitochondrial protein synthesis has been accomplished by chromatography on Sephacryl S-200. Stimulatory activity was eluted in two peaks, one in the 40,000 to 80,000 molecular weight range and a broad peak with a molecular weight of less than 10,000. Stimulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis by the low molecular weight activator fraction was proportional to the concentration of protein added and abolished by trypsin treatment suggesting that the low molecular weight activator is a protein(s). The rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis in the presence of activator, was linear for 40 min, while that in the presence of GTP was linear for only 20 min, suggesting that the activator and GTP stimulate protein synthesis by different mechanisms. Analysis of the products of the stimulated mitochondrial protein synthesis by gel electrophoresis revealed that the activator increased equally the labeling of all products. These results indicate that low molecular weight proteins present in the cytosol regulate mitochondrial protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1531260577,"The digestion of histones in chicken erythrocyte nucleosome cores and chromatin by Staphylococcus aureus protease was examined. This protease cleaves specifically at acidic residues and prefers Glu-X bonds under the conditions used. Only 1 of 24 glutamic acids and 2 of 13 aspartic acids among all four core histones are located in basic, NH2-terminal tails; hence, the protease is a highly specific probe of exposed nonbasic sequences. The protease readily degraded H1, H5, and H3, moderately degraded H2b, and only slightly degraded H2a and H4 in nucleosomes and nucleosome cores. Electrophoresis of core histone fragments from limited digests showed that most glutamic acids were inaccessible, but at least five sites in nonbasic sequences were readily cleaved. Tentative assignments of these fragments based on comparisons with products from limited digests of pure histones suggested that most accessible sites in nucleosome cores occur in H3. The most probable sites of H3 cutting are glutamic acids at positions 51, 60, 73, 94, and 97. At least one site in H2b, probably the equivalent of glutamic acid 105 in the calf H2b sequence, was accessible. No sites in H2a and H4 appeared highly accessible. H5 was readily cleaved at a site near the NH2 terminus. These data substantiate other evidence that nonbasic core histone sequences are located primarily in the nucleosome interior, but that H3 binds to the ends of core DNA and thereby is partly exposed on the upper and lower surfaces of the disk-shaped core."
https://openalex.org/W1528750906,"Antibodies specific for the modified nucleoside N6-(delta 2-isopentenyl) adenosine (i6A) were employed to identify the tRNAs containing i6A from an unfractionated tRNA mixture by a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. When radioactive aminoacyl-tRNAs were incubated with i6A-specific antibodies and filtered through nitrocellulose membrane filters, the tRNAs possessing i6A (tRNAtyr and tRNAser) remained on the filters. tRNAarg and tRNAlys which do not contain i6A showed no binding. This finding will be useful as a very simple and rapid assay of such RNAs under a variety of conditions. Purification of i6A containing tRNAs from an unfractionated tRNA mixture was achieved by affinity chromatography of the tRNAs on an i6A antibody-Sepharose column. Nonspecific binding of tRNAs to the column was avoided by the use of purified antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1603147853,"Cell-free systems from Corynebacterium poinsettiae and Micrococcus luteus incorporated labeled mevalonic acids into acyclic C40 and cyclic C50 carotenoids. When (3R,4R)-[2-14C,4-3H1]mevalonate was used as substrate, the 14C:3H ratios of C.p.450 and sarcinaxanthin showed that the hydrogen atoms at C-2 of both carotenoids, and that at C-6 of sarcinaxanthin, are derived from the 4-pro-R position of mevalonate. The 14C:3H ratios of C.p.450 and sarcinaxanthin synthesized from (2RS,3R)-[2-14C,2-3H2]mevalonate showed that both hydrogen atoms of C-4 are derived from those at C-2 of mevalonate. These results exclude epsilon- and beta-rings as precursors of the gamma-ring. They also exclude the interconversion of the epsilon- and beta-rings. Sarcinaxanthin samples synthesized from (3R,4R)-[2-14C,4-3H1]- and (2RS,3R)-[2-14C,2-3H2]mevalonate by a cell-free system from M. luteus were found to undergo isomerization in strong alkali. The major product of isomerization (85%) was decaprenoxanthin (epsilon-ring) with the beta-ring C.p.450 present in small amounts (3% yield). The 14C:3H ratios of these isomerization products were consistent with the loss of one C-4 hydrogen atom from each epsilon-ring of the former and one C-6 hydrogen atom from each beta-ring of the latter."
