https://openalex.org/W2109543073,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Efforts to control it are hampered by difficulties with diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Most people infected with M. tuberculosis remain asymptomatic, termed latent TB, with a 10% lifetime risk of developing active TB disease. Current tests, however, cannot identify which individuals will develop disease. The immune response to M. tuberculosis is complex and incompletely characterized, hindering development of new diagnostics, therapies and vaccines. Here we identify a whole-blood 393 transcript signature for active TB in intermediate and high-burden settings, correlating with radiological extent of disease and reverting to that of healthy controls after treatment. A subset of patients with latent TB had signatures similar to those in patients with active TB. We also identify a specific 86-transcript signature that discriminates active TB from other inflammatory and infectious diseases. Modular and pathway analysis revealed that the TB signature was dominated by a neutrophil-driven interferon (IFN)-inducible gene profile, consisting of both IFN-gamma and type I IFN-alphabeta signalling. Comparison with transcriptional signatures in purified cells and flow cytometric analysis suggest that this TB signature reflects changes in cellular composition and altered gene expression. Although an IFN-inducible signature was also observed in whole blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), their complete modular signature differed from TB, with increased abundance of plasma cell transcripts. Our studies demonstrate a hitherto underappreciated role of type I IFN-alphabeta signalling in the pathogenesis of TB, which has implications for vaccine and therapeutic development. Our study also provides a broad range of transcriptional biomarkers with potential as diagnostic and prognostic tools to combat the TB epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2073966685,"Although metabolic conditions associated with an increased AMP/ATP ratio are primary factors in the activation of 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a number of recent studies have shown that increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species can stimulate AMPK activity, even without a decrease in cellular levels of ATP. We found that exposure of recombinant AMPKαβγ complex or HEK 293 cells to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was associated with increased kinase activity and also resulted in oxidative modification of AMPK, including <i>S</i>-glutathionylation of the AMPKα and AMPKβ subunits. In experiments using C-terminal truncation mutants of AMPKα (amino acids 1–312), we found that mutation of cysteine 299 to alanine diminished the ability of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to induce kinase activation, and mutation of cysteine 304 to alanine totally abrogated the enhancing effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on kinase activity. Similar to the results obtained with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated HEK 293 cells, activation and <i>S</i>-glutathionylation of the AMPKα subunit were present in the lungs of acatalasemic mice or mice treated with the catalase inhibitor aminotriazole, conditions in which intracellular steady state levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are increased. These results demonstrate that physiologically relevant concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can activate AMPK through oxidative modification of the AMPKα subunit. The present findings also imply that AMPK activation, in addition to being a response to alterations in intracellular metabolic pathways, is directly influenced by cellular redox status."

https://openalex.org/W1998596396,"Binding of von Willebrand factor to the glycoprotein Ib α subunit on the surface of platelets mediates crosslinking of platelets and is an important factor in blood coagulation. Using a new method that links a receptor together with its ligand in a single molecule to measure the binding and unbinding processes, Kim et al. have identified a previously unrecognized type of bond behaviour. The receptor–ligand bond exists in two distinct states, one seen at low force and a second, more stable state that begins to engage when tensile force is applied, stabilizing it against the force. The discovery of this 'flex-bond' behaviour, involving switching between two populations of slip-bond (with bond lifetimes that decrease with increasing load) rather than catch-bonds (with lifetimes that increase with applied force) has implications for how platelets bound to von Willebrand factor are able to resist force, and for how increased flow activates platelet plug formation. Here, a new type of behaviour of receptor–ligand bonds has been identified, by using a new method that links receptor and ligand in a single molecule to measure binding and unbinding. The binding of von Willebrand factor to the glycoprotein Ib α subunit on the surface of platelets is important for coagulation. This receptor–ligand bond is now shown to have two distinct states, one seen at low force and a second that has greater force resistance. This has implications for how increased blood flow activates platelet plug formation. Haemostasis in the arteriolar circulation mediated by von Willebrand factor (VWF) binding to platelets is an example of an adhesive interaction that must withstand strong hydrodynamic forces acting on cells. VWF is a concatenated, multifunctional protein that has binding sites for platelets as well as subendothelial collagen1,2. Binding of the A1 domain in VWF to the glycoprotein Ib α subunit (GPIbα) on the surface of platelets mediates crosslinking of platelets to one another and the formation of a platelet plug for arterioles3,4. The importance of VWF is illustrated by its mutation in von Willebrand disease, a bleeding diathesis1. Here, we describe a novel mechanochemical specialization of the A1–GPIbα bond for force-resistance. We have developed a method that enables, for the first time, repeated measurements of the binding and unbinding of a receptor and ligand in a single molecule (ReaLiSM). We demonstrate two states of the receptor–ligand bond, that is, a flex-bond. One state is seen at low force; a second state begins to engage at 10 pN with a ∼20-fold longer lifetime and greater force resistance. The lifetimes of the two states, how force exponentiates lifetime, and the kinetics of switching between the two states are all measured. For the first time, single-molecule measurements on this system are in agreement with bulk phase measurements. The results have important implications not only for how platelets bound to VWF are able to resist force to plug arterioles, but also how increased flow activates platelet plug formation."
https://openalex.org/W1994029368,"Generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) requires massive epigenome reorganization. It is unclear whether reprogramming of female human cells reactivates the inactive X chromosome (Xi), as in mouse. Here we establish that human (h)iPSCs derived from several female fibroblasts under standard culture conditions carry an Xi. Despite the lack of reactivation, the Xi undergoes defined chromatin changes, and expansion of hiPSCs can lead to partial loss of XIST RNA. These results indicate that hiPSCs are epigenetically dynamic and do not display a pristine state of X inactivation with two active Xs as found in some female human embryonic stem cell lines. Furthermore, whereas fibroblasts are mosaic for the Xi, hiPSCs are clonal. This nonrandom pattern of X chromosome inactivation in female hiPSCs, which is maintained upon differentiation, has critical implications for clinical applications and disease modeling, and could be exploited for a unique form of gene therapy for X-linked diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2048521244,"Repulsive signaling by Semaphorins and Plexins is crucial for the development and homeostasis of the nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Sema7A acts as both an immune and a neural Semaphorin through PlexinC1, and A39R is a Sema7A mimic secreted by smallpox virus. We report the structures of Sema7A and A39R complexed with the Semaphorin-binding module of PlexinC1. Both structures show two PlexinC1 molecules symmetrically bridged by Semaphorin dimers, in which the Semaphorin and PlexinC1 beta propellers interact in an edge-on, orthogonal orientation. Both binding interfaces are dominated by the insertion of the Semaphorin's 4c-4d loop into a deep groove in blade 3 of the PlexinC1 propeller. A39R appears to achieve Sema7A mimicry by preserving key Plexin-binding determinants seen in the mammalian Sema7A complex that have evolved to achieve higher affinity binding to the host-derived PlexinC1. The complex structures support a conserved Semaphorin-Plexin recognition mode and suggest that Plexins are activated by dimerization."

Appropriate cell behavior in response to the changing wound environment is required for efficient wound closure. However, the way in which wound keratinocytes modify the wound environment to coordinate with such cellular responses remains less studied. We demonstrated that angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) produced by wound keratinocytes coordinates cell-matrix communication. ANGPTL4 interacts with vitronectin and fibronectin in the wound bed, delaying their proteolytic degradation by metalloproteinases. This interaction does not interfere with integrin-matrix protein recognition and directly affects cell-matrix communication by altering the availability of intact matrix proteins. These interactions stimulate integrin- focal adhesion kinase, 14-3-3, and PKC-mediated signaling pathways essential for effective wound healing. The deficiency of ANGPTL4 in mice delays wound re-epithelialization. Further analysis revealed that cell migration was impaired in the ANGPTL4-deficient keratinocytes. Altogether, the findings provide molecular insight into a novel control of wound healing via ANGPTL4-dependent regulation of cell-matrix communication. Given the known role of ANGPTL4 in glucose and lipid homeostasis, it is a prime therapeutic candidate for the treatment of diabetic wounds. It also underscores the importance of cell-matrix communication during angiogenesis and cancer metastasis.

https://openalex.org/W2123677157,"Background DEET, 2-undecanone (2-U), IR3535 and Picaridin are widely used as insect repellents to prevent interactions between humans and many arthropods including mosquitoes. Their molecular action has only recently been studied, yielding seemingly contradictory theories including odorant-dependent inhibitory and odorant-independent excitatory activities on insect olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and odorant receptor proteins (ORs). Methodology/Principal Findings Here we characterize the action of these repellents on two Aedes aegypti ORs, AaOR2 and AaOR8, individually co-expressed with the common co-receptor AaOR7 in Xenopus oocytes; these ORs are respectively activated by the odors indole (AaOR2) and (R)-(−)-1-octen3-ol (AaOR8), odorants used to locate oviposition sites and host animals. In the absence of odorants, DEET activates AaOR2 but not AaOR8, while 2-U activates AaOR8 but not AaOR2; IR3535 and Picaridin do not activate these ORs. In the presence of odors, DEET strongly inhibits AaOR8 but not AaOR2, while 2-U strongly inhibits AaOR2 but not AaOR8; IR3535 and Picaridin strongly inhibit both ORs. Conclusions/Significance These data demonstrate that repellents can act as olfactory agonists or antagonists, thus modulating OR activity, bringing concordance to conflicting models."
https://openalex.org/W1993802319,"Aseptic loosening of orthopaedic implants is induced by wear particles generated from the polymeric and metallic components of the implants. Substantial evidence suggests that activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) may contribute to the biological activity of the wear particles. Although pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) produced by Gram-positive bacteria are likely to be more common in patients with aseptic loosening, prior studies have focused on LPS, a TLR4-specific PAMP produced by Gram-negative bacteria. Here we show that both TLR2 and TLR4 contribute to the biological activity of titanium particles with adherent bacterial debris. In addition, lipoteichoic acid, a PAMP produced by Gram-positive bacteria that activates TLR2, can, like LPS, adhere to the particles and increase their biological activity, and the increased biological activity requires the presence of the cognate TLR. Moreover, three lines of evidence support the conclusion that TLR activation requires bacterially derived PAMPs and that endogenously produced alarmins are not sufficient. First, neither TLR2 nor TLR4 contribute to the activity of ""endotoxin-free"" particles as would be expected if alarmins are sufficient to activate the TLRs. Second, noncognate TLRs do not contribute to the activity of particles with adherent LPS or lipoteichoic acid as would be expected if alarmins are sufficient to activate the TLRs. Third, polymyxin B, which inactivates LPS, blocks the activity of particles with adherent LPS. These results support the hypothesis that PAMPs produced by low levels of bacterial colonization may contribute to aseptic loosening of orthopaedic implants."
https://openalex.org/W2009148873,"m-Calpain plays a critical role in cell migration enabling rear de-adhesion of adherent cells by cleaving structural components of the adhesion plaques. Growth factors and chemokines regulate keratinocyte, fibroblast, and endothelial cell migration by modulating m-calpain activity. Growth factor receptors activate m-calpain secondary to phosphorylation on serine 50 by ERK. Concurrently, activated m-calpain is localized to its inner membrane milieu by binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). Opposing this, CXCR3 ligands inhibit cell migration by blocking m-calpain activity secondary to a PKA-mediated phosphorylation in the C2-like domain. The failure of m-calpain activation in the absence of PIP(2) points to a key regulatory role, although whether this PIP(2)-mediated membrane localization is regulatory for m-calpain activity or merely serves as a docking site for ERK phosphorylation is uncertain. Herein, we report the effects of two CXCR3 ligands, CXCL11/IP-9/I-TAC and CXCL10/IP-10, on the EGF- and VEGF-induced redistribution of m-calpain in human fibroblasts and endothelial cells. The two chemokines block the tail retraction and, thus, the migration within minutes, preventing and reverting growth factor-induced relocalization of m-calpain to the plasma membrane of the cells. PKA phosphorylation of m-calpain blocks the binding of the protease to PIP(2). Unexpectedly, we found that this was due to membrane anchorage itself and not merely serine 50 phosphorylation, as the farnesylation-induced anchorage of m-calpain triggers a strong activation of this protease, leading notably to an increased cell death. Moreover, the ERK and PKA phosphorylations have no effect on this membrane-anchored m-calpain. However, the presence of PIP(2) is still required for the activation of the anchored m-calpain. In conclusion, we describe a novel mechanism of m-calpain activation by interaction with the plasma membrane and PIP(2) specifically, this phosphoinositide acting as a cofactor for the enzyme. The phosphorylation of m-calpain by ERK and PKA by growth factors and chemokines, respectively, act in cells to regulate the enzyme only indirectly by controlling its redistribution."
https://openalex.org/W2043579286,"Many bacterial pathogens present adhesins at the tips of long macromolecular filaments known as pili that are often important virulence determinants. Very little is known about how pili presented by Gram-positive pathogens mediate host cell binding. The crystal structure of a pilus adhesin from the important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes reveals an internal thioester bond formed between the side chains of a cysteine and a glutamine residue. The presence of the thioester was verified using UV-visible spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. This unusual bond has only previously been observed in thioester domains of complement and complement-like proteins where it is used to form covalent attachment to target molecules. The structure also reveals two intramolecular isopeptide bonds, one of these formed through a Lys/Asp residue pair, which are strategically positioned to confer protein stability. Removal of the internal thioester by allele-replacement mutagenesis in S. pyogenes severely compromises bacterial adhesion to model host cells. Although current paradigms of bacterial/host cell interaction envisage strong non-covalent interactions, the present study suggests cell adhesion could also involve covalent bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1555143316,"Propionyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (PCC), a mitochondrial biotin-dependent enzyme, is essential for the catabolism of the amino acids Thr, Val, Ile and Met, cholesterol and fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms. Deficiencies in PCC activity in humans are linked to the disease propionic acidaemia, an autosomal recessive disorder that can be fatal in infants. The holoenzyme of PCC is an alpha(6)beta(6) dodecamer, with a molecular mass of 750 kDa. The alpha-subunit contains the biotin carboxylase (BC) and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domains, whereas the beta-subunit supplies the carboxyltransferase (CT) activity. Here we report the crystal structure at 3.2-A resolution of a bacterial PCC alpha(6)beta(6) holoenzyme as well as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction at 15-A resolution demonstrating a similar structure for human PCC. The structure defines the overall architecture of PCC and reveals unexpectedly that the alpha-subunits are arranged as monomers in the holoenzyme, decorating a central beta(6) hexamer. A hitherto unrecognized domain in the alpha-subunit, formed by residues between the BC and BCCP domains, is crucial for interactions with the beta-subunit. We have named it the BT domain. The structure reveals for the first time the relative positions of the BC and CT active sites in the holoenzyme. They are separated by approximately 55 A, indicating that the entire BCCP domain must translocate during catalysis. The BCCP domain is located in the active site of the beta-subunit in the current structure, providing insight for its involvement in the CT reaction. The structural information establishes a molecular basis for understanding the large collection of disease-causing mutations in PCC and is relevant for the holoenzymes of other biotin-dependent carboxylases, including 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) and eukaryotic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)."

In these conditions, hemeproteins and heme are released, but whether heme affects the inflammatory response to microorganism molecules remains to be characterized. Here, we show that heme increased the lethality and cytokine secretion induced by LPS in vivo and enhanced the secretion of cytokines by macrophages stimulated with various agonists of innate immune receptors. Activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and MAPKs and the generation of reactive oxygen species were essential to the increase in cytokine production induced by heme plus LPS. This synergistic effect of heme and LPS was blocked by a selective inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and was abrogated in dendritic cells deficient in Syk. Moreover, inhibition of Syk and the downstream molecules PKC and PI3K reduced the reactive oxygen species generation by heme.

Our results highlight a mechanism by which heme amplifies the secretion of cytokines triggered by microbial molecule activation and indicates possible pathways for therapeutic intervention during hemolytic infectious diseases. IntroductionA general consequence of infectious diseases that cause hemolysis, internal hemorrhage, or extensive cell damage is the release of hemeproteins. Upon oxidation, hemeproteins release heme, a potentially harmful molecule (1Ferreira A. Balla J. Jeney V. Balla G. Soares M.P. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 1097-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Heme-binding plasma proteins, such as hemopexin or albumin, remove the intravascular free heme, subsequently degraded by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), generating equimolar amounts of biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and free iron (2Muller-Eberhard U.

HO-1-deficient mice (Hmox−/−) have high plasma concentrations of heme and show increased susceptibility to LPS-induced lethality, associated with inflammation and oxidative damage (4Poss K.D.

Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8561) Google Scholar). The activation of these receptors elicits selective intracellular signaling cascades that result in the production of cytokines, chemokines, lipid mediators, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. The synergistic effect of certain associations of PRR agonists on cytokine secretion by macrophages and DC promotes the inflammatory response and the activation of the adaptive immune system (18Trinchieri G. Sher A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). The increased secretion of cytokines is also achieved by combinations of microbial molecules with molecules from host origin such as cytokines, ATP, and ROS (19Nathan C. Nature. 2002; 420: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar, 20Powers K.A. Szászi K. Khadaroo R.G. Tawadros P.S. Marshall J.C. Kapus A. Rotstein O.D. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 8: 1951-1961Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This activation of the immune system is considered essential for pathogen killing but is also critically involved in tissue damage and sepsis (19Nathan C. Nature. 2002; 420: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated if heme would be able to affect the inflammatory response triggered by microbial molecules. Heme caused a remarkable increase in the production of cytokines induced by microbial molecules and the lethality induced by LPS. We demonstrate that the heme-LPS synergistic effect on cytokine secretion and the generation of ROS by heme were both dependent on Syk activation.DISCUSSIONIn malaria, hemorrhagic fevers, leptospirosis, and septic shock, high quantities of hemoproteins are released, probably affecting the inflammatory response triggered by microbial molecules. Here, we showed that heme synergized with microbial products increased lethality and cytokine production in vivo and in vitro. Hemolysis induced by phenylhydrazine or treatment with heme caused an increased lethality when combined with a sublethal dose of LPS. The effect of heme on cytokine secretion was not restricted to LPS, because heme also synergizes with agonists of TLR2, TLR3, TLR9, NOD1, and NOD2. The increased cytokine production correlated with an earlier and heightened activation of NF-κB and with phosphorylation of MAPKs on macrophages treated with heme and LPS. Moreover, inhibition of these pathways abrogated the increased secretion of TNF. Furthermore, we demonstrated that generation of oxidative stress by heme was essential for its potentiating effects upon LPS stimulation. The upstream mechanism of ROS generation by heme and heme-LPS synergism to increase cytokine production involved the activation of Syk, PI3K, and PKC. Together, these results revealed a critical and previously unrecognized role of heme in enhancing innate immune response by affecting the signaling of PRRs through Syk activation and subsequent change of the redox state of macrophages.A low dose of LPS alone resulted in insignificant cytokine secretion, whereas the same dose of LPS together with heme resulted in substantial production of cytokines, thus suggesting that this synergism may be particularly important under conditions of low agonist concentrations. Heme affected MyD88 and TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon β (TRIF) pathways induced by LPS upon activation of TLR4, increasing the secretion of TNF, IL-6, and IP-10. Heme also enhanced cytokine secretion induced by TLR2, TLR9, and TLR3 agonists. These results indicate that heme synergizes with those TLRs that use exclusively MyD88 (TLR2 and -9), with the TLR that activates TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon β only (TLR3), or with that able to induce both pathways simultaneously (TLR4). Moreover, heme increased cytokine secretion induced by NOD agonists. These receptors, in contrast to TLRs, are localized to the cytosol, instead of being associated to cell membranes, and use RICK/RIP2 as adaptor protein (30Carneiro L.A. Magalhaes J.G. Tattoli I.

Immunol. 2008; 20: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Together, these results establish that heme amplifies cytokine secretion by PRRs situated on distinct locations and using distinct signal transduction pathways.The combination of heme and LPS caused an enhanced IκBα degradation, NF-κB activation, and MAPKs phosphorylation. The activation of these pathways was essential to the effect of heme, because treatment with selective inhibitors abrogated the increase in cytokine secretion. The redox state severely affects the response of leukocytes to microbial molecules and cytokines. ROS affect the activation of NF-κB, a key component in TLR and NLR signaling pathways, and are required for cytokine production upon receptor activation (16Medzhitov R. Nature. 2007; 449: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar, 17Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O.

Exogenously added H2O2 causes the activation of NF-κB and increases the secretion of cytokines by macrophages stimulated with LPS, whereas antioxidants have an inhibitory effect (20Powers K.A.

The generation of ROS by heme was involved in the potentiating effect on LPS-induced cytokine secretion. NAC, DPI, and rotenone impaired this enhanced response, whereas inhibition of xanthine oxidase or NOS had no effect. These results suggest that ROS generated by NADPH and mitochondria are involved on heme-LPS synergism to produce cytokines.Recent studies demonstrated an intense cooperation of several PRRs and ITAM-associated receptors, demonstrating both positive and negative regulation (22Rogers N.C.

It has been suggested that activation of ITAM-associated receptors with high affinity ligands causes cross-inhibition of TLR receptors, whereas low affinity ligands potentiate the response (34Wang L.

The mechanism of the synergistic induction of cytokine production by TLRs and ITAM-associated receptors seems to be an enhanced activation of NF-κB and MAPKs (29Ivashkiv L.B. Nat.

We observed that heme caused the phosphorylation of Syk and that treatment with a selective inhibitor of Syk caused the abrogation of heme-LPS synergistic effects on macrophages and DC. Using Syk-deficient DC, we confirmed the critical role of Syk on heme-LPS synergistic effects. The inhibitors of Syk and downstream effectors, including PKC and PI3K, all affected the generation of ROS and the heme-LPS synergism on cytokine production by macrophages. These results resemble the ROS production induced by Dectin-1 and TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK1)-mediated signal in cooperation with TLR2, which enhances activation of NF-κB (26Gantner B.N.

However, we recently observed that PKC and PI3K are also involved on ROS generation induced by heme on neutrophils, thus also suggesting a receptor-mediated process (14Porto B.N. Alves L.S.

A recent report indicates that monosodium urate crystals activate Syk in DC by a mechanism independent of protein receptors in the plasma membrane and dependent on cholesterol in lipid rafts (35Ng G.

At present there is no evidence indicating that H2O2 uses a receptor to activate this pathway. The involvement of a putative specific ITAM-associated receptor activated by heme or, alternatively, Syk activation by heme in a membrane receptor-independent effect requires further investigation.In conclusion, our results show that heme is capable of potentiating cytokine production induced by different innate receptors irrespective of their subcellular localization. This phenomenon ascribes to heme a general role on modulation of innate responses to pathogens and/or NF-κB activation. The molecular mechanism behind this effect of heme is the activation of Syk and subsequent ROS generation. IntroductionA general consequence of infectious diseases that cause hemolysis, internal hemorrhage, or extensive cell damage is the release of hemeproteins. Upon oxidation, hemeproteins release heme, a potentially harmful molecule (1Ferreira A. Balla J. Jeney V. Balla G. Soares M.P. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 1097-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Heme-binding plasma proteins, such as hemopexin or albumin, remove the intravascular free heme, subsequently degraded by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), generating equimolar amounts of biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and free iron (2Muller-Eberhard U.

HO-1-deficient mice (Hmox−/−) have high plasma concentrations of heme and show increased susceptibility to LPS-induced lethality, associated with inflammation and oxidative damage (4Poss K.D.

Heme caused a remarkable increase in the production of cytokines induced by microbial molecules and the lethality induced by LPS. We demonstrate that the heme-LPS synergistic effect on cytokine secretion and the generation of ROS by heme were both dependent on Syk activation. DISCUSSIONIn malaria, hemorrhagic fevers, leptospirosis, and septic shock, high quantities of hemoproteins are released, probably affecting the inflammatory response triggered by microbial molecules. Here, we showed that heme synergized with microbial products increased lethality and cytokine production in vivo and in vitro. Hemolysis induced by phenylhydrazine or treatment with heme caused an increased lethality when combined with a sublethal dose of LPS. The effect of heme on cytokine secretion was not restricted to LPS, because heme also synergizes with agonists of TLR2, TLR3, TLR9, NOD1, and NOD2. The increased cytokine production correlated with an earlier and heightened activation of NF-κB and with phosphorylation of MAPKs on macrophages treated with heme and LPS. Moreover, inhibition of these pathways abrogated the increased secretion of TNF. Furthermore, we demonstrated that generation of oxidative stress by heme was essential for its potentiating effects upon LPS stimulation. The upstream mechanism of ROS generation by heme and heme-LPS synergism to increase cytokine production involved the activation of Syk, PI3K, and PKC. Together, these results revealed a critical and previously unrecognized role of heme in enhancing innate immune response by affecting the signaling of PRRs through Syk activation and subsequent change of the redox state of macrophages.A low dose of LPS alone resulted in insignificant cytokine secretion, whereas the same dose of LPS together with heme resulted in substantial production of cytokines, thus suggesting that this synergism may be particularly important under conditions of low agonist concentrations. Heme affected MyD88 and TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon β (TRIF) pathways induced by LPS upon activation of TLR4, increasing the secretion of TNF, IL-6, and IP-10. Heme also enhanced cytokine secretion induced by TLR2, TLR9, and TLR3 agonists. These results indicate that heme synergizes with those TLRs that use exclusively MyD88 (TLR2 and -9), with the TLR that activates TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon β only (TLR3), or with that able to induce both pathways simultaneously (TLR4). Moreover, heme increased cytokine secretion induced by NOD agonists. These receptors, in contrast to TLRs, are localized to the cytosol, instead of being associated to cell membranes, and use RICK/RIP2 as adaptor protein (30Carneiro L.A. Magalhaes J.G. Tattoli I.

Immunol. 2008; 20: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Together, these results establish that heme amplifies cytokine secretion by PRRs situated on distinct locations and using distinct signal transduction pathways.The combination of heme and LPS caused an enhanced IκBα degradation, NF-κB activation, and MAPKs phosphorylation. The activation of these pathways was essential to the effect of heme, because treatment with selective inhibitors abrogated the increase in cytokine secretion. The redox state severely affects the response of leukocytes to microbial molecules and cytokines. ROS affect the activation of NF-κB, a key component in TLR and NLR signaling pathways, and are required for cytokine production upon receptor activation (16Medzhitov R.

Immunity. 2008; 29: 807-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). H2O2 also activates NF-κB, a process dependent on Syk (36Takada Y. Mukhopadhyay A. Kundu G.C. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24233-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a possible involvement of this pathway on H2O2-induced synergism on cytokine production induced by LPS. At present there is no evidence indicating that H2O2 uses a receptor to activate this pathway. The involvement of a putative specific ITAM-associated receptor activated by heme or, alternatively, Syk activation by heme in a membrane receptor-independent effect requires further investigation.In conclusion, our results show that heme is capable of potentiating cytokine production induced by different innate receptors irrespective of their subcellular localization. This phenomenon ascribes to heme a general role on modulation of innate responses to pathogens and/or NF-κB activation. The molecular mechanism behind this effect of heme is the activation of Syk and subsequent ROS generation. In malaria, hemorrhagic fevers, leptospirosis, and septic shock, high quantities of hemoproteins are released, probably affecting the inflammatory response triggered by microbial molecules. Here, we showed that heme synergized with microbial products increased lethality and cytokine production in vivo and in vitro. Hemolysis induced by phenylhydrazine or treatment with heme caused an increased lethality when combined with a sublethal dose of LPS. The effect of heme on cytokine secretion was not restricted to LPS, because heme also synergizes with agonists of TLR2, TLR3, TLR9, NOD1, and NOD2. The increased cytokine production correlated with an earlier and heightened activation of NF-κB and with phosphorylation of MAPKs on macrophages treated with heme and LPS. Moreover, inhibition of these pathways abrogated the increased secretion of TNF. Furthermore, we demonstrated that generation of oxidative stress by heme was essential for its potentiating effects upon LPS stimulation. The upstream mechanism of ROS generation by heme and heme-LPS synergism to increase cytokine production involved the activation of Syk, PI3K, and PKC. Together, these results revealed a critical and previously unrecognized role of heme in enhancing innate immune response by affecting the signaling of PRRs through Syk activation and subsequent change of the redox state of macrophages. A low dose of LPS alone resulted in insignificant cytokine secretion, whereas the same dose of LPS together with heme resulted in substantial production of cytokines, thus suggesting that this synergism may be particularly important under conditions of low agonist concentrations. Heme affected MyD88 and TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon β (TRIF) pathways induced by LPS upon activation of TLR4, increasing the secretion of TNF, IL-6, and IP-10. Heme also enhanced cytokine secretion induced by TLR2, TLR9, and TLR3 agonists. These results indicate that heme synergizes with those TLRs that use exclusively MyD88 (TLR2 and -9), with the TLR that activates TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon β only (TLR3), or with that able to induce both pathways simultaneously (TLR4). Moreover, heme increased cytokine secretion induced by NOD agonists. These receptors, in contrast to TLRs, are localized to the cytosol, instead of being associated to cell membranes, and use RICK/RIP2 as adaptor protein (30Carneiro L.A. Magalhaes J.G. Tattoli I.

Immunol. 2008; 20: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Together, these results establish that heme amplifies cytokine secretion by PRRs situated on distinct locations and using distinct signal transduction pathways. The combination of heme and LPS caused an enhanced IκBα degradation, NF-κB activation, and MAPKs phosphorylation. The activation of these pathways was essential to the effect of heme, because treatment with selective inhibitors abrogated the increase in cytokine secretion. The redox state severely affects the response of leukocytes to microbial molecules and cytokines. ROS affect the activation of NF-κB, a key component in TLR and NLR signaling pathways, and are required for cytokine production upon receptor activation (16Medzhitov R. Nature. 2007; 449: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar, 17Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O.

Exogenously added H2O2 causes the activation of NF-κB and increases the secretion of cytokines by macrophages stimulated with LPS, whereas antioxidants have an inhibitory effect (20Powers K.A.

The generation of ROS by heme was involved in the potentiating effect on LPS-induced cytokine secretion. NAC, DPI, and rotenone impaired this enhanced response, whereas inhibition of xanthine oxidase or NOS had no effect. These results suggest that ROS generated by NADPH and mitochondria are involved on heme-LPS synergism to produce cytokines. Recent studies demonstrated an intense cooperation of several PRRs and ITAM-associated receptors, demonstrating both positive and negative regulation (22Rogers N.C. Slack E.C. Edwards A.D.

It has been suggested that activation of ITAM-associated receptors with high affinity ligands causes cross-inhibition of TLR receptors, whereas low affinity ligands potentiate the response (34Wang L.

The mechanism of the synergistic induction of cytokine production by TLRs and ITAM-associated receptors seems to be an enhanced activation of NF-κB and MAPKs (29Ivashkiv L.B. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We observed that heme caused the phosphorylation of Syk and that treatment with a selective inhibitor of Syk caused the abrogation of heme-LPS synergistic effects on macrophages and DC. Using Syk-deficient DC, we confirmed the critical role of Syk on heme-LPS synergistic effects. The inhibitors of Syk and downstream effectors, including PKC and PI3K, all affected the generation of ROS and the heme-LPS synergism on cytokine production by macrophages. These results resemble the ROS production induced by Dectin-1 and TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK1)-mediated signal in cooperation with TLR2, which enhances activation of NF-κB (26Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Canavera S.J. Akira S. Underhill D.M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). The mechanism of ROS generation by heme is considered to be at least partially dependent on the Fenton reaction (13Wagener F.A. Volk H.D. Willis D. Abraham N.G. Soares M.P. Adema G.J. Figdor C.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, we recently observed that PKC and PI3K are also involved on ROS generation induced by heme on neutrophils, thus also suggesting a receptor-mediated process (14Porto B.N. Alves L.S.

Penin F. Rice C.M. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The viral genome is a single-stranded RNA of positive polarity containing a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by two untranslated regions (UTRs), the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR. The single ORF is translated into a large (∼3000 residues) polyprotein that is processed into some 10 mature proteins. Thus, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NS5b is cleaved from the C terminus of the polyprotein. In vivo the 591-residue NS5b is the central player in the synthesis of new genomic RNAs, in association with other viral and cellular proteins. This viral replication complex is associated with membranes (2Gosert R. Egger D. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. Blum H.E. Bienz K. Moradpour D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) with the highly hydrophobic C-terminal 21 residues of NS5b forming a transmembrane helix (3Ivashkina N. Wölk B. Lohmann V.

In vitro, NS5b has been shown to be capable of template-directed RNA synthesis on its own, requiring only divalent metals (magnesium or manganese) as cofactors. Indeed, NS5b can catalyze both de novo synthesis from a single-stranded template (4Luo G. Hamatake R.K. Mathis D.M. Racela J. Rigat K.L. Lemm J. Colonno R.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and primer extension from the subsequent RNA duplex or from a preannealed template/primer duplex. The NS5b C-terminal transmembrane helix is dispensable for these activities, and C-terminal deletions of 21 residues (NS5b_Δ21) or more (NS5b_Δ47 to NS5b_Δ60) have been used in most activity and all crystallographic studies.

They have also brought a puzzle to light; the 40-residue stretch (termed “linker” throughout this manuscript) between the catalytic core (fingers, palm, and thumb, Fig. 1) and the C-terminal membrane anchor occludes the catalytic cleft (5Ago H.

In the present work we present a parallel structural and functional characterization of subtype 1a (H77 strain) and subtype 1b (J4 strain) NS5b enzymes with the aim of shedding new light on the puzzle of the linker involvement in the initiation of RNA synthesis. Our structural results include the first crystal structures of subtype 1a H77_NS5b_Δ21 alone and in complex with GTP and crystal structures of subtype 1b J4_NS5b_Δ21 in a new crystal form and of a mutant of the linker. A small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) characterization of J4_NS5b_Δ21 was also performed to assess the conformation of NS5b in solution. Functional analyses were done by in vitro RdRp assays of H77_NS5b_Δ21 and J4_NS5b_Δ21 (wild type and linker mutants). Taken together, these results clarify the early steps of RNA synthesis by HCV-NS5b; on the one hand, they point to the direct involvement of the linker in the very first steps of de novo initiation of RNA synthesis, leading to formation of the first dinucleotide primer. On the other hand, they show that GTP stimulates a later transition to processive elongation that is the true rate-limiting step in initiation. Site-directed mutagenesis of the serine 556 of H77 and J4 NS5b_Δ21 was performed by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with oligonucleotides described in Table 1.

Virology. 2003; 317: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and was purified according to the protocol therein with 0.5% n-octylglucoside instead of 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The wild type J4_NS5b_Δ21 used in structural studies was expressed and purified according to the protocol of O'Farrell et al. (15O'Farrell D. Trowbridge R. Rowlands D. Jäger J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), with minor modifications (i.e. 1% glucose was added to repress NS5b expression in all media, except the induction medium and carbenicillin was used as antibiotic instead of ampicillin). For all preparations used in structural work, the fractions containing the purified proteins were pooled, dialyzed against 5–10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 1–4 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by A280 with extinction coefficients calculated from the construct sequences. Monoclinic crystals (H77_X1) of H77_NS5b_Δ21 were initially obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Equal volumes of protein solution (3.5 mg/ml in HEPES 8 mm, pH 7.5, 1.5 m ammonium acetate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTT, also containing 55 μm concentrations of a short 5-base RNA and 0.5 mm GTP) and well solution (0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and PEG 5000 monomethyl ether) were mixed. To improve reproducibility and quality of the crystals, streak seeding and microseeding techniques were used. The final refined protocol uses the sitting drop vapor diffusion method and produces a triclinic crystal form (H77_X2). Equal volumes (2 μl each) of protein solution (3.5 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT) and well solution (50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.25 m ammonium acetate, 25–30% PEG 1000) were mixed and left to equilibrate overnight. Microseeding was then carried out with a dilute stock solution of crushed crystals, 0.2 μl of which was pipeted into each well. Crystals were transferred for a few seconds in a cryosolution containing 20% glycerol plus all the other components of the crystallization drop and flash-cooled in liquid ethane. In the case of soaks with substrates, these were added to a final concentration of 5–10 mm (nucleotides) and/or 0.1–1 mm (RNAs), MgCl2 was added to 10 mm, no ammonium sulfate was included, and soaking time was 20–40 min.

Open table in a new tab The orthorhombic crystal form (J4_O1) reported by O'Farrell et al. (15O'Farrell D. Trowbridge R. Rowlands D. Jäger J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) was reproduced by a different route and with significantly different cell parameters (our crystal form is hereafter called J4_O2). Our protocol is very reproducible and uses the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with microseeding; seeds were initially produced by crushing clusters of needles obtained by mixing equal 1-μl volumes of protein solution (6.3 mg/ml) and well solution (50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 15–22% PEG 4000). Equal volumes (1 μl each) of protein solution and well solution (0.2 m magnesium sulfate, 15–25% PEG 2000 monomethyl-ether) were then mixed and left to equilibrate overnight. Microseeding was finally carried out with a 100–10,000× dilution of freshly crushed needles, 0.2 μl of which was pipeted into each drop. A new, trigonal crystal form (J4_T) was obtained by lowering the salt concentration (initially 0.2 m ammonium acetate). Crystals were obtained by mixing 1 μl of protein solution (5 mg/ml) with 1 or 2 equal volumes of water and 1 or 2 equal volumes of reservoir solution (2–6% PEG 3350, 0.2 m NaF). The initial dilution promoted nucleation, and the subsequent drop shrinking allowed slow (∼1 week) growth of large (>0.3 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm3) trigonal crystals. Crystals were transferred for a few seconds in a cryosolution containing all the components of the crystallization drop plus 15% (J4_O2) or 30% (J4_T) glycerol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. In the case of soaks with substrates (J4_O2), magnesium sulfate was first substituted by 0.4 m ammonium acetate in 5 successive ∼2–5-fold dilutions of the drop. 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm GTP, and/or 1 mm CUGGC RNA were then included, and soaking time was 30–40 min. High resolution synchrotron data (Table 2) were collected at beamline PROXIMA1 of the SOLEIL Synchrotron (Saclay, France) or beamline ID14–1 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data were processed with the XDS package (16Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11232) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement was performed with program Molrep (17Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). Models were rebuilt with COOT (18Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17085) Google Scholar) and refined with phenix.refine (19Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W.

Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16439) Google Scholar). In the cases of H77_X1 and H77_X2, BK_NS5b_Δ21 was used as search model in molecular replacement (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1QUV), and the initial solution was first rebuilt automatically with arp_warp (20Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). In the cases of J4_O2 and J4_T, the previously published J4_NS5b_Δ21 (PDB code1NB4) was used as the search model in molecular replacement. Differences in main chain conformation between pairs of molecules were objectively assessed using program ESCET (21Schneider T.R. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We used significance values (ESCET “lolim” parameter) of 5.0 σ to identify broader conformational differences and 2.5 σ to take into account all significant conformational differences. Protein samples of J4_NS5b_Δ21 were freshly dialyzed against Tris 10 mm, pH 7.5, ammonium acetate 200 mm, EDTA 1 mm, DTT 4 mm less than 48 h before and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Vivaspin, membrane cutoff, 30 kDa) to 4.0 mg/ml immediately before SAXS experiments. Data were collected at beamline ID14–3 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). The beamline setup used was calibrated with a protein solution of known mass and concentration (bovine serum albumin at 4.5 mg/ml). Data were compared for radiation damage, but none was observed. Data were processed using standard procedures and extrapolated to infinite dilution by the program package PRIMUS (22Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). Program CRYSOL (23Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2766) Google Scholar) was used to compare this experimental SAXS pattern to those calculated from the x-ray crystal structure and from more open models of J4_NS5b_Δ21. The latter models were constructed by opening the thumb and displacing the linker enough to accommodate a template/primer RNA duplex (see the legend to Fig. 7) taken from a Foot and Mouth Disease Virus RdRp complex (24Ferrer-Orta C. Arias A. Perez-Luque R. Escarmís C. Domingo E. Verdaguer N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47212-47221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Three templates were used in these assays. The first two correspond to the 341 nt of the 3′ end of the minus strand RNA from HCV genotype 1 (G1-C) or 3 (G3-U). They were obtained by in vitro transcription as previously described (25Masante C. Mahias K. Lourenço S. Dumas E. Cahour A. Trimoulet P. Fleury H. Astier-Gin T. Ventura M. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The third template (G3–4U) was obtained by in vitro transcription of a DNA template obtained by PCR amplification from the 5′-UTR of the geno 3 clone 4 HCV with the G3–4U forward primer AAAACCCTCTTACGAGGGGACACTC and the 5′-341-T7-2 reverse primer (25Masante C. Mahias K. Lourenço S. Dumas E. Cahour A. Trimoulet P. Fleury H. Astier-Gin T. Ventura M. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). HCV RdRp and RNA were preincubated for 30 min at 25 °C in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 17 units of RNasin (Promega), 0.5 mm concentrations of the two initiating nucleotides (GTP and CTP for RNA G1-C; ATP and CTP for RNA G3-U) or of GTP alone or no NTP, 86 nm RNA template, and 200 nm purified NS5b. Heparin (Mr 4000–6000, 200 μg/ml), then [32P]UTP (3000 Ci·mmol −1, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the NTP needed for elongation (0.5 mm each) were successively added. The reaction was run at 25 °C for 0, 5, 10, 20, or 60 min and stopped by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The radioactivity incorporated into neo-synthesized RNA was then determined by scintillation counting. The assay was carried out in 20 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 units/μl RNasin, 1 μm RNA template, 1 μm NS5b. When the initiation phase alone was analyzed, 0.5 mm GTP or ATP and 10 μm CTP with 4 μCi of [α-32P] CTP (3000 Ci·mmol−1) were the only added nucleotides. At different time points, 4 μl were collected, the reaction was quenched by adding 1 μl of 100 mm SDS and diluted in 8 μl of 90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.025% SDS, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol loading buffer. After denaturation at 70 °C for 5 min, samples were loaded onto a 22% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate EDTA buffer containing 7 m urea. The migration was performed at 30 watts for 3 h, and the gel was submitted to electronic autoradiography using a Pharos apparatus and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The elongation phase was analyzed after a 2-h incubation in the same assay conditions except for the NTP used. GTP was added at different concentrations before or at the same time as 0.5 mm ATP, 3′-dUTP, and 10 or 100 μm CTP with 4 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci·mmol−1, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). When the elongation was stopped with 0.5 mm 3′-dGTP instead of 3′-dUTP, UTP (0.5 mm) was added in the elongation reaction mixture. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 100 mm SDS. Five microliters were diluted in 8 μl of formamide/dyes loading buffer, and the reaction products were analyzed on polyacrylamide gel as above. The molecular weight markers were synthesized as described in Dutartre et al. (26Dutartre H. Boretto J. Guillemot J.C. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6359-6368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or obtained from Dharmacon and 32P-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci·mmol−1, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase following the manufacturer instructions (Promega). To enhance RNA synthesis in gel-based assays with templates with a 3′-U (G3-U and G3–4U), DMSO (10%v/v) was added in the reaction mixtures using these templates as well as to those using G1-C in side-by-side comparisons (cf. the legends to FIGURE 4, FIGURE 6). Control experiments with G1-C indicated that the addition of DMSO increased 2–3-fold RNA synthesis without modifying the pattern of initiation and elongation products.FIGURE 4Effect of high GTP concentrations on the synthesis of initiation and elongation products. A, the nucleotide sequence of the 3′ end of template RNAs G1-C, G3-U, and G3-4U is shown. B, shown is the experimental scheme. C, RNA corresponding to the 341 nt from the 3′ end of the (-) strand RNA from H77 (G1-C) or genotype 3 clone 4 (G3-U) HCV were preincubated with J4 NS5b and 0, 50, 100, 200, and 500 μm GTP for 30 min at 25 °C. [α-32P]CTP and 3′-dUTP with and without ATP were then added, and incubation continued for 2 h in the presence of 10%(v/v) DMSO. The CTP concentration was 10 μm in synthesis with G3-U and 100 μm in synthesis with G1-C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 100 mm SDS. Five microliters were diluted in 8 μl of formamide/dyes loading buffer, and the reaction products were analyzed on 22% polyacrylamide gel. The arrowhead indicates the position of the AC dinucleotide. M is for pppGpC molecular weight marker. D, G3–4U RNA was preincubated with J4 NS5b in the same conditions as above. [α-32P]CTP with and without ATP was then added with 3′-dUTP or 3′-dGTP plus UTP, and incubation continued for 2 h in the presence of 10%(v/v) DMSO. The reaction was stopped as in C, and the synthesized RNAs were analyzed on a 20% polyacrylamide gel.

The construct we used in the structural studies is a Q65H point mutant of strain H77_NS5b_Δ21. The Q65H mutation was isolated from a chronically infected chimpanzee, where it became fixed in the dominant virus present in the blood of the infected animal. The H77_NS5bQ65H_Δ21 construct was previously found to be even more active than the wild type in in vitro assays (14Lou H. Choi Y.H. LaVoy J.E. Major M.E. Hagedorn C.H. Virology. 2003; 317: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We obtained two related crystal forms (X1 and X2) of H77_NS5bQ65H_Δ21 with, respectively, three and two molecules in the asymmetric units, yielding five high resolution views of the subtype 1a NS5b (Table 2). We subjected these five views to an objective conformational pairwise comparison with the program ESCET (21Schneider T.R. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Table 3 shows that we may ascribe the five molecules to two groups; X1_A, X1_B, and X2_A on the one hand and X1_C and X2_B on the other hand. The molecules are conformationally identical within each group but display small conformational differences between groups. These differences are ascribable to different crystal packing environments and are significant with a tolerance of 2.5 σ but not of 5 σ (Table 3, numbers in parentheses). In contrast, a structure of subtype 1b NS5b (strain J4, with nearly 90% sequence identity to H77_NS5b) is significantly different from all five views of H77_NS5b even with a tolerance of 5 σ (Table 3, last column). We may, therefore, break up the NS5b structure in subdomains according to the conformational differences between 1a and 1b enzymes (27Schneider T.R. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This analysis is pictured in Fig. 2. It shows that the main conformational difference lies in the shift of a block made of the structural elements taking part in the fingertips/thumb interaction, including helix A of the fingertips and helix S of the thumb. This difference leads to a maximum shift in this region in C-α position of 3.5 Å between J4_ and H77_NS5b (0.6 Å overall). In contrast, the part of the thumb (including the linker and β-flap) not directly involved in interactions with the fingertips is in the same rigid block as the palm and fingers.TABLE 3Pairwise conformational comparisons between the five H77_NS5b molecules in two crystal forms (X1 and X2) and the best-defined J4_NS5b molecule in crystal form O (J4*_O2_B; see the legend to Table 4)H77_X1_AH77_X1_BH77_X1_CH77_X2_AH77_X2_BJ4*_O2_B〈esd〉 (Å)0.080.120.100.080.080.08H77_X1_A97.9 (99.9)95.3 (99.9)98.2 (100.0)93.0 (99.7)72.4 (94.9)H77_X1_B95.5 (99.7)98.0 (99.9)93.2 (99.4)80.9 (97.4)H77_X1_C93.4 (99.8)99.4 (100.0)81.1 (97.6)H77_X2_A89.9 (99.2)70.5 (93.3)H77_X2_B77.7 (96.5)J4*_O2_B Open table in a new tab Noteworthy is the absence of ligands in the H77 X1 crystal form despite the presence in the crystallization drops of both a short RNA spanning the 3′-most 5 residues of the genotype 1 negative strand and GTP (see “Experimental Procedures”). Several sulfate ions were visible, however, one occupying the position of the triphosphate moiety of the “priming” nucleotide previously identified in our study of NS5b_1b_Δ55 in complex with nucleotides (28Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the absence of substrates in the H77_NS5b structure might be due to the presence of sulfate ions in the buffer, competing with the phosphate backbone of RNA and/or the triphosphate moieties of nucleotides. Therefore,"
https://openalex.org/W2007525493,"Metastasis involves the invasion of cancer cells across both the extracellular matrix and cellular barriers, and an evolving theme is that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may mediate invasive cellular behavior. Previously, we isolated and analyzed a subpopulation of PC-3 prostate cancer cells, TEM4-18, and found that these cells both invaded an endothelial barrier more efficiently and exhibited enhanced metastatic colonization in vivo. Transendothelial migration of these cells depended on expression of ZEB1, a known regulator of EMT. Surprisingly, these cells were much less invasive than parental PC-3 cells in assays that involve matrix barriers. Here, we report that TEM4-18 cells express significantly reduced levels of two subunits of laminin-332 (β3 and γ2) and that exogenous laminin-332, or co-culture with laminin-332-expressing cells, rescues the in vitro invasion phenotype in these cells. Stable knockdown of ZEB1 in prostate cancer cells up-regulated LAMC2 and ITGB4 mRNA and protein and resulted in a concomitant increase in Transwell migration. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we show that ZEB1 directly interacts with the promoters of LAMC2 and ITGB4. These results provide a novel molecular basis for reduced laminin-332 observed in clinical prostate cancer specimens and demonstrate a context-dependent role for EMT in invasive cellular behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1971747549,"DnaJ from Escherichia coli is a Type I Hsp40 that functions as a cochaperone of DnaK (Hsp70), stimulating its ATPase activity and delivering protein substrates. How DnaJ binds protein substrates is still poorly understood. Here we have studied the role of DnaJ G/F-rich domain in binding of several substrates with different conformational properties (folded, partially (un)folded and unfolded). Using partial proteolysis we find that RepE, a folded substrate, contacts a wide DnaJ area that involves part of the G/F-rich region and Zn-binding domain. Deletion of G/F-rich region hampers binding of native RepE and reduced the affinity for partially (un)folded substrates. However, binding of completely unfolded substrates is independent on the G/F-rich region. These data indicate that DnaJ distinguishes the substrate conformation and is able to adapt the use of the G/F-rich region to form stable substrate complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2037511210,"Keratins 8 and 18 (K8/18) are intermediate filament proteins expressed specifically in simple epithelial tissues. Dynamic equilibrium of these phosphoglycoproteins in the soluble and filament pool is an important determinant of their cellular functions, and it is known to be regulated by site-specific phosphorylation. However, little is known about the role of dynamic O-GlcNAcylation on this keratin pair. Here, by comparing immortalized (Chang) and transformed hepatocyte (HepG2) cell lines, we have demonstrated that O-GlcNAcylation of K8/18 exhibits a positive correlation with their solubility (Nonidet P-40 extractability). Heat stress, which increases K8/18 solubility, resulted in a simultaneous increase in O-GlcNAc on these proteins. Conversely, increasing O-GlcNAc levels were associated with a concurrent increase in their solubility. This was also associated with a notable decrease in total cellular levels of K8/18. Unaltered levels of transcripts and the reduced half-life of K8 and K18 indicated their decreased stability on increasing O-GlcNAcylation. On the contrary, the K18 glycosylation mutant (K18 S29A/S30A/S48A) was notably more stable than the wild type K18 in Chang cells. The K18-O-GlcNAc mutant accumulated as aggregates upon stable expression, which possibly altered endogenous filament architecture.

This feature of keratin expression has been utilized in the development of tissue-specific markers and distinguishes different epithelial cell types. For example, basal epidermal keratinocytes express K5/14, suprabasal keratinocytes in the upper layer of skin express K1/10, and wound healing epithelial cells express K6/16 (5Schweizer J.

Simple epithelial tissues like pancreas, liver, and intestinal lining express keratin pair K8/18 along with variable levels of K19, K20, and K7 (10Owens D.W. Lane E.B. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 748-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Keratins, like all other intermediate filament proteins, share a common structure consisting of a central coiled coil, α-helical conserved “rod” domain that is flanked by non-α-helical amino-terminal “head” and carboxyl-terminal “tail” domains (7Fuchs E.

The head and tail domains of keratins are relatively nonconserved and harbor sites for post-translational modifications like phosphorylation and glycosylation (13Heins S. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1994; 6: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Keratin pair 8/18 and its regulation by phosphorylation are the most widely studied. Several sites of serine phosphorylation have been identified in the head and tail domains of K8 (Ser-23/Ser-73/Ser-431) and K18 (Ser-33/Ser-52) (10Owens D.W. Lane E.B.

Biol. 2006; 174: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The hyperphosphorylation of K8/18 is known to correlate with progression of chronic liver disease in patients (27Toivola D.M. Ku N.O. Resurreccion E.Z. Nelson D.R. Wright T.L. Omary M.B. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that alterations in filament reorganization because of phosphorylation could affect their cellular functions. K8/18 glycosylation occurs as addition of a single O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) sugar moiety. Occurrence of O-GlcNAc was first described in 1984 in lymphocytes (28Torres C.R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, this unique type of glycosylation is described on serine and threonine residues of various classes of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins that include transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, metabolic enzymes, proteasome subunits, oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, and cytoskeletal proteins (29Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 30Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Sci. STKE. 2005. 2005; : re13Google Scholar, 31Zachara N.E. Hart G.W.

Like phosphorylation, O-GlcNAc is a dynamic modification with its addition and removal regulated by two enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase (32Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Due to its dynamic nature, O-GlcNAc is known to regulate numerous functions like protein phosphorylation, subcellular localization, protein-protein interactions, gene transcription, and degradation (31Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 599-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Three sites of O-GlcNAcylation have been mapped in the head domain of K18 at Ser-29, Ser-30, and Ser-48 (37Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11820-11827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The sites on O-GlcNAcylation on K8 are not yet identified; however, peptide mapping indicates the presence of multiple O-GlcNAc sites (38Chou C.F. Smith A.J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3901-3906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of O-GlcNAc on K8/18 has been identified to be 1.5–2 (38Chou C.F. Smith A.J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3901-3906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc on K8/18 cycles rapidly and is known to increase upon G2/M arrest (39Haltiwanger R.S. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8752-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Chou C.F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No reciprocal relationship has been demonstrated between K8/18 O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation under in vivo conditions. However, in vitro studies by peptide analysis indicate the reciprocal relationship of these two modifications at K18 Ser-48 and Ser-52 (41Tao G.Z. Kirby C. Whelan S.A. Rossi F. Bi X. MacLaren M. Gentalen E. O'Neill R.A. Hart G.W. Omary M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of mutant K18 with all three O-GlcNAcylation sites mutated (Ser-29, -30, and -48 to Ala) exhibited no obvious change in the filament architecture as seen by immunostaining (37Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11820-11827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate a positive correlation between O-GlcNAc levels on K8/18 and their solubility. Increased O-GlcNAcylation caused increased solubility accompanied by their simultaneous degradation by proteasomes. On the contrary, absence of O-GlcNAc in the K18 glycosylation mutant (S29A/S30A/S48A) imparted stability. Stable expression of the mutant caused altered filament architecture, its accumulation as aggregates, and progressive cell death. Chang (human hepatocyte) and HepG2 (human hepatoma) cell lines were obtained from National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Anti-human keratin 8 (clone M20), keratin 18 (clone CY-90), and anti-ubiquitin (clone 6C1) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies to phosphoserine/threonine (O-Phos) (clone 22a) and O-GlcNAc (clone RL-2) were obtained from BD Biosciences and Affinity BioReagents, respectively. Anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 was obtained from Molecular Probes, Invitrogen; Vectashield mounting medium was from Vector Laboratories, and anti-mouse HRP was from Sigma. Protein G-Sepharose, PVDF membrane, and the ECL kit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cultureware was obtained from Nunclon. Pfu polymerase and restriction enzymes were from Fermentas International Inc., Canada. GlcNAc was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were purchased locally and were of analytical grade. Chang (human hepatocyte cell line) and HepG2 (human hepatoma cell line) were routinely cultured and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.03% glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin G-sodium, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 10% FBS at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For heat stress, cells were grown at 42 °C for various time points. For different drug/inhibitor treatments, PUGNAc, GlcNAc, and MG-132 were added at concentrations of 100 μm, 20 mm, and 25 μm, respectively, for various time points. Cycloheximide was used to compare the half-life of K8/18 by growing cells in its presence at a concentration of 100 μm for different time points. In experiments involving two different drug treatments, cells were simultaneously treated with both the drugs for various time points. Total cell lysates were obtained by solubilizing Chang or HepG2 cells in cell lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris and 2% SDS, pH 6.8). Keratin-enriched cytoskeletal preparations were made according to procedures published previously (17Jaitovich A. Mehta S. Na N. Ciechanover A. Goldman R.D. Ridge K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25348-25355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 42Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In brief, harvested cells were treated for 15 min at 4 °C with PBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin) followed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 20 min). The supernatant was collected as the Nonidet P-40-soluble keratin fraction (soluble fraction). The resulting insoluble pellet was homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% Empigen and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 20 min). The supernatant was collected as Nonidet P-40-insoluble keratin fraction (filament fraction). Proteins (40 μg for total cell lysate, 80 μg for Nonidet P-40 soluble fraction, and 15 μg of filament fraction) were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with one of the following antibodies: anti-K8, anti-K18, anti-O-GlcNAc, or anti-phosphoserine/threonine monoclonal antibodies. Membranes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Tween for 30 min, then incubated with anti-mouse secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). After Western blotting, the membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, which served as a control for equal loading. For immunoprecipitation studies, soluble or filament fractions were incubated with anti-K18 antibody or anti-ubiquitin antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The immune complexes were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.4% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4). The immune complexes were solubilized in cell lysis buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed as described above. The amount of K8/18 in the immunoprecipitates of samples to be compared is normalized as close as possible so that the differences in the modifications can be easily evaluated. O-GlcNAcylated proteins from the soluble fraction were precipitated by WGA-Sepharose beads. Amounts of keratins in the soluble fraction of Chang and HepG2 cells were matched as close as possible by analyzing different amount of the same on SDS-PAGE. Equal volumes of these soluble fractions containing matched amounts of keratins were precleared with Sepharose beads for 1 h at room temperature. The precleared fractions were then incubated with WGA-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation (2000 rpm, 5 min). The supernatant was collected as unbound fraction. The WGA beads were washed three times with buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.4% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4. The WGA-bound proteins were eluted in equal volumes of cell lysis buffer and then prepared for immunoblotting as described above. Total RNA was isolated from Chang cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was assessed by spectrophotometry at 260 nm, and the quality was confirmed by resolving 2 μg of total RNA from each preparation on 1% agarose gel. The first strand cDNAs were synthesized by Protoscript First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs) using random primers. The primers used for PCR amplifications were as follows: K18 forward primer 5′-GACACCAATATCACACGACTGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGCTTGTAGGCCTTTTACTTCC-3′, which correspond to nucleotides 640–661 and 747–726, respectively, of K18 (GenBankTM accession number NM_199187); K8 forward primer 5′-CATAGACAAGGTACGGTTCCTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGTTGTCCATGTTGCTTCGAGC-3′, which correspond to nucleotides 418–439 and 518–497, respectively, of K8 (GenBankTM accession number NM_002273.3); 18 S rRNA forward primer 5′-GACCGCGGTTCTATTTTGTTGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTGCGCCGGTCCAAGAATTTCA-3′, which correspond to nucleotides 874–895 and 981–960, respectively, of 18 S rRNA (GenBankTM accession number NR_003286); YFP cDNA forward primer 5′-TGACCCTGAAGTTCATCTGCAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAGTCGTGCTGCTTCATGTGGT-3′, which correspond to nucleotides 128–149 and 251–230, respectively, of YFP (GenBankTM accession number GQ221700). The PCR was performed in a gradient thermocycler, DNAEngine (Bio-Rad). Four microliters of the first strand product was used as a template in each 25-μl PCR. The reaction parameters consisted of one cycle of 95 °C for 5 min, followed by cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 0.5 min each and a single 15 min cycle at 72 °C for extension. The reactions were performed for various (20, 25, and 30) cycles of PCR amplification. The RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel using 50- and 100-bp DNA ladders as a standard to determine the molecular size. Levels of 18 S rRNA served as control for equal loading. The K18-GM cDNA from the vector construct was amplified by PCR using high fidelity polymerase Pfu. The 5′ forward (5′-TTGAATTCATGAGCTTCACCACTCGCTCC-3′) and 3′ reverse (5′-TTTGGTACCCCATGCCTCAGAACTTTGGTGT-3′) primers incorporated an EcoRI site and KpnI site, respectively, so that they are in-frame with the YFP coding sequence of the mammalian expression vector EYFP N1 (Clontech). These primers were used to amplify the K18-GM cDNA. The PCR amplicon and the vector EYFP N1 were sequentially restriction-digested with EcoRI and KpnI. The digested amplicon was ligated into the linearized vector and transformed into a DH5α strain of competent Escherichia coli cells, and the positive clone was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. Transfection of Chang cells with YFP-tagged cDNAs of either K18-WT or K18-GM was performed using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (44Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 86.2-86.3Google Scholar). Stable cell line of Chang cells expressing YFP-K18 either WT or GM was selected using G418 antibiotic (USB Corp.) followed by sorting cells on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Chang cells stably or transiently expressing YFP-tagged K18-WT or GM were fixed in chilled methanol (−20 °C for 5 min). Antibody staining for indirect immunofluorescence was carried out as described elsewhere (45Flitney E.W. Goldman R.D. Methods Cell. Biol. 2004; 78: 297-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4, for 5 min followed by a 10-min incubation in PBS. The coverslips were overlaid with 5% BSA for 15 min, followed by incubation for 1 h with anti-K8 or -K18 antibody. The coverslips were subsequently incubated with PBS for 30 min with three changes. This was followed by incubation with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 for 1 h with subsequent incubation with PBS for 30 min with three changes. Following this, the nucleus was stained with DAPI for 1 min, and the coverslips were incubated for 15 min in PBS with three changes. All the incubations were at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using Vectashield mounting medium. Cells were examined in a Zeiss LSM510 META confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Images were obtained using a 63× PlanApochromat phase contrast objective (NA: 1.4) and processed using LSM510 imaging software, version 4.2. Densitometric quantitation of scanned images was done by ImageJ 1.43 (National Institutes of Health). Band intensities were normalized to respective loading controls. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 4. Comparisons were done by unpaired Student's t test, and one-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the data. p < 0.01 (**) and p < 0.001 (***) values were considered significant. Malignant transformation reportedly results in increased activity of the enzyme O-GlcNAcase leading to decreased O-GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins (46Slawson C. Pidala J. Potter R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1537: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This decrease in O-GlcNAcylation on cellular proteins is seen even in highly malignant HepG2 (hepatoma) cell line as compared with the immortalized Chang cells (hepatocyte) (supplemental Fig. 1D). These cell lines were compared to assess the effect of altered O-GlcNAcylation of K8/18 on their solubility/filament forming properties. Comparison of Western-blotted keratin immunoprecipitates from filament fractions (Nonidet P-40 insoluble) showed that keratins from HepG2 cells are indeed notably less glycosylated as compared with those from Chang cells (0.47-fold for both K8 and K18) (Fig. 1A). Decreased glycosylation was also accompanied by decreased phosphorylation on these proteins (0.41- and 0.39-fold for K8 and K18, respectively) (Fig. 1A). The extent of O-GlcNAcylation on soluble keratins was assessed by the extent of their binding to WGA (a lectin that exhibits specific affinity for GlcNAc)-Sepharose. Although the amount of K8/18 in the soluble fractions of Chang and HepG2 cells used for WGA affinity was closely matched (Fig. 1B), keratins from HepG2 cells exhibited decreased binding to WGA (0.61- and 0.65-fold for K8 and K18, respectively). This suggests that K8 and K18, even from the soluble fraction, are less O-GlcNAcylated in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1B). To see if the extent of O-GlcNAc on keratins has any effect on their solubility (extractability by Nonidet P-40), total, soluble, and insoluble filament fractions from the two cell lines were compared. Results showed that although HepG2 cells exhibit higher levels of K8 and K18 (2.28- and 1.54-fold for K8 and K18, respectively), very little remains in the soluble fraction (0.57- and 0.71-fold for K8 and K18, respectively), and most of it appears to be assembled as filaments (2.18- and 2.58-fold for K8 and K18, respectively). In contrast, higher amount of keratins in Chang cells remained in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1C). Thus, keratins in HepG2 cells exhibit decreased O-GlcNAcylation and also decreased solubility. The above observations indicate a positive correlation between K8/18 O-GlcNAcylation and their solubility properties. Phosphorylation, a known regulator of keratin solubility, exhibits a gradient between soluble and filament keratins (14Omary M.B. Ku N.O. Liao J. Price D. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 31: 105-140PubMed Google Scholar). If O-GlcNAc also has a role in such regulation, it would also exhibit such a gradient. Comparison of immunoprecipitated K8 and K18 showed that keratins in the soluble fraction are not only considerably more phosphorylated but are also more O-GlcNAcylated as compared with those in the filament fraction (Fig. 1D). This suggests that alterations in K8/18 O-GlcNAcylation possibly lead to simultaneous changes in their partitioning between soluble and filament fractions. If the above observations are correct, then altering keratin solubility should change their O-GlcNAcylation status. Heat stress is known to increase keratin solubility (47Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Omary M.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were subjected to heat stress to investigate if alteration in keratin 8/18 solubility would be accompanied by changes in their O-GlcNAc status. As expected, heat stress resulted in an increase in the amount of soluble K8 and K18 in these cells (1.59- and 1.33-fold, respectively) (Fig. 2A). This coincided with increased O-GlcNAcylation and also phosphorylation on K8/18 (2.14- and 1.75-fold for O-GlcNAcylation and 1.05- and 1.33-fold for phosphorylation, on K8 and K18, respectively) (Fig. 2B). The increase in O-GlcNAcylation on K8 and K18 during heat stress is more pronounced than changes in phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). To determine whether increased O-GlcNAcylation of K8/18 would lead to their increased solubility, HepG2 cells were incubated with GlcNAc. GlcNAc treatment of HepG2 cells caused incr"
https://openalex.org/W2024085207,"The precise mechanisms underlying the interaction between intestinal bacteria and the host epithelium lead to multiple consequences that remain poorly understood at the molecular level. Deciphering such events can provide valuable information as to the mode of action of commensal and probiotic microorganisms in the gastrointestinal environment. Potential roles of such microorganisms along the privileged target represented by the mucosal immune system include maturation prior, during and after weaning, and the reduction of inflammatory reactions in pathogenic conditions. Using human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cell grown as polarized monolayers, we found that association of a Lactobacillus or a Bifidobacterium with nonspecific secretory IgA (SIgA) enhanced probiotic adhesion by a factor of 3.4-fold or more. Bacteria alone or in complex with SIgA reinforced transepithelial electrical resistance, a phenomenon coupled with increased phosphorylation of tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1 and occludin. In contrast, association with SIgA resulted in both enhanced level of nuclear translocation of NF-κB and production of epithelial polymeric Ig receptor as compared with bacteria alone. Moreover, thymic stromal lymphopoietin production was increased upon exposure to bacteria and further enhanced with SIgA-based complexes, whereas the level of pro-inflammatory epithelial cell mediators remained unaffected. Interestingly, SIgA-mediated potentiation of the Caco-2 cell responsiveness to the two probiotics tested involved Fab-independent interaction with the bacteria. These findings add to the multiple functions of SIgA and underscore a novel role of the antibody in interaction with intestinal bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1996749688,"We showed that the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α by macrophages in response to Toxoplasma gondii glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) requires the expression of both Toll-like receptors TLR2 and TLR4, but not of their co-receptor CD14. Galectin-3 is a β-galactoside-binding protein with immune-regulatory effects, which associates with TLR2. We demonstrate here by using the surface plasmon resonance method that the GPIs of T. gondii bind to human galectin-3 with strong affinity and in a dose-dependent manner. The use of a synthetic glycan and of the lipid moiety cleaved from the GPIs shows that both parts are involved in the interaction with galectin-3. GPIs of T. gondii also bind to galectin-1 but with a lower affinity and only through the lipid moiety. At the cellular level, the production of TNF-α induced by T. gondii GPIs in macrophages depends on the expression of galectin-3 but not of galectin-1. This study is the first identification of a galectin-3 ligand of T. gondii origin, and galectin-3 might be a co-receptor presenting the GPIs to the TLRs on macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1995073326,"Mutations in fibrillin-1 or fibrillin-2, the major structural components of extracellular microfibrils, cause pleiotropic manifestations in Marfan syndrome and congenital contractural arachnodactyly, respectively. We recently found that fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 control bone formation by regulating osteoblast differentiation through the differential modulation of endogenous TGFβ and bone morphogenetic protein signals. Here, we describe in vivo and ex vivo experiments that implicate the fibrillins as negative regulators of bone resorption. Adult Fbn2(-/-) mice display a greater than normal osteolytic response to locally implanted lipopolysaccharide-coated titanium particles. Although isolated cultures of Fbn2(-/-) preosteoclasts exhibited normal differentiation and activity, these features were substantially augmented when mutant or wild-type preosteoclasts were co-cultured with Fbn2(-/-) but not wild-type osteoblasts. Greater osteoclastogenic potential of Fbn2(-/-) osteoblasts was largely accounted for by up-regulation of the Rankl gene secondary to heightened TGFβ activity. This conclusion was based on the findings that blockade of TGFβ signaling blunts Rankl up-regulation in Fbn2(-/-) osteoblasts and bones and that systemic TGFβ antagonism improves locally induced osteolysis in Fbn2(-/-) mice. Abnormally high Rankl expression secondary to elevated TGFβ activity was also noted in cultured osteoblasts from Fbn1(-/-) mice. Collectively our data demonstrated that extracellular microfibrils balance local catabolic and anabolic signals during bone remodeling in addition to implying distinct mechanisms of bone loss in Marfan syndrome and congenital contractural arachnodactyly."

However, expansion of Treg cells has proved challenging because of their anergic potential.

Recent work shows that β-catenin may play a central role in Treg cell stabilization. Ding et al. (9Ding Y. Shen S. Lino A.C. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Lafaille J.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have shown that ectopic expression of a mutated form of β-catenin that lacks the classic Ser-33/Ser-37/Thr-41/Ser-45 N-terminal amino acids and is therefore nondegradable was able to enhance Treg cell survival in vitro. β-Catenin is best known for its role in Wnt signaling, a pathway that governs patterning and cell fate determination during embryogenesis (10He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Woodgett J.R. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 11Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is regulated by the serine/threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β). Phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β targets β-catenin for ubiquitination and degradation, terminating the signal (11Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibiting GSK-3β activity with Li+ or other GSK-3β inhibitors or by expressing a dominant inhibitory mutant of GSK-3β leads to a significant increase in β-catenin levels (12Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When cellular levels of β-catenin rise, β-catenin interacts with transcription factors of the high mobility group box family, LEF-1 and T cell factor; enters the nucleus; and regulates induction of genes believed to be involved in the proliferative response (13Papkoff J. Aikawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is this downstream activation of cellular growth that has made β-catenin especially interesting to immunologists searching for immunosuppressive targets. Recently, manipulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has been shown to alter T cell expansion and their cytokine profile (14Ioannidis V. Beermann F. Clevers H. Held W. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 15Staal F.J. Weerkamp F. Baert M.R. van den Burg C.M. van Noort M. de Haas E.F. van Dongen J.J. J.

This association between β-catenin and T cell proliferation has prompted strong query into the action of β-catenin in Treg cells. By utilizing the GSK-3β inhibitor SB216763, we examined what role GSK-3β plays in Treg cell activity. We also suggest a possible mechanism by which SB216763 may act on increasing Treg cell suppressive function. Treg cells treated with SB216763 were found to maintain elevated levels of FoxP3 protein and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL as compared with the untreated controls. Given the possible overt relationship between SB216763 and prevention of apoptosis in Treg cells, we also examined what effects DEVD-CHO, a caspase-3 inhibitor, had on Treg cell function. Caspase-3 inhibitor, when used alone, resulted in an increase in Treg cell suppression activity. When used in combination with GSK-3β inhibitor, we observed no further augmentation in this suppressive effect, suggesting that the two inhibitors may be acting on the same or parallel pathways. Additionally, when SB216763 was given systemically in an islet allotransplant mouse model, islet allograft survival was observed. Nevertheless, SB216763 and drugs similar in function provide obvious laboratory and clinical advantages in defining the role of Treg cell activity in models for autoimmunity and transplantation. C57BL/6 (designated B6 for clarity) (H-2b), BALB/c (H-2d), and C3H (H-2k) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). All mice were kept in pathogen-free, filter top isolator cages. All animals were cared for according to methods prescribed by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Committee for Research Animal Care. Single cell suspensions were prepared from B6 and BALB/c mice using standard methods. After a brief erythrocyte lysis using Red Blood Cell Lysing Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), the cells were resuspended in degassed PBS with 0.5% BSA and 2 mm EDTA. Separation of CD4+CD25− and CD4+CD25+ cells was accomplished with magnetic labeling using a MACS CD4+CD25+ Treg Cell Isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). CD4+CD25− cells were negatively selected with the flow-through fraction, whereas the CD4+CD25+ cells were positively selected. The purity of CD4+CD25+ fractions was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis because anti-CD25-PE antibody was used for purification. The final purity of the cell population was 90–95% (data not shown). CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were co-cultured with CD4+CD25− T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Invitrogen) with 5 μm SB216763 (Sigma-Aldrich) or with 0.05% DMSO (vehicle control). CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were added in increasing ratios to CD4+CD25− T cells for dose-response measurements. Proliferation was measured in triplicates by the incorporation of tritiated thymidine over the last 18–20 h of the co-culture. All cells were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium. The DEVD-CHO CPP32/apopain inhibitor (Calbiochem) was used at 10 and 100 μm. Flow cytometry was accomplished using a BD FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and was performed on cells incubated with 0.5 μg of PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 (L3T4) antibody (BD Pharmingen) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed and permeabilized with 0.2% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich) and stained intracellularly with 0.5 μg of antibody for 30 min at room temperature with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse FoxP3 (FJK-16s) (eBioscience), anti-mouse GSK-3β (Tyr(P)-216) (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-mouse β-catenin (Ser(P)-33/Ser(P)-37/Thr(P)-41) (27C10) (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-mouse β-catenin (H-102) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-mouse Bcl-xL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. Column-purified CD4+CD25+ cells were plated at 400,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate and incubated in the absence or presence of 10 μm SB216763 (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were counted and lysed in a volume of 1× SDS loading buffer (Bio-Rad), proportionate to the number of cells, at 42 and 66 h. To evaluate Bcl-2 levels, proportionate samples were loaded on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Western blotting was performed as described previously (18Alessandrini A. Namura S. Moskowitz M.A. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 12866-12869Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) by using anti-Bcl-2 antibodies (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology). As a loading control, the immunoblot was stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology). In this in vivo model, B6 mice were used as recipients, and C3H mice were used as islet donors. Prior to islet transplantation, B6 mice were rendered diabetic by intraperitoneal injections of 200 mg/kg streptozotocin (Sigma-Aldrich). Diabetes was defined as blood glucose levels >200 mg/dl for at least 2 consecutive days. Islets from C3H mice were isolated by the standard technique of collagenase digestion and Ficoll purification. Following isolation, 500 fresh islets were transplanted under the kidney capsule of diabetic B6 mice treated with saline containing 1% DMSO in the control group or with daily intraperitoneal injections of SB216763 (100 μm) in the experimental group. Euglycemia was defined as a non-fasting blood glucose level <200 mg/dl. Rejection was diagnosed when animals became hyperglycemic again with blood glucose >200 mg/dl for at least 2 consecutive days. For Treg cell depletion studies, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 250 μg of PC61 anti-CD25 (BioXCell, Lebanon, NH) on days −8 and −3 prior to islet transplantation. On the day of transplant, peripheral blood was analyzed with GK1.5 anti-CD4 and 7D4 anti-CD25 (eBioscience) to demonstrate Treg cell depletion. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Where indicated, we determined the statistical significance between two groups by the log rank test (Mantel-Cox test). Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Activated GSK-3β is characterized by phosphorylation of Tyr-216. In Fig. 1, A and B, we analyzed by FACS isolated, column-purified, CD25-PE-labeled B6 splenic naïve CD4+CD25+ cells for the presence of phospho-Tyr-216 and showed that CD4+CD25+hi cells exhibited the greatest staining with phospho-Tyr-216 antibody (Fig. 1A, panels C, F, and I). GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin on serines 33/37 and threonine 41, resulting in the degradation of β-catenin. Using antibodies specific to phospho-β-catenin (Ser-33/37 and Thr-41), we show that CD4+CD25+hi cells also displayed the greatest phospho-β-catenin (Ser-33/37 and Thr-41) staining as revealed by FACS analysis (Fig. 1A, panel B). We obtained similar FACS analysis results with similarly purified CD4+CD25+ cells from B6 naïve lymph nodes (Fig. 1A, panel E) and from BALB/c naïve spleen (Fig. 1A, panel H). These results are important because they show that naïve CD4+CD25+hi cells, which also have the greatest FoxP3 levels, possess the highest GSK-3β activity as indicated by having the highest degree of phospho-β-catenin (Ser-33/37 and Thr-41) (60–70%) labeling when compared with CD4+CD25+med and CD4+CD25+lo cells. In addition, analysis of CD4+CD25−FoxP3− cells revealed a lower GSK-3β activity when compared with CD4+CD25+hi cells as ascertained by phospho-β-catenin (Ser-33/37 and Thr-41) labeling (Fig. 1B). To assess the effect of GSK-3β inhibition on the functional properties of Treg cells, we performed an in vitro suppression assay in the absence or presence of SB216763, a specific GSK-3β inhibitor (Fig. 2). We isolated CD4+CD25− effector T cells and CD4+CD25+ Treg cells using magnetic separation. CD4+CD25− effector T cells were incubated in the presence or absence of anti-CD3/CD28 microbeads with increasing amounts of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells with or without SB216763. Proliferation was assessed by [3H]thymidine uptake. Notably, CD4+CD25− T effector cells incubated with an equal number of anti-CD3/CD28 microbeads and in the absence of Treg cells showed a 25% increase in [3H]thymidine uptake with the addition of SB216763 when compared with vehicle-treated control. This is not unprecedented because Ohteki et al. (19Ohteki T. Parsons M. Zakarian A. Jones R.G. Nguyen L.T. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have demonstrated previously that inhibition of T cells with lithium, an inhibitor of GSK-3β, resulted in increased T cell proliferation. More importantly, there was a marked difference in suppression of CD4+CD25− T cells cultured with CD4+CD25+ Treg cells with and without SB216763. At a 1:1 ratio of CD4+CD25− T cells and CD4+CD25+ Treg cells, the suppression was 65% as measured by [3H]thymidine uptake. Although this was not unexpected, we observed an increase in suppression by CD4+CD25+ Treg cells in cultures supplemented with SB216763. Moreover, this enhanced suppression was titratable with increasing numbers of SB216763-treated CD4+CD25+ Treg cells, yielding better suppression than with control CD4+CD25+ Treg cells. Namely, 95% suppression was seen when CD4+CD25− T cells were combined in a 1:8 ratio with CD4+CD25+ Treg cells and SB216763, whereas CD4+CD25− T cells without the GSK-3β inhibitor yielded 78% inhibition. Ding et al. (9Ding Y. Shen S. Lino A.C. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Lafaille J.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have shown that the introduction of a stable mutant form of β-catenin leads to the increased survival of Treg cells. GSK-3β has been shown to phosphorylate β-catenin, targeting it for degradation via ubiquitination. Therefore, we analyzed what effect inhibition of GSK-3β by SB216763 would have on β-catenin levels in our experimental system. We co-cultured CD4+CD25− effector T cells and CD4+CD25+ Treg cells with anti-CD3/CD28 microbeads in the presence or absence of SB216763. Using FACS analysis, we assessed untreated and SB216763-treated cultures for β-catenin while gating on the CD4+CD25+hiFoxP3+ Treg cells (Fig. 3). In this experimental design, β-catenin was elevated in Treg cells during all time points. CD4+CD25− cells also showed increased β-catenin levels (data not shown), which would explain why they exhibited greater proliferation in the presence of SB216763 in the absence of Treg cells (Fig. 2). This is unsurprising given that β-catenin is implicated in cellular proliferation with its heightened presence due to GSK-3β inhibition. Interestingly, although there were increased β-catenin levels in treated cells, we also observed β-catenin protein stabilization in untreated CD4+CD25+hiFoxP3+ cells. This stabilization of β-catenin was observed in CD4+CD25+hiFoxP3+ cells only when they were co-cultured with CD4+CD25− cells (data not shown). We noticed that CD4+CD25+hiFoxP3+ cells, when grown in vitro, exhibited rapid loss of FoxP3 protein (data not shown). Given that inhibition of GSK-3β enhanced Treg cell activity, we wanted to assess whether SB216763 treatment influenced FoxP3 turnover. CD4+CD25− T cells and CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were isolated using magnetic separation and co-cultured in a 1:1 ratio with anti-CD3/CD28 microbeads with and without SB216763. The collective grouping of T effector and Treg cells was fixed and stained with anti-CD4-PE-Cy5 and -FoxP3-FITC at intervals of 0, 24, 48, and 72 h (Fig. 4). CD4+CD25− T cells alone incubated with anti-CD3/CD28 microbeads with and without SB216763 served as controls for this experiment. Using FACS analysis and gating on FoxP3+ cells, we found that CD4+CD25+ Treg cells co-cultured with CD4+CD25− T cells and treated with SB216763 maintained their FoxP3+ signature. FoxP3 expression in untreated CD4+CD25+ Treg cells was detected in 39.7% of cells at 24 h, in 51.6% at 48 h, and in 18.3% at 72 h. Contrastingly, SB216763-treated CD4+CD25+ Treg cells displayed a slower pace of loss of FoxP3 protein. These cells had a FoxP3 signal of 54.6% at 24 h, 32.5% at 48 h, and 31.2% at 72 h. This finding suggests that treatment with SB216763 slows FoxP3 cell turnover in Treg cells in vitro. When CD4+CD25− effector T cells that had proliferated in the presence of anti-CD3/CD28 microbeads were examined, they were found to display minimal to no FoxP3 expression (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that inhibition of GSK-3β results in increased cell survival by the stabilization of β-catenin (9Ding Y. Shen S. Lino A.C. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Lafaille J.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that SB216763 treatment results in increased Bcl-xL protein expression in Treg cells. Bcl-xL is an antiapoptotic protein that works to counteract cellular death through inhibitory binding of apoptotic mediators (9Ding Y. Shen S. Lino A.C. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Lafaille J.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we demonstrated heightened Bcl-xL protein levels in CD4+CD25+ Treg cells when they were co-cultured with CD4+CD25− T cells and with anti-CD3/CD28 microbeads. FACS analysis on gated CD4+CD25+hi cells demonstrated that untreated cells exhibited a 19% increase in Bcl-xL signal, whereas SB216763-treated cells exhibited a 31% increase in Bcl-xL within 24 h (Fig. 5a). By 48 h, untreated cells returned to their original Bcl-xL levels, whereas treated cells maintained 13% higher levels of Bcl-xL protein even after 72 h. Western blot analysis of purified CD4+CD25− cells treated in vitro with SB216763 showed that Bcl-2 levels were maintained at least up to 66 h following GSK-3β inhibition versus untreated cells (Fig. 5b). The increase in Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 protein levels correlated with increased cell survival of CD4+CD25+ cells where SB216763-treated cells exhibited 20% more cells at 66 h versus controls (data not shown). Collectively, these findings suggest that the GSK-3β inhibitor SB216763 may work through Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 to protect CD4+CD25+ Treg cells from apoptosis in vitro. GSK-3β has been shown to play a role in apoptosis in part by destabilizing Bcl-2 (20Letai A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 728-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Maurer U. Charvet C. Wagman A.S. Dejardin E. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Because we observed a stabilization of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 following GSK-3β inhibition, we next examined whether SB216763 inhibition acted concordantly with inhibition of apoptosis. To explore this, we made use of a caspase-3 inhibitor, DEVD-CHO. In Fig. 5c, we show that addition of 100 μm DEVD-CHO resulted in a 30% increase in suppressive activity at a 1:1 ratio of CD4+CD25− T cells to CD4+CD25+ Treg cells in the presence of anti-CD3/CD28 microbeads. There was no additive effect when cells were co-treated with SB216763 and DEVD-CHO. These results suggest that DEVD-CHO and SB216763 may act through similar and/or parallel pathways to lessen Treg cell apoptosis and enhance suppressive activity. In an attempt to extrapolate our in vitro work to an in vivo system, we used an allograft islet transplantation system to assess any potential effects on islet allograft survival in the presence of GSK-3β inhibition. Systemic inhibition of GSK-3β has been used in animal models ranging from inflammation to Alzheimer disease to type II diabetes (22Cline G.W. Johnson K. Regittnig W. Perret P. Tozzo E. Xiao L.

Diabetes. 2003; 52: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), but the effect of inhibiting GSK-3β in animal models for organ transplantation has not yet been reported. In an islet transplant model where C3H islets were transplanted into B6 mice, we showed that there was at least a modest prolongation of allograft islet survival in mice that were treated daily with 100 μm SB216763 beginning 1 day post-transplantation (Fig. 6A). We next depleted Treg cells using anti-CD25 antibody (PC61) and assessed whether the SB216763 effect was negated. The two-dose PC61 treatment of mice prior to transplantation resulted in an 87–90% depletion of CD4+FoxP3+ cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes as determined by FACS analysis (data not shown). In Fig. 6B, we show that prolongation of allograft islet survival was not seen if Treg cells were depleted. A recent study has shown that introduction of a stable form of β-catenin results in increased Treg cell survivability. This paralleled the need for fewer modified Treg cells in the alleviation of inflammatory bowel disease in a mouse model (9Ding Y. Shen S. Lino A.C. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Lafaille J.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed which upstream components of β-catenin regulation may play a role in Treg cell function. We focused on the serine/threonine kinase GSK-3β, which phosphorylates β-catenin, marking it for ubiquitination, resulting in its degradation. Our results show that the inhibition of GSK-3β potentiates Treg cell suppressive activity and that it does so by increasing Treg cell survivability, consistent with observations by Ding et al. (9Ding Y. Shen S. Lino A.C. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Lafaille J.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To address the issue of the role of GSK-3β in Treg cell function, we isolated CD4+CD25+ cells and by FACS analysis showed that the highest portion of activated GSK-3β, as characterized by phosphorylation of tyrosine 216, was observed in CD4+CD25+hi cells. These cells also exhibited the greatest level of phospho-β-catenin (Ser-33/37 and Thr-41), indicative of greater GSK-3β activity. Inhibition of GSK-3β using SB216763, a specific GSK-3β inhibitor, resulted in increased Treg cell activity as exhibited by at least 20% greater suppression in cells treated with SB216763. This enhanced suppression was not a result of direct inhibition of CD4+CD25− cell proliferation by SB216763 because treatment of CD4+CD25− cells alone with inhibitor resulted in increased cellular proliferation. This is consistent with previous observations by Ohteki et al. (19Ohteki T. Parsons M. Zakarian A. Jones R.G. Nguyen L.T. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that inhibition of T cells with lithium, an inhibitor of GSK-3β, resulted in increased T cell proliferation and IL-2 production. But this is in contrast with what was observed by Ding et al. (9Ding Y. Shen S. Lino A.C. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Lafaille J.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) who found that ectopic expression of stable β-catenin in CD4+CD25− effector T cells results in anergy. This could be simply due to the fact that mutant β-catenin in CD4+CD25− cells is competing with the endogenous wild type form by competing for binding to transcriptional factors and/or regulatory molecules, such as GSK-3β complex, resulting in the alteration in proliferation of T effector cells. Using the Miltenyi Biotec kit for the isolation of CD4+CD25+ cells gives the added advantage that the cells are prestained with anti-CD25-PE antibody, and therefore phenotypic changes can be assessed in mixed cultures with unlabeled CD4+CD25− cells by following the labeled cells. Analysis of β-catenin protein showed that there was an increase in total β-catenin protein in CD4+CD25+hiFoxP3+ cells treated with GSK-3β inhibitor versus untreated cells. But although there was an increased level of β-catenin protein in treated cells, β-catenin protein stabilization also occurred in untreated CD4+CD25+hiFoxP3+ cells. This was only observed in CD4+CD25+hiFoxP3+ cells co-cultured with CD4+CD25− cells. This could be attributable to the fact that β-catenin stabilization may be a molecular event that occurs in Treg cells during the process of suppression and that what Ding et al. (9Ding Y. Shen S. Lino A.C. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Lafaille J.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and our laboratory have shown is an enhancement of this process either through the introduction of non-hydrolyzable β-catenin or through the inhibition of GSK-3β, respectively. It is possible that co-staining for FoxP3 and β-catenin could serve as identifying markers for assessing activated Treg cells in vivo. We also looked at the status of FoxP3 expression in cells treated with or without SB216763 and found that treated CD4+CD25+hiFoxP3+ cells exhibited prolonged FoxP3 expression as compared with untreated cells. A possible explanation for this is that active GSK-3β has been shown to phosphorylate the transcriptional factor NFAT, resulting in its exit from the nucleus, negatively regulating its NFAT activity (28Neal J.W. Clipstone N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3666-3673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). NFAT is important in the transcriptional activation of FoxP3 expression (29Tone Y. Furuuchi K. Kojima Y. Tykocinski M.L. Greene M.I. Tone M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of GSK-3β may result in the stabilization of NFAT activity, resulting in increased FoxP3 expression. In addition, it is well documented that TGF-β treatment results in increased FoxP3 expression (5Chen W. Jin W. Hardegen N. Lei K.J. Li L. Marinos N. McGrady G. Wahl S.M. J. Exp.

Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Lafaille J.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have shown that messenger RNA levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL are increased in Treg cells that ectopically express stable β-catenin as assessed by RT-PCR. Using FACS analysis and gating on FoxP3+ cells, we found that Bcl-xL protein levels were increased in SB216763-treated CD4+CD25+hiFoxP3+ cells versus untreated cells. This is in agreement with Ding et al. (9Ding Y. Shen S. Lino A.C. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Lafaille J.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and suggests that increased Treg cell suppressive function following GSK-3β inhibition may be due in part to increased Treg cell survival. To further validate that inhibition of apoptosis increases Treg cell function, we treated cells with the caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO and observed about a 30% increase in the suppressive activity of Treg cells. When cells were treated with DEVD-CHO together with SB216763, we observed no additive effect, suggesting that GSK-3β inhibition may affect pathways similar or parallel to those inhibited by DEVD-CHO. Because GSK-3β inhibition potentiates the suppressive activity of Treg cells in vitro, we have begun to study the effect of inhibition of GSK-3β in vivo using an islet transplant model where C3H islets are transplanted into B6 mice. Moreover, although we cannot draw definitive inferences on the effect of Treg cells in SB216763-treated animals, it is notable that euglycemia was prolonged in grafted animals in the treated group. Interestingly, although explanted islet grafts from both the control and experimental groups displayed lymphocytic infiltration suggestive of rejection (data not shown), the time to rejection was significantly different in animals treated with SB216763. Although we cannot exclude a myriad of variables involved, it is striking to note that islet grafts survived twice as long with GSK-3β inhibition than in the control. Depletion of Treg cells by PC61 resulted in the elimination of the SB216763 effect on prolonging allograft islet survival. Although the imprecise nature of these experiments cannot be understated, this disparity coupled with our in vitro work does raise the possibility that enhanced Treg cells, due to GSK-3β inhibition, contribute in promoting tolerance. Preliminary data suggest that naïve mice treated daily for 7 days with 100 μm SB216763 show a decrease in the number of FoxP3 positive cells in the spleen with an increase in the number of FoxP3-positive cells in the peripheral blood without a change in the overall number of FoxP3+ cells in treated versus untreated naïve mice (data not shown). In summary, we have shown that inhibition of GSK-3β resulted in increased suppression activity by Treg cells. Analysis of SB216763-treated Treg cells showed that there was a stabilization of β-catenin and that this in part may account for the increased functionality of Treg cells. This is consistent with the findings of Ding et al. (9Ding Y. Shen S. Lino A.C. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Lafaille J.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) when they ectopically expressed a non-hydrolyzable mutant form of β-catenin in Treg cells. We further show that GSK-3β inhibition was accompanied by increased stabilization of FoxP3 protein in Treg cells as well as an increase in Bcl-xL protein levels. There was no additive effect when cells were co-treated with SB216763 and DEVD-CHO, suggesting that the inhibitors are acting on similar and/or parallel pathways. When SB216763 was given systemically to recipients of transplanted islets, these allospecific cells exhibited prolonged survival. Knowledge of how GSK-3β affects FoxP3 stability and function and what role this plays in increasing Treg cell suppressive activity is timely, especially in light of the recent study by Zhou et al. (39Zhou X. Bailey-Bucktrout S.L. Jeker L.T. Penaranda C. Martínez-Llordella M. Ashby M. Nakayama M. Rosenthal W. Bluestone J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 1000-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar) showing that the loss of FoxP3 expression in Treg cells results in the generation of “exFoxP3” T cells that have a potent, pathogenic memory T cell phenotype. Therefore, understanding the important molecular mechanism(s) underlying this form of immune regulation could aid in the development of therapeutics for managing allotransplantation rejection and autoimmunity.

The signaling mechanisms triggered by the IL-17 receptor (IL-17RA) and related receptors are strikingly different from other cytokine subclasses.

We show that functionality of this domain requires a large extension to the previously identified SEFIR motif. In contrast to the SEFIR, this extension is not conserved among IL-17R family members. Surprisingly, Act1 recruitment is not sufficient for downstream signaling activation, whereas ubiquitination of TRAF6 correlates tightly with functional receptors. We further demonstrate that IL-17RA exhibits signaling properties that are nonredundant with other IL-17R family members. Finally, we report that IL-17 signals synergistically with lymphotoxin-α3, using the same signaling motifs within IL-17RA.

Although evidence in budding yeast indicates that Mps1 is targeted for degradation at anaphase by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC)-cCdc20 complex, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that govern Mps1 protein levels in human cells. Here, we provide evidence for the ubiquitin ligase/proteosome pathway in regulating human Mps1 levels during late mitosis through G1 phase. First, we showed that treatment of HEK 293T cells with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 resulted in an increase in both the polyubiquitination and the accumulation of Mps1 protein levels. Next, Mps1 was shown to co-precipitate with APC and its activators Cdc20 and Cdh1 in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Consistent with this, overexpression of Cdc20 or Cdh1 led to a marked reduction of endogenous Mps1 levels during anaphase or G1 phase, respectively. In contrast, depletion of Cdc20 or Cdh1 by RNAi treatment both led to the stabilization of Mps1 protein during mitosis or G1 phase, respectively. Finally, we identified a single D-box motif in human Mps1 that is required for its ubiquitination and degradation. Failure to appropriately degrade Mps1 is sufficient to trigger centrosome amplification and mitotic abnormalities in human cells.

Furthermore, the calculations predict that substituting the Pro110 residue with an Ala will change the conformation to a straight hydrophobic helix that would traverse the membrane. We have expressed the P110A mutant of caveolin-1, with a FLAG tag at the N terminus, in HEK 293 cells. We evaluate the topology of the proteins with confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in these cells. We find that FLAG tag at the N terminus of the wild type caveolin-1 is not reactive with antibodies unless the cell membrane is permeabilized with detergent. This indicates that in these cells, the hydrophobic segment of this protein is not transmembrane but takes up a bent conformation, making the protein monotopic. In contrast, the FLAG tag at the N terminus of the P110A mutant is equally exposed to antibodies, before and after membrane permeabilization. We also find that the P110A mutation causes a large reduction of endocytosis of caveolae, cellular lipid accumulation, and lipid droplet formulation.

Biol. 2009; 273: 117-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy allows the visualization of caveolae as 50–100-nm flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane or as circularized single or clustered vesicles underneath the plasma membrane. Caveolae are specialized membrane microdomains enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol, and receptor proteins. It is also the site of NO production and of cholesterol efflux from the cell. Several isoforms of caveolin are characteristic proteins of caveolae (15Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 16Williams T.M. Lisanti M.P. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 214Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Caveolin inserts into membranes of phosphatidylcholine in a cholesterol-dependent manner (17Li S. Song K.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 568-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and is anchored to the membrane with a hydrophobic segment comprising residues 105–125 as well as with three palmitoyl chains attached to Cys residues. Palmitoylated proteins are known to translocate into cholesterol-rich domains (18Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar), and this may contribute to the partitioning of caveolin to the cholesterol-rich domain of caveolae. However, a mutant form of caveolin with the three palmitoylation sites removed still translocates to caveolae (19Dietzen D.J. Hastings W.R. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6838-6842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thus, the protein itself must promote the interaction of caveolin-1 with cholesterol-rich domains. There is a CRAC domain adjacent to the hydrophobic segment of caveolin. CRAC domains have been suggested to be important in facilitating the translocation of peptides and proteins to cholesterol-rich domains (20Epand R.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 279-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 21Li H. Papadopoulos V. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4991-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and there is evidence that the CRAC domain of caveolin facilitates translocation of the protein into caveolae (22Epand R.M. Sayer B.G. Epand R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25595-25599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Another feature of the interaction of caveolin with membranes is that the hydrophobic segment is thought to form a U-shaped, re-entrant helix rather than a transmembrane helix (15Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 24Schlegel A. Schwab R.B. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The finding that the sequence of this hydrophobic segment of caveolin-1 is well conserved in evolution (22Epand R.M. Sayer B.G. Epand R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) suggests that it plays an important functional role. The protein caveolin-1 is the major isoform of the caveolin family and is expressed in most cell types. Caveolin-1 expression is related to caveolar formation. There are no caveolae in caveolin-1 null cells (26Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 293: 2449-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar), and expression of caveolin-1 in such cells results in the de novo formation of caveolae (27Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In the current study, we chose to use HEK 293 cells that express virtually no endogenous caveolin-1 and lack the most common putative fatty acid transport protein, FAT/CD36 (28Meshulam T. Simard J.R. Wharton J. Hamilton J.A. Pilch P.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2882-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 29Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2002; 5: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Expression of caveolin-1 in these cells caused lipid uptake (28Meshulam T. Simard J.R. Wharton J. Hamilton J.A. Pilch P.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2882-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, the uptake of BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide (LacCer) 4The abbreviations used are: LacCerlactosylceramideFLAGan epitope tag with the sequence DYKDDDDKOlAcoleic acidPFAparaformaldehydeEtOHethanolNGSnormal goat serum6 m1monosialotetrahexosylganglioside. and globoside are selectively internalized by a caveola-related process (30Puri V.

These labeled lipids as well as labeled albumin can be used as markers for the caveolar endocytic pathway (11Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J.

We have previously shown that the Pro residue in the hydrophobic segment of diacylglycerol kinase-ϵ is important in allowing this segment to form a bend in a membrane, resulting in a re-entrant helix (35Decaffmeyer M. Shulga Y.V. Dicu A.O. Thomas A. Truant R. Topham M.K. Brasseur R. Epand R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 383: 797-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that substitution of the Pro residue in the hydrophobic segment of this enzyme with Ala resulted in it converting to a transmembrane helix. Caveolin-1 also has a Pro residue in the hydrophobic segment at position 110. We determined if substitution of this residue in caveolin with Ala would allow it to become a transmembrane helix and what effect this would have on caveolar structure and function. To determine the membrane topology of caveolin-1 and its P110A mutant, we expressed an N-terminal FLAG tag-labeled form of these proteins in HEK 293 cells. If the hydrophobic segment formed a transmembrane helix, the FLAG epitope would be exposed to the cell exterior. However, if the hydrophobic segment formed a re-entrant helix, the protein would remain monotopic and be located on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. It is conceivable that the presence of the polar FLAG tag at the N terminus inhibits the formation of a re-entrant helix after passage of the protein through the translocon. However, this would seem unlikely, a priori, because of the separation of the membrane inserting segment from the N terminus and because of our finding that the same FLAG tag does not prevent the wild type caveolin-1 from forming a re-entrant helix. In addition, to know if substitution of Pro110 with Ala influenced the ability of caveolae to be endocytosed, wild type and mutant caveolin-1 were expressed in cells and analyzed for the uptake of BODIPY-LacCer and BODIPY-BSA. Another of the multiple functions of caveolae is to mediate the uptake of long-chain fatty acids, resulting in the formation of lipid droplets (36Simard J.R. Meshulam T. Pillai B.K. Kirber M.T.

Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1390-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We observed the formation of lipid droplets and their localization in cells transfected with either the wild type or the P110A mutant form of caveolin-1, to determine the importance of the topology of caveolin for this function. In addition, the effects of the mutation for caveolae formation were investigated with immunoelectron microscopy. Our studies with caveolin-1 were supplemented with in silico calculations that are in accord with several of the experimental findings and provide a thermodynamic basis for the experimental observations. Mouse caveolin-1 DNA fragment was amplified from pcDNA3.1 hygro vector constructed with the fragment of interest (we are grateful to Dr. Pilch's research group, Boston University (28Meshulam T. Simard J.R. Wharton J. Hamilton J.A. Pilch P.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2882-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) for generously providing this material) by PCR. The following primers were used: forward, 5′-CCAAGCTTATGTCTGGGGGCAAATA-3′; reverse, 5′-CGGGATCCTCATATCTCTTTCTGC-3′. The fragments of interest were subcloned into the corresponding site of a p3XFLAG-CMV-7.1 mammalian vector (Sigma-Aldrich), which attaches a FLAG epitope at the N terminus of the protein. The P110A mutant of the FLAG-tagged caveolin-1 was designed using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A mutated DNA plasmid was amplified from an N-terminal caveolin-1 by 18 cycles using Pfu DNA polymerase (Fermentas) and the following mutagenic primers: forward, 5′-ACGATCTTCGGCATCGCCATGGCACTCATCTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCAGATGAGTGCCATGGCGATGCCGAAGATCGT-3′. After digestion of the nonmutated parental DNA with DpnI restriction enzyme, the resulting PCR mix, containing the mutated DNA plasmid, was transformed into competent cells. DNA was purified from the bacterial culture using the QIAprep miniprep kit (Qiagen). The presence of the desired mutation was verified by sequencing analysis. HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The p3XFLAG constructs were transiently transfected into HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected in parallel with the p3XFLAGCMV-7.1 vector as a control. In confluent 6-well plates, HEK 293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged caveolin-1 or with the P110A were rinsed with PBS and scraped into ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (1×) (Sigma-Aldrich)). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% gel) and then transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). Blotting was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare), using mouse anti-FLAG antibody followed by anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immune complexes were detected using an ECL solution detection system (GE Healthcare). The presence of FLAG-tagged caveolin-1 and the P110A proteins were detected by Western blotting using mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-actin and anti-Gαi1 primary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and anti-transferrin receptor antibody was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. HEK 293 cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates. The cells were grown to 60–70% confluence in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were then transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent from Invitrogen. The medium was replaced after 5 h, and the cells were left in the incubator for 24 h. The next day, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS, pH 7.4, and after several washes the cells were incubated with 5% BSA in PBS for 1.5 h, or they were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed three times, and then incubated with 5% BSA in PBS for 1.5 h. The cells were then rinsed with PBS and incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS (1:200) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After rinsing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) in PBS (1:500) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing five times with PBS, the glass coverslips were mounted onto the glass slides and left to dry at room temperature in the dark overnight. The coverslip was then sealed onto the slide with nail polish and left to dry. The slides were visualized using the spinning disk confocal microscope (Leica DMI 6000 B). BODIPY-LacCer was from Invitrogen. To prepare for the caveolar invagination assay, BODIPY-LacCer was complexed (1:1, mol/mol) with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (defatted BSA) (31Marks D.L.

Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) as follows; BODIPY-LacCer 25 μg was dissolved in 500 μl of chloroform/ethanol (19:1, v/v) and put into a 5-ml glass tube. It was dried under nitrogen and then under vacuum for 1 h. Dried BODIPY-LacCer was dissolved in 200 μl of absolute ethanol. An ethanolic solution of BODIPY-LacCer was added dropwise to 300 μl of defatted BSA/PBS solution. The mixture was then dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4 °C with four changes of PBS to remove the ethanol. After dialysis, the mixture was centrifuged once or twice in an ultracentrifuge for 20 min at 100,000 × g, 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. The concentration of the BODIPY-LacCer·BSA complex was determined by measurements of fluorescence intensity, relative to known standards of BODIPY-C5-sphingomyelin (Invitrogen) using a spectrofluorimeter (AMINCO/Bowman, Series 2). Bovine serum albumin conjugated with BODIPY (33Sharma D.K. Choudhury A. Singh R.D. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol.

BODIPY 493/503 stock solution (1 mg/ml) was prepared by dissolving 5 mg of BODIPY 493/503 (Molecular Probes) in a 5-ml ethanol aliquot and stored at −20 °C. The defatted BSA/oleic acid (OlAc) medium was prepared as indicated (40Listenberger L.L. Brown D.A. Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2007; 24 (Unit 24.2)PubMed Google Scholar). Either caveolin-1 or the P110A mutant was expressed into HEK 293 cells. BODIPY-LacCer was complexed to defatted BSA as described above. Cells were typically incubated for 30 min at 10 °C with either 2 μm BODIPY-LacCer·BSA or 50 μg of BODIPY-BSA, washed twice with HMEM+G buffer (13.8 mm Hepes acid, 137.0 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 2.0 mm glutamine, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.18 mm Na2HPO4, minimum essential medium vitamins (Invitrogen), minimum essential medium amino acids (Invitrogen), pH 7.4) (31Marks D.L. Singh R.D. Choudhury A. Wheatley C.L. Pagano R.E. Methods. 2005; 36: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Singh R.D. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2007; 24 (Unit 24.1)PubMed Google Scholar), and further incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Fluorescent markers (BODIPY-LacCer·BSA or BODIPY-BSA) present at the plasma membrane were then removed by back-exchange using 5% defatted BSA in HMEM without glucose (HMEM−G buffer) (four times for 10 min each at 10 °C) (39Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In some experiments, HEK 293 cells were pretreated with 80 μm genistein, an inhibitor of caveola-mediated endocytosis, prior to incubation with fluorescent markers (2 h at 37 °C) and during the above mentioned steps. Cell viability in the presence of 80 μm genistein was analyzed using a cell proliferation assay kit (Millipore) and was found to be higher than 90%. After removing the excess of fluorescent markers, the cells were then fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, quenched with 25 mm glycine in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min at room temperature, and further incubated in blocking buffer (10% fetal bovine serum in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. The specimens were then incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C with mouse anti-FLAG antibody, washed three times in PBS, incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 for 1 h at room temperature, washed five times in PBS, and mounted in Prolong (Molecular Probes). Using a spinning disk confocal microscope (Leica DMI 6000 B), BODIPY-labeled samples were excited at 450–490 nm and viewed as green fluorescence (λem ∼540 nm). Alexa Fluor 647-labeled proteins were excited at 650 nm and viewed as red (λem ∼692 nm). For double-labeled experiments, control samples were labeled identically with the individual fluorophores and measured identically to the dual labeled samples at each wavelength to verify that there was no cross-over between emission channels. HEK 293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with FLAG-tagged caveolin-1 or with the P110A mutant. Cells supplemented with OlAc for the indicated time (36Simard J.R. Meshulam T.

Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 914-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were washed with PBS and fixed with 10% formalin in PBS for 15 min. This reagent was discarded, and then fresh formalin was added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h. After two washes in PBS, cells were incubated with 60% isopropyl alcohol for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were dried completely at room temperature, stained for 10 min in freshly diluted Oil Red O (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (6 parts Oil Red O stock solution and 4 parts H2O; Oil Red O stock solution is 0.5% Oil Red O in isopropyl alcohol). The cells were stained at room temperature for 20 min, followed by passage through a 0.2-μm filter. The stain was removed, and cells were washed with water four times. The plates were measured at A490 nm in a plate reader. Because the HEK 293 cells lack the most common putative fatty acid transporter, FAT/CD36, we verified that caveolin-dependent fatty acid uptake led to the accumulation of triglyceride. Triglyceride content was determined in cell lysates using a colorimetric Triglyceride assay as previously described (36Simard J.R. Meshulam T. Pillai B.K. Kirber M.T. Brunaldi K. Xu S. Pilch P.F. Hamilton J.A. J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 914-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Point Scientific Inc.). Cell lysates were prepared using 1% Igepal CA-630 in PBS, and results were normalized to 100 μg of total cellular protein. Cells were plated on 8-well chamber glass slides (Lab-Tek II, Nalge Nunc) and incubated overnight. Growth medium was changed to 400 μm defatted BSA/OlAc medium with serum and incubated for 24 h. Cells were transiently transfected in the same medium and incubated for 48 h. Transfected cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed by incubating with 3% PFA for 20 min at room temperature, and washed four times with PBS. The blocking buffer (0.2 m glycine, 0.1 mg/ml saponin, and 30 mg/ml BSA in PBS) was added for 45 min at room temperature to prevent nonspecific antibody binding. Cells were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody 1:200 in the antibody diluent (0.1 mg/ml saponin, 1 mg/ml BSA in PBS) for 1.5 h at 37 °C and washed four times (10 min each) with PBS on a gently rocking platform. The anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647 was diluted 1:150 in the antibody diluent containing the BODIPY 493/503 (final concentration 1 μg/ml), and the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed four times as above, and the coverslips were mounted onto slides with 20–40 μl of SlowFade mounting medium (Invitrogen) (40Listenberger L.L. Brown D.A. Curr. Protoc.

Four specimens, individually prepared, were observed with a multiphoton excitation microscope (Leica DMI 6000 B; scanner, Leica TCS SP5 with AOBS). Cells were plated on a 10-cm culture dish and transiently transfected. Cells were scraped in ice-cold PBS, 2 mm EDTA and pelleted by centrifugation at 2,506 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture, and subjected to mechanical disruption with 12 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (cytosol) was removed. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5). To this, an equal volume of the same buffer with 2% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added, and the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min. Insoluble fractions were pelleted in a microcentrifuge (14,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed (detergent soluble membrane fraction), and the insoluble pellet was resuspended in buffer B (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 60 mm β-octyl glucoside (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice.

The PCPs can process additional extracellular protein precursors and play fundamental roles in developmental processes and assembly of the ECM. The stimulatory activity of PCPE-1 is restricted to the processing of fibrillar procollagens, suggesting PCPE-1 is a specific regulator of collagen deposition. PCPE-1 consists of two CUB domains that bind to the procollagen C-propeptides and are required for PCP enhancing activity, and one NTR domain that binds heparin. To understand the biological role of the NTR domain, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assays, cell attachment assays as well as immunofluorescence and activity assays, all indicating that the NTR domain can mediate PCPE-1 binding to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). The SPR data revealed binding affinities to heparin/HSPGs in the high nanomolar range and dependence on calcium.

IntroductionFibrillar procollagen precursors contain N- and C-terminal propeptide extensions at both ends of their pro α chains. These propeptides must be removed for proper collagen fibril assembly to occur (1Ricard-Blum S. Ruggiero F. van der Rest M. Top. Curr. Chem. 2005; 247: 35-84Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar).

This functional versatility results from their ability to process a variety of matrix components in addition to fibrillar procollagens, including non-fibrillar procollagens, small leucine-rich proteoglycans, growth factors (e.g. growth differentiation factors 8 and 11), and associated regulatory proteins (chordin, latent TGF-β-binding protein) and lysyl oxidases, enzymes responsible for elastin and collagen cross-linking (reviews in Refs. 2Kessler E.

Enhancement of BMP-1 activity by PCPE-1 appears to be restricted to fibrillar procollagen precursors because PCPE-1 does not affect BMP-1 activity on other tolloid substrates (9Moali C. Font B.

Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).

However, no inhibitory activity was detected by other investigators against a range of metalloproteinases, including MMPs-1, -2, -3, and -9, BMP-1 and different ADAMTS proteinases (18Bekhouche M.

The short linker between the CUB domains of PCPE-1 provides a flexible tether linking two binding sites within the individual CUB domains that act cooperatively in the binding of PCPE-1 to the procollagen substrate (20Kronenberg D.

HSPGs carry out distinct biological functions, from maintenance of basement membrane homeostasis to modulation of growth factor activity and angiogenesis (24Iozzo R.V. Zoeller J.J. Nyström A. Mol. Cells. 2009; 27: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). They are abundant at cell surfaces and within the extracellular matrix and heparan sulfate (HS) is a complex and highly active biopolymer, which binds to a wide variety of growth factors, morphogens, chemokines, and extracellular matrix proteins (25Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 26Whitelock J.M. Iozzo R.V. Chem.

HSPGs act as co-receptors for several tyrosine kinase receptors and have been shown to be important in controlling the biological activities of the bound factor (26Whitelock J.M. Iozzo R.V. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2745-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In this study, using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assays, we characterized at the molecular level the binding of PCPE-1 to heparin and heparan sulfate, which is likely to be the physiological partner of PCPE-1. This included determination of the kinetics and affinity constants and demonstration of the role of divalent cations in this interaction. We have also investigated the role of this interaction in mediating cell adhesion to PCPE-1 and in anchoring PCPE-1 to the cell membrane, revealing that cell-bound PCPE-1 can augment procollagen processing by BMP-1 at the cell surface. The binding of PCPE-1 to heparan sulfate might play a major role in the assembly of the molecular machines comprised of bone morphogenetic protein-1, PCPE-1, and procollagens, which ensure the processing of procollagen molecules at the cell surface.DISCUSSIONIn the present report, we found that PCPE-1 binds to heparin/heparan sulfate with an affinity in the high nanomolar range (KD = 63.2 and 122 nm for heparin and heparan sulfate, respectively). This is lower than the affinity we have calculated for collagen I (KD = 3.4 and 3.5 nm for heparin and heparan sulfate, respectively) and for collagen V (KD = 5.62 and 2.0 nm for heparin and heparan sulfate, respectively (31Ricard-Blum S. Beraud M. Raynal N. Farndale R.W. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25195-25204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but much higher than the affinity of endostatin, a soluble fragment of collagen XVIII inhibiting angiogenesis (KD ∼ 2 μm for both glycosaminoglycans) (30Ricard-Blum S. Féraud O. Lortat-Jacob H. Rencurosi A. Fukai N. Dkhissi F. Vittet D. Imberty A. Olsen B.R. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2927-2936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or of the α5β1 integrin (1.14 μm and 2.04 μm for heparin and heparan sulfate, respectively (33Faye C. Moreau C. Chautard E. Jetne R. Fukai N. Ruggiero F. Humphries M.J. Olsen B.R. Ricard-Blum S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22029-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).The strength of PCPE-1 binding to heparin has been previously evaluated by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose. PCPE-1 eluted from the column between 0.4 and 0.5 m NaCl (17Moschcovich L. Bernocco S. Font B. Rivkin H. Eichenberger D. Chejanovsky N. Hulmes D.J. Kessler E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2991-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or between 0.3 and 0.4 m NaCl (8Steiglitz B.M. Keene D.R. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49820-49830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, heparin-Sepharose may act as a cation exchanger because of the highly negative charge of heparin. The amount of salt required for elution of a protein from the affinity column is a quantitative measure of the ionic component of the binding, but fails to measure the hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding contributions to binding (25Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar), whereas the SPR assays take into account all of the possible bonding mechanisms. Deviations between the relative ionic strength elution of proteins from heparin-Sepharose and direct affinity measurements have been observed (34Powell A.K. Yates E.A. Fernig D.G. Turnbull J.E. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 17R-30RCrossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), suggesting that differential ionic strength elution of proteins may not reflect their true relative affinities. The presence of two possible binding sites identified by fitting SPR kinetic data to the heterogeneous ligand model is in agreement with the fact that significant quantities of PCPE-1 eluted at NaCl concentrations lower than 0.3 m (8Steiglitz B.M. Keene D.R. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49820-49830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).The NTR domain does not contain any of the three linear consensus sequences proposed for heparin binding (BBXBX, BBXXBX, and XBBBXXBBBXXBBX, where B is a basic and X a hydropathic, neutral and hydrophobic, amino acid residue (25Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). The precise binding site of heparin/heparan sulfate inside the NTR domain remains to be mapped. The three-dimensional structure of the NTR domain has been elucidated by NMR (22Liepinsh E. Banyai L. Pintacuda G. Trexler M. Patthy L. Otting G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25982-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It includes a patch with uncharged residues in the center and positive charges at the rim, including Lys32, Arg36, Arg120, Arg134, Arg147 (numbering of amino acid positions is as used in the NTR construct studied by Liepinsh et al. (22Liepinsh E. Banyai L. Pintacuda G. Trexler M. Patthy L. Otting G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25982-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), in which position 30 corresponds to Cys318 in full-length PCPE-1). Electrostatic surface representation of the NTR domain shows that several basic amino acids of the NTR domain are clustered on one face of the molecule, forming two other basic clusters that may bind heparin/heparan sulfate. The first one comprises Arg35, Arg36, and Arg147 and the second one Lys105, Lys106, Lys56, Lys99, and Arg60. These basic clusters might also bind heparan sulfate.The binding of PCPE-1/NTR to heparin/heparan sulfate requires divalent cations, and most likely calcium, as reported previously for other extracellular proteins such as endostatin (30Ricard-Blum S. Féraud O. Lortat-Jacob H. Rencurosi A. Fukai N. Dkhissi F. Vittet D. Imberty A. Olsen B.R. van der Rest M. J. Biol.

Olsen B.R. Ricard-Blum S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22029-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and certain annexins (35Shao C. Zhang F. Kemp M.M. Linhardt R.J. Waisman D.M. Head J.F. Seaton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31689-31695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The role of calcium ions in the binding of the NTR domain of PCPE-1 to heparin is unclear. Based on its three-dimensional structure (22Liepinsh E. Banyai L. Pintacuda G. Trexler M. Patthy L. Otting G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25982-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), this protein domain does not contain calcium ions. It is possible however that, as was shown for annexin A2 (35Shao C. Zhang F. Kemp M.M. Linhardt R.J. Waisman D.M. Head J.F. Seaton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31689-31695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), some heparin binding sites may rely on calcium binding and not on arrays of basic residues. In this instance, main-chain and side chain nitrogen atoms and two calcium ions play an important role in the binding. Of special interest in this regard is the finding that a new calcium-binding site is formed in annexin A2 upon initial binding to heparin, in which two sugar residues within a small heparin derivative used as a model for heparin, provided oxygen ligands for this calcium ion. It is conceivable that a similar mechanism operates in the binding of the NTR domain to heparin, where initial binding to clusters of basic residues in the NTR domain may trigger the formation of a functionally important calcium binding site(s) for heparin.Our data on the interaction of PCPE-1 with cells, including inhibition by heparin, a NTR-specific monoclonal antibody and the NTR fragment itself, strongly suggest that the NTR domain of PCPE-1 mediates the binding of PCPE-1 to cell surface HSPGs. This binding was observed with both HEK-293 cells that do not express collagen type I but express HSPGs and 3T3 mouse fibroblasts that produce and process relatively large amounts of procollagen I and also express HSPGs. The binding patterns and patterns of inhibition of cell attachment to PCPE-1 by heparin seen with these cell types were however different (Fig. 2). Higher cell binding and a lower degree of inhibition by heparin were seen with the fibroblasts as compared with the HEK-293 cells. This suggests that the interaction of PCPE-1 with fibroblasts may involve another receptor in addition to HSPGs, while the interaction of PCPE-1 with the HEK-293 cells was mainly mediated by HSPGs. Nonetheless, the interaction of the NTR domain with HSPGs seems to be cardinal for PCPE-1 binding to cells, as prolonged incubation of 3T3 mouse fibroblasts with heparin alone was sufficient to achieve complete displacement of PCPE-1 Flag from the cell surface. The finding that cell-bound PCPE-1 can be fully displaced by heparin (which does not penetrate intact cells) indicates that cell-bound PCPE-1 is not internalized, and suggests that PCPE-1 may function on the cell surface, accelerating procollagen processing at this location.The biological significance of PCPE-1 interaction with heparan sulfate is not fully elucidated. To gain an insight on this question, we examined whether cell-bound PCPE-1 can stimulate PCP activity pericellularly. We used radioactively labeled procollagen and Flag-tagged PCPE-1 to facilitate their localization, and both were localized to the cell surface/cell layer during enzymatic processing by BMP-1. The results of the processing assays, which were performed with and without addition of PCPE-Flag, document for the first time cell-associated enhancing activity of PCPE-1. This suggests the cell surface as a physiological site of PCPE-1 enhancing activity, and is in agreement with previous reports indicating that in tendon, fibrillogenesis is initiated in a series of extracellular compartments defined by the fibroblasts and close to their surface (36Zhang G. Young B.B. Ezura Y. Favata M. Soslowsky L.J. Chakravarti S. Birk D.E. J Musculoskelet Neuronal Interact. 2005; 5: 5-21PubMed Google Scholar).The highest degree of enhancement (3.5-fold) was however lower than that obtained in the standard assay of PCP activity (∼10-fold) that is performed in solution at optimal (1:1) molar ratios of PCPE-1 and procollagen (29Ricard-Blum S. Bernocco S. Font B. Moali C. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J. Burchardt E.R. van der Rest M. Kessler E. Hulmes D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33864-33869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This could be due to the fact that in the cell-based assay, we only measured an increment in enhancing activity, above that provided by endogenous PCPE-1, which also binds to the cell membrane and can be displaced from it by heparin (37Wineman E. Weiss T. Farzam N. Savion N. Smorodinsky I.N. Kessler E. Federation of the European Connective Tissue Societies, Marseille, France, July 9–13. 2008; (2008, Federation of the European Connective Tissue Societies)Google Scholar).The interaction of the NTR domain with heparan sulfate seems to play a role in anchoring PCPE-1 to the cell membrane where it can take part in the processing of a number of extracellular matrix proteins by BMP-1, including fibrillar procollagen precursors. Assembly of functional multiprotein complexes has been reported on the heparan sulfate polymer chain (27Gallagher J.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 4: 438-441Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate may act as a guiding scaffold to bring BMP-1, PCPE-1, and procollagen molecules together in areas of collagen fibrillogenesis, playing a pivotal role in the building of the molecular machines involved in procollagen processing. Indeed, heparan sulfate chains bind with moderate affinity to PCPE-1, which is required to enhance BMP-1 activity, to procollagen I with high affinity in the nanomolar range (31Ricard-Blum S.

The functional importance of complexes assembled by heparan sulfate is highlighted by the recent demonstration that heparin/heparan sulfate can increase the enhancing activity of PCPE-1 further (about 2-fold) in the processing of (mini) procollagen III by BMP-1, an effect described as “superstimulation” of PCPE-1 (18Bekhouche M.

IntroductionFibrillar procollagen precursors contain N- and C-terminal propeptide extensions at both ends of their pro α chains.

They are abundant at cell surfaces and within the extracellular matrix and heparan sulfate (HS) is a complex and highly active biopolymer, which binds to a wide variety of growth factors, morphogens, chemokines, and extracellular matrix proteins (25Capila I.

HSPGs act as co-receptors for several tyrosine kinase receptors and have been shown to be important in controlling the biological activities of the bound factor (26Whitelock J.M. Iozzo R.V. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2745-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In this study, using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assays, we characterized at the molecular level the binding of PCPE-1 to heparin and heparan sulfate, which is likely to be the physiological partner of PCPE-1. This included determination of the kinetics and affinity constants and demonstration of the role of divalent cations in this interaction. We have also investigated the role of this interaction in mediating cell adhesion to PCPE-1 and in anchoring PCPE-1 to the cell membrane, revealing that cell-bound PCPE-1 can augment procollagen processing by BMP-1 at the cell surface. The binding of PCPE-1 to heparan sulfate might play a major role in the assembly of the molecular machines comprised of bone morphogenetic protein-1, PCPE-1, and procollagens, which ensure the processing of procollagen molecules at the cell surface."

Tax sequesters MDC1 to chromatin sites distinct from classic ionizing radiation-induced foci. The recruitment of MDC1 is competitive between the two foci.

HTLV-1 is the causative agent for adult T-cell leukemia, an aggressive leukemia/lymphoma. Infection by HTLV-1 is characterized by a long asymptomatic period of on average ∼30 years (1Proietti F.A.

The molecular details of the transformation process are not completely understood, but mounting evidence supports the hypothesis that Tax induces genomic instability in the host, a condition that accelerates accumulation of mutations that support cellular transformation (7Jeang K.T.

Sustained deficiencies of this sort are expected to result in genomic instability, and this hypothesis is consistent with the observation that genomic instability characterizes pretransformed HTLV-infected cells and the long asymptomatic period prior to transformation. An important cellular strategy for coordination of an efficient DDR is through the sequential recruitment of repair-response factors to the sites of DNA damage. The formation of these damage foci result from cellular efforts to consolidate repair activity and as such the formation, enumeration/size, and persistence of the foci reflect regulation of DDR (19Jackson S.P. Bartek J. Nature. 2009; 461: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (3610) Google Scholar, 20Lukas C. Bartek J. Lukas J.

The best studied of these nuclear structures is ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF). Immediately following insult by ionizing radiation, damaged DNA ends are recognized by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex. This recognition step is critical to the initial activation of DNA-PK/ATM, which sets in motion the activation of a number of downstream signal mediators such as Chk2, BRCA1, and 53BP1. The signaling coincides with recruitment of factors to the sites of damage, a process that is iterative and tied to the extent of damage. Recently, the recruitment of MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1) to IRIF has been revealed as a critical event for initiation, amplification, and stabilization of the foci at sites of damage (22Dimitrova N. de Lange T.

In the present study we demonstrate that Tax tethers MDC1 to chromatin overlapping with nuclear foci called Tax speckled structures (TSS). The TSS foci and IRIF do not colocalize, and recruitment of MDC1 is competitive between the two sites. We show that TSS contain the DDR proteins DNA-PK, BRCA1, and MDC1 and that Tax expression alone generates a DDR signal that is dependent upon the sequestration of MDC1. Tax expression and formation of TSS foci impaired the normal DDR as demonstrated through a quantitative reduction in damage-induced Nbs1-containing foci. These results support a novel competition model for Tax-induced genomic instability. 293T cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen).

For immunofluorescence analysis we used the following antibodies: anti-MDC1 goat polyclonal (1/100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-BrdU mouse monoclonal (1/50; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), anti-BRCA1 mouse monoclonal (1/100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Nbs1 rabbit polyclonal (1/400; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), and anti-DNA-PK Thr(P)2609 mouse monoclonal (1/400; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). For Western analysis, the following antibodies were used: anti-MDC1 goat polyclonal (1/200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GFP mouse monoclonal (1/500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA rabbit polyclonal (1/1500, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), anti-tubulin mouse monoclonal (1/2000; Sigma), anti-Tax-pep3 rabbit polyclonal (1/2000), anti-ORC2 rabbit polyclonal (1/400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-γ-H2AX (1/2000; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 60-mm plates. The following day the medium was replaced with serum-free and antibiotic-free medium 1 h prior to transfection. A total of 100 pmol of siRNA MDC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or siRNA control were diluted in 500 μl of Opti-MEM® I medium without serum. LipofectaminTM 2000 was gently mixed, and 5 μl was diluted in 500 μl of Opti-MEM® I medium without serum. The mixture was mixed and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The selected DNA and/or siRNA were mixed with the diluted LipofectaminTM 2000 and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-siRNA-LipofectaminTM 2000 complexes were then added to the plate. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, washed, and plated with complete medium. The cells were harvested after an additional 48 h. The cells were transfected directly upon coverslips. The medium was removed, and the coverslips were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with ice-cold methanol for 2 min. The coverslips were then washed four times with PBS and incubated with primary antibody diluted in 3% BSA in PBS. Excess primary antibody was removed with two washes each of PBS, 1% Tween 20 and PBS. The coverslips were then incubated with species-specific Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) diluted at 1/1000 in 3% BSA in PBS. The nuclei were counterstained with To-Pro-3 iodide (Invitrogen) diluted 1/1,000 in the same secondary antibody solution. Excess secondary antibody was removed with two washes each of 3% BSA in PBS and PBS. One drop of Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) was placed onto a slide, and the coverslip was inverted onto the slide and left to air dry for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Confocal fluorescent images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope at 63× magnification with a 2× zoom using argon (488 nm), HeNe1 (543 nm), and HeNe2 (633 nm) lasers and imaged with LSM Image Browser software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) using the semi-dry transfer method with 20 V applied for 1 h. The membranes were then blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 1× Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Primary antibodies diluted in 1× Odyssey blocking buffer were applied to the membranes and incubated at 4 °C overnight with shaking. The membranes were washed four times for 5 min with PBS, 1% Tween 20. Li-Cor Odyssey secondary antibodies were diluted to a concentration of 1/20,000 in 1× Odyssey blocking buffer containing 0.5% SDS and 0.5% Tween and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature protected from light. The membranes were washed four times for 5 min with PBS, 1% Tween 20 and then stored in PBS until ready to be analyzed. The blots were scanned and analyzed with a Li-Cor Odyssey scanner and software. Approximately 5 × 106 cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested with a cell scraper into 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. The cells were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 2 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold PBS. The cells were again centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO3, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture) with a blunt 1000-μl micropipette tip. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the solution was incubated on ice for 5 min. The solution was then centrifuged at 1,300 × g (4000 rpm) at 4 °C for 5 min in a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube. The supernatant (fraction S1) was separated from the pellet (fraction P1), which contains the nuclei. Fraction S1 was clarified by high speed centrifugation at 20,000 × g (14,000 rpm) at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant (fraction S2), which represents the cytosolic fraction, was collected, and the pellet was discarded. Fraction S2 was stored at −80 °C until ready to use. Pellet fraction P1 was washed once with buffer A (0.6 ml/tube) by centrifugation again at 4000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. Washed fraction P1 was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture) with a blunt 1000-μl micropipette tip and lysed for 30 min on ice. The P1 sample was then centrifuged at 1,700 × g (5000 rpm) at 4 °C for 5 min. The resulting supernatant (fraction S3), which contains the soluble nuclear proteins, was separated from the pellet (fraction P2) that contains the chromatin. Fraction S3 was stored at −80 °C until ready to use. Fraction P2 was washed once with Buffer B (0.6 ml/tube) by centrifugation at 10,000 × g (11,000 rpm) at 4 °C for 1 min. Fraction P2 was then resuspended in M-PER (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) protein extraction buffer (180 μl/sample), briefly sonicated, and clarified by high speed centrifugation at 20,000 × g (14,000 rpm) at 4 °C for 5 min. The final supernatant (fraction P3), which contains the chromatin-bound proteins, was collected and kept at −80 °C until ready to use. Mock and STaxGFP transfected cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml of BrdU (Sigma) for 30 h under normal cell culture conditions and then exposed to 15 Gy of x-ray irradiation or left untreated. After ionizing radiation, the cells were grown for 16 h, washed with PBS, fixed with methanol for 5 min at −20 °C, and blocked with 3% BSA for 30 min. The cells were immunostained with mouse anti-BrdU followed by anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). The nuclei were counterstained with To-Pro-3 iodide (Invitrogen) diluted at 1/1,000. We previously described the subcellular localization of Tax to prominent nuclear speckles we termed TSS (34Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6347-6357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have subsequently demonstrated the recruitment of Chk2 and DNA-PK to TSS by Tax (15Haoudi A. Daniels R.C. Wong E. Kupfer G. Semmes O.J.

These observations and the knowledge that Tax expression results in genomic instability led us to speculate that Tax induces genomic instability via functional sequestration of proteins of the cellular DDR. To advance this hypothesis, we examined additional DDR proteins for colocalization to TSS. Tax-GFP fusion protein was transiently expressed, and endogenous DDR proteins were analyzed for colocalization using indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. In Fig. 1, we show a typical expression pattern of Tax localized to nuclear TSS. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase damage response activator DNA-PK, activated via phosphorylation at Thr2609, colocalizes with TSS as we have previously demonstrated (33Durkin S.S. Ward M.D. Fryrear K.A. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31705-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, we now show that the DDR mediator proteins BRCA1 and MDC1 also localize to TSS. Greater than 80% of all nuclei counted showed colocalization between TSS and the indicated protein. Foci for BRCA1, DNA-PK, and MDC1 were observed in the absence of Tax expression in less than 5% of cells. The localization of nucleolin to a nuclear domain distinct from TSS is included as a control. The recruitment of MDC1 to TSS is especially interesting given the critical role this protein plays in the initiation and amplification of DDR, and IRIF formation and maintenance. These findings establish that Tax-induced TSS foci are enriched for DDR proteins. To gain insight into the formation of TSS, it was critical to determine whether the TSS were independent/separable from classic DDR structures such as IRIF. Because TSS share many of the protein markers of IRIF, we utilized a modified BrdU staining technique that detects DNA breaks to visualize damage foci (37Raderschall E. Golub E.I. Haaf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1921-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Tax-expressing cells were pulsed with BrdU for 30 h before ionizing radiation treatment to completely label the DNA. No denaturation step was used before anti-BrdU staining; therefore only the accessible BrdU epitopes that occur at DNA strand breaks are visualized. If TSS are formed at sites of DNA damage, then we would expect to observe colocalization with the BrdU foci. As shown in Fig. 2, in the absence of exogenous irradiation, there were no nuclear BrdU foci and thus no evidence of TSS residing at sites of DNA damage. We next induced the formation of IRIF by exposing the cells to 5 Gy of IR and examined the cells 16 h later. In the Tax-expressing cells exposed to IR clear BrdU damage, foci were observed. However, there was only incidental overlap between TSS and IRIF. Specifically, less than 50% of cells expressing both foci displayed overlap and in those cells that did, ∼7% of TSS contained BrdU foci. These data demonstrate that although TSS and IRIF share many DDR proteins, they are in fact different structures. Having established that TSS and IRIF are independent structures, we hypothesized that TSS may compete with IRIF for limiting DDR proteins. This competition for limiting DDR proteins would provide a mechanism for repression of the repair response and Tax-mediated genomic instability. One approach toward identification of limiting factors is to induce both TSS and IRIF and observe the distribution of known DDR proteins. In these studies, we expressed Tax-GFP and examined the colocalization of endogenous proteins by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. We established IRIF by exposure to 5 Gy of IR to ensure maximum recruitment to IRIF. In Fig. 3 we show that MDC1, DNA-PK, and BRCA1 are all induced to localize to TSS in the absence of IR. Greater than 80% of counted cells showed colocalization of TSS and each of these nuclear foci. When both TSS and IRIF are present, DNA-PK and BRCA1 are effectively recruited to both structures in >92% of cells. However, when presented with both IRIF and TSS, MDC1 localized almost exclusively to foci outside of TSS. This result suggests that MDC1 may be a critical factor for regulating TSS/IRIF formation. Interestingly, expression of Tax did not result in induction of Nbs1 localization to TSS in the absence of IR, although we could demonstrate efficient induction and localization to IRIF. Because Nbs1 is a critical component of the damage-sensing complex MRN, the absence of Nbs1 in TSS is consistent with a lack of associated DNA breaks. Of the tested DDR proteins, MDC1 appears to localize either to TSS in the absence of IR or to IRIF in the presence of high doses of IR. We reasoned that if the localization of MDC1 to TSS and/or IRIF was competitive, then MDC1 localization would be dictated by the relative recruitment to each site. We were unable to effectively titrate IRIF directly because IR exposures less than 1 Gy resulted in inconsistent formation of IR-induced MDC1-containing foci. Therefore, to achieve a competition balance between the amount of damage versus the amount of Tax, we “titrated” damaged DNA by following time points post-repair. We reasoned that as damage was resolved then the “demand” for IR foci would fall below the demand for Tax foci. A standard dose of 1 Gy was found to produce sufficient IRIF and allow for cell recovery. Because the experiments were conducted within 24 h, Tax expression was relatively constant (protein half-life, >24 h). Each experimental time point resulted from analysis of 25 nuclei from cells in which both TSS and IRIF were observed. A simple numerical average was generated for the percentage of foci that overlap. In the absence of IR the colocalization of MDC1 to TSS was >84% (Fig. 4). However, at 4 h following exposure to 1 Gy of IR, MDC1 dramatically relocalized to IRIF with <9% of foci overlap. We also observed that the relative size and shape of the TSS remain unchanged throughout the experiment. At the 24-h time point the MDC1 foci outside of TSS have both reduced in number and size as is consistent with resolved DNA damage. Under these conditions, ∼47% of the TSS now displayed colocalization with MDC1. Thus, as damaged DNA is repaired and the recruitment balance shifts toward TSS foci, MDC1 relocalizes to TSS. Damage-independent DDR foci were shown to result from tethering MDC1 to DNA (38Soutoglou E. Misteli T. Science. 2008; 320: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We thus speculated that Tax initiates a damage-independent DRR within TSS by binding to and recruiting MDC1. In this series of experiments we sought to establish whether Tax binds to MDC1. HA-MDC1 and either S-TaxGFP, S-Tax, or S-GFP were cotransfected into 293T cells, and Tax complexes were subsequently isolated from whole cell lysates using S-agarose chromatography. We directly normalized cell lysates to expression of MDC1 and adjusted expression efficiency to achieve comparable expression of Tax, Tax-GFP, or GFP. We also conducted immunoblot analysis for expression of tubulin in the extracts prior to purification of complexes for additional experimental normalization. In Fig. 5A, we show that both TaxGFP and Tax protein coprecipitates with MDC1 at comparable efficiency. In contrast, GFP fails to form a complex with MDC1. These results demonstrate a specific binding between Tax and MDC1. We previously determined that TSS reside within the subnuclear architecture of interchromatin granules (34Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6347-6357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if Tax is binding to MDC1 and recruiting this protein into TSS, then the relative amount of MDC1 within the chromatin fraction should increase in the presence of Tax. In this experiment, we isolated the cellular chromatin fraction from cells either expressing Tax or not. The isolated chromatin fractions were then separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted to determine steady-state levels of endogenous MDC1. We initially determined that the total expression of MDC1 was unaffected by the expression of Tax (Fig. 5B). When normalized to tubulin, the total cell extracts presented with equivalent levels of MDC1. However, in the chromatin fraction the relative amount of MDC1 was dramatically increased in the Tax-expressing cells (Fig. 5C). As has been reported elsewhere, we see multiple forms of MDC1 with different migration rates (39Stucki M. Clapperton J.A. Mohammad D. Yaffe M.B. Smerdon S.J. Jackson S.P. Cell. 2005; 123: 1213-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that these isoforms are due to differential phosphorylation (40Lou Z. Minter-Dykhouse K. Wu X. Chen J. Nature. 2003; 421: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The chromatin extracts were normalized to expression of the chromatin-specific protein Orc2. The relative expression of tubulin and Orc2 was used to qualify the efficiency of the chromatin fractionation process. Thus, Tax-expressing cells display an increased steady-state level of endogenous MDC1 in the chromatin fraction as a result of Tax expression. This result is consistent with our model for Tax binding to MDC1 and recruiting the protein to chromatin-associated TSS. We recently identified a TSS localization signal in Tax that is necessary and sufficient for targeting to TSS (41Fryrear K.A. Durkin S.S. Gupta S.K. Tiedebohl J.B. Semmes O.J. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 5339-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Specifically, when we linked GFP to the first 75 amino acids of Tax, encompassing both the NLS (1–50) and TSS localization signal (50–75), this protein formed nuclear foci and targeted to the same subnuclear sites as wild type Tax. Having identified the minimal structure of Tax required for localization to TSS, we asked whether the TSS localization signal domain was able to recruit cellular DDR. We observed that although Tax1–75 could efficiently form TSS foci, neither MDC1 nor DNA-PK Thr(P)2609 was recruited to these structures (Fig. 6). We then examined the Tax 1–75 expressing cells for ability to form IRIF. The formation of IRIF and recruitment of MDC1 and DNA-PK to foci was unimpaired in these cells. In addition, the IRIF did not colocalize with the TSS. These data show that recruitment of DDR proteins to TSS requires the C-terminal half of Tax and suggests that Tax serves to bridge the formation of DDR-containing TSS. We reasoned that if TSS and IRIF compete for MDC1 recruitment and DDR activation, then expression of Tax should impair the normal damage-induced DDR. As we noted earlier, in contrast to all other accessed DDR factors, Nbs1 was not recruited to TSS foci. Therefore, we were able to measure IRIF formation separate from TSS formation by observation of Nbs1 recruitment into IRIF. In contrast to MDC1 foci, we were able to observe a robust Nbs1-containing foci formation at lower IR doses, and so for these experiments we utilized an exposure of 0.5 Gy. Exp"

In cortical neurons, most neurotransmitter release is triggered by Ca2+ binding to synaptotagmin-1; however, a second delayed phase of release, referred to as asynchronous release, is triggered by Ca2+ binding to an unidentified secondary Ca2+ sensor. To test whether CaM could be the enigmatic Ca2+ sensor for asynchronous release, we now use in cultured neurons short hairpin RNAs that suppress expression of ∼70% of all neuronal CaM isoforms. Surprisingly, we found that in synaptotagmin-1 knock-out neurons, the CaM knockdown caused a paradoxical rescue of synchronous release, instead of a block of asynchronous release. Gene and protein expression studies revealed that both in wild-type and in synaptotagmin-1 knock-out neurons, the CaM knockdown altered expression of >200 genes, including that encoding synaptotagmin-2. Synaptotagmin-2 expression was increased several-fold by the CaM knockdown, which accounted for the paradoxical rescue of synchronous release in synaptotagmin-1 knock-out neurons by the CaM knockdown. Interestingly, the CaM knockdown primarily activated genes that are preferentially expressed in caudal brain regions, whereas it repressed genes in rostral brain regions. Consistent with this correlation, quantifications of protein levels in adult mice uncovered an inverse relationship of CaM and synaptotagmin-2 levels in mouse forebrain, brain stem, and spinal cord. Finally, we employed molecular replacement experiments using a knockdown rescue approach to show that Ca2+ binding to the C-lobe but not the N-lobe of CaM is required for suppression of synaptotagmin-2 expression in cortical neurons. Our data describe a previously unknown, Ca2+/CaM-dependent regulatory pathway that controls the expression of synaptic proteins in the rostral-caudal neuraxis.

CaM is highly conserved in vertebrates and is ubiquitously expressed. All CaM proteins are composed of two lobes (i.e. the N- and C-lobes) that each contain two E-F hand Ca2+-binding motifs and are connected via a flexible α-helix (15Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J.

In addition, CaM was proposed to directly function as a Ca2+ sensor for Ca2+-triggered exocytosis (25DeLorenzo R.J. Cell Calcium. 1981; 2: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Steinhardt R.A. Alderton J.M. Nature. 1982; 295: 154-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), prompting us to test here whether CaM may act as the Ca2+ sensor for asynchronous release. For this purpose, we cultured cortical neurons from synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) knock-out (KO) mice in which synchronous release is abolished and only asynchronous release remains (5Geppert M. Goda Y.

Neuron. 2005; 48: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We then analyzed the effects of shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of all CaM isoforms on neurotransmitter release, using a previously established lentiviral system that suppresses ∼70% of neuronal CaM expression (24Pang Z.P. Cao P. Xu W. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We found that although KD of CaM had no significant effect on asynchronous release, it surprisingly rescued the loss of synchronous release in Syt1 KO neurons. An unbiased genome-wide gene expression profiling experiment revealed that the CaM KD induced a dramatic up-regulation of expression of Syt2 and synaptobrevin-1 (Syb1), which are normally expressed in the forebrain at low levels but are abundant in caudal brain regions (27Berton F.

In addition, the expression of other caudal synaptic genes was increased, whereas expression of rostral synaptic genes was decreased. Moreover, using molecular replacement experiments, we show that the regulation of Syt2 expression by CaM requires Ca2+ binding to only the C-lobe but not the N-lobe of CaM. Thus, our data show that Ca2+ binding to CaM regulates neurotransmitter release not only in the short term by binding to target proteins (12Clapham D.E.

Mouse cortical culture was made as described elsewhere (6Maximov A. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2005; 48: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Pang Z.P. Cao P. Xu W. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, the primary cortical neurons were isolated from postnatal day 0 pups of Syt1 deficient or wild-type mice, dissociated by papain digestion, and plated on Matrigel-coated circle glass coverslips. The neurons were cultured in vitro for 13–16 days in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), glucose, transferrin, fetal bovine serum, and Ara-C (Sigma). The packaging of lentiviruses and the infection of neurons with lentiviruses were described previously (24Pang Z.P. Cao P. Xu W. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lentiviral expression vector (control vector L309 or the shRNAs carrying vectors) and three helper plasmids, the pRSV-REV, pMDLg/pRRE, and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein were co-transfected into HEK 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) at 6, 2, 2, and 2 μg of DNA/25-cm2 culture area, respectively. The transient transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Supernatants with viruses were collected 48 h after transfection. Cortical neuronal culture was infected at 5 days in vitro (DIV) and used for biochemical or physiological analysis on 14–16 DIV. All of the steps were performed under level II biosafety conditions. Lentiviral vectors constructions were described previously (24Pang Z.P. Cao P. Xu W. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Human H1 promoter and human U6 promoter were cloned into lentiviral backbone vector FG-12 vector. Cloning sites after H1 promoter are XhoI-XbaI-HpaI; cloning sites after U6 promoter are AscI-ClaI-RsrII-PacI. Internal ribosome entry site-enhanced GFP was cloned in after ubiquitin C promoter, leaving BamHI-EcoRI sites for inserting rescue cDNAs. Short hairpin sequences for CaMs were the same as described previously (24Pang Z.P. Cao P. Xu W. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The cultured cortical neurons were lysed, and total RNA was extracted and purified with a RNAqueous micro kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Standard gene expression analyses were performed using the Affymetrix mouse gene ST_1.0 chip by the Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility at Stanford University. Array data were analyzed using the Partek genomics suite. Gene expression levels were compared with their control groups individually. Two data sets of CaM KD and CaM KD + WT CaM rescue were obtained with two batches of cultured neurons infected with control viruses; viruses with shRNAs targeting CaM 1–3; or viruses with shRNAs and expression of shRNA silent WT CaM cDNA (supplemental Table S1). Only the gene expression levels changed after CaM KD and rescued with WT CaM in both experiments are included in the list. Full gene expression array data are deposited to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. The cultured cortical neurons were lysed, and total RNA was extracted and purified with a RNAqueous micro kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA level of individual genes was then analyzed by one-step quantitative real time PCR system with pre-made TaqMan® gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, 30 ng of RNA sample in 1 μl of volume was mixed with 10 μl of TaqMan fast universal PCR master mix (twice), 0.1 μl of reverse transcriptase (50 units/μl), 0.4 μl of RNase inhibitor (20 units/μl), 7.5 μl of H2O, and 7 μl of TaqMan® gene expression assay for the target gene (including the forward and reverse primers and the TaqMan FAM-MGB probe). The reaction mixture was loaded onto ABI7900 fast real time PCR machine for 30 min of reverse transcription at 48 °C followed by 40 PCR amplification cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 s and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 20 s. The amplification curve was collected and analyzed with ΔΔCt methods for relative quantification of mRNAs. The amount of mRNA of target genes, normalized to that of an endogenous control and relative to the calibrator sample, is calculated by 2−ΔΔCt. In the current study, GAPDH was used as the endogenous control, and the RNA samples derived from neurons infected with control vector (L309) were used as calibrators. The TaqMan® gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) used in the current study included: Mm00486655_m1 (CaM 1), Mm00849529_g1 (CaM 2), Mm00482929_m1 (CaM 3), Mm00618457_m1 (Lrrtm3), Mm00436864_m1 (Syt2), and mouse GAPD (GAPDH) endogenous control. Syt9 quantitative real time PCR PrimeTime assay was designed and custom-made through Integrated DNA Technologies. Electrophysiology was performed as described previously (6Maximov A. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2005; 48: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Pang Z.P. Cao P. Xu W. Südhof T.C. J.

Methods. 2007; 161: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, the evoked synaptic responses were triggered by a bipolar electrode (FHC, CBAEC75 Concentric Bipolar Electrode OP: 125 μm SS; IP: 25 μm Pt/lr) placed at a position 100–150 μm from the soma of neurons recorded. The patch pipettes were pulled from borsilicate glass capillary tubes (Warner Instruments; catalog number 64-0793) using PP830 or PC-10 pipette puller (Narishige). The resistance of pipettes filled with intracellular solution varied between 4 and 5 MOhm. After formation of whole cell configuration and equilibration of intracellular pipette solution, the series resistance was adjusted to 8–10 MOhm. Synaptic currents were monitored with Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). The frequency, duration, and magnitude of extracellular stimulus were controlled with a model 2100 isolated pulse stimulator (A-M Systems, Inc.) synchronized with Clampex 9 data acquisition software (Molecular Devices). The whole cell pipette solution contained 135 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na-GTP, 4 mm Mg-ATP, and 10 mm QX-314 (pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH). The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). Inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents were pharmacologically isolated by adding AMPA and NMDA receptor blockers 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (20 μm) and AP-5 (50 μm) or GABAA receptor blockers bicuculine (20 μm) or picrotoxin (50 μm) to the extracellular bath solution. Spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were monitored in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 μm) to block the action potentials. For immunoblotting analyses from cultured neurons, at 14–15 DIV, the cultures were washed twice using PBS. The materials were directly collected by SDS protein sample buffers (50 μl of sample buffer/well for 24-well plates). Equal amounts of samples (25 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies as follows: CaM monoclonal antibody (Milllipore; 05-173, 1:1,000); Syt2 (I735, 1:3,000); Syt1 (Cl41.1, 1:4,000); syntaxin 1 (U6251, 1:3,000); SNAP-25 (P913, 1:1,000); Rab3A (42.2, 1:2,000); rabphilin (I731, 1:1,000), secretory carrier membrane proteins (R806, 1:1,000); PSD95 (L667, 1:1,000); Munc18 (J371, 1:1,000); cysteine string protein (R807, 1:1,000); N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (P944, 1:1,000); NL1 (4C12, 1:1,000); NL2 (169C, 1:200); GDP dissociation inhibitor (81.2, 1:2,000); synaptotbrevin-1 (P938, 1:500); β-actin (mouse monoclonal antibody clone 14; BD Transduction Labs; 1:2,000); and vasolin-containing protein (VCP; K330, 1:1,000). For protein quantitations, 125I-labeled secondary antibodies and PhosphoImager detection (Molecular Dynamics) were used. GDP dissociation inhibitor and VCP were employed as internal standards. The electrophysiological currents were sampled at 10 kHz and analyzed off-line using Clampfit 9 (Molecular Devices) software. For graphic representation of the current traces shown for evoked synaptic transmission, stimulus artifacts were removed. For measurements of frequency of spontaneous release and amplitudes of synchronous IPSCs during stimulus trains, individual mIPSCs or IPSCs were collected using pClamp template search function. Cumulative distributions of inter-event interval and amplitude of mIPSCs were compared using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. All of the statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test except where otherwise stated. We used shRNAs targeting all CaM isoforms (24Pang Z.P. Cao P. Xu W. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to suppress CaM expression in cultured cortical neurons from Syt1 KO mice. Immunoblotting analysis with enhanced chemiluminescence detection suggested that the CaM KD strongly suppresses CaM expression (Fig. 1A), and quantitations of the CaM mRNA and protein levels confirmed an actual suppression of CaM expression by ∼70% (24Pang Z.P. Cao P. Xu W. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Syt1 functions not only as a Ca2+ sensor for synchronous release but also for spontaneous miniature synaptic release (“minis”); it additionally acts as a clamp for mini release (31Xu J. Pang Z.P. Shin O.H. Südhof T.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As a result, the Syt1 KO causes a large increase in the frequency of minis; however, the increased minis in Syt1-deficient synapses remain Ca2+-sensitive and are likely mediated by a secondary, as yet unidentified Ca2+ sensor that exhibits the same properties as the Ca2+ sensor for asynchronous release. Thus, we first tested whether the CaM KD alters the increased minis observed in the absence of Syt1. Indeed, we found that the CaM KD reduced the frequency of mini IPSCs in Syt1 KO neurons ∼40% (Fig. 1, B, C, and E). This reduction in mini release was fully rescued by expression of shRNA-resistant wild-type CaM using the same lentivirus (24Pang Z.P. Cao P. Xu W. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the mini reduction is not a result of an off-target effect of the shRNAs used for the experiment. No obvious changes have been observed in the amplitudes of mIPSCs after CaM KD (Fig. 1, D and F) and kinetics of mIPSCs (Fig. 1, G and H). We next examined evoked asynchronous release in Syt1 KO cultured neurons with or without rescue. To our surprise, we found that instead of impairing asynchronous release, the CaM KD reversed the loss of synchronous release in Syt1 KO neurons (Fig. 2, A–C). Analysis of the kinetics of evoked responses revealed that upon CaM KD, the massively delayed release reaction in Syt1 KO synapses is accelerated to wild-type levels (Fig. 2C). Again, this CaM KD phenotype could be fully rescued by expression of wild-type CaM. Moreover, the restoration of synchronous release is also evident during trains of stimulation (Fig. 2D). However, the presence of synaptic facilitation instead of depression during the stimulus trains indicated that the release probability of CaM KD synapses was lower than that of WT synapses (Fig. 2E), consistent with our previous observation that the CaM KD decreases the presynaptic release probability by a CaMKII-dependent mechanism (24Pang Z.P. Cao P. Xu W. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To search for a potential mechanism that accounts for the rescue of synchronous release by the CaM KD in Syt1 KO neurons, we performed an unbiased gene expression analysis in cortical neurons. To avoid artifacts induced by the Syt1 KO or by off-target effects, we used wild-type neurons and directly compared neurons that had been infected with lentiviruses expressing the CaM shRNAs either without or with a wild-type CaM rescue protein. We then analyzed the gene expression patterns in these neurons with the Affymetrix mouse gene ST_1.0 chip. We identified in two independent array studies ∼250 genes whose expression was consistently up- or down-regulated by the CaM KD, as compared with the CaM KD/rescue control (see Fig. 4; Table 1 and supplemental Table S1; deposited to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus.TABLE 1Correlation of gene expression changes induced by the CaM KD in cortical neurons with the rostral-caudal expression patterns of these genes as deduced from the Allen Brain AtlasGene nameDescriptionExpression level in CaM KD (microarray)-Fold change (CaM KD/control)Rostral to caudal expression level (Allen Brain Atlas)Ratio (caudal/rostral)Syt2synaptotagmin 2↑5.64→3.04Cntn2contactin 2↑2.22→2.02Lgi3leucine-rich repeat LGI family, member 3↑2.12→1.12Coro6coronin, actin binding protein 6↑3.96→2.06Flt3FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3↑2.56→2.79Phospho1phosphatase, orphan 1↑2.15→4.11Aldh1a7aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A7↑1.79→2.35Tspan17tetraspanin 17↑1.71→1.44Tspan2tetraspanin 2↑1.75→1.26F3coagulation factor III↑1.46→2.90Stx1asyntaxin 1A↓0.61←0.30Icam5intercellular adhesion molecule 5↓0.54←0.02Lrrtm1leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 1↓0.69←0.05Opcmlopioid-binding protein↓0.6←0.37Lrrtm3leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 3↓0.62←0.47Npas2Neuronal PAS domain protein 2↓0.65←0.14NueroD6neurogenic differentiation 6↓0.38←0.46Arpc5actin-related protein 2↓0.63←0.11Mtap9microtubule-associated protein 9↓0.67←0.54Dlg3discs, large homolog 3↓0.64←0.25Necab1N-terminal EF-hand calcium binding protein 1↓0.61←0.27Doc2Bdouble C2 domain protein B↓0.58←0.18Cpne5copine 5↓0.56←0.23Sez6Seizure related gene 6↓0.63←0.34Ypel2Yipppee-like 2↓0.6←0.57Galnt9UDP-N-acetyl-a-d-galactosamine↓0.58←0.52Tiam2T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 2↓0.62←0.14Ctxn1cortexin 1↓0.6←0.20Pak7p21 (CDKN1A)-activated kinase 7↓0.58←0.07Rab40bRab40b, member RAS oncogene family↓0.62←0.30Rimbp2RIMS binding protein 2↓0.52←0.72Tmem74transmembrane protein 74↓0.55←0.25Lingo1leucine-rich repeat and Ig domain containing 1↓0.56←0.22Epha6Eph receptor A6↓0.56←0.62Ephb6Eph receptor B6↓0.69←0.45 Open table in a new tab As expected, multiple classes of genes were regulated by CaM. Consistent with previous studies (32Greenberg M.E. Thompson M.A. Sheng M. J. Physiol. Paris. 1992; 86: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar), we found that activity-dependent genes, such as Homers, Npas2, Arc, and Egr3 (supplemental Table S1), were down-regulated by the CaM KD. Interestingly, we observed that several synaptic trafficking proteins were either up- or down-regulated by the CaM KD (Fig. 3 and supplemental Table S1). Among these was a large increase in the expression of Syt2, which can serve as a Ca2+ sensor for synaptic exocytosis (3Sun J. Pang Z.P. Qin D. Fahim A.T. Adachi R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 2007; 450: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 7Pang Z.P. Melicoff E. Padgett D. Liu Y. Teich A.F. Dickey B.F. Lin W. Adachi R. Südhof T.C. J.

Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 496-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar); thus, this up-regulation of Syt2 by the CaM KD likely accounts for the rescue of the Syt1 KO phenotype. In addition, expression of Syb1 was massively increased, whereas expression of Syt4, Syt9, and syntaxin-1A was decreased. Another intriguing class of proteins whose expression was strongly regulated by CaM were cell adhesion molecules, such as the synaptic cell adhesion molecules Lrrtm1, Lrrtm3, and contactin-2 (Fig. 3). Moreover, we observed up-regulation of sodium channels, and a down-regulation of potassium channels, suggesting that CaM might control the activity-dependent regulation of neuronal excitability. Finally, we detected changes in multiple genes encoding transcription factors, intracellular signal transduction proteins, elements of the cytoskeleton, or metabolic enzyme"
https://openalex.org/W1997817392,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Kes1/Osh4 is a member of the enigmatic family of oxysterol-binding proteins found throughout Eukarya united by a β-barrel structure that binds sterols and oxysterols. In this study, we determined that phosphoinositides are the major determinant in membranes that facilitate Kes1 association both in vitro and in cells. Increased expression of Kes1 in yeast cells decreased the levels of both phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). Phosphoinositide and sterol bindings by Kes1 were necessary for Kes1 to decrease the level of PI4P but not PI3P. Kes1 inhibited vesicular trafficking between the trans-Golgi and plasma membrane as evidenced by accumulation of the vacuolar soluble NSF attachment protein receptors Snc1 in the cytoplasmic vesicles. Sterol and phosphoinositide binding by Kes1 both contributed to its regulation of Snc1 trafficking. This study also describes a previously unknown role for Kes1 in the regulation of the autophagy/cytoplasm to the vacuole trafficking pathway. The Kes1-mediated regulation of the autophagy/cytoplasm to the vacuole trafficking pathway was prevented by increasing expression of the PI3K Vps34, suggesting that it is the Kes1-mediated decrease in PI3P level that contributes to this regulation."

It has been hypothesized that phosphorylation might have a role in the induction of autoimmunity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren syndrome. Proteolytic cleavage has been identified as a possible mechanism of breaking tolerance in autoimmune rheumatic diseases due to exposure of cryptic epitopes to the immune system triggering autoimmune phenomena such as autoantibodies against self-molecules (11Kamachi M.

Other mechanisms that contribute to breaking tolerance toward self-peptides might include release of cytokines and pro-inflammatory mediators able to alter phosphorylation status through kinase pathway activation (13Casciola-Rosen L.

IL-1β promotes activation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK (Janus kinases) in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis inducing joint inflammation, although a clear-cut mechanism remains to be elucidated (14De Paepe B.

The aim of this work was to explore the phosphorylation status and expression of SRP72 autoantigen, using an in vitro model, previously reported by our group (17Arana-Argaez V.E. Martínez-Garía E.A. Martín-Marquez B.T. Muñoz-Valle J.F. Garcia-Iglesias T. Delgado-Rizo V. Vazquez-Del Mercado M. Bioquimia. 2009; 34: 77-82Google Scholar), on Jurkat cells that offer an excellent substrate to test models of autoimmune diseases because they are a stable tumor cell line capable of producing human IL-2, which stimulates the long term in vitro proliferation of antigenic specific effector T cells and enhances mitogenic properties; also they offer various antigen and effector specificities. These Jurkat cells were stimulated by recombinant human IL-1β (rhIL-1β). IL-1β is overexpressed in muscle biopsies of patients with DM (18De Paepe B. Creus K.K. De Bleecker J.L. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2009; 21: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); also it is known to up-regulate the MAPK kinase family; p38, ERK, and JNK (19Yang H.T. Cohen P. Rousseau S. Cell.

Furthermore, we were able to show that specific MAPK inhibitors prevented IL-1β-induced up-regulation of SRP72. endoplasmic reticulum relative units of area immunoprecipitation-Western blot recombinant human IL dermatomyositis signal recognition particle. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Millipore, Billerica, MA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 72 h until a confluence of 1 × 106 cells/ml for each experiment. The cell pellet was obtained after centrifugation at 300 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. In the experiments to examine the effects of rhIL-1β on SRP72 expression, Jurkat cells were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium without (control) or with 100 pg/ml rhIL-1β (Millipore) and harvested at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min. The cells were washed with iced-cold PBS and lysate in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) as described elsewhere (7Manning G. Plowman G.D. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 514-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The total protein concentration of cell extract after centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C) was quantified by Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Another series of experiments, effects of MAPK pathway inhibition (ERK1/2, p38, and JNK) on rhIL-1β-stimulated Jurkat cells, was examined by culturing cells with ERK1/2-MAPK inhibitors PD98059 (Selleck Chemicals LLC, Houston, TX) (MEK1 and MEK2 (1, 5, 10 μm)), HA1077 (Sigma) (RISK2 (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase family of serine/threonine number 2) (1, 10, 20 μm)), p38 MAPK inhibitors SB203580 (Selleck Chemicals LLC) (p38α (1, 5, 10 μm)), SB202190 (Selleck Chemicals LLC) (p38β2 (1, 5, 10 μm)), or JNK-MAPK inhibitor SP600125 (Sigma) (MAPK 9-JNK (1, 10, 20 μm)). Cells were harvested at 0, 120, and 240 min. The experiments were repeated three times. Cell lysate that contains 20 μg of protein in SDS-Laemmli loading buffer (7Manning G. Plowman G.D. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 514-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) per lane was fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE using mini Protean 3 electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). The filter was blocked in TBS (20 mm Tris base, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad), followed by incubation with the primary antibody goat polyclonal IgG (200 μg/ml) to human SRP72 epitope mapping near the C terminus of SRP72 of human origin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:2500), human SRP54 (Sigma) (1:2500), which represents the nonphosphorylated SRP protein and human GAPDH (Syd Labs, Boston) (1:3000). The filters were then incubated with HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and developed using ECL system (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The protein band was quantified using the Kodak 1D Imaging System, version 3.5 software, and expressed as relative units of area (RUA). Lysates from Jurkat cells treated with different MAPK inhibitors and rhIL-1β (100 pg/ml) were immunoprecipitated as described previously (7Manning G. Plowman G.D. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 514-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μl (2 μg) of anti-goat SRP19 antibody (Aviva Systems Biology LLC, San Diego) plus 2 μl (2 μg) of rabbit anti-goat IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) incubated with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) were used to immunoprecipitate the SRP complex that contained six polypeptides: 72, 68, 54, 21, 19, and 9 kDa. The IP-WB was performed using anti-phosphoserine antibodies (dilution 1:3000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and was developed by ECL (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Jurkat cells (1 × 106) were treated in the same experimental conditions as described before. Total RNA extraction was carried out using the RNeasy kit for isolation of total RNA (QiagenTM, Germantown, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase reagent and oligo(dT) (Invitrogen). The cycle included 5 min at 65 °C, 2 min at 37 °C, 50 min at 37 °C, and 15 min at 70 °C. cDNA obtained from the RT reaction was subjected to PCR using TaqMan Universal PCR master mix and ABI PRISM 7300 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primer and probe sequences and concentrations were optimized according to the manufacturer's guidelines in TaqMan Universal PCR master mix, protocol number HS00974354_g1, for human SRP72, containing FAMTM (fluorescent reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein, 518 nm) as reporter dye, and human GAPDH was obtained from TaqMan human GAPDH reagents kit protocol part 4326317E (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), containing VIC® dye (552 nm) as reporter. PCR parameters were as follows: incubation at 50 °C for 2 min, incubation at 95 °C for 10 min, and then 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min. Each sample was tested in duplicate. Relative mRNA levels of genes of interest were then calculated from the standard curve. The experiment was repeated three times and was analyzed with ABI prism software. Effects of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK inhibitors on Jurkat cell proliferation were evaluated by counting the concentration of cells at time 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h of culture. SB203580 p38 inhibitor (Promega Corp.) and ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (Selleck Chemicals LLC) were added at 1, 5, 10 μm concentration to Jurkat cells without stimulation with rhIL-β. ConA (5 μg/ml)-stimulated Jurkat cells in complete RPMI 1640 medium were used as a control. There was no toxic effect of inhibitors on cell viability nor on cell proliferation. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test using Prism 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. The SRP72 protein expression was increased between 90 and 240 min of rhIL-1β stimulation with a peak of expression at 240 min (Fig. 1A, lanes 6–9; corresponding values of RUA are shown in Fig. 1B, closed bars; 0 versus 240 and 5 versus 180 min, p < 0.05). The effects of MAPK inhibitors ERK1/2 PD98059 and HA1077 on rhL-1β-stimulated Jurkat cells were evaluated by WB using antibodies against SRP72, SRP54 (nonphosphorylated form of SRP), and GAPDH (loading control). Reduction of SRP72 protein expression by MAPK inhibitor was apparent at 120–240 min after culturing with both PD98059 (10 μm, Fig. 1C) and HA1077 (20 μm, Fig. 1E). The reduction of SRP72 expression was confirmed by quantitative analysis as shown in RUA (Fig. 1, D and F). In contrast, expression of SRP54 and the constitutive protein GAPDH was not changed, indicating specific inhibition of SRP72 expression by these MAPK inhibitors. Next, the effect of p38 inhibitors SB203580 (Fig. 2A) and SB202190 (Fig. 2C) on SRP72, SRP54, and GAPDH protein expression was examined by WB. Both inhibitors induced a concentration-dependent reduction of SRP72 expression but did not affect SRP54 and GAPDH levels. 10 μm SB203580 and 10 μm SB202190 induced the maximum reduction of SRP72 expression (Fig. 2, A and C, respectively). A quantitative analysis by densitometry scanning (RUA) verified a statistically significant reduction of SRP72 expression by SB203580 (Fig. 2B) and SB202190 (p < 0.05, Fig. 2D). SRP54 and GAPDH expression was not affected, suggesting that the reduction of SRP72 by the MAPK inhibitors was not due to nonspecific protein degradation but rather the effects were specific for SRP72 protein expression. In contrast, JNK inhibitor SP600125 did not show any effect on expression of SRP72, SRP54, and GAPDH (Fig. 2, E and F). The effects of rhIL-1β on phosphorylation of SRP72 in Jurkat cells were evaluated by immunoprecipitating the SRP complex using anti-SRP19 antibodies followed by specific anti-phosphoserine antibodies in WB. An increased reactivity of SRP72 at 90–180 min after addition of rhIL-1β was observed, indicating rhIL-1β induced phosphorylation of SRP72 (Fig. 3A, lanes 6–8). RUA quantification of SRP72 band showed increased phosphorylation peaking at 120 (p < 0.05, Fig. 3B). Effects of inhibitors of ERK1/2 (PD98059 (Fig. 3, C and D) and HA1077 (Fig. 3, E and F) on IL-1β-induced serine phosphorylation of SRP72 were examined using immunoprecipitates by anti-SRP19 antibodies. These inhibitors dramatically reduced the SRP72 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C and E, respectively). Quantification of RUA of the corresponding SRP72 band showed significant reduction. All of were statistically significant at p < 0.05 (Fig. 3, D and F). The experiments were repeated three times with similar results. Effects of p38 MAPK inhibitors (SB203580 and SB202190) on serine phosphorylation of SRP72 were examined in Jurkat cells stimulated by rhIL-1β. Both inhibitors showed a concentration-dependent reduction of SRP72 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and C, *, p < 0.05). Quantification of the SRP72 phosphorylation confirmed statistically significant reduction of SRP72 serine phosphorylation (Fig. 4, B and D, *, p < 0.05). In contrast, phosphorylation of SRP54 was not observed, indicating an exclusive phosphorylation effect of SRP72 evaluated by anti-phosphoserine antibody. Opposite the p38 MAPK inhibitors, JNK-MAPK pathway inhibitor SP600125 showed no effect on SRP72 phosphorylation in rhIL-1β-stimulated Jurkat cells (Fig. 4E). Quantification of the SRP72 protein band confirmed the results of IP-WB (Fig. 4F) as expected, because JNK is involved in tyrosine phosphorylation and not in serine phosphorylation as it occurs in SRP72. Results shown above indicated reduced SRP72 protein expression as well as reduced serine phosphorylation by MAPK inhibitors in rhIL-1β-stimulated Jurkat cells. One possible explanation is that these effects might be related to toxic effects of the MAPK inhibitors and, more specifically, induction of apoptosis or inhibition of cell proliferation. Therefore, the effects of MAPK inhibitors on cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by proliferation cell growth curve and by flow cytometry analysis of forward and side scatter pattern of the cells. Jurkat cells were cultured with the inhibitors at a concentration used in the above experiments, and the cell growth was counted at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. No effects of reduced Jurkat cell proliferation was observed in the presence of MAPK inhibitors (data not shown). In addition, forward and side scatter analysis of cells after culturing with these inhibitors showed a normal distribution pattern (data not shown). Thus, at least MAPK inhibitors do not appear to induce significant apoptosis or reduction of cell proliferation in the conditions used in this study. Because ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK inhibitors reduced SRP72 protein expression in rhIL-1β-stimulated Jurkat cells, SRP72 mRNA was evaluated using quantitative RT-PCR. Jurkat cells were stimulated with rhIL-1β without inhibitor (Fig. 5A) or with ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 5B), JNK inhibitor HA1077 (Fig. 5C), p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 5D), p38 inhibitor SB202190 (Fig. 5E), or JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Fig. 5F). The results did not show significant changes on the mRNA expression of SRP72 mRNA after the treatment with these inhibitors, suggesting that the reduction of SRP72 protein expression is not mediated by down-regulation of SRP72 mRNA. In Fig. 1, A and B, we showed induction of SRP72 by rhIL-1β after 90 min, peaking at 240 min. Interleukins are known to activate cells to exert many effects pro- or anti-inflammatory, angiogenesis, etc. MAPK kinase family is a key point on transcription factors such as NF-κβ (8Seger R.

Mary C. Scherrer A. Johnson A.E. Strub K. Cell. 2008; 133: 440-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), where SRP plays an important role (24Lingappa V.R. Katz F.N. Lodish H.F. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8667-8670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SRP72 is the only component in the SRP complex that can be phosphorylated. Our results confirmed that SRP72 was a phosphoprotein to which a serine residue is phosphorylated (25Utz P.J. Hottelet M. Le T.M. Kim S.J. Geiger M.E. van Venrooij W.J. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35362-35370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The physiological and potential pathological implication of this phenomenon in production of autoantibodies to SRP72 is not known. We suggest a few possible applications of this reaction on the cell physiology as follows. 1) It has been described that a GTPase domain on the docking protein for SRP at the rough ER could be related to the release of the complex SRP-docking-ribosome-mRNA-translocon (5Jiang Y. Cheng Z. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Lingappa V.R. Katz F.N. Lodish H.F. Blobel G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 2) The phosphorylation of the SRP72 might increase the affinity of SRP for its receptor on the rough ER membrane and facilitate the rough ER translocation of protein (5Jiang Y. Cheng Z. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Lakkaraju A.K. Mary C. Scherrer A. Johnson A.E. Strub K.

Cell. 1994; 5: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 3) The phosphorylation of SRP72 influence on the SRP complex activity in general because of the targeting of the protein by SRP does not requires GTPase activity (31Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 32Siu F.Y. Spanggord R.J. Doudna J.A.

A lot of work has to be done for the complete understanding of this phenomenon. The main function of the SRP complex is to attach the signal nascent polypeptide sequence, arrest the elongation, and finally, transport to the rough ER lumen the proteins that will be secreted to accomplish post-translational modifications. Indeed, the major role of SRP72 along SRP68 is to translocate proteins into the rough ER lumen (35Siegel V. Walter P. Cell. 1988; 52: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 36Utz P.J. Anderson P. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Why, in inflammatory myopathies, SRP72 as well as the SRP54 subunits are the target of autoantibody production is not known. In 1998, it was reported that a serum from a patient with DM could immunoprecipitate the SRP complex from Jurkat cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (36Utz P.J. Anderson P. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) or [32P]orthophosphate and that SRP72 is phosphorylated on a phosphoserine residue. This SRP72 subunit was the only phosphoprotein among the SRP components. A cleavage of SRP72 into a 66- and 6-kDa fragment after induction of apoptosis in Jurkat cells was shown. This apoptotic cleavage of autoantigens has been described as a possible mechanism of breaking tolerance against self-peptides on different autoimmune rheumatic diseases, so this is the first evidence related so far to an SRP72 subunit change once it is induced by apoptosis. We cannot assume that this might be the possible explanation as to why DM patients develop autoantibodies against SRP components. The information about clinical characteristics of DM patients who are positive for antibodies against SRP54 is that they have an aggressive outcome with poor response to conventional therapies (11Kamachi M. Le T.M. Kim S.J. Geiger M.E. Anderson P. Utz P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1213-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to evaluate the pathways of phosphorylation and overexpression of the SRP72 polypeptide, using an in vitro model of Jurkat cells stimulated by rhIL-1β in the presence of MAPK inhibitors. Our results showed that rhIL-1β causes up-regulation of protein expression and phosphorylation of SRP72 in Jurkat cells. Inhibitors of MAPK pathway ERK1/2 or p38α/β down-regulate the expression of SRP72 autoantigen in Jurkat cells stimulated by rhIL-1β. Studies in rheumatic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis have shown the important implication of IL-1β on the overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), influencing the progression of the disease (30Migliaccio G. Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The increase of SRP72 influenced by IL1β might be involved in triggering tissue damage in the patients with polymyositis and DM (11Kamachi M. Le T.M. Kim S.J. Geiger M.E. Anderson P. Utz P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1213-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications such as hyperphosphorylation of proteins have been proposed as one of the mechanisms of breaking tolerance to some specific epitopes of autoantigens such as La/SSB in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren syndrome (37Rutjes S.A. Utz P.J. van der Heijden A. Broekhuis C. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 38Utz P.J. Gensler T.J. Anderson P.

Physiol. 2007; 292: H1139-H1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our results show that phosphorylation of SRP72 is increased by rhIL-1β. In summary, changes in phosphorylation status of some proteins that are potential autoantigens may unmask cryptic epitopes. Once the antigens in unconventional form are processed and presented on antigen presenting cells, an autoimmune response may be triggered (36Utz P.J. Anderson P. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Previous studies reported that IL-1β is able of activate the MAPK pathway (39Mitchell M.D. Laird R.E. Brown R.D.

Our hypothesis is that MAPK inhibitors of p38α/β and ERK1/2, might influence the SRP72 autoantigen expression in Jurkat cells challenged by rhIL-1β. To validate our hypothesis, we included SRP54 antibody testing in the same conditions as we tested SRP72 subunit along with JNK inhibitors, showing that both SRP polypeptides and the GAPDH constitutive protein did not suffer any change when they were evaluated under the same experimental conditions (11Kamachi M. Le T.M. Kim S.J. Geiger M.E. Anderson P. Utz P.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1213-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additionally, we were able to show by cell counting for up to 72 h in a time course experiment that the exponential growth of Jurkat cells was not affected by MAPK inhibitors used in this study (data not shown). Lack of increased apoptosis by MAPK inhibitors was also confirmed by flow cytometry. This demonstrates that our results are valid using the appropriate controls (SRP54 and GAPDH), and the results are reproducible. One caveat of our study is that rhIL-1β was not able to show an increase of SRP72 expression at 120 and 240 min in the presence of MAPK inhibitors. Real time RT-PCR was done to measure the autoantigen of interest induced by rhIL-β in Jurkat cells tested with MAPK inhibitors, showing no effect on mRNA expression of the SRP72 gene, which could explain that the SRP72 and all the components of the SRP complex are synthesized and assembled inside the nucleus to do their functions in the cytoplasm (2Nagai K.

Our results are similar to reports that have described that the levels of mRNA are not a reflection of the cellular protein activity in several physiological situations (43Anderson P. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). SRP72 is a constitutive protein present in all eukaryotic organisms that is essential for survival; it is the unique organism that can survive after deletion of this SRP72 protein or other polypeptides of the SRP complex such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (23Lakkaraju A.K. Mary C. Scherrer A. Johnson A.E. Strub K. Cell. 2008; 133: 440-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which demonstrates the importance of this protein inside the cellular mechanisms, mainly the translocation of secreted proteins. Some studies show the use of mRNA expression patterns by themselves, however, is insufficient for understanding the expression of protein products, as additional post-transcriptional mechanisms, including protein translation, post-translational modification, and degradation, may influence the level of a protein present in a given cell or tissue (44Giordano T.J. Shedden K.A. Schwartz D.R. Kuick R. Taylor J.M. Lee N. Misek D.E. Greenson J.K. Kardia S.L. Beer D.G. Rennert G. Cho K.R. Gruber S.B. Fearon E.R. Hanash S. Am. J.

These cases probably represent a situation where, in the cell, having significantly controlled the mRNA expression to produce a specific level of protein, the mechanisms to control the translation will probably not be employed. Alternatively, those proteins that have very low occupancy rates have uncorrelated mRNA and protein expression; thus, given that the cell has not tightly controlled the mRNA expression, it will dictate the resulting protein levels through rigorous controls of its translation (46Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). A second option for a general lack of correlation between mRNA and protein abundance may be that proteins have very different half-lives as the result of varied protein synthesis and degradation. Protein turnover can vary significantly depending on a number of different conditions; the cell can control the rates of degradation or synthesis for a given protein, and there is significant heterogeneity even within proteins that have similar functions (47Pratt J.M.

Experimental therapy using inhibitors of the MAPK pathway for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has been under development; the anti-inflammatory and anti-erosive effects in experimental models of arthritis, beside the relief of inflammatory pain, are shown (41Barksby H.E.

It will be necessary to perform careful research on various kinase pathways, including MAPK in DM and other rheumatic diseases, to help explain the routes of activation and inhibition of autoantigens. The understanding of this process may help develop the design of new therapies to prevent and control the loss of the tolerance toward our own proteins."

The nuclear factor I C (NFI-C) transcription factor has been implicated in tooth development, but a potential role in hair growth had not been assessed. In this study we found that NFI-C regulates the onset of the hair growth cycle. NFI-C−/− mice were delayed in the transition from the telogen to anagen phase of the hair follicle cycle after either experimental depilation or spontaneous hair loss. Lack of NFI-C resulted in delayed induction of the sonic hedgehog, Wnt5a, and Lef1 gene expression, which are key regulators of the hair follicle growth initiation. NFI-C−/− mice also showed elevated levels of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), an inhibitor of keratinocyte proliferation, and of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 at telogen. Reduced expression of Ki67, a marker of cell proliferation, was noted at the onset of anagen, indicating impaired activation of the hair progenitor cells. These findings implicate NFI-C in the repression of TGF-β1 signaling during telogen stage, resulting in the delay of progenitor cell proliferation and hair follicle regeneration in NFI-C-deficient mice. Taken together with prior observations, these findings also designate NFI-C as a regulator of adult progenitor cell proliferation and of postnatal tissue growth or regeneration.

NFI-A-deficient mice develop neurological defects and die shortly after birth (4das Neves L. Duchala C.S. Tolentino-Silva F. Haxhiu M.A. Colmenares C. Macklin W.B. Campbell C.E. Butz K.G.

Tooth development shares several common stages and features with hair. Similar sets of intersecting signaling pathways, such as those elicited by TGF-β, PDGF, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), keratinocyte growth factor, Wnt, or sonic hedgehog (Shh) have been involved in morphogenesis and maturation of these appendages in mice. Furthermore, strong evidence of the similitude of these appendages is also provided by the numerous inherited or sporadic human diseases where abnormal tooth and hair development may be attributed to the misregulation of these signaling pathways (10Mikkola M.L. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Mikkola M.L. Millar S.E. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2006; 11: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Development of the murine follicles begins in utero. The epithelium and the underlying mesenchyme interact to form new follicles (12Botchkarev V.A. Kishimoto J. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 2003; 8: 46-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). After morphogenesis, each hair follicle repeatedly cycles between three stages: growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and rest (telogen) (13Cotsarelis G. Kaur P. Dhouailly D. Hengge U. Bickenbach J. Exp. Dermatol. 1999; 8: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Müller-Röver S. Handjiski B. van der Veen C. Eichmüller S. Foitzik K. McKay I.A. Stenn K.S. Paus R. J. Invest.

The hair follicle is composed of three main structures. The outer root sheath (ORS) is the outer cell layer that surrounds the inner root sheath (IRS) and the hair shaft. These last two structures derive from proliferating keratinocyte progenitor cells within the hair matrix. The mesenchymal component of the follicle is the dermal papilla (DP). Composed of specialized fibroblasts, this structure connects the follicle to the bloodstream and to the nervous system. In mice, melanization is a hair follicle cycle-dependent process. Pigments are produced during the anagen phase by melanocytes dispersed among the matrix cells (16Budd P.S. Antoniou J. Mellor A.L. Jackson I.J. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 17Nordlund J.J. Dermatol. Clin. 2007; 25: 271-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The most distinguishable feature of the hair follicle is its continuous cyclic regeneration and formation of a new hair shaft. Stem cells leading to follicle re-growth are thought to be localized in a specialized niche within the ORS at the insertion site of the arrector pili muscle called the bulge (18Cotsarelis G. Sun T.T. Lavker R.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 1329-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Molecular interactions between the dermal papilla and the epithelial stem cells of the bulge are believed to be responsible for activation of their proliferation, leading to the transition from telogen to anagen phase. The stimulation of bulge stem cells gives rise to rapidly dividing cells that migrate to the matrix (18Cotsarelis G. Sun T.T. Lavker R.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 1329-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). These keratinocyte progenitor cells will undergo a finite number of divisions to generate the lower part of the follicle, where their terminal differentiation will produce the IRS and the hair shaft (19Lavker R.M. Sun T.T. Oshima H. Barrandon Y. Akiyama M. Ferraris C. Chevalier G. Favier B. Jahoda C.A. Dhouailly D. Panteleyev A.A. Christiano A.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp.

The molecular nature of the epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk leading to the transition from a quiescent to a proliferative phase is poorly understood. However, several genetic studies have suggested that the hair follicle transition from telogen to anagen is associated with a series of events involving the inhibition of BMP pathways (20Botchkarev V.A.

BMP4 was identified as an inhibitor of the hair follicle cycle progression that is responsible for the maintenance of the follicle in the telogen phase (20Botchkarev V.A. Botchkareva N.V. Nakamura M. Huber O. Funa K. Lauster R. Paus R. Gilchrest B.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2205-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Geoghegan A. Polak L. Fuchs E. Cell. 2004; 118: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). The anagen onset was associated to an inhibitor-releasing mechanism involving de novo expression of Noggin, which acts by antagonizing BMP4 signaling. Inactivation of the BMP4 signal coincides with the induction of the Shh signaling, which in turn activates the Wnt/β-catenin/Lef-1 pathway, cell proliferation, and hair shaft formation (26Alonso L.

At the end of anagen, the transition of actively growing hair follicles into the phase of spontaneous involution (catagen) is characterized by the increase of TGF-β1 signaling, which drives apoptosis and proliferation arrest of the keratinocytes in the hair follicle matrix and epithelial strands (12Botchkarev V.A. Kishimoto J. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 2003; 8: 46-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 30Foitzik K. Lindner G. Mueller-Roever S. Maurer M. Botchkareva N.

While studying the role of NFI-C on skin wound healing (9Plasari G. Calabrese A. Dusserre Y. Gronostajski R.M. McNair A. Michalik L. Mermod N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 6006-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we observed a previously unidentified phenotype related to a hair growth delay in NFI-C−/− mice. Examination of the hair follicle cycle in NFI-C wild-type and knock-out mice indicated that the telogen-anagen transition is delayed in NFI-C−/− mice. Consistently, decreased expression of Shh and Wnt5a at anagen onset and of Lef1 during the growing phase was found in knock-out mice, implying NFI-C in the regulatory events that lead to anagen onset. High levels of TGF-β1 and cell cycle inhibitor p21/WAF1/CIP1 (p21) and decreased expression of Ki67, a marker of cell proliferation, were observed at the telogen and telogen-anagen transition in NFI-C−/− animals. Taken together, these results indicate that loss of NFI-C leads to a persistent activation of the TGF-β pathway at telogen that induces a delay in Shh and Wnt/β-catenin/Lef-1 signaling activation and keratinocyte proliferation. NFI-C knock-out mice generated by removal of the second exon from NFI-C gene were kindly provided by Gronostajski and co-workers (7Steele-Perkins G. Butz K.G. Lyons G.E. Zeichner-David M. Kim H.J. Cho M.I. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1075-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and NFI-C-null animals were obtained by breeding heterozygous littermates. All mice in this study have the C57Bl/6 background and were housed in a temperature-controlled room (23 °C) on a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle. As homozygous knock-out animals have brittle teeth, a ground standard rodent chow (Kliba Nafag) as well as the unground chow and water was provided ad libitum to all animals under study three times a week after weaning (P21). Over-groomed litters were separated from the mother 28 days after birth. The day of weaning was considered as day 0 after over-grooming, after which skin biopsies were collected to study fur recovery in wild-type and knock-out animals. Alternatively, non-over-groomed 23-day-old mice were depilated using a wax/rosin mixture to induce and synchronize hair follicle cycling in the plucked area (14Müller-Röver S.

Skin biopsies were collected from the depilated area to perform histological sections, or they were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for gene expression analysis. Each time point after plucking was analyzed in triplicate on NFI-C−/− or wild-type mice. Differences between the timing of spontaneous anagen stages of NFI-C−/− and wild-type animals was detected similarly up to 28 days after birth. Hematoxylin/eosin staining was performed on 5-μm paraffin sections of back skin. The endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using the Vector Black Alkaline Phosphatase Kit II (Vector Laboratories). Briefly, the enzyme substrate was applied directly on 7-μm skin cryosections and incubated for 20 min at room temperature to develop a brown/black reaction product. P-cadherin immunostaining was performed on 7-μm cryosections of back skin fixed for 3 min in 100% ethanol using a rat monoclonal antibody (PCD-1, Takara) at a 1/1000 dilution for 2 h and an anti-rat IgG secondary FITC-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For K15 immunofluorescence, cryosections were fixed for 3 min in 100% acetone and incubated overnight with the blocking solution from the MOM kit of Vector Laboratories diluted at 1/10. Slides were successively incubated for 2 h with a mouse monoclonal anti-K15 (LHK15, Novocastra) at a 1/100 dilution and an anti-mouse secondary antibody Alexa 546-conjugated (Molecular Probes). The immunostaining for Ki67 and p-Smad2/3 was performed on 4% paraformaldehyde fixed paraffin sections of back skin. Slides stained for Ki67 were subjected to epitope retrieval by immersion in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and heated for 20 min in a microwave oven set to 800 watts. Incubation with the anti-Ki67 goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was performed overnight, and detection was carried-out with anti-goat antibody coupled to biotin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Revelation was performed with a FITC-conjugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories). P-Smad2/3 stained slides were incubated with p-Smad2/3 goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, and detection was performed with anti-goat antibody coupled to biotin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the VECTASTAIN® ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Revelation was performed with diaminobenzidine (Sigma). All sections were counterstained with DAPI to visualize cell nuclei and photographed using light, fluorescence, or confocal microscopy. The number of p-Smad2/3-positive cells residing in the hair follicle was evaluated from three knock-out and wild-type mice. A total of about 50 hair follicles per day were analyzed for each group of mice. A statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed, two-sample equal variance t test. GGT enzyme activity was measured as described previously (31Jacobs W.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1971; 31: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Persijn J.P. van der Slik W. Zwart W.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1971; 35: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200-μm skin sections were homogenized in 50 μl of buffer containing 10% glycerol, 1% Triton, and 5 mm K2HPO4 at pH 7. The suspensions were centrifuged, and the total protein concentration of the supernatants was measured using a Bradford assay. A volume of 10 μl of the supernatant was used for the enzymatic assay with 100 μl of substrate buffer containing 1.26 mg/ml γ-glutamyl-nitro, 2.92 mg/ml glycylglycine, 11 mm HCl2, and 50 mm Bicine. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 2.5 h, after which they were stopped by adding 100 μl of 4.4 m acetic acid. The yellow reaction product was quantified by spectrophotometry at 410 nm. Sample absorbance values were normalized to the total protein content after deduction of the background absorbance obtained with 10 μl of supernatant inactivated by prior incubation at 100 °C. A standard curve of GGT activity was established using a range from 0 to 2 × 10−4 units of equine kidney GGT (Sigma), and the GGT skin activity is expressed as units per μg of extract total proteins. Statistical significance of enzyme activity differences was determined using a two-tailed paired t test. Total RNAs were extracted from whole thickness skin explants using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's instructions. Further purification of RNA was performed using RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen). RNA integrity was assessed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining. Reverse transcription was performed using RT-PCR Master Mix (GE Healthcare). Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with random primers, and first strand reverse-transcribed cDNA was diluted 1:200 in water before use. Real-time PCR was carried out with LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master kit using a LightCycler 480 system (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. Relative gene expression was calculated using the equation EBCtB/EACtA, where E represents the efficiency as estimated with the LinReg method, Ct is the threshold cycle, B is the endogenous reference, and A is the gene of interest as described previously (33Karlen Y. McNair A. Perseguers S. Mazza C. Mermod N. BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 131Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). As the endogenous reference, we used the geometric mean of the mRNA levels of the eukaryotic elongation factor 1 α1 (EEF1a1) and ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9). Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. The results represent the mean of three animals ± S.E. Statistical significance of differences in gene expression was examined using a two-tailed, two-sample equal variance t test. Hair barbering of a litter is a stress-related disorder observed with some inbred mouse lines that appears as a loss of hair of all pups as a consequence of an over-grooming behavior by the mother. This was occasionally observed during the breeding of NFI-C knock-out heterozygote mice, which resulted in a similar loss of the fur for all littermates irrespective of their genotype. All mice recovered their fur after weaning and separation from the mother. However, fur recovery was delayed for the NFI-C−/− mice when compared with wild-type or heterozygous littermates (Fig. 1A). A histological study of the skin structure at the time of weaning (day 28 post-partum) revealed invaginations of the epithelium in the dermis and broken hair shafts (Fig. 1B). These invaginations were observed in the skin of both wild-type and knock-out mice, suggesting that they may result from over-grooming. The repetitive licking by the mother may have caused a weakening of the hair shaft and its rupture within the follicle sheath. Animals of both genotypes eventually recovered normal skin and follicular structures, although at a different pace, as demonstrated by histological studies of the skin 15 days post-weaning (Fig. 1C). The hair follicles had developed and the epidermis was reconstituted, as invaginations were no longer visible in both types of skins. At this time, wild-type mouse follicles had already reached the telogen phase, characterized by thinner and shorter follicles, whereas the follicles of NFI-C-deficient mice were still in anagen phase, as follicles were well developed and the bulbs resided in the deep subcutis. Thus, NFI-C−/− mice showed a delay in the follicle growth and formation of the new hair shaft, suggesting a role for NFI-C in hair follicle regeneration. To avoid potential side effects of over-grooming and to ascertain the involvement of NFI-C in the growth of normally structured follicles, we used the depilation-induced hair follicle cycling model. This consists of hair removal by the plucking of all hair shafts from the back of 23-day-old mice, which has been shown to induce homogenous and synchronized transition from the first telogen phase to anagen over the entire depilated skin area (14Müller-Röver S.

Eight days after plucking, the depilated skin areas of control mice were gray, indicating melanization, whereas those of mutant mice were pink (Fig. 2A). No difference was noted when comparing wild-type and heterozygous mice (data not shown). In mouse skin, melanin production depends on the progression to anagen phase, as it is mainly synthesized by the melanocytes within the growing hair bulb (16Budd P.S. Antoniou J. Mellor A.L. Jackson I.J. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The hair cycle was delayed but not abolished in knock-out animals, as they showed a similar gray coloration 2–3 days later (data not shown). Knock-out animals eventually recovered their entire fur in the depilated area with no difference in structure, size, and number of the new hair follicles as compared with wild-type mice (data not shown). This confirmed a hair growth delay of NFI-C−/− mice independently of over-grooming. To identify the delayed hair follicle cycle stage, we next performed hematoxylin-eosin staining of skin biopsy sections collected during the first 8 days after plucking. The first differences in follicle growth could be observed at day 4 post-depilation when comparing NFI-C-expressing and homozygous knock-out mice (Fig. 2B). Although wild-type follicles reached anagen III, the stage at which new bulbs reach the border between the dermis and hypodermis (14Müller-Röver S. Handjiski B. van der Veen C. Eichmüller S. Foitzik K. McKay I.A. Stenn K.S. Paus R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 3-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), knock-out follicles were still in telogen or just entering anagen (Fig. 2B). This result suggested that it is the hair cycle initiation step that is delayed in NFI-C-null mice. As this might result from the increased inflammation reaction induced by plucking (34Argyris T.S. Adv. Morphog. 1968; 7: 1-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the spontaneous hair growth at anagen 28 days post-partum. Although the hair follicle cycle generally depends on the genetic background, sex, environment, and nutritional factors, morphogenesis as well as the first postnatal cycle (catagen, telogen, and anagen) follow a rather precise and synchronized time-scale. As for the plucking-induced anagen experiments, a delayed spontaneous growth was observed in knock-out animals, implying again an inefficient onset of the anagen phase (Fig. 2C). At day 28 post-partum, the wild-type mouse follicles followed a normal cycle course and transition to the anagen phase, whereas knock-out mouse follicles were still in telogen and exhibited a thinner skin. These findings indicated that there is a general delay of the telogen to anagen phase transition in knock-out mice that occurs independently of the hair removal procedure. To assess whether cycle retardation may result from a general defect in hair morphogenesis, we performed hematoxylin-eosin staining of skin sections collected at day 2.5, 4, 6, and 9 post-partum from NFI-C-deficient and wild-type mice. Interestingly, no difference in follicular morphogenesis was observed between the two genotypes (data not shown), indicating that follicle development per se is not affected by the lack of NFI-C. Overall, these findings indicate that the retarded hair growth observed in knock-out animals resulted from a delayed step during or preceding the initiation of anagen. The successive increase and decrease of follicular length during the hair cycle is accompanied by drastic changes in protein levels, which can be used to distinguish specific stages of the cycle. To further examine the hair growth delay in NFI-C−/− animals, we performed immunostaining of P-cadherin, a cell-cell adhesion molecule expressed in a subset of follicular cells. P-cadherin was present in the ORS and in keratinocytes of the developing hair matrix (DHM) but not in the IRS and DP of wild-type animals at day 4 post-depilation (Fig. 3A), as expected from Müller-Röver et al. (35Müller-Röver S. Tokura Y. Welker P. Furukawa F. Wakita H. Takigawa M. Paus R. Exp. Dermatol. 1999; 8: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, P-cadherin was only detected in the secondary hair germ in knock-out littermates. Thus, knock-out mouse hair follicles are delayed at an early step of anagen, whereas the wild-type follicle cycle follows a normal timing. GGT is a metabolic enzyme that contributes to the transfer of γ-glutamyl groups on peptides and l-amino acids (36Cameron R. Kellen J. Kolin A. Malkin A. Farber E. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 823-829PubMed Google Scholar, 37De Young L.M. Richards W.L. Bonzelet W. Tsai L.L. Boutwell R.K. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3697-3701PubMed Google Scholar). In healthy skin GGT activity is present exclusively in the ORS and IRS of the hair follicle during anagen, whereas it is absent from the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. GGT activity increases during anagen and gradually regresses in catagen to reach undetectable levels in telogen, providing a reliable indicator of the cycle progression after plucking (38Kawabe T.T. Kubicek M.F. Johnson G.A. Buhl A.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 122-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type depilated mice exhibited normal hair follicle cycle timing as detected from the GGT activity, whereas that of NFI-C−/− mice followed a similar profile but reached a maximum ∼2 days after their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 3B). The expression and localization of alkaline phosphatase are also hair cycle-dependent, as the DP displays elevated activity during the entire hair cycle, whereas the ORS expresses this protein during late anagen and catagen (39Handjiski B.K. Eichmüller S. Hofmann U. Czarnetzki B.M. Paus R. Br. J. Dermatol. 1994; 131: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, the alkaline phosphatase activity was measured to investigate if the follicular cycling delay also occurred at the end of the cycle. As expected, a high activity was observed in the DP of both genotypes. However, alkaline phosphatase activity was only observed in the ORS of knock-out follicles (Fig. 3C). Although NFI-C-deficient follicles were in catagen, normal follicles were finishing the cycle and entering telogen, as the apoptotic strand of keratinocytes had lost staining for alkaline phosphatase and dermal papi"
https://openalex.org/W1972523077,"Cell fate decision remarkably generates specific cell differentiation path among the multiple possibilities that can arise through the complex interplay of high-dimensional genome activities. The coordinated action of thousands of genes to switch cell fate decision has indicated the existence of stable attractors guiding the process. However, origins of the intracellular mechanisms that create ""cellular attractor"" still remain unknown. Here, we examined the collective behavior of genome-wide expressions for neutrophil differentiation through two different stimuli, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA). To overcome the difficulties of dealing with single gene expression noises, we grouped genes into ensembles and analyzed their expression dynamics in correlation space defined by Pearson correlation and mutual information. The standard deviation of correlation distributions of gene ensembles reduces when the ensemble size is increased following the inverse square root law, for both ensembles chosen randomly from whole genome and ranked according to expression variances across time. Choosing the ensemble size of 200 genes, we show the two probability distributions of correlations of randomly selected genes for atRA and DMSO responses overlapped after 48 hours, defining the neutrophil attractor. Next, tracking the ranked ensembles' trajectories, we noticed that only certain, not all, fall into the attractor in a fractal-like manner. The removal of these genome elements from the whole genomes, for both atRA and DMSO responses, destroys the attractor providing evidence for the existence of specific genome elements (named ""genome vehicle"") responsible for the neutrophil attractor. Notably, within the genome vehicles, genes with low or moderate expression changes, which are often considered noisy and insignificant, are essential components for the creation of the neutrophil attractor. Further investigations along with our findings might provide a comprehensive mechanistic view of cell fate decision."
https://openalex.org/W2008298886,"The regulation and function of lysosomal hydrolases during yolk consumption and embryogenesis in zebrafish are poorly understood. In an effort to better define the lysosomal biochemistry of this organism, we analyzed the developmental expression, biochemical properties, and function of several glycosidases in zebrafish eggs, embryos, and adult tissues. Our results demonstrated that the specific activity of most enzymes increases during embryogenesis, likely reflecting a greater need for turnover within the embryo as yolk-derived nutrients are depleted. Analysis of glycosidase activity in zebrafish and medaka eggs revealed selective deposition of enzymes required for the degradation of N-linked glycans, including an abundance of acidic mannosidases. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with the α-mannosidase inhibitor swainsonine resulted in the accumulation of glycosylated vitellogenin fragments and demonstrated a function for maternally deposited acid α-mannosidase in yolk consumption. Surprisingly, we also found that, unlike mammals, acid α-glucosidase from zebrafish and medaka does not appear to be modified with mannose 6-phosphate residues. We further showed these residues were not acquired on human acid α-glucosidase when expressed in zebrafish embryos, suggesting unique differences in the ability of the human and zebrafish N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase to recognize and modify certain lysosomal glycosidases. Together, these results provide novel insight into the role of acidic glycosidases during yolk utilization and the evolution of the mannose 6-phosphate targeting system in vertebrates.

Together, these results provide novel insight into the role of acidic glycosidases during yolk utilization and the evolution of the mannose 6-phosphate targeting system in vertebrates. Lysosomal catabolism and the subsequent recycling and utilization of metabolites are critical for many biological processes, as highlighted by the serious consequences to human and animal health when these functions are disrupted (1Futerman A.H. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 2Hemsley K.M. Hopwood J.J. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2010; 33: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Degradation of macromolecules by lysosomal hydrolases is also essential for the utilization of the yolk during embryogenesis in fish, insects, and amphibians. Freshwater fish embryos such as zebrafish and medaka rely on the contents of their yolk cell as the primary source of amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid building blocks throughout their early development. The cytoplasm of this yolk cell contains glycogen and protein granules, the latter of which is composed mainly of the yolk glycophosphoprotein, vitellogenin (Vtg). 2The abbreviations used are: VtgvitellogeninCI-MPRcation-independent mannose 6-phosphate4-MU4-methylumbelliferylConAconcanavalin AMan-6-Pmannose 6-phosphateEndo Hendoglycosidase Hdpfdays post-fertilization. This large multidomain protein is synthesized by the maternal liver, secreted into the bloodstream, internalized by the growing oocyte via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and then stored in specialized organelles, the yolk granules (yolk platelets) (3Opresko L.K.

In addition to vitellogenin, several other complex sialoglycoproteins and glycolipids have been characterized in the eggs of aquatic species, although their biological roles are not yet fully understood (6Kitajima K.

Yolk granules and lysosomes share many common features; their intralumenal pH is tightly regulated, and they both appear to house all the hydrolytic enzymes necessary for the complete breakdown of their contents (8Fagotto F. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3645-3647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the constitutive activity of lysosomes, temporal regulation of yolk consumption is necessary to supply nutrients in a measured fashion to the developing tissues of the embryo and to ensure survival until it is capable of independent feeding. Several mechanisms of controlling yolk utilization have been described, including the regulation of pH within the yolk granules, fusion of granules with lysosomes, and enzymatic latency of the hydrolytic enzymes (8Fagotto F. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3645-3647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fagotto F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 125: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Komazaki S. Hiruma T. Dev.

Two endoglycosidases capable of removing N-linked oligosaccharides at distinct developmental stages have been identified in medaka (16Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22110-22114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Seko A. Kitajima K. Iwamatsu T. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the presence of acid glycosidases within the yolk has been reported in Xenopus laevis eggs (18Wall D.A. Meleka I. J. Cell. Biol. 1985; 101: 1651-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Jorgensen P. Steen J.A. Steen H. Kirschner M.W. Development. 2009; 136: 1539-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In both cases, however, the contribution of these glycosidases in the utilization of yolk granules or in the regulation of specific processes during oogenesis and/or embryogenesis has not been determined (18Wall D.A.

Development. 2009; 136: 1539-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The catabolism of the glycans present on vitellogenin and other yolk-deposited molecules may serve as a source of carbohydrate for the developing embryo. Thus, understanding the developmental expression and biochemical properties of lysosomal glycosidases in the zebrafish yolk as well as the embryo represents an essential consideration for the development and subsequent interpretation of metabolic disease models within this organism, including emerging models of glycosylation-related disorders (20Moro E. Tomanin R. Friso A. Modena N. Tiso N. Scarpa M. Argenton F. Matrix Biol. 2010; 29: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Flanagan-Steet H. Sias C. Steet R. Am. J.

To elucidate the developmental expression and physiological significance of glycosidases, we investigated the deposition, post-translational modification, and function of these enzymes in the eggs and embryos of two common fish species, Danio rerio (zebrafish) and Oryzias latipes (Japanese medaka). Our results revealed that certain glycosidases are selectively deposited within the zebrafish and medaka yolk. In addition, we described a role for one hydrolase, α-mannosidase, in the end degradation and glycan trimming of glycosylated vitellogenin fragments. Furthermore, we uncovered a surprising lack of mannose phosphorylation on acid α-glucosidase in zebrafish and medaka. Together, these data provide new insight into the biological role of zebrafish glycosidases during yolk consumption and the evolution of the mannose 6-phosphate targeting pathway in vertebrates. Swainsonine was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK); the anti-vitellogenin monoclonal antibody (clone JE-10D4) was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), and the X-gal substrate was obtained from Sigma. The HPC4 affinity matrix was from Roche Applied Science. The 4-methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrates were also from Sigma, with the exception of the 4-MU α-iduropyranoside, 4-MU α-mannopyranoside, and 4-MU β-galactopyranoside that were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Biotinylated ConA was from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Wild type zebrafish were from Fish 2U (Gibsonton, FL), and wild type medaka (CAB strain) were obtained from the University of Georgia Aquatic Biotechnology and Environmental Laboratory. Both were maintained using standard protocols. For analysis of embryonic glycosidases, zebrafish embryos were dechorionated, if necessary, anesthetized with Tricaine, and deyolked by multiple passages through a glass Pasteur pipette. Lysates were prepared in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, with 1% Triton X-100 by brief sonication on ice and subjected to centrifugation (3500 × g, 10 min). For analysis of egg and yolk glycosidases, individual yolks were directly aspirated into a pipette tip and solubilized in sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, with 0.5% Triton X-100. Fertilized and unfertilized eggs were collected, disrupted by brief sonication in citrate buffer, and centrifuged to remove broken chorions. Protein concentration was determined using a micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and aliquots were normalized for equivalent protein concentration. Activity of lysosomal glycosidases was measured using the following fluorescent substrates: 4-MU β-galactopyranoside (for β-galactosidase), 4-MU α-galactopyranoside (for α-galactosidase), 4-MU β-glucuronide (for β-glucuronidase), 4-MU β-N-acetylglucosaminide (for β-hexosaminidase), 4-MU α-mannopyranoside (for acid and neutral α-mannosidase), 4-MU β-mannopyranoside (for β-mannosidase), 4-MU α-iduropyranoside (for α-iduronidase), 4-MU α-glucopyranoside (for acid and neutral α-glucosidase), and 4-MU β-glucopyranoside (for acid β-glucosidase). Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity was measured in the presence of 100 mm sodium tartrate using 4-MU phosphate as a substrate. All substrates were prepared in 50 mm sodium citrate or 100 mm sodium acetate reaction buffers, pH 4.5, with 0.5% Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 3 mm except for 4-MU α-iduropyranoside, which was prepared in formate buffer, pH 3.5, to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Reactions were incubated for 3–16 h at 37 °C and quenched with 0.2 m sodium carbonate buffer, and the fluorescence of 4-methylumbelliferone was measured using a Turner 380 fluorometer. Specific activity was expressed as nanomoles of substrate cleaved (proportional to the fluorescence units read) per h per mg of total protein. Lysates were fractionated using either a Man-6-P receptor affinity column as described previously (21Flanagan-Steet H. Sias C. Steet R. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 175: 2063-2075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Lee W.S. Payne B.J. Gelfman C.M. Vogel P. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27198-27203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or a ConA lectin affinity column. The ConA lectin column was eluted sequentially with 10 mm α-methylglucoside and 100 mm α-methylmannoside in column buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2). Activity of lysosomal enzymes was measured in each column fraction using appropriate fluorescent substrate activity. Reactions were performed in 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.5, 0.5% Triton X-100 containing 3 mm of the respective substrates. The percentage of bound activity relative to total activity recovered from three independent experiments is shown. For activity analysis in situ, zebrafish embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature or at 4 °C overnight, washed (three times for 10 min with PBS, pH 7.4), and then washed again (three times for 15 min) with PBS, pH 6.0. Embryos were stained with 1 mg/ml X-gal in PBS, pH 6.0, containing 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 2 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C overnight. The embryos were photographed on an Olympus SZ-16 dissecting microscope fitted with a CCD camera. Yolk lysates were resolved by 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and either probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody (JE-10D4) against zebrafish vitellogenin (1:1000 dilution) or stained directly with Coomassie Blue as vitellogenin isoforms typically represent ∼90% of the total protein in the yolk (19Jorgensen P. Steen J.A. Steen H. Kirschner M.W. Development. 2009; 136: 1539-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In some experiments, lysates were treated with 10 units of Endo H in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer overnight at 37 °C prior to electrophoresis. ConA lectin blotting was performed by incubation of transferred proteins with 10 μg/ml biotinylated ConA lectin in 3% BSA for 1 h followed by extensive washing with PBS-T. Blots were then incubated with streptavidin-linked HRP, and bands were detected with standard ECL reagents. The plasmid carrying full-length human acid α-glucosidase tagged with HPC4 epitope at the N terminus was linearized with NotI, and in vitro transcription was performed with T7 promoter by using mRNA Machine kit (GE Healthcare). 200 pg of RNA was injected into zebrafish embryos at the one-cell stage. Deyolked embryos were collected at 30 h after injection and subjected to analysis using the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate (CI-MPR) affinity column. For HPC4 immunoprecipitation experiments, the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science) were followed. A total of 80 RNA-injected embryos at 30 h post-fertilization were deyolked, lysed in the 500 μl of lysis buffer by brief sonication, and cleared by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of anti-protein C affinity matrix at 4 °C with slow rotation for 3 h. The matrix was rinsed three times and eluted with 200 μl of elution buffer without calcium. Aliquots of supernatant and eluted protein were assayed directly for acid α-glucosidase and β-galactosidase activity or subjected to Western blot analysis to assess efficiency of immunoprecipitation. The anti-human acid α-glucosidase monoclonal antibody was used at a 1:2500 dilution and the anti-HPC4 antibody at a 1:500 dilution. The blocking process was performed in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. For inhibitor studies in living zebrafish embryos, 5 mm swainsonine was injected into the chorion of fresh laid eggs to increase inhibitor uptake, and the embryos were subsequently incubated in fish medium containing 20 μm swainsonine for 30 h. Embryos were then extensively rinsed in fish medium to remove any residual inhibitor prior to yolk collection, lysate preparation, and α-mannosidase activity assays. We achieved roughly 70% inhibition of α-mannosidase in activity assays when swainsonine was injected into the chorion. Fluorescence-based assays were used to determine the activity of several lysosomal glycosidases during the first 7 days of development. We chose lysosomal glycosidases that represent various types of macromolecule degradation as follows: glycoprotein (α-mannosidase, β-galactosidase, and β-hexosaminidase), glycosaminoglycan (α-iduronidase and β-glucuronidase), and glycogen (acid α-glucosidase). β-Galactosidase and β-hexosaminidase also play a role in the degradation of specific types of glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids. Zebrafish embryos were collected and deyolked to remove contamination by maternally deposited hydrolases, and acidic activity was measured in protein-normalized embryo lysates. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 1. The activity of most of the glycosidases rose steadily throughout the first 5 days of development. The increase in α-mannosidase activity was somewhat slower than β-galactosidase and β-hexosaminidase; however, at 7 days post-fertilization (dpf), the relative percent increase of activity was comparable. Relative to the other enzymes, low activity of both α-iduronidase and β-glucuronidase was observed at early developmental time points, but this activity rose substantially from 1 to 4 dpf before reaching a plateau at 5 dpf. The activity for glycogen-degrading acid α-glucosidase remained fairly constant during the 1st week of development, possibly reflecting the necessity for glycogen utilization in the muscle of the embryo throughout its early development. The expression of one of these lysosomal glycosidases, β-galactosidase (zGLB1), was investigated by in situ hybridization, RT-PCR, and colorimetric activity analyses. RT-PCR analysis revealed a constant level of zGLB1 transcripts throughout the first 5 days of development, and our in situ hybridization experiments showed that the majority of zGLB1 expression was present in the brain (data not shown). Staining for β-galactosidase activity with X-gal was undetectable in the embryo at the 4-cell stage but was evident by 3 dpf, particularly in the head region (Fig. 2, top panels). Conversely, substantial X-gal staining was visible within the yolk in 4-cell stage embryos, indicating that β-galactosidase is deposited in an active form in the developing yolk cell. We next analyzed dissociated yolk cells from 4-cell stage and 3 dpf embryos by light microscopy following X-gal staining. As noted in Fig. 2, activation of β-galactosidase activity at early stages appears to be a granule-specific phenomenon, with some granules exhibiting strong X-gal staining, although others remain clear and crystalline in appearance. By 3 dpf, however, most of the yolk granules are X-gal-positive, indicating progressive activation. In an effort to determine the specificity of enzyme deposition, we measured the activity of several glycosidases in zebrafish- and medaka-fertilized eggs. To minimize any contribution of enzymes from the developing zygotes, activity was measured in yolk lysates prepared from eggs not more than 1 h post-fertilization. These results shown in Fig. 3 show selective deposition of glycosidases in the yolk of both organisms, with α-mannosidase and β-mannosidase activity representing the highest specific activity in zebrafish and medaka yolk, respectively. The specific activity of some egg-deposited enzymes differed substantially when compared with the specific activity within early embryos. For example, only minimal β-hexosaminidase activity could be detected within zebrafish eggs, but this activity was among the highest measured in the embryo. The higher overall specific activity of most glycosidases in zebrafish compared with medaka appears to be a function of greater enzyme deposition (as opposed to lower total protein content) because equivalent concentrations of protein per egg were measured. The activity of β-galactosidase was readily detected in the yolk of both fish species and was present at higher levels than the glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes, α-iduronidase and β-glucuronidase. Although very little acid β-glucosidase activity could be measured in either species, acid α-glucosidase activity was also abundantly present in zebrafish and medaka eggs, a finding consistent with the presence of glycogen granules in the yolk. Collectively, these data demonstrate that lysosomal mannosidases and other glycosidases necessary for N-glycan catabolism are abundantly deposited into zebrafish yolks and are generally present at much higher specific activities when compared with medaka yolks. In addition to lysosomal α-mannosidase, which functions optimally at low pH, most mammalian cells also contain neutral mannosidases such as Golgi α-mannosidase and cytosolic α-mannosidase that are involved in N-glycan processing and the disposal of free N-glycans, respectively. In light of the fact that we detected such high levels of overall α-mannosidase activity in zebrafish eggs, we assayed egg and brain lysates across a pH range to estimate the potential contribution of neutral α-mannosidases. As shown in Fig. 4, only acidic α-mannosidase activity could be detected in zebrafish eggs, suggesting that neutral α-mannosidases are not present in the yolk cell. The pH profile of α-mannosidase activity in zebrafish brain demonstrated peaks at both acidic and neutral pH that likely indicates the presence of lysosomal α-mannosidase as well as cytosolic/Golgi α-mannosidases. We also analyzed α-glucosidase activities and found that both zebrafish and medaka contain both acidic and neutral α-glucosidase activity within the yolk and brain (data not shown). Together, these findings demonstrate that acidic α-mannosidase represents the majority of α-mannosidase activity in zebrafish eggs. Although most mammalian lysosomal glycosidases are mannose-phosphorylated, the extent to which zebrafish glycosidases are Man-6-P-modified has not been fully characterized. To address this question, we fractionated zebrafish egg and adult brain lysates using a CI-MPR affinity chromatography column and analyzed the relative activity of several glycosidases in unbound and Man-6-P-eluted fractions. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 5A. Consistent with our earlier experiments on whole zebrafish embryos, 15–20% of the acidic β-galactosidase, α-galactosidase, and α-mannosidase activity in brain lysates was shown to bind to the CI-MPR affinity column (21Flanagan-Steet H. Sias C. Steet R. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 175: 2063-2075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The percent of Man-6-P-modified activity, however, was considerably higher in the yolk lysates compared with the brain, with the majority of α-mannosidase (57%), β-galactosidase (54%), and α-galactosidase (78%) activity bound to the column. Surprisingly, all of the acid α-glucosidase activity from both sources was found exclusively in the unbound fractions. When fractionated using a ConA affinity column, nearly 55% of the acid α-glucosidase activity was found in either the flow-through fractions or those eluted with 10 mm α-methylglucoside. This indicates that the majority of enzyme is modified with only highly branched complex-type N-glycans, an indication that Man-6-P residues were never added to these glycans. The lack of mannose phosphorylation on acid α-glucosidase was also noted in medaka brains and yolk, demonstrating that this phenomenon is observed in other fish species (Table 1). By comparison, 24% of the acid α-glucosidase activity from feline brain, 51% of mouse brain activity, and 31% of the recombinant enzyme (MyozymeTM) were found to be mannose-phosphorylated. In an effort to rule out the possibility that a low level of mannose phosphorylation on acid α-glucosidase was removed upon fertilization, we also analyzed unfertilized egg lysates on the CI-MPR affinity column, but again we failed to detect any measurable level of bound activity (Table 1).TABLE 1Mannose phosphorylation of acid α-glucosidase in fish and mammalian tissuesEnzyme source% Man-6-P-modified activityα-Gluβ-GalZebrafish egg (fertilized)<0.154 ± 3Zebrafish egg (unfertilized)<0.148 ± 7Zebrafish brain<0.116 ± 5Medaka egg<0.160 ± 6Medaka brain<0.121 ± 4Feline brain24 ± 763 ± 7Mouse brain5177MyozymeTM31NAHuman acid α-glucosidase expressed in zebrafish<0.1NA Open table in a new tab The mannose phosphorylation of lysosomal hydrolases depends on their ability to bind to GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, the enzyme that initiates Man-6-P biosynthesis. To determine whether the lack of Man-6-P residues on acid α-glucosidase reflected differences between the mammalian and zebrafish protein, we next asked whether human acid α-glucosidase, a protein that has been demonstrated to be mannose-phosphorylated, was capable of being modified by zebrafish phosphotransferase. Human acid α-glucosidase tagged with HPC4 was injected into one-cell stage embryos, and embryos were collected at 2 dpf and analyzed for expression by activity assays and Western blots. We achieved 30–50% increase over the endogenous level of acid α-glucosidase activity in these embryos. Expression of the human enzyme was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and detection using a monoclonal antibody against human acid α-glucosidase (Fig. 5B). Whole embryo lysates were also fractionated on an anti-HPC4 affinity column followed by analysis of unbound and bound aliquots using the mouse monoclonal antibody or anti-HPC4 antisera. We detected only the 110-kDa form of human acid α-glucosidase, because further processing of this enzyme results in loss of the N-terminal HPC4 tag. Although acid α-glucosidase activity was readily measured in HPC4-bound fractions, no β-galactosidase activity could be immunoprecipitated demonstrating the specificity of this method. To gauge whether the human enzyme was modified with Man-6-P residues in zebrafish, control and injected embryo lysates were fractionated on a CI-MPR affinity column, and activity was measured in unbound and bound aliquots. As with endogenous zebrafish acid α-glucosidase, the overexpressed activity was below the limit of detection in any of the Man-6-P-eluted fractions, suggesting that the human enzyme is unable to become Man-6-P-modified by zebrafish phosphotransferase (Table 1). The major protein deposited in the zebrafish yolk is vitellogenin, a large multidomain glycoprotein that is synthesized in the maternal liver, taken up into the ovaries from the serum, and packaged into yolk granules during oogenesis. The organization of zebrafish Vtg domains and the position of potential N-glycosylation sites are depicted in Fig. 6A. The full-length Vtg is proteolytically processed during oogenesis and embryonic development into smaller fragments that can be detected using either Coomassie staining or Western blot analysis with an anti-Vtg monoclonal antibody (Fig. 6B). Although this antibody can detect 160-kDa full-length Vtg, it does not appear to recognize the 110-kDa lipovitellin heavy chain subdomain, leading us to believe that the epitope lies within the C-terminal portion of the protein. Based on the predicted molecular masses of known zebrafish Vtg domains and its apparent specificity for C-terminal fragments, the subdomains detected by Western blot with the anti-Vtg antibody (see Fig. 5E) most likely represent the light chain vitellin or lipovitellin light chain (∼30 kDa) and von Willebrand factor-like subdomains, β′ and CT (17 and 13 kDa, respectively) (23Finn R.N. Biol. Reprod. 2007; 76: 926-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the various Vtg isoforms in zebrafish demonstrated the presence of several potential N-linked glycan sites within these C-terminal Vtg domains. Glycomic analyses of vitellogenin in other species have indicated that Vtg precursors typically bear high mannose-type N-glycans (24Roth Z. Parnes S. Wiel S. Sagi A. Zmora N. Chung J.S. Khalaila I. Glycoconj. J. 2010; 27: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Wojchowski D.M. Parsons P. Nordin J.H. Kunkel J.G. Dev. Biol. 1986; 116: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To confirm the presence of high mannose N-glycans on zebrafish Vtg, we performed Coomassie stains and ConA lectin blots on control and Endo H-treated yolk lysates. As shown in Fig. 6C, the 13-kDa band shifted lower upon Endo H treatment, and mobility shifts in additional higher molecular weight bands could also be detected. Consistent with this finding, some of these low molecular weight bands were also reactive to the ConA lectin in control lysates (Fig. 6D). Upon Endo H treatment, the 50- and 13-kDa bands disappeared, suggesting that these Vtg fragments were modified by high mannose glycans. Thus, the glycosylated fragments we detected most likely correspond to the C-terminal domains of zebrafish Vtg. Since the breakdown of high mannose N-glycans in the lysosomal compartment requires the action of acidic α-mannosidase, we postulated that the abundant deposition of this glycosidase in the zebrafish yolk serves to facilitate the utilization of Vtg during embryogenesis. To investigate this possibility, we treated embryos with the α-mannosidase inhibitor swainsonine and monitored the effects on the processing of zebrafish Vtg by Western blot analysis of yolk lysates. We first showed that swainsonine was able to potently inhibit zebrafish α-mannosidase activity using in vitro assays (>98% inhibition at 2 μm). Because in situ inhibition of α-mannosidase activity could not be performed due to the lack of an appropriate colorimetric α-mannosidase substrate, swainsonine uptake and in vivo inhibition of α-mannosidase activity (up to 70%) was indirectly assessed in embryos incubated with this inhibitor (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Swainsonine treatment was not toxic to the embryos nor did it appear to alter early development, even after exposure for up to 7 days at high concentrations (100 μm). Accumulation of the 17-kDa Vtg fragment in the swainsonine-treated yolks and greater heterogeneity of the glycosylated 13-kDa band could be detected by Western blot in 2 dpf yolk samples (Fig. 6E, see asterisks). Furthermore, higher levels of the 13-kDa band could easily be detected at 3 dpf. The relative amount of larger Vtg fragments in the swainsonine-treated samples was not altered, suggesting that α-mannosidase contributes to glycan trimming and end degradation of Vtg fragments but is not required for the initial steps in the digestion of this protein. In this study, we undertook a characterization of the activity and biochemical properties of multiple glycosidases in zebrafish embryos and eggs and explored the function of these enzymes during embryogenesis. Our results demonstrated selective yolk deposition and mannose phosphorylation of these enzymes and suggest a role for acid α-mannosidase in the utilization of yolk glycoproteins. With regard to the developing embryo, we generally observed increasing activity of all the glycosidases tested throughout the first 5 days, at which time most of these activities either reached a plateau or began to decrease. The increased expression and activity of glycosidases within the embryo may reflect the need for greater turnover of glycosylated molecules in the embryo itself as the availability of nutrients from the yolk becomes depleted. Alternatively, up-regulation of glycosidase activity in the embryo could also be due to the differentiation or proliferation of specific cell types (such as chondrocytes) that express high levels of these enzymes. Selective deposition of glycosidases within the yolk appears to be a common feature of both medaka and zebrafish, although there are interesting differences between these species, with regard to the specific activity of these enzymes within the yolk. Although both species deposit high levels of mannosidases in the yolk, the ratio of β-mannosidase and α-mannosidase is variable, and the overall specific activity of these and other glycosidases was considerably higher in zebrafish when compared with medaka. Furthermore, the specific activity of the glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes, β-glucuronidase and α-iduronidase, as well as the glycolipid-degrading acid β-glucosidase, was significantly lower compared with β-galactosidase and α-mannosidase. These observations may reflect variations in the composition of yolk glycoproteins or the general structure of glycans in these systems. The low specific activity of the glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes, β-glucuronidase and α-iduronidase, is somewhat surprising because substantial sulfatase activity in the zebrafish yolk has been reported previously (20Moro E. Tomanin R. Friso A. Modena N. Tiso N. Scarpa M. Argenton F. Matrix Biol. 2010; 29: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for glycosidase deposition is not well understood, but it does not appear to be mediated exclusively by the mannose 6-phosphate targeting system because certain enzymes that lack these residues, such as acid α-glucosidase, are abundantly present within the yolk. It is possible that these enzymes interact directly with the yolk components that they will eventually degrade once activation of the yolk granules occurs. Indeed, vitellogenin contains multiple domains that are known to facilitate the binding of lipids and other molecules, including proteases (23Finn R.N. Biol. Reprod. 2007; 76: 926-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The basis for greater specific activity of the glycosidases in zebrafish, in particular the strikingly high deposition of acid α-mannosidase, is also not clear, but it does not depend on lower overall protein concentration in the zebrafish eggs because both species contain roughly equal protein content per fertilized egg. Medaka embryos develop slower when compared with zebrafish, whose development and utilization of the yolk by comparison are rapid. This necessity for rapid uptake of nutrients during zebrafish embryogenesis may therefore require a higher hydrolytic capacity compared with medaka. A more detailed characterization of the glycoprotein composition within the medaka and zebrafish yolk may highlight the basis for this selective glycosidase deposition. Our findings strongly indicate a lack of mannose phosphorylation on acid α-glucosidase in all zebrafish and medaka tissues studied, including the yolk cell where levels of Man-6-P-modified glycosidases were found to be the highest. Because there was a fraction of acid α-glucosidase activity still capable of binding the mannose-specific lectin ConA, we cannot rule out the possibility that some zebrafish enzyme is modified to a low level by Man-6-P residues during biosynthesis and that these residues are subject to rapid removal within activated yolk granules. Although the zebrafish genome appears to contain all of the components of the Man-6-P targeting pathway (including subunits of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase and both mannose 6-phosphate receptors), these data suggest that acid α-glucosidase and possibly other glycosidases did not evolve to be high affinity substrates for GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase in zebrafish. Interestingly, we were unable to achieve mannose phosphorylation of human acid α-glucosidase expressed in zebrafish embryos, suggesting that efficient mannose phosphorylation of acid α-glucosidase in higher vertebrates may have involved evolution of specific amino acids within the glycosidase as well as phosphotransferase. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of human and zebrafish acid α-glucosidase shows less sequence identity than other lysosomal glycosidases such as β-galactosidase and α-mannosidase, both of which exhibit high mannose phosphorylation levels. Although acid α-glucosidase lacks Man-6-P residues, its apparent optimal activity at low pH indicates that it functions within an acidic compartment (i.e. lysosomes). Thus, this enzyme likely relies on an ancestral method of transport to reach the lysosomal compartment in zebrafish and for its deposition into the yolk. Studies to determine the evolutionary node for the mannose phosphorylation of acid α-glucosidase in vertebrates are underway and should provide new insight into the development of the Man-6-P targeting pathway within the vertebrate lineage. Our findings point to a likely role for acid α-mannosidase in the degradation of glycosylated Vtg fragments bearing high mannose-type N-glycans. We observed a clear difference in the profile of Vtg fragments upon swainsonine treatment despite the fact complete in vivo inhibition of acid α-mannosidase was not achieved. On a molecular level, the accumulation of the glycosylated fragments suggests that efficient removal of the glycans may be necessary for the final catabolism of these peptides. It is uncertain whether the sugars liberated from the catabolism of Vtg N-glycans are subsequently used to synthesize N-glycan precursors in the embryo or yolk cell. The fact that swainsonine treatment did not result in any noticeable development defects in zebrafish embryos might reflect the fact that incomplete inhibition of α-mannosidase was achieved or that glucose, not mannose, is the primary source of key glycosylation precursors in the yolk cell. Understanding the balance of monosaccharide utilization in the zebrafish yolk and embryo as well as the metabolic regulation of other precursor molecules such as lipids will no doubt be necessary to aid in the interpretation of disease models that are being developed in this versatile organism. Although clearly localized to the yolk granule, the biological function of β-galactosidase with the yolk and its potential catabolic targets is not known. A wide range of carbohydrate-binding proteins, including galactose-specific lectins, are deposited in high concentrations in animal yolk cells, and robust staining with these lectins have been detected in a spatial and temporal manner during oogenesis and post-fertilization development (26Vasta G.R. Ahmed H. Du S. Henrikson D. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 503-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Lehmann F. Gäthje H. Kelm S. Dietz F.

Thus, a requirement for removal of terminal galactose residues by β-galactosidase may serve an important role in the release of yolk membranes or the down-regulation of specific epitopes during these processes. Assessing the function of these abundant glycosidases and how they impact oogenesis and embryonic development represent an important consideration for future investigation.

To date six glycosyltransferases for chondroitin synthesis have been identified, and the complex of chondroitin sulfate synthase-1 (CSS1)/chondroitin synthase-1 (ChSy-1) and chondroitin sulfate synthase-2 (CSS2)/chondroitin polymerizing factor is assumed to play a major role in CS biosynthesis. We found an alternative splice variant of mouse CSS2 in a data base that lacks the N-terminal transmembrane domain, contrasting to the original CSS2. Here, we investigated the roles of CSS2 variants. Both the original enzyme and the splice variant, designated CSS2A and CSS2B, respectively, were expressed at different levels and ratios in tissues. Western blot analysis of cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts confirmed that both enzymes were actually synthesized as proteins and were localized in both the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Pulldown assays revealed that either of CSS2A, CSS2B, and CSS1/ChSy-1 heterogeneously and homogeneously interacts with each other, suggesting that they form a complex of multimers. In vitro glycosyltransferase assays demonstrated a reduced glucuronyltransferase activity in CSS2B and no polymerizing activity in CSS2B co-expressed with CSS1, in contrast to CSS2A co-expressed with CSS1. Radiolabeling analysis of cultured COS-7 cells overexpressing each variant revealed that, whereas CSS2A facilitated CS biosynthesis, CSS2B inhibited it. Molecular modeling of CSS2A and CSS2B provided support for their properties. These findings, implicating regulation of CS chain polymerization by CSS2 variants, provide insight in elucidating the mechanisms of CS biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2032022637,"Collagen VI is an extracellular protein that most often contains the three genetically distinct polypeptide chains, α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI), although three recently identified chains, α4(VI), α5(VI), and α6(VI), may replace α3(VI) in some situations. Each chain has a triple helix flanked by N- and C-terminal globular domains that share homology with the von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domains. During biosynthesis, the three chains come together to form triple helical monomers, which then assemble into dimers and tetramers. Tetramers are secreted from the cell and align end-to-end to form microfibrils. The precise molecular mechanisms responsible for assembly are unclear. Mutations in the three collagen VI genes can disrupt collagen VI biosynthesis and matrix organization and are the cause of the inherited disorders Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. We have identified a Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy patient with compound heterozygous mutations in α2(VI). The first mutation causes skipping of exon 24, and the mRNA is degraded by nonsense-mediated decay. The second mutation is a two-amino acid deletion in the C1 VWA domain. Recombinant C1 domains containing the deletion are insoluble and retained intracellularly, indicating that the mutation has detrimental effects on domain folding and structure. Despite this, mutant α2(VI) chains retain the ability to associate into monomers, dimers, and tetramers. However, we show that secreted mutant tetramers containing structurally abnormal C1 VWA domains are unable to associate further into microfibrils, directly demonstrating the critical importance of a correctly folded α2(VI) C1 domain in microfibril formation."
https://openalex.org/W1967039891,"While much is known about the role of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in working memory (WM) deficits of schizophrenia, the nature of the relationship between cognitive components of WM and brain activation patterns remains unclear. We aimed to elucidate the neural correlates of the maintenance component of verbal WM by examining correct and error trials with event-related fMRI.Twelve schizophrenia patients (SZ) and thirteen healthy control participants (CO) performed a phonological delayed-matching-to-sample-task in which a memory set of three nonsense words was presented, followed by a 6-seconds delay after which a probe nonsense word appeared. Participants decided whether the probe matched one of the targets, and rated the confidence of their decision. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity during WM maintenance was analyzed in relation to performance (correct/error) and confidence ratings. Frontal and parietal regions exhibited increased activation on correct trials for both groups. Correct and error trials were further segregated into true memory, false memory, guess, and true error trials. True memory trials were associated with increased bilateral activation of frontal and parietal regions in both groups but only CO showed deactivation in PFC. There was very little maintenance-related cortical activity during guess trials. False memory was associated with increased left frontal and parietal activation in both groups.These findings suggest that a wider network of frontal and parietal regions support WM maintenance in correct trials compared with error trials in both groups. Furthermore, a more extensive and dynamic pattern of recruitment of the frontal and parietal networks for true memory was observed in healthy controls compared with schizophrenia patients. These results underscore the value of parsing the sources of memory errors in fMRI studies because of the non-linear nature of the brain-behavior relationship, and suggest that group comparisons need to be interpreted in more specific behavioral contexts."

Interactions preferentially occurred in the presence of Zn2+ suggesting that matrilin-3 has acquired a requirement for specific metal ions for activation and/or molecular associations.

In this study we have identified new characteristics of the matrilin-1 A-domains by describing their glycosylation state and the effect of N-glycan chains on their structure, thermal stability, and protein-protein interactions. Initial characterization revealed that N-glycosylation did not affect secretion of these two proteins, nor did it alter their folding characteristics. However, removal of the glycosylation decreased their thermal stability. We then compared the effect of different cations on binding between both M1A domains and type II and IX collagens and showed that Zn2+ also supports their interactions. Finally, we have demonstrated that both M1A1 domains and biglycan are essential for the association of the type II·VI collagen complex.

IntroductionThe immune cells, especially B cells, are exposed to various genotoxic stresses during their maturation and activation for immune responses. The DNA damages in B cells are mainly the results of programmed mechanisms, such as the V(D)J recombination, the class switch recombination (CSR), 2The abbreviations used are: CSRclass switch recombinationBERbase excision repairDSBdouble strand breakKLHkeyhole limpet hemocyaninTNP2,4,6-trinitrophenolMMRmismatch repairPIpropidium iodideCFSEcarboxyfluorescein succinimidyl esterPEphosphatidylethanolaminehhuman. and the somatic hypermutation of the Ig gene (1Revy P. Buck D. le Deist F. de Villartay J.P. Adv. Immunol. 2005; 87: 237-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both V(D)J recombination and CSR can specifically generate DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), and DSB is a particularly harmful form of DNA damage. Somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations, and occasionally deletion or insertion mutations, into the rearranged V(D)J gene segments at a frequency of ∼10−3 mutations per base per round of cell division. Besides these three specific DNA-altering mechanisms, B cells are also exposed to general DNA injuries as they rapidly proliferate in response to stimuli (1Revy P. Buck D. le Deist F. de Villartay J.P. Adv. Immunol. 2005; 87: 237-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Branzei D. Foiani M. Curr. Opin. Cell.

Although the aforementioned DNA DSBs and mutations are required for normal immune response, these DNA lesions, if not managed appropriately, can lead to severe consequences such as immune deficiency or cancer (3Xu Y.

For example, in germinal center B cells, some DNA repair factors involved in mismatch repair (MMR) or base excision repair (BER) are diverted from their normal roles in preserving genomic integrity to increasing DNA sequence diversity within the Ig locus (4Peled J.U.

Aside from cell cycle checkpoint functions, there is mounting evidence that Rad9 has important roles in repairing DNA lesions. Rad9 can bind multiple DNA repair proteins involved in DNA BER and regulate their activities (16Lu A.L. Bai H. Shi G. Chang D.Y. Front.

Recently, we reported that Rad9 carries out its MMR function through interaction with MLH1 (24He W. Zhao Y. Zhang C. An L. Hu Z. Liu Y. Han L. Bi L. Xie Z. Xue P. Yang F. Hang H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6406-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Bai et al. (25Bai H. Madabushi A. Guan X. Lu A.L. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2010; 9: 478-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported that Rad9 could also physically and functionally interact with the other two MMR proteins, MSH2 and MSH6. Interestingly, both BER and MMR are required specifically in Ig production (4Peled J.U. Kuang F.L. Iglesias-Ussel M.D. Roa S. Kalis S.L. Goodman M.F. Scharff M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 481-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 26Stavnezer J. Guikema J.E. Schrader C.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 261-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar).Here, to test the possible roles of Rad9 in B cells, we generated a conditional knock-out mouse line in which Rad9 is deleted specifically in B cells. Mice with Rad9+/− or Rad9−/− B cells demonstrate no overt, spontaneous, morphologic defects. However, the Rad9−/− B cells displayed impaired growth response and enhanced DNA lesions. We also detected impaired Ig production in response to TNP-KLH immunization in Rad9−/− mice. In addition, the Ig CSR is deficient in Rad9−/− B cells. These data demonstrate that Rad9 plays dual roles during B cell development in generating functional antibodies and in maintaining the integrity of the whole genome.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have documented that Rad9 is required for B cell proliferation (Fig. 3), Ig generation, and CSR (Fig. 4). Accumulated evidence indicates that Rad9 plays an important role in DNA repair (5Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2491) Google Scholar, 6Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar, 7Paulovich A.G. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1995; 82: 841-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), and enhanced DNA lesions resulting from Rad9 deletion in mouse keratinocytes lead to enhanced apoptosis and a slower cell cycle progression (27Hu Z.. Liu Y. Zhang C. Zhao Y. He W. Han L. Yang L. Hopkins K.M. Yang X. Lieberman H.B. Hang H. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5552-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consistently, we also observed enhanced levels of DNA lesions (Fig. 3F) and apoptosis (Fig. 3, D and E) and a slower cell cycle progression (Fig. 3, B and C) in Rad9-deleted mouse B cells. The total effect of the enhanced apoptosis and a slower cell cycle progression is a reduced mouse Rad9−/− B cell proliferation (Fig. 3A). Therefore, the reduced proliferation rate is one of the mechanisms underlying deficient Ig generation in Rad9−/− B cells (Fig. 4A).In Rad9−/− mice, the reduction of blood TNP-specific IgG was much more significant than that of blood TNP-specific IgM (25.7-fold decrease versus 2.63-fold decrease: Fig. 4A), suggesting that a CSR deficiency resulted from Rad9 deletion. In addition, in cells at the same cell cycle divisions, IgG expression levels in B cells from Rad9−/− mice were significantly lower than those in Rad9+/+ B cells (Fig. 4, B–D), suggesting that Rad9 plays a more direct role in Ig production and CSR than just through cell expansion.CSR is an intrachromosomal deletional recombination event that occurs in mature B cells in response to antigen stimulation. It has been reported that many DNA damage repair factors required for BER, MMR, and nonhomologous end joining directly participate in this process (4Peled J.U. Kuang F.L. Iglesias-Ussel M.D. Roa S. Kalis S.L. Goodman M.F. Scharff M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 481-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 26Stavnezer J. Guikema J.E. Schrader C.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 261-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Accumulated evidence indicates that Rad9 plays direct roles in base excision repair and mismatch repair, but not in nonhomologous end joining of DNA double strand breaks (23Gembka A. Toueille M.

We previously reported that Rad9 directly interacted with the MMR protein hMLH1, and this interaction is important for DNA MMR (24He W. Zhao Y. Zhang C. An L. Hu Z. Liu Y. Han L. Bi L. Xie Z. Xue P. Yang F. Hang H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6406-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Bai et al. (25Bai H. Madabushi A. Guan X. Lu A.L. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2010; 9: 478-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have reported recently that Rad9 also physically and functionally interacts with the two other important MMR proteins, hMSH2-hMSH6. Rad9 can stimulate the DNA binding activity of hMSH2-hMSH6, and Rad9 and hMSH6 colocalize to nuclear foci in nuclei of HeLa cells after exposure to N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, which causes DNA lesions that can be repaired by the MMR mechanism. Furthermore, the foci formation of Rad9 and hMSH6 in N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-treated cells is dependent on the presence of each other. Gembka et al. (23Gembka A. Toueille M. Smirnova E. Poltz R. Ferrari E. Villani G. Hübscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2596-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported that Rad9 physically interacted with the BER protein APE1 and that the 9-1-1 (Rad9-Hus1-Rad1) complex stimulated the endonuclease activity of APE1. Interestingly, it has been reported that the MMR proteins MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 and the BER protein APE1 all function in CSR. CSR is reduced in mice that lack one of these four genes (31Schrader C.E. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Stavnezer J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Schrader C.E. Guikema J.E. Wu X. Stavnezer J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2009; 364: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 33Li Z. Scherer S.J. Ronai D. Iglesias-Ussel M.D. Peled J.U. Bardwell P.D. Zhuang M. Lee K. Martin A. Edelmann W.

Med. 2007; 204: 3017-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, Rad9 is likely to participate in the process of CSR through BER and/or MMR, but not through nonhomologous end joining.Based on the accumulated evidence, we hypothesize two molecular mechanisms by which Rad9 participates in the process of CSR. First, Rad9 is likely to contribute to the recruitment of the components of CSR machinery mentioned above and stimulate their functions in CSR. Second, Rad9 has been reported to possess 3′-to-5′-nuclease activity without a known function (35Bessho T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7451-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and 3′-to-5′-nuclease activity has been shown to be important for MMR (36Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A. Burdett V. Modrich P.L. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 302-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Therefore, Rad9 is likely to function in mismatch-dependent 3′-to-5′-excision, thus promoting the conversion of the single strand break to DSB in CSR, having a similar role as ExoI, which is an MMR-associated 5′-directed exonuclease in eukaryotic cells and plays a role in CSR (37Bardwell P.D. Woo C.J. Wei K. Li Z. Martin A. Sack S.Z. Parris T. Edelmann W. Scharff M.D. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To understand the exact underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which Rad9 functions in CSR (such as via its interaction with MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or APE1), further major effort is required.In summary, we have provided experimental evidences for the first time that Rad9 plays dual roles during B cell development in generating functional antibodies and in maintaining the integrity of the whole genome in B cells. IntroductionThe immune cells, especially B cells, are exposed to various genotoxic stresses during their maturation and activation for immune responses. The DNA damages in B cells are mainly the results of programmed mechanisms, such as the V(D)J recombination, the class switch recombination (CSR), 2The abbreviations used are: CSRclass switch recombinationBERbase excision repairDSBdouble strand breakKLHkeyhole limpet hemocyaninTNP2,4,6-trinitrophenolMMRmismatch repairPIpropidium iodideCFSEcarboxyfluorescein succinimidyl esterPEphosphatidylethanolaminehhuman. and the somatic hypermutation of the Ig gene (1Revy P. Buck D. le Deist F. de Villartay J.P. Adv. Immunol. 2005; 87: 237-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both V(D)J recombination and CSR can specifically generate DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), and DSB is a particularly harmful form of DNA damage. Somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations, and occasionally deletion or insertion mutations, into the rearranged V(D)J gene segments at a frequency of ∼10−3 mutations per base per round of cell division. Besides these three specific DNA-altering mechanisms, B cells are also exposed to general DNA injuries as they rapidly proliferate in response to stimuli (1Revy P. Buck D. le Deist F. de Villartay J.P. Adv. Immunol. 2005; 87: 237-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Branzei D. Foiani M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2005; 17: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although the aforementioned DNA DSBs and mutations are required for normal immune response, these DNA lesions, if not managed appropriately, can lead to severe consequences such as immune deficiency or cancer (3Xu Y. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Although several of the common DNA damage response mechanisms are found to be responsible for maintaining the genome integrity of immune cells, some of the DNA damage response pathways play unique roles in B cells(3Xu Y. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For example, in germinal center B cells, some DNA repair factors involved in mismatch repair (MMR) or base excision repair (BER) are diverted from their normal roles in preserving genomic integrity to increasing DNA sequence diversity within the Ig locus (4Peled J.U. Kuang F.L. Iglesias-Ussel M.D. Roa S. Kalis S.L. Goodman M.F. Scharff M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 481-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).Rad9 plays important roles in both cell cycle checkpoint control and DNA repair (5Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kaçmaz K.

Rad9 is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans and can form a ring-shaped heterotrimer, dubbed the 9-1-1 complex, with Rad1 and Hus1 (8Griffith J.D. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Recently, we reported that Rad9 carries out its MMR function through interaction with MLH1 (24He W. Zhao Y. Zhang C. An L. Hu Z. Liu Y. Han L. Bi L. Xie Z. Xue P. Yang F. Hang H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6406-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Bai et al. (25Bai H. Madabushi A. Guan X. Lu A.L. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2010; 9: 478-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported that Rad9 could also physically and functionally interact with the other two MMR proteins, MSH2 and MSH6. Interestingly, both BER and MMR are required specifically in Ig production (4Peled J.U. Kuang F.L. Iglesias-Ussel M.D. Roa S. Kalis S.L. Goodman M.F. Scharff M.D. Annu. Rev.

Here, to test the possible roles of Rad9 in B cells, we generated a conditional knock-out mouse line in which Rad9 is deleted specifically in B cells. Mice with Rad9+/− or Rad9−/− B cells demonstrate no overt, spontaneous, morphologic defects. However, the Rad9−/− B cells displayed impaired growth response and enhanced DNA lesions. We also detected impaired Ig production in response to TNP-KLH immunization in Rad9−/− mice. In addition, the Ig CSR is deficient in Rad9−/− B cells. These data demonstrate that Rad9 plays dual roles during B cell development in generating functional antibodies and in maintaining the integrity of the whole genome. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have documented that Rad9 is required for B cell proliferation (Fig. 3), Ig generation, and CSR (Fig. 4). Accumulated evidence indicates that Rad9 plays an important role in DNA repair (5Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2491) Google Scholar, 6Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar, 7Paulovich A.G. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1995; 82: 841-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), and enhanced DNA lesions resulting from Rad9 deletion in mouse keratinocytes lead to enhanced apoptosis and a slower cell cycle progression (27Hu Z.. Liu Y. Zhang C. Zhao Y. He W. Han L. Yang L. Hopkins K.M. Yang X. Lieberman H.B. Hang H. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5552-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consistently, we also observed enhanced levels of DNA lesions (Fig. 3F) and apoptosis (Fig. 3, D and E) and a slower cell cycle progression (Fig. 3, B and C) in Rad9-deleted mouse B cells. The total effect of the enhanced apoptosis and a slower cell cycle progression is a reduced mouse Rad9−/− B cell proliferation (Fig. 3A). Therefore, the reduced proliferation rate is one of the mechanisms underlying deficient Ig generation in Rad9−/− B cells (Fig. 4A).In Rad9−/− mice, the reduction of blood TNP-specific IgG was much more significant than that of blood TNP-specific IgM (25.7-fold decrease versus 2.63-fold decrease: Fig. 4A), suggesting that a CSR deficiency resulted from Rad9 deletion. In addition, in cells at the same cell cycle divisions, IgG expression levels in B cells from Rad9−/− mice were significantly lower than those in Rad9+/+ B cells (Fig. 4, B–D), suggesting that Rad9 plays a more direct role in Ig production and CSR than just through cell expansion.CSR is an intrachromosomal deletional recombination event that occurs in mature B cells in response to antigen stimulation. It has been reported that many DNA damage repair factors required for BER, MMR, and nonhomologous end joining directly participate in this process (4Peled J.U. Kuang F.L. Iglesias-Ussel M.D. Roa S.

Immunol. 2008; 26: 261-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Accumulated evidence indicates that Rad9 plays direct roles in base excision repair and mismatch repair, but not in nonhomologous end joining of DNA double strand breaks (23Gembka A. Toueille M.

We previously reported that Rad9 directly interacted with the MMR protein hMLH1, and this interaction is important for DNA MMR (24He W. Zhao Y. Zhang C. An L. Hu Z. Liu Y. Han L. Bi L. Xie Z. Xue P. Yang F. Hang H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6406-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Bai et al. (25Bai H. Madabushi A. Guan X. Lu A.L. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2010; 9: 478-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have reported recently that Rad9 also physically and functionally interacts with the two other important MMR proteins, hMSH2-hMSH6. Rad9 can stimulate the DNA binding activity of hMSH2-hMSH6, and Rad9 and hMSH6 colocalize to nuclear foci in nuclei of HeLa cells after exposure to N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, which causes DNA lesions that can be repaired by the MMR mechanism. Furthermore, the foci formation of Rad9 and hMSH6 in N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-treated cells is dependent on the presence of each other. Gembka et al. (23Gembka A. Toueille M. Smirnova E. Poltz R. Ferrari E. Villani G. Hübscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2596-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported that Rad9 physically interacted with the BER protein APE1 and that the 9-1-1 (Rad9-Hus1-Rad1) complex stimulated the endonuclease activity of APE1. Interestingly, it has been reported that the MMR proteins MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 and the BER protein APE1 all function in CSR. CSR is reduced in mice that lack one of these four genes (31Schrader C.E. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Stavnezer J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 32Schrader C.E. Guikema J.E. Wu X. Stavnezer J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.

Med. 2007; 204: 3017-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, Rad9 is likely to participate in the process of CSR through BER and/or MMR, but not through nonhomologous end joining.Based on the accumulated evidence, we hypothesize two molecular mechanisms by which Rad9 participates in the process of CSR. First, Rad9 is likely to contribute to the recruitment of the components of CSR machinery mentioned above and stimulate their functions in CSR. Second, Rad9 has been reported to possess 3′-to-5′-nuclease activity without a known function (35Bessho T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7451-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and 3′-to-5′-nuclease activity has been shown to be important for MMR (36Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A. Burdett V. Modrich P.L. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 302-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Therefore, Rad9 is likely to function in mismatch-dependent 3′-to-5′-excision, thus promoting the conversion of the single strand break to DSB in CSR, having a similar role as ExoI, which is an MMR-associated 5′-directed exonuclease in eukaryotic cells and plays a role in CSR (37Bardwell P.D.

To understand the exact underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which Rad9 functions in CSR (such as via its interaction with MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or APE1), further major effort is required.In summary, we have provided experimental evidences for the first time that Rad9 plays dual roles during B cell development in generating functional antibodies and in maintaining the integrity of the whole genome in B cells.

It is currently thought that the Sty1 MAPK cascade is mediated by histidine kinases and phosphorelay proteins in response to oxidative stress signals. However, studies of the exact transduction mechanism of multiple-stress responses are lacking. Thus, in response to various stimuli, we monitored the Sty1 MAPK pathway through the downstream transcription factor Atf1 in living cells using a highly sensitive luciferase reporter gene. Surprisingly, in cadmium and low glucose (LG) medium, Atf1 activation was observed even in the absence of all of the four fission yeast MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs); whereas in osmotic stress, Atf1 activation was abolished. Thus, the osmotic stress likely mediates the MAPK activation via MAPKKKs, whereas a cadmium or LG condition activates the MAPK in a MAPKKK-independent manner. On the other hand, knockout of tyrosine phosphatase gene pyp1+ abolished the Atf1 response to cadmium and LG, but not to osmotic stress, suggesting that Pyp1 is a sensor for cadmium and LG.

IntroductionThe MAPK signaling pathways are critical for the response of eukaryotic cells to adapt to external environment conditions (1Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). A MAPK module is a three-kinase cascade, consisting of three protein kinases: a MAPKKK 2The abbreviations used are: MAPKKKMAPK kinase kinaseCREcAMP response elementEMMEdinburgh minimal mediumLGlow glucose. that activates a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which in turn activates a MAPK enzyme. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the Sty1 MAPK pathway is known to be involved in multiple-stress responses such as high temperature, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, nutrient limitation, and heavy metal toxicity (2Degols G. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3356-3363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Samejima I. Mackie S. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6162-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 4Shieh J.C.

Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In general, signals induced by these multiple stress agents are relayed from the membrane or the cytoplasm to the nucleus to regulate gene expression for stress adaptation.To date, histidine-to-aspartate (His-to-Asp) phosphorelay signaling systems are thought to be involved in the signal transduction implicated in oxidative stress response: activated histidine kinases Mak1, Mak2, and Mak3 (6Buck V.

Mcs4 then in turn regulates MAPK module by activating the MAPKKKs Wis4/Wak1/Wik1 and Win1 (3Samejima I. Mackie S. Fantes P.A.

Wis1 is required for activation of the MAPK Sty1 following osmotic, heat, or oxidative stresses (10Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) was also reported to regulate Sty1 activation upon heat shock (14Nguyen A.N. Shiozaki K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activated Sty1 accumulates in the nucleus (15Gaits F. Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Gaits F. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1395-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), where it activates transcription factors, such as bZIP transcription factor Atf1, and regulates a large set of genes that are relevant to the stress adaptation (see Fig. 4A).In an attempt to identify the mechanisms of signal transduction and the sensing systems of each distinct stress factor in fission yeast, we monitored the transcriptional activity of Atf1 in living cells using a destabilized luciferase reporter gene fused to three tandem repeats of cAMP response elements (CRE)-like sequence under the conditions of osmotic stress KCl, heavy metal CdCl2, and low-glucose (LG) medium. We have investigated the knock-out strains known to be involved in the Sty1 MAPK pathway to see if there are defects in signal transduction accompanying the gene knockout. Here, we show evidence for the presence of MAPKKK-dependent and -independent activation of the MAPK. We also show that Pyp1 plays a role for sensing heavy metal CdCl2 and LG.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWild-type cells, Δatf1 cells, and Δsty1 cells were subjected to osmotic stress (0.075–0.3 m KCl), heavy metal stress (0.5–2 mm CdCl2), and LG (0.1% glucose), respectively. In wild-type cells, elevated extracellular KCl caused a continuous rise in a dose-dependent manner in the Atf1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 1A, left panel). CdCl2 also caused a dose-dependent increase (Fig. 1A, center panel); however, it should be noted that there was a delayed onset of increasing response compared with that by KCl. LG showed a steady increase in response, with a peak rise at about 120 min (Fig. 1A, right panel). In Δatf1 cells, there was no response upon treatment with KCl, CdCl2, or LG (Fig. 1B), indicating that the 3×CRE::luc(R2.2) reporter assay reflects the Atf1 activity. In Δsty1 cells, the 3×CRE::luc(R2.2) reporter activity was hardly detected (Fig. 1B), indicating that the reporter assay also reflects the Sty1 activity.FIGURE 1Real-time monitoring of Atf1 activity in living cells. A, live-cell monitoring of Atf1 activity in wild-type cells. Wild-type cells transformed with the multicopy plasmid (3×CRE::luc(R2.2) reporter plasmid) were incubated with d-luciferin and treated with KCl (0.075–0.3 m), CdCl2 (0.5–2 mm), or EMM with LG (0.1% glucose). Relative light units are expressed as the ratio of light emission of each sample to the basal (without stimulation) light emission of wild-type cells in EMM at 180 min. The data shown are representative of multiple experiments. B, reporter assay reflecting Sty1 activity as well as Atf1 activity in living cells. The cells as indicated were transformed with the reporter plasmid, cultured in EMM at 27 °C, and treated with KCl (0.3 m), CdCl2 (2 mm), or LG (0.1% glucose), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, detection of phosphorylated Sty1 by immunoblotting. Cells were grown in YPD medium at 27 °C and exposed to LG medium, 0.3 m KCl, or 2 mm CdCl2 for 30 min. Phosphorylated Sty1 protein (Sty1-P) was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphorylated p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) MAPK antibody and anti-Cdc4 antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” D, real-time monitoring of integration reporter activities in wild-type and Δsty1 cells. Δsty1 cells harboring the stable integration reporter vector transformed with an inducible-expression plasmid of Sty1 in the presence or absence of thiamine (see “Experimental Procedures”) were treated as indicated. Error bars, mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As a further test, we examined the level of dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine of Sty1 by immunoblotting under the treatment with KCl, CdCl2, or LG (Fig. 1C). The immunoblot detected a substantial increase in the phosphorylation level caused by each stress factor, which is consistent with the results of 3×CRE::luc(R2.2) reporter assay.Also, the integrated 3×CRE::luc(R2.2) reporter activities were examined in Δsty1 cells that were transformed with an inducible Sty1 on an expression plasmid. When the Sty1 expression was repressed by thiamine, there was an extremely low response upon stimulation, and in the absence of the thiamine the reporter activities returned to almost the same level as that in wild-type cells (Fig. 1D and supplemental Table S2). These results again indicate that the luciferase reporter reflects Sty1 activity in living cells.The integrated 3×CRE::luc(R2.2) reporter showed much lower sensitivity than the multicopy reporter, and it failed to detect the activity in some knock-out cells. Therefore, we used the multicopy reporter for most of knock-out cells showing low Atf1 activity. Although the copy number of plasmids in fission yeast is variable, the S.D. obtained with the multicopy reporter suggests that the experiments are reliable.To investigate the role of Mcs4 in multiple-stress-induced responses, we monitored the reporter activities in Δmcs4 cells. It has been reported that Mcs4 acts as a “response regulator” protein of the prototypical bacterial two-component system transmitting oxidative stress signals to the Sty1 MAPK cascade (6Buck V.

Cell. 2002; 13: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In Δmcs4 cells, the basal and stimulated activities of the reporter were markedly low as the basal reporter activity in Δmcs4 cells was only about 5% of that in wild-type cells (Table 1). Notably, the reporter activity responded only weakly (∼2-fold basal levels) to osmotic stress, whereas it responded well to CdCl2 and to LG (∼7-fold and 17-fold basal levels, respectively). Contrary to the study showing that Mcs4 is a response regulator transmitting oxidative stress signals to the Sty1 cascade (8Nguyen A.N. Lee A. Place W. Shiozaki K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1169-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), our present data suggest that Mcs4 functions as a regulator primarily in response to osmotic stress and to a lesser extent to oxidative stress agents.TABLE 13×CRE::luc(R2.2) reporter activity in various cellsCell typesBasalStimuliKCl (0.3 m)CdCl2 (2 mm)LG (2% → 0.1%)Wild type1.0 ± 0.0963.5 ± 0.312.1 ± 0.203.3 ± 0.48Δmcs40.048 ± 0.0160.095 ± 0.0350.34 ± 0.130.82 ± 0.40Δwis40.078 ± 0.0140.19 ± 0.0410.55 ± 0.0680.66 ± 0.17Δwin10.15 ± 0.0130.26 ± 0.0281.0 ± 0.170.80 ± 0.18Δwis4Δwin10.015 ± 0.00160.017 ± 0.00330.15 ± 0.0320.10 ± 0.010Δwis10.0031 ± 0.000540.0039 ± 0.00140.0018 ± 0.000780.0036 ± 0.0019Δwis4Δwin1Δbyr2Δmkh10.0097 ± 0.000340.011 ± 0.00850.19 ± 0.0490.11 ± 0.0099Δpyp13.18 ± 0.116.73 ± 0.643.32 ± 0.372.91 ± 0.59pyp1C470S3.06 ± 0.155.62 ± 0.382.81 ± 0.562.85 ± 0.14 Open table in a new tab MAPK Sty1 is directly phosphorylated by a MAPKK, Wis1, which is phosphorylated by two redundant MAPKKKs, Wis4 and Win1 (26Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In Δwis1 cells, the promoter activities induced by the three stress agents, respectively, were abolished (Fig. 2, A and C, and Table 1). The Sty1 phosphorylation level was also monitored under the treatment with 2 mm CdCl2, and no detectable Sty1 phosphorylation was observed in Δwis1 cells (Fig. 2D). These results are consistent with the notion that Wis1 is required for the activation of Sty1 under several stress conditions (10Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2870-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 11Kato Jr., T. Okazaki K. Murakami H. Stettler S. Fantes P.A. Okayama H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2KCl-stimulated Sty1 activation is dependent on MAPKKKs, whereas both the CdCl2- and LG-stimulated activations are independent of MAPKKKs. A, both CdCl2- and LG-stimulated activations of Sty1 are dependent on MAPKK Wis1 but not MAPKKKs Wis4 and Win1. Wild-type, Δwis4, Δwin1, Δwis4Δwin1, and Δwis1 cells, respectively, transformed with the reporter plasmid were treated as indicated. Data were analyzed and plotted as in Fig. 1D, and the inset is a magnification of the results obtained in Δwis4Δwin1 cells and Δwis1 cells. B, MAPKKKs Wis4 and Win1 are required for KCl-stimulated Sty1 activation but not for CdCl2- or LG-stimulated activations. The Δwis4Δwin1 cells transformed with the reporter plasmid were treated as indicated. C, MAPKK Wis1 is absolutely required for the activation of Sty1. The Δwis1 cells transformed with the reporter plasmid were treated with the three agents, respectively, as described in Fig. 1A. D, detection of phosphorylated Sty1 by immunoblotting under the treatment with CdCl2 is shown. Cells were grown in YPD medium at 27 °C. CdCl2 was added to a final concentration of 2 mm at time 0, and aliquots of cells were harvested every 60 min. Sty1 protein was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphorylated p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) MAPK antibody (Sty1-P) and anti-HA antibody (Sty1-HA) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” E, CdCl2- and LG-stimulated activations are independent of MAPKKKs. Δwis4Δwin1 cells or Δwis4Δwin1Δbyr2Δmkh1 cells transformed with the reporter plasmid were untreated (basal) or treated with CdCl2 (2 mm) or LG. Data were analyzed and plotted as in Fig. 1D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then monitored the reporter activity in single MAPKKK knock-out cells, Δwis4 and Δwin1. In Δwis4 or Δwin1, similar to Δmcs4 cells, both the basal activity and the stimulated activity of the reporter were very low. It should be noted that the response to KCl stimulation was only weakly observed, in contrast to the clear responses to CdCl2 and LG (Fig. 2A). These results, together with the results obtained in Δmcs4 cells, suggest that Mcs4, Wis4, and Win1 may synergistically mediate osmotic stress signal to the MAPKK Wis1. In Δwis4Δwin1 double knock-out cells, no reporter activity was observed by KCl treatment, whereas CdCl2 and LG, respectively, showed significant stimulated reporter activity (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 1). The phosphorylation level of Sty1 under the treatment with CdCl2 was not detected in Δwis4Δwin1 double knock-out cells by immunoblotting (Fig. 2D), further indicating that the 3×CRE::luc(R2.2) reporter assay has a much higher sensitivity than the immunoblot detection. Our findings of the reporter assay suggest that KCl-stimulated Sty1 activation is dependent on MAPKKKs Wis4 and Win1, whereas both CdCl2- and LG-stimulated activations are independent. Possibly, two other known fission yeast MAPKKKs, Byr2 and Mkh1, compensate for the loss of Wis4 and Win1.Byr2 is required for mating and sporulation (27Masuda T. Kariya K. Shinkai M. Okada T. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1979-1982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and Mkh1 regulates morphogenesis and cell wall integrity (28Loewith R. Hubberstey A. Young D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 153-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed the strains lacking all of the four MAPKKKs and tested them using this reporter assay. In Δwis4Δwin1Δbyr2Δmkh1 tetra knock-out cells, similar reporter activities were observed compared with those in Δwis4Δwin1 double knock-out cells upon the treatment with CdCl2 or LG (Fig. 2E and Table 1). This further suggests that both CdCl2- and LG-stimulated MAP kinase activations are MAPKKK-independent.These results led us to look into the negative regulators of the Sty1 MAPK cascade. The protein-tyrosine phosphatases Pyp1 and Pyp2 are found to function by inactivating Sty1 (12Millar J.B. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We then monitored the reporter activities in Δpyp1 and Δpyp2 cells. Higher basal reporter activity was observed in Δpyp1 cells than in wild-type or Δpyp2 cells (Fig. 3, A–C). This is consistent with the notion that Pypl and Pyp2 dephosphorylate and inhibit the Styl MAPK (12Millar J.B. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and that Pyp1 is a major tyrosine phosphatase for Sty1 dephosphorylation (3Samejima I. Mackie S. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6162-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In Δpyp1 cells, notably, the promoter activity stimulated by the treatment with CdCl2 or LG was not or was barely observed, whereas the stimulation by KCl was clearly observed (Fig. 3B). In Δpyp2 cells, the reporter activity stimulated by the three stress agents, respectively, was similar to that in wild-type cells (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that Pyp1, but not Pyp2, is responsible for sensing and transmitting the signals to Sty1 MAPK upon treatment with CdCl2 or LG.FIGURE 3Deletion of pyp1+ gene abolished both CdCl2- and LG-stimulated Sty1 activation, whereas KCl-stimulated activation was unaffected. A, wild-type cells transformed with the reporter plasmid were incubated with d-luciferin and treated as indicated. B and C, Δpyp1 and Δpyp2 cells transformed with the reporter plasmid were treated as indicated. D, the highly conserved Cys residue of Pyp1 may function as a sensor for CdCl2 and LG. Wild-type, Δpyp1, and Δpyp2 cells containing integrated pREP1-pyp1C470S-GFP, transformed with the reporter plasmid, were treated as indicated. Data were analyzed and plotted as in Fig. 1D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Notably, Δpyp1 cells showed a higher basal reporter activity than wild-type cells (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that even in the absence of extracellular stresses, Sty1 is still phosphorylated by MAPKK Wis1. Consistently, Δwis1Δpyp1 double knock-out cells showed extremely low basal and response reporter activities that were similar to those of Δwis1 single knock-out cells (data not shown), indicating that high basal reporter activity in Δpyp1 cells is dependent on the activity of Wis1 and on its Sty1-phosphorylating activity and suggests that Wis1 has some activity and phosphorylates Sty1 in the absence of two upstream MAPKKKs. Consistent with this notion, a previous article by Samejima et al. showed that Wis1AA (unphosphorylated form) still phosphorylates Sty1 (3Samejima I. Mackie S. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6162-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This seems to be the reason why Wis1 is absolutely required for Sty1 activation by CdCl2 and LG. Also, morphological comparison between Δwis1 cells and wild-type cells overexpressing pyp1+ has been performed. Similar to Δwis1 cells, overexpression of pyp1+ in a wild-type background led to significant cell elongation (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that Pyp1 is actually opposing the Wis1 activity.Recent studies in mammalian cells have reported that CdCl2 induces the formation of reactive oxygen species (29Avery S.V. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2001; 49: 111-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30Schützendübel A. Polle A. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Valko M. Morris H. Cronin M.T. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 1161-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3543) Google Scholar) and that LG causes a metabolic oxidative stress (32Lee Y.J. Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Chen J.C. Davis B.H.

The highly conserved Cys residue located within the core catalytic domains of all known protein-tyrosine phosphatases is essential for the catalytic activity in vitro (34Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cho H. Ramer S.E. Itoh M. Kitas E. Bannwarth W. Burn P. Saito H. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that the conserved Cys residue in PTPα is sensitive to reactive oxygen species and that it may function as a redox sensor (37Persson C. Sjöblom T. Groen A. Kappert K. Engström U. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. den Hertog J. Ostman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 1886-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, to determine whether this Cys residue (Cys470) is also crucial for the ability of Pyp1 to sense the signals induced by the treatment with CdCl2 and LG, respectively, the pREP1-pyp1C470S-GFP was integrated into the chromosome of Δpyp1 cells. The mutation of this Cys residue showed similar reporter activity compared with that in Δpyp1 cells upon the treatment with the three stress agents, respectively (Fig. 3D and Table 1). This suggests that alteration of the Cys residue in the catalytic site abolishes the ability to sense and to transmit the signals to Sty1 MAPK upon the treatment with CdCl2 and LG, respectively, indicating that Cys470 may function as a sensor for these two stress agents.In summary, in contrast with the hypothesis that all of the stresses are mediated by the two MAPKKKs (38Shiozaki K. Shiozaki M. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A), here we show evidence in favor of the conclusion shown in Fig. 4B: KCl stimulates the Sty1 MAPK pathway through MAPKKKs, whereas CdCl2 and LG stimulate the pathway through the inhibition of Pyp1 independently of MAPKKKs. This is in contrast with a previous hypothesis that insights on the mechanisms of stress response and signal transduction in fission yeast may help in studying similar mechanisms in higher eukaryotes. IntroductionThe MAPK signaling pathways are critical for the response of eukaryotic cells to adapt to external environment conditions (1Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). A MAPK module is a three-kinase cascade, consisting of three protein kinases: a MAPKKK 2The abbreviations used are: MAPKKKMAPK kinase kinaseCREcAMP response elementEMMEdinburgh minimal mediumLGlow glucose. that activates a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which in turn activates a MAPK enzyme. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the Sty1 MAPK pathway is known to be involved in multiple-stress responses such as high temperature, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, nutrient limitation, and heavy metal toxicity (2Degols G. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3356-3363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Samejima I. Mackie S. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6162-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 4Shieh J.C.

Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In general, signals induced by these multiple stress agents are relayed from the membrane or the cytoplasm to the nucleus to regulate gene expression for stress adaptation.To date, histidine-to-aspartate (His-to-Asp) phosphorelay signaling systems are thought to be involved in the signal transduction implicated in oxidative stress response: activated histidine kinases Mak1, Mak2, and Mak3 (6Buck V.

Cell. 2001; 12: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) mediate their effects through phosphorelay protein Mpr1/Spy1 and Mcs4 response regulator (6Buck V. Quinn J. Soto Pino T. Martin H.

Mcs4 then in turn regulates MAPK module by activating the MAPKKKs Wis4/Wak1/Wik1 and Win1 (3Samejima I. Mackie S. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6162-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), which are functionally redundant in activating MAPKK Wis1. Wis1 is required for activation of the MAPK Sty1 following osmotic, heat, or oxidative stresses (10Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activated Sty1 accumulates in the nucleus (15Gaits F. Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1395-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), where it activates transcription factors, such as bZIP transcription factor Atf1, and regulates a large set of genes that are relevant to the stress adaptation (see Fig. 4A).In an attempt to identify the mechanisms of signal transduction and the sensing systems of each distinct stress factor in fission yeast, we monitored the transcriptional activity of Atf1 in living cells using a destabilized luciferase reporter gene fused to three tandem repeats of cAMP response elements (CRE)-like sequence under the conditions of osmotic stress KCl, heavy metal CdCl2, and low-glucose (LG) medium. We have investigated the knock-out strains known to be involved in the Sty1 MAPK pathway to see if there are defects in signal transduction accompanying the gene knockout. Here, we show evidence for the presence of MAPKKK-dependent and -independent activation of the MAPK. We also show that Pyp1 plays a role for sensing heavy metal CdCl2 and LG."

CUX1 expression is very weak in quiescent cells and increases during G1. Biochemical activities associated with transcriptional activation by CUX1 are potentiated by post-translational modifications in late G1, notably a proteolytic processing event that generates p110 CUX1. Constitutive expression of p110 CUX1, as observed in some transformed cells, leads to accelerated entry into the S phase. In this study, we investigated the post-translation regulation of CUX1 during mitosis and the early G1 phases of proliferating cells. We observed a major electrophoretic mobility shift and a complete inhibition of DNA binding during mitosis. We show that cyclin B/CDK1 interacts with CUX1 and phosphorylates it at multiple sites. Serine to alanine replacement mutations at 10 SP dipeptide sites were required to restore DNA binding in mitosis. Passage into G1 was associated with the degradation of some p110 CUX1 proteins, and the remaining proteins were gradually dephosphorylated. Indirect immunofluorescence and subfractionation assays using a phospho-specific antibody showed that most of the phosphorylated protein remained in the cytoplasm, whereas the dephosphorylated protein was preferentially located in the nucleus. Globally, our results indicate that the hyperphosphorylation of CUX1 by cyclin B/CDK1 inhibits its DNA binding activity in mitosis and interferes with its nuclear localization following cell division and formation of the nuclear membrane, whereas dephosphorylation and de novo synthesis contribute to gradually restore CUX1 expression and activity in G1.

Mitosis in higher eukaryotes is associated with global inhibition of gene transcription (1Prescott D.M. Bender M.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1962; 26: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms are thought to contribute to this effect, including changes in chromatin structure that restrict accessibility to the DNA template and inhibition of the transcriptional machinery by phosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 2Gottesfeld J.M. Forbes D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 197-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Mitotic inhibition of transcription was shown to involve direct phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II and III subunits (3Segil N. Guermah M. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. Heintz N.

Phosphorylation of transcription factors during mitosis may serve to reset the DNA binding clock allowing for a fresh transcriptional program to begin at the start of each cell cycle. Exclusion from mitotic chromatin, however, is not universal. Indeed, a number of general or specific transcription factors have been shown to remain associated with condensed chromosomes in mitosis, including TFIID (11Christova R. Oelgeschläger T. Nat.

The association of these factors with specific regulatory sequences within mitotic chromosomes was proposed to cooperate with other epigenetic mechanisms, like histone modifications or incorporation of histone variants (22Chow C.M.

In particular, both TFIID and HSF2 were found to interact with the PP2A phosphatase and the CAP-G subunit of condensin, thereby promoting dephosphorylation and inactivation of the condensin complex and preventing chromatin compaction in the vicinity (19Xing H. Wilkerson D.C. Mayhew C.N. Lubert E.J. Skaggs H.S. Goodson M.L. Hong Y. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. Science. 2005; 307: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Xing H. Vanderford N.L.

In higher eukaryotic cells, cyclin-dependent kinases and their activating subunits, the cyclins, regulate progression through the cell cycle with cyclin B binding to CDK1 during mitosis (28O'Farrell P.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 512-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Inhibitory phosphorylations by Wee1/Myt1 on Thr14/Tyr15 of CDK1 prevent premature activation during the G2 phase of the cell cycle (29McGowan C.H. Russell P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 30Booher R.N. Holman P.S. Fattaey A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22300-22306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Activation of cyclin B/CDK1 as cells enter mitosis results from the dephosphorylation of these residues by Cdc25 phosphatases, and the phosphorylation of Thr161 within the T-loop by the cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase follows a positive feedback loop whereby cyclin B/CDK1 not only phosphorylates Myt1 and Wee1 to effect their inhibition or degradation but also Cdc25 phosphatases to stimulate their activity. Together these regulatory events lead to an explosion of cyclin B/CDK1 activity (31Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 32Timofeev O. Cizmecioglu O. Settele F. Kempf T. Hoffmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 16978-16990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A recent proteomics study has identified over 70 proteins that are phosphorylated in mitosis by cyclin B/CDK1, some of which on multiple residues (33Blethrow J.D. Glavy J.S. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by cyclin B/CDK1 enables the activation of other major mitotic kinases, such as Plk1 and the Aurora kinases, and regulates the processes involved in nuclear breakdown, spindle assembly, and chromosome condensation (34Lindqvist A. Rodríguez-Bravo V. Medema R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Cyclin B/CDK1 eventually contributes to the activation of APC/C, the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the targeted degradation of cyclin B resulting in the inactivation of the kinase complex, an essential step required for chromosome separation and mitotic exit (35Kraft C. Herzog F. Gieffers C. Mechtler K. Hagting A. Pines J. Peters J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6598-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The high degree of connection between these signaling pathways highlights the importance of cyclin B/CDK1. Indeed, a knock-out of the cyclin B1 gene in a mouse model is embryonic lethal (36Brandeis M. Rosewell I. Carrington M. Crompton T. Jacobs M.A. Kirk J. Gannon J. Hunt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4344-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in Drosophila revealed that the Cut transcription factor functions as an important determinant of cell type specificity in multiple organs and tissues (37Bodmer R. Barbel S. Sheperd S. Jack J.W. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1987; 51: 293-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 38Jack J. Dorsett D. Delotto Y. Liu S.

This function is believed to be conserved in evolution because ectopic expression of the murine or human Cut homeobox protein 1 (CUX1) similarly affected embryonic sensory organ development and was able to rescue the wing scalloping mutant phenotype (40Ludlow C. Choy R. Blochlinger K. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). How Cut or CUX1 would determine cell identity is not known. A number of studies in tissue culture systems have documented the cell cycle-dependent regulation of CUX1. The histone nuclear factor D (HiNF-D), which was later found to include CUX1 as its DNA binding partner, was reported to be up-regulated in S phase in normal cells (41van Wijnen A.J. Wright K.L.

The full-length CUX1 protein binds rapidly but only transiently to DNA (46Moon N.S. Bérubé G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of stable DNA binding in the late G1 phase was shown to involve at least two post-translational modifications as follows: dephosphorylation of the Cut homeodomain by the Cdc25A phosphatase and proteolytic cleavage to generate p110 CUX1 (47Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Bérubé G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 48Coqueret O. Bérubé G. Nepveu A.

Cell. 2004; 14: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The activity of the p110 isoform is highest in S phase. Not only is p110 generated at the end of G1 phase, but as cells progress into the G2 phase, DNA binding is down-modulated following phosphorylation by cyclin A/CDK1 of two serine residues in the region of the Cut homeodomain (50Santaguida M. Ding Q. Bérubé G. Truscott M. Whyte P. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45780-45790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cyclin A/CDK2 interacts with CUX1 during the S phase but does not phosphorylate these residues and, in fact, cooperates with p110 CUX1 in reporter assays (51Santaguida M. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32712-32721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, constitutive expression of p110 CUX1 accelerates entry into the S phase and stimulates cell proliferation (52Sansregret L. Goulet B. Harada R. Wilson B. Leduy L. Bertoglio J. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2441-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, the G1 phase is extended in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from Cux1Z/Z knock-out mice (52Sansregret L. Goulet B. Harada R. Wilson B. Leduy L. Bertoglio J. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2441-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One proposed function for mitotic bookmarking is to mark those genes that need to be quickly activated in early G1. Another potential function, which does not exclude the first, is the maintenance of cell identity along a given cell lineage. In this context, the molecular bookmark would act as a cell memory mechanism by which cell identity is transmitted to daughter cells. Specific transcription factors involved in bookmarking would be expected to be active not only in mitosis but also in late G2 and early G1. CUX1 is believed to be important for the determination and maintenance of cell identify, but its activity was shown to be weak in early G1 as cells come out of quiescence, the highest in S phase, and gradually weaker in G2 (42Holthuis J. Owen T.A. van Wijnen A.J. Wright K.L. Ramsey-Ewing A. Kennedy M.B. Carter R. Cosenza S.C. Soprano K.J. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S.

In this study, we maintained cells in the presence of growth factors to investigate the regulation of p110 CUX1 from one cell cycle to the next. We report that p110 CUX1 is inactivated in mitosis as the result of hyper-phosphorylation by cyclin B/CDK1. Passage into G1 is associated with the degradation of some p110 CUX1 proteins, whereas the remaining proteins are gradually dephosphorylated and imported into the nucleus. Globally, these results indicate that the hyper-phosphorylation of CUX1 by cyclin B/CDK1 resets CUX1 activity to the zero level at each cell division, although dephosphorylation in G1 reactivates the protein. All lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (all from Invitrogen), except for NMuMG cells that were supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin. Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Retroviruses were produced by transfecting 293VSV cells with plasmids encoding CUX1 (Myc-tagged at the N terminus and HA-tagged at the C terminus) inserted in the pREV/TRE vector (Clontech). The supernatant was applied on cells along with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Roche Applied Science) and plates were centrifuged at 300 × g for 1 h. Stably infected cells were selected for 5 days in hygromycin (pREV/TRE), and at least 500 resistant clones were pooled. Vectors expressing the following proteins were used: p110 CUX1 (amino acids 747–1505); p110 CUX1/TAP tag (amino acids 612–1336-TAP tag). Stable cell lines generated by transfection were produced by co-transfecting CUX1 (amino acids 612–1328 His-tagged N terminus and HA-tagged C terminus) inserted into the pTriEx2 vector (Novagen) and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers' instructions. Populations were generated by selecting with G418 (Roche Applied Science) for 5 days, and resistant clones were pooled. Mitotic cells were collected by a gentle shake off after a 10–14-h nocodazole treatment (40–100 ng/ml). To study entry into G1, floating mitotic cells were then washed three times in complete media and re-seeded for 2–16 h. Cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. The blocking/solubilization solution consisted in PBS containing 5% FBS and 0.5% Triton X-100. α-HA, α-endogenous-CUX1, and α-CUX1-Ser(P)1237 were used as primary antibodies with Alexa-conjugated, species-specific secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). DNA was stained with DAPI (Sigma). Confocal images were taken using a Zeiss 510 Meta laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Canada Ltd, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) with a ×100 objective. Volocity software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for image analysis. Cells were trypsinized, fixed in 75% EtOH, and stored at −20 °C until analysis. For analysis, 50 μl of FBS was added to each sample. The cells were then centrifuged, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 300 μl of PBS containing 200 μg/ml RNase (Sigma) and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and analyzed using a FACScan (BD Biosciences), using doublet discrimination to gate single cells. Cell cycle profiles were analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star software). Nuclear extracts were prepared using a procedure adapted from Lee et al. (53Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were submitted to three freeze/thaw cycles in Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). Nuclei were then resuspended in Buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After 15 min of centrifugation, the supernatant was collected. Buffers A and C were supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mix tablet (Roche Applied Science). Total extracts were prepared in RIPA, 0.1% SDS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, protease and phosphatase inhibitor tablets). After 10 min on ice, the resulting slurry was centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Mitotic extracts used in kinase assays were prepared from nocodazole-arrested cells. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 nm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g, and adjusted to 10 mg/μl. EMSAs for exogenous CUX1 were performed with 1–4 μg of total extract from mammalian cells. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min in a final volume of 30 μl of EMSA buffer (25 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 1 mm of DTT) with 100 ng of poly(dI-dC) and 30 μg of BSA as nonspecific competitors. End-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-tcgagacgatatcgataagcttcttttc-3′) were added and further incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (30:1) and separated by electrophoresis at 8 V/cm in Tris-glycine. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. For Southwestern blot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were renatured by agitating for 15 min at 4 °C with 6 m guanidine HCl in binding buffer (250 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 30 mm MgCl, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT). This was repeated using serial dilutions of guanidine HCl in binding buffer down to 0.185 m and finally in binding buffer alone. The membrane was then incubated in blocking buffer (binding buffer, 5% milk, phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) for 2 h at room temperature. Hybridization was carried out at 4 °C overnight, using end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-tcgagacgatatcgataagcttcttttc-3′) diluted in binding buffer plus 1% milk and phosphatase inhibitors. The membrane was then washed three times in binding buffer, dried, and exposed to autoradiography. Proteins extracts were resuspended in Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked in TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween X-100) containing 5% milk and 2.5% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBS-T, washed in TBS-T, and incubated with species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 40 min at room temperature. Proteins were then visualized using the ECL system of Amersham Biosciences according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following antibodies and dilutions were used: CUX1 (α861, 1:2000; α1300, 1:2000 (47Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Bérubé G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)), γ-tubulin (1:15,000, Sigma), HA (1:2000, MMS-101R, Covance), CDK1 (1:700, Ab-4, NeoMarkers), and cyclin B1 (1:500, Neomarkers). Lysates from Sf9 cells expressing cyclin B/CDK1 (Fig. 2), mitotic extracts, and purified PKA (Sigma) (supplemental Fig. S1) were used as sources of kinase. His-purified CUX1 recombinant proteins were incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NaF). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 10–20 min at 30 °C and were terminated by adding 6 μl of SDS loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were resolved on 6% or 10% SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to x-ray films. Bacterially purified CUX1 (amino acids 612–1328) was phosphorylated using lysates from Sf9 cells expressing cyclin B/CDK1 complex. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was washed in a large volume of water, dried, and rewetted with methanol and water and dried again. Membrane was exposed to x-ray film to visualize the phosphorylated species and cut out the membrane. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed by hydrolysis of the membrane-bound proteins in constantly boiling 6 n HCl for 1 h at 100 °C. The resulting amino acids were dried, resuspended in 5 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (0.58 m formic acid, 1.36 m glacial acetic acid), and applied to TLC plates. Separation was achieved by two-dimensional electrophoresis, first in pH 1.9 buffer for 1 h at 500 V and then in pH 3.5 buffer (0.87 m glacial acetic acid, 0.5% pyridine (v/v), 0.5 mm EDTA) for 1 h at 500 V. 1 μl of nonradioactive phosphoamino acid standard mixture containing phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (10 mg/ml) were spotted on top of each sample. Following electrophoresis, the plate was dried for 20 min and sprayed with ninhydrin to indicate the position of single amino acids, and the phosphorylated amino acids were revealed by autoradiography. We initially observed that CUX1 proteins from cells in mitosis migrated more slowly in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). This was seen in mitotic cells collected by shake off after treatment with nocodazole (Fig. 1A, lane 2), whereas the attached cells in the same dish, which are mostly cells progressing through G2, displayed CUX1 proteins of lower apparent molecular weight (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Interestingly, the normal CUX1 migration pattern was restored when mitotic cells were relieved of the nocodazole block by re-plating into fresh medium (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–6). The slower electrophoretic mobility of CUX1 in mitosis was associated with the inhibition of DNA binding, as determined by Southwestern blot analysis (Fig. 1A, middle panel). In agreement with this result, indirect immunofluorescence using an asynchronous population of cells revealed that CUX1 was dissociated from the chromatin during mitosis (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that CUX1 DNA binding activity is inhibited in mitosis, and this correlates with post-translational modifications that reduce its electrophoretic mobility. We next investigated whether short CUX1 isoforms such as p110 CUX1 displayed a similar regulation during mitosis. A recombinant p110 CUX1 protein (Myc/747-1505/HA) was expressed by retroviral transduction in multiple cell lines. In all cell lines tested, p110 CUX1 displayed a slower migration in SDS-PAGE when lysates were prepared from mitotic nocodazole-arrested cells (Fig. 2, A, lane 3, and B, lane 2; and data not shown). Slower migration of CUX1 again correlated with a drastic inhibition of p110 CUX1 DNA binding activity as judged from electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 4 and 5). The electrophoretic mobility shift seemed primarily due to phosphorylation because treatment of a mitotic lysate with λ-phosphatase restored migration in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 2 and 4). Importantly, a similar shift in migration was observed when mitotic cells were collected from an asynchronous cell population (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 2 and 3). We conclude that p110 CUX1 contains the amino acid residues that are post-translationally modified during"
https://openalex.org/W1996090840,"In the host immune system, leukocytes are often exposed to multiple inflammation inducers. NF-κB is of considerable importance in leukocyte function because of its ability to activate the transcription of many proinflammatory immediate-early genes. Tremendous efforts have been made toward understanding how NF-κB is activated by various inducers. However, most research on NF-κB regulation has been focused on understanding how NF-κB is activated by a single inducer. This is unlike the situation in the human immune system where multiple inflammation inducers, including both exogenous and endogenous mediators, are present concurrently. We now present evidence that the formylated peptide f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), a bacterial chemoattractant, synergizes with TNFα to induce NF-κB activation and the resultant inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of synergistic activation of NF-κB by bacterial fMLP and TNFα may be involved in the induction of RelA acetylation, which is regulated by p38 MAPK. Thus, this study provides direct evidence for the synergistic induction of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory responses by both exogenous and endogenous inducers. The ability of fMLP to synergize with TNFα and activate NF-κB represents a novel and potentially important mechanism through which bacterial fMLP not only attracts leukocytes but also directly contributes to inflammation by synergizing with the endogenous mediator TNFα. In the host immune system, leukocytes are often exposed to multiple inflammation inducers. NF-κB is of considerable importance in leukocyte function because of its ability to activate the transcription of many proinflammatory immediate-early genes.

Despite the importance of understanding the host response to bacterial infection, many of the fundamental molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions remain unknown. f-Met-Leu-Phe mitogen-activated protein IκB kinase nuclear factor κB quantitative real time trichostatin A bronchoalveolar lavage. The pro-inflammatory cytokine such as TNFα is considered one of the key inflammatory mediators during bacterial infection. This powerful protein, secreted mostly by human blood leukocytes, such as monocytes/macrophages, acts as a host defense against bacterial infections. However, excessive elevations of TNFα can lead to inflammatory disorders (11Bazzoni F. Beutler B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1717-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). The regulation of gene expression in these cells is governed by the activities of transcription factors such as NF-κB, NF-IL-6, and AP-1. NF-κB is of paramount importance to immune cell function because of its ability to activate the transcription of many proinflammatory immediate-early genes (12Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 13Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 32: 141-179Crossref Scopus (4591) Google Scholar). NF-κB, which has been studied in great detail and shown to be dimeric in structure, is composed of members of the Rel family of transcriptional activators. In dormant cells, NF-κB is normally complexed with a member of the IκB proteins, which localizes the transcription factor to the cytosol in an inactive state (14Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the cells with ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TNFα, and IL-1 results in the rapid dissociation of IκB and the subsequent entry of the active NF-κB to the nucleus where it can interact with DNA. Many kinases have been shown to phosphorylate IκB at specific N-terminal serine residues. The most well studied kinases are the IκB kinases (IKKs) IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ (15Hatada E.N. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 16Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev.

Phosphorylation of IκB by the IKK pathway will eventually lead to the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which in turn activates expression of target genes such as TNFα, IL-1, and IL-8 in the nucleus. Tremendous efforts have been made toward understanding how NF-κB is activated by various inducers, including bacteria, viruses, and cytokines. However, most research so far on NF-κB regulation has been focused on understanding how NF-κB is activated by a single inducer. This is unlike the situation in vivo where multiple inflammation inducers, including both exogenous and endogenous mediators, are present concurrently at the site of inflammation. Thus, an important question is raised as to whether mixtures of inflammation inducers would have a significant impact on host-pathogen interactions. Recently, studies from both our laboratory and other laboratories have shown that bacterial chemoattractant fMLP activates NF-κB by IKK-IκB and p38 MAPK signaling pathways (18Ayala J.M. Goyal S.

Therefore, we hypothesized that inflammatory responses are induced by multiple inducers from both exogenous and endogenous sources that operate synergistically by activating multiple signaling pathways and that this synergy is likely to play a significant role in the induction of host defense to bacterial infections and in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders. Here, we report that fMLP and TNFα synergistically induce inflammatory response via multiple signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of synergistic activation of NF-κB by bacterial fMLP and TNFα may involve the induction of RelA acetylation, which is regulated by p38 MAPK. Thus, this study provides direct evidence for the synergistic induction of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory responses by both exogenous and endogenous inducers. The ability of fMLP to synergize with TNFα and to activate NF-κB represents a novel and potentially important mechanism through which bacterial chemoattractant fMLP cannot only attract leukocytes but also directly contribute to inflammation by synergizing with endogenous mediator TNFα. fMLP was purchased from Sigma. Trichostatin A (TSA), TNFα antagonist (R-7050), and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant human TNFα was purchased from Invitrogen. Antibodies for phospho-p65 and phospho-p38 MAPK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotides and their complementary strands for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were from Promega (Madison, WI) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The sequence is 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (NF-κB). Heparinized human peripheral blood from health donors was fractionated on Percoll (GE Healthcare) density gradients. Monocytes were prepared from the mononuclear cell population as described previously (22Schiff D.E. Kline L. Soldau K. Lee J.D. Pugin J. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The monocytic cell line THP-1 cells were differentiated by incubation with 1,25(OH)2D3 for 3 days (23Browning D.D. Pan Z.K. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7995-8001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). THP1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm; Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), and 2-mercaptoethanol (complete media). Human peripheral blood monocytes were stimulated with fMLP and TNFα or fMLP/TNFα for 2 h. Total RNA was isolated by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) by following the manufacturer's instructions. For the reverse transcription reaction, TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems) were used. The reverse transcription reaction was performed for 60 min at 37 °C, followed by 60 min at 42 °C by using oligo(dT) and random hexamers. PCR amplification was performed by using TaqMan Universal Master Mix. Predeveloped TaqMan assay reagents (probe and primer mixture of human TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-8) were used to detect expression of the gene. In brief, reactions were performed in duplicate containing 2× Universal Master Mix, 2 μl of template cDNA, 200 nm primers, and 100 nm probe in a final volume of 25 μl, and they were analyzed in a 96-well optical reaction plate (Applied Biosystems). Probes include a fluorescent reporter dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein, on the 5′ end and labeled with a fluorescent quencher dye, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, on the 3′ end to allow direct detection of the PCR product. Reactions were amplified and quantified by using an ABI 7500 sequence detector and the manufacturer's corresponding software (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantity of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-8 mRNA was obtained by using the comparative Ct method (for details, see User Bulletin 2 for the ABI PRISM 7500 sequence-detection system) and was normalized by using predeveloped TaqMan assay reagent human cyclophilin as an endogenous control (Applied Biosystems). Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (4Pan Z.K. Chen L.Y. Cochrane C.G. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Antibodies against RelA was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and acetyl-lysine was from Upstate. Nuclear extracts were prepared from human peripheral blood monocytes using a modified method of Dignam et al. (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar), and EMSAs were performed using 2.5 μg of the nuclear extract as described previously (25Pan Z.K. Zuraw B.L. Lung C.C. Prossnitz E.R. Browning D.D. Ye R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2042-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The reporter construct NF-κB-LUC was generated as described previously (26Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T.F. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with 0.35 μg of NF-κB-luc and 0.05 μg of pRL-tk-null-luc (reporter gene) (Promega, Madison, WI) using Amaxa according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfected cells were cultivated for 48 h before a 6-h incubation in medium ± fMLP, TNFα, or fMLP/TNFα. Luciferase activity was determined by using the luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or the media were from stimulated human peripheral blood monocytes (fMLP, TNFα, or fMLP/TNFα for 6 h). The fluid or media were collected, and the secreted TNFα was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercial kit (Genzyme Corp.) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The quantities of secreted TNFα in the test samples were determined by using a standard curve generated with purified TNFα. C3H/HeOuJ mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, and all animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Scripps Research Institute and Medical University of Ohio. Under anesthesia, mice were intranasally treated with fMLP (0.5 mg/kg) or TNFα (10 μg/kg) or fMLP plus TNFα in 50 μl of sterile PBS (control). BAL was performed by cannulating the trachea with sterilized PBS, and cells from BAL fluid were stained with Wright-Giemsa stain after cytocentrifuging. For TNFα protein release, BAL fluid was collected, and secreted TNFα was measured by ELISA as described above. To determine whether fMLP and TNFα synergistically activate NF-κB in monocytes and macrophages, we first measured NF-κB-dependent promoter activity by using luciferase reporter plasmid in THP1 cells and RAW274.6 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 5 and 6, both 10 nm fMLP and 10 ng/ml TNFα (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 5 and 6) caused enhanced expression of an NF-κB-controlled reporter gene in THP1 cells (Fig. 1A) and RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1B), but they were ineffective when used at the lower concentrations of 0.1 nm and 0.1 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 2 and 3). However, when THP1 cells or RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with 0.1 nm fMLP and 0.1 ng/ml TNFα together, significant NF-κB activation was seen (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 4). This experiment suggests that synergistic activation of leukocytes could occur at a low concentration of fMLP and TNFα. We then determined whether there was evidence for the synergy in the activation of NF-κB induced by fMLP and TNFα. As shown in Fig. 1, C–E, fMLP synergized with TNFα to activate NF-κB in human peripheral blood monocytes (Fig. 1C), THP1 cells (Fig. 1D), and RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1E). This experiment suggests that synergistic induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine by fMLP and TNFα acts on the level of transcriptional activation. Because of the important role that NF-κB plays in regulating various key inflammatory mediators, we next sought to determine whether fMLP and TNFα also synergistically induce several key NF-κB-dependent inflammatory mediators, including TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-8, by performing real time quantitative PCR analysis to assay mRNA quantitatively and ELISA to detect protein level in monocytes and macrophages. We tested the effect of fMLP and TNFα on the expression of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-8. As shown in Fig. 2, fMLP and TNFα synergistically induce expression of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-8 in human monocytes (Fig. 2A), THP1 cells (Fig. 2B), and RAW274.6 cells (Fig. 2C). We then investigated the role of TNFα antagonist (R-7050, Calbiochem) in synergistic induction of cytokine induction in THP1 cells. TNFα antagonist significantly blocked TNFα-induced cytokine expression and synergistic induction of cytokine by fMLP and TNFα (Fig. 2D). Consistent with these results, synergistic induction of TNFα was not observed in fMLP receptor knockdown cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that synergistic expression of cytokine by fMLP and TNFα appears to involve signaling via both fMLP receptor and TNFα receptor. Collectively, these results indicate that bacterial chemoattractant fMLP and endogenous mediator TNFα synergistically stimulate inflammatory cytokine production in blood monocytes and tissue macrophages. The effects of mixtures of multiple pathogenic factors are more relevant to the in vivo situation occurring during a bacterial infection than the effects of a single inducer. We next determined whether fMLP and TNFα synergistically induce lung inflammatory responses in mice. Mice were treated with fMLP (0.5 mg/kg) and TNFα (10 μg/kg), which were administered intranasally in 50 μl of sterile PBS. After 1 day, BAL fluid was assessed for infiltrating cells (Fig. 3A), and proinflammatory cytokines (Fig. 3B) were examined by ELISA. Mice exposure to mixture of fMLP and TNFα had significantly more infiltrating cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids than did the mice stimulated with either fMLP or TNFα alone. There was also a dramatic and significant increase in the amount of cytokines produced in BAL fluid when mice received mixtures of fMLP and TNFα rather than fMLP or TNFα alone (Fig. 3B). Consistent with these in vivo results, it demonstrates that fMLP and TNFα synergistically induce inflammatory response in vitro and in the murine model of lung inflammation. Many cellular stress stimuli can activate both NF-κB and p38 MAPK molecules (27Schulze-Osthoff K. Ferrari D. Riehemann K. Wesselborg S.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5718-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Because of this overlap, we explored the possibility that activation of p38 is also involved in the synergistic NF-κB activation. We first sought to determine whether activation of p38 MAPK is required for the synergistic NF-κB activation by assessing the effect of SB203580, a specific inhibitor for p38 MAPK (32Adams J.L. Lee D. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 1999; 2: 96-109PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, SB203580 abrogates the synergistic activation of NF-κB in response to fMLP and TNFα. Moreover, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant form of p38 inhibits the synergistic NF-κB activation as well, confirming the involvement of p38 MAPK in the synergistic NF-κB activation (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that p38 MAPK is also involved in the synergistic activation of NF-κB induced by fMLP and TNFα. Recently, acetylation of RelA has been shown to play critical roles in NF-κB activation by enhancing the DNA binding activity of RelA to the κB site (33Chen L.f. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 34Chen L.F. Mu Y. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6539-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 35Chen L.F. Williams S.A. Mu Y. Nakano H. Duerr J.M. Buckbinder L. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7966-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that acetylation of RelA may be involved in mediating the synergy by fMLP and TNF-α. To test our hypothesis, we first assessed RelA acetylation. Interestingly, acetylation of RelA is synergistically induced by fMLP and TNF-α (Fig. 5A). Because acetylation of RelA plays an important role in NF-κB activation by enhancing the DNA binding activity of RelA to the κB site (33Chen L.f. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 34Chen L.F. Mu Y. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6539-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 35Chen L.F.

Biol. 2005; 25: 7966-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), we next investigated the effect of TSA, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, on NF-κB activation induced by TNF-α and fMLP. As shown, TSA treatment further enhanced the synergistic activation of NF-κB induced by TNF-α and fMLP (Fig. 5B). Taken together, we concluded from these results that fMLP synergistically enhances TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation via induction of RelA acetylation. To determine the possible involvement of p38 MAPK in RelA acetylation, we first evaluated the effect of SB203580 on fMLP-induced p38 phosphorylation in THP1 cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, SB203580 inhibits fMLP-induced p38 phosphorylation in THP1 cells. We then evaluated the effect of SB203580 on RelA acetylation. Fig. 6B shows synergistic RelA acetylation by TNF-α, and fMLP was attenuated by SB203580 treatment. Moreover, SB203580 also greatly inhibited synergistic enhancement of inflammatory cytokine TNFα expression induced by fMLP and TNFα as assessed by Q-PCR (Fig. 6C) and by ELISA (Fig. 6D). Thus, these results suggest that p38 MAPK is involved in synergistic activation of NF-κB by fMLP and TNF-α through p38 MAPK-mediated RelA acetylation (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Schematic representation of synergistic NF-κB activation by fMLP and TNFα via p38 MAPK-dependent RelA acetylation in monocytes and macrophages.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Viable bacteria in infected tissue have been observed to attract leukocytes. fMLP was purified and identified as the major peptide from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (36Marasco W.A.

Stimulation of leukocytes with fMLP induced several cellular functions, including directed cell movement, phagocytosis, and the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (38Truett 3rd, A.P.

Recently, we found that fMLP activates NF-κB in monocytes and macrophages, thereby stimulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1, and IL-8. In the host immune system, the leukocytes are often exposed to multiple pathogens, including both exogenous and endogenous sources. Under in vivo situations such as bacterial infection, little is known about the host response to bacterial infection. Many of the fundamental molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions remain unknown. In this study, we showed that mixtures of bacterial chemoattractant fMLP and key inflammatory mediator TNFα behave synergistically in the activation of NF-κB and in the induction of inflammation in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate an important role for bacterial chemoattractant fMLP from exogenous bacteria and key inflammatory cytokine TNFα from endogenous mediators in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections. The most current studies on inflammatory regulation in bacterial infections have focused primarily on the induction of inflammation by a single pathogenic inducer and not by mixtures. Although studies with a single pathogenic inducer are indeed critical for our understanding of the molecular basis of the relevant signaling pathway, the information derived may be insufficient for a full understanding of how inflammation is induced in vivo where both exogenous and endogenous mediators are present simultaneously. In the pathogenesis of bacterial infections, fMLP first interacts with its receptors sitting on the surface of host leukocytes, which, in turn, leads to the up-regulation of genes encoding important inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα. The up-regulated TNFα in response to fMLP will in turn act on the host cells and synergize with fMLP to further induce inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, the signaling mechanisms underlying bacteria-induced inflammation in the presence of both exogenous and endogenous inducers appear to be more complicated than the signaling mechanisms underlying bacteria-induced inflammation in the presence of a single inducer. In this study, we found that fMLP, a bacterial chemoattractant, synergizes with TNFα, a key proinflammatory cytokine, to activate NF-κB in a synergistic manner both in vitro and in vivo. The ability of fMLP to synergize with TNFα and activate NF-κB represents a novel and potentially important mechanism through which bacterial fMLP not only attracts leukocytes but also directly contributes to inflammation by synergizing with the endogenous mediator TNFα. The control of inflammation is likely to best be understood on the level of this synergistic regulation. These results represent an important pathogenic phenomenon, which is not fully understood in bacterial infection. This study has significantly expanded and enhanced our understanding of how inflammation is induced in vivo where multiple inducers, including both exogenous and endogenous sources, are present simultaneously. There is very limited information currently available concerning the synergistic activation of inflammation. A better understanding could bring new insights into the regulation of inflammation and may suggest novel therapeutic strategies or targets to minimize host injury following bacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W2086642679,"It is established that suicide inactivation of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) by drugs and other xenobiotics leads to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the enzyme. The exact mechanism is not known, although it is widely thought that the covalent alteration of the active site during inactivation triggers the degradation. A mechanism that involves recognition of the altered nNOS by Hsp70 and its cochaperone CHIP, an E3-ubiquitin ligase, has been proposed. To further address how alterations of the active site trigger ubiquitination of nNOS, we examined a C331A nNOS mutant, which was reported to have impaired ability to bind L-arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin. We show here that C331A nNOS is highly susceptible to ubiquitination by a purified system containing ubiquitinating enzymes and chaperones, by the endogenous ubiquitinating system in reticulocyte lysate fraction II, and by intact HEK293 cells. The involvement of the altered heme cleft in regulating ubiquitination is confirmed by the finding that the slowly reversible inhibitor of nNOS, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine, but not its inactive D-isomer, protects the C331A nNOS from ubiquitination in all these experimental systems. We also show that both Hsp70 and CHIP play a major role in the ubiquitination of C331A nNOS, although Hsp90 protects from ubiquitination. Thus, these studies further strengthen the link between the mobility of the substrate-binding cleft and chaperone-dependent ubiquitination of nNOS. These results support a general model of chaperone-mediated protein quality control and lead to a novel mechanism for substrate stabilization based on nNOS interaction with the chaperone machinery."

Cross-reactive T cells have previously been characterized at the population level by cytokine secretion and MHC tetramer staining assays, but single-cell analysis is difficult or impossible using these methods. In this study, we describe development of a novel peptide-MHC heterodimer specific for cross-reactive T cells. MHC-peptide monomers were independently conjugated to hydrazide or aldehyde-containing cross-linkers using thiol-maleimide coupling at cysteine residues introduced into recombinant MHC heavy chain proteins. Hydrazone formation provided bi-specific MHC heterodimers carrying two different peptides. Using this approach we prepared heterodimers of the murine class I MHC protein H-2Kb carrying peptides from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and vaccinia virus, and used these to identify cross-reactive CD8+ T cells recognizing both lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and vaccinia virus antigens. A similar strategy could be used to develop reagents to analyze cross-reactive T cell responses in humans.

The cellular immune response to foreign antigens depends on T cell receptor (TCR) 2The abbreviations used are: TCRT cell receptorMHCmajor histocompatibility complexLCMVlymphocytic choriomeningitis virusVVvaccinia virusMTFBmaleimidotrioxaformyl benzaldehydeMHPH3-N-maleimido-6-hydraziniumpyridine hydrochloridePER-phycoerythrinAPCallophycocyaninMFImean fluorescence intensity. recognition of short peptides bound to cell-surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. For CD8+ T cells, antigen specificity is determined by the interaction of TCR with 8–10-mer peptides presented by class I MHC proteins (1Garboczi D.N. Hung D.T. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 3429-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). During T cell development, TCR genes are assembled by somatic recombination of V, D, J, and C gene fragments, with additional diversity introduced by nucleotide addition at the junctions, resulting in a vast repertoire of clonally distributed TCR proteins, with hypervariable regions concentrated in the TCR loops that contact MHC and bound peptide antigen. Despite the diversity of TCR sequences, the diversity of foreign antigens is equally large or larger, and individual TCR are able to recognize multiple peptide sequences. During the negative selection phase of T cell development, autoreactive T cells capable of binding self-MHC-peptide complexes at high affinity are deleted, and it has been suggested that negative selection removes so many TCR sequences that a high level of TCR cross-reactivity is required for the immune system to be able to recognize a sufficiently large set of foreign peptides (2Mason D. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). T cell cross-reactivity has been observed in many systems (3Boen E. Crownover A.R. McIlhaney M.

T cell cross-reactivity appears to provide a molecular basis for T cell heterologous immunity, in which exposure to one pathogen provides protection against another (9Cornberg M. Sheridan B.S. Saccoccio F.M. Brehm M.A. Selin L.K. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 934-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For example, prior infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) protects mice from a lethal dose of vaccinia virus (VV), with LCMV immune mice showing alterations in their T cell response to VV infection due to LCMV-specific T cells cross-reacting with VV (10Chen H.D.

Similar patterns of T cell cross-reactivity have been suggested to underlie protective heterologous immunity between influenza A virus, Epstein-Barr virus (12Clute S.C. Watkin L.B. Cornberg M.

T cell cross-reactivity in these systems has been difficult to study, in part because reagents are not available for isolation and characterization of the cross-reactive T cells.

MHC tetramer staining is a very effective method for isolating and characterizing antigen-specific T cell populations (15Altman J.D. Moss P.A. Goulder P.J. Barouch D.H. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Bell J.I. McMichael A.J. Davis M.M. Science. 1996; 274: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar). In this technique, biotin-labeled recombinant MHC molecules loaded with specific antigenic peptides are oligomerized using fluorescent streptavidin to form highly specific reagents for analysis of antigen-specific T cells in mixed populations using flow cytometry. The use of oligomeric species is necessary because the MHC-TCR interaction is characterized by low affinity and rapid dissociation kinetics (16Altman J.D. Davis M.M. Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2003; : 17.3.1-17.3.33Google Scholar), which precludes use of labeled MHC monomers as specific staining reagents (17Stone J.D. Stern L.J. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). MHC tetramers conventionally are used in T cell staining protocols, mostly because of the ease of introducing biotin labels into recombinant proteins and the availability of a wide variety of fluorescent streptavidin conjugates (15Altman J.D. Moss P.A. Goulder P.J. Barouch D.H. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Bell J.I. McMichael A.J. Davis M.M. Science. 1996; 274: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar). In addition to MHC tetramers, other oligomeric forms of MHC proteins including dimers, trimers, and higher order oligomers are available and also have been used as effective staining reagents (18Fahmy T.M. Bieler J.G. Schneck J.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 268: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Cochran J.R. Cameron T.O. Stone J.D. Lubetsky J.B. Stern L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Antigen-specific analysis and isolation of T cells using MHC tetramers and similar reagents is a mainstay of current immunological practice, and for example, has been used to characterize the fine specificity of the T cell response to VV and LCMV (5Cornberg M. Clute S.C. Watkin L.B. Saccoccio F.M. Kim S.K. Naumov Y.N. Brehm M.A. Aslan N. Welsh R.M. Selin L.K. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 2825-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Chen H.D.

Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, MHC-based staining reagents currently are available only as homo-oligomers with identical MHC-peptide components, and as such have not been used extensively to characterize T cell cross-reactivity. In principle two MHC tetramers could be used in co-staining experiments to evaluate the ability of a particular T cell to cross-react with different MHC-peptide complexes, but in practice competition between the two tetramers severely limits this approach (5Cornberg M. Clute S.C. Watkin L.B. Saccoccio F.M. Kim S.K. Naumov Y.N. Brehm M.A. Aslan N. Welsh R.M. Selin L.K. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 2825-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As an alternate approach to the specific detection and analysis of cross-reactive T cells, we describe here the development of novel bi-specific MHC-peptide dimers, and their use in characterization of cross-reactive T cells by flow cytometry. We employed thiol-maleimide and hydrazine-carbonyl chemistries (21Kitagawa T. Aikawa T. J. Biochem. 1976; 79: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 22King T.P. Zhao S.W. Lam T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5774-5779Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) to functionalize and then cross-link specific peptide complexes of the murine class I MHC molecule H-2Kb, and used fluorescent versions of these MHC heterodimers to specifically stain CD8+ T cells cross-reactive toward LCMV and VV. A previous strategy for production of class II MHC heterodimers has been reported (23Krogsgaard M. Li Q.J. Sumen C. Huppa J.B. Huse M. Davis M.M. Nature. 2005; 434: 238-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), but that strategy relies on sequential differential affinity purification for isolation of heterodimers after nonspecific cross-linking, and was not used for T cell staining or characterization of T cells in mixed populations. Extracellular domains of the murine MHC class I H-2Kb heavy chain carrying a C121R mutation and a non-native C-terminal cysteine introduced at position 282 (17Stone J.D. Stern L.J. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and full-length human light chain β2-microglobulin, were expressed separately as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli and were folded in vitro by dilution in the presence of excess peptide, as previously described for human class I MHCs (1Garboczi D.N. Hung D.T. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 3429-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides purified by reverse phase-HPLC were purchased from 21st Century Biochemicals. Folded H-2Kb monomers were purified by anion exchange chromatography on Poros HQ columns (Roche Applied Science) using a gradient of NaCl from 0–0.5 m in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. The concentration of each H-2Kb monomer was calculated by absorbance spectroscopy after anion exchange chromatography using ϵ280 = 74,955 cm−1 m−1 for H-2Kb heavy chain, ϵ280 = 20,003 cm−1 m−1 for β2-microglobulin light chain, and varied ϵ280 for peptides depending on sequence. Purified H-2Kb monomers were adjusted to a concentration of 10–20 mg/ml using regenerated cellulose filters (Amicon) and stored in 5 mm DTT to prevent the disulfide-linked species. Reduced H-2Kb monomers were purified by size exclusion chromatography using NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare) to remove DTT prior to thiol modification. H-2Kb monomers were reacted with heterobifunctional cross-linkers MTFB (maleimidotrioxaformyl benzaldehyde) or MHPH (3-N-maleimido-6-hydraziniumpyridine hydrochloride) in a 6-fold molar excess for 3 h in 100 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, buffer (Solulink). Cross-linker-modified H-2Kb monomers were purified from free cross-linker by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). MHPH-modified H-2Kb monomers and MTFB-modified H-2Kb monomers were mixed together in a 1:1 molar ratio. The concentration of the reaction mixture (containing MHPH modified H-2Kb monomer and MTFB modified H-2Kb monomer) was adjusted to 1–2 mg/ml using a regenerated cellulose filter (Amicon) and incubated for 20 h at room temperature in the presence of 5 mm aniline (Acros Organics), which was found to catalyze hydrazone formation (24Dirksen A. Dirksen S. Hackeng T.M. Dawson P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 15602-15603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Chemically cross-linked H-2Kb dimers were purified from H-2Kb monomers by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). Purified, unlabeled H-2Kb dimers were stored at 4 °C at a concentration of ∼1 μm for up to 1 month. H-2Kb monomers were purified by size exclusion chromatography using NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare) to remove DTT prior to thiol modification. Reduced H-2Kb monomers were reacted with a 5-fold molar excess of Alexa 647 maleimide (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. Alexa 647-labeled H-2Kb monomers were purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). H-2Kb homodimers and heterodimers, prepared as described above, were adjusted to a concentration greater than 10 μm and labeled with a 20-fold molar excess of Alexa 647 succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen). The labeling reaction was quenched using a 50-fold molar excess of ethanolamine (Sigma), and H-2Kb dimers were re-purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). Reaction yield and labeling efficiency were determined by absorbance spectroscopy after gel filtration purification, using ϵ280 = 265,000 cm−1 m−1 for Alexa 647 succinimidyl ester and the above mentioned ϵ280 for H-2Kb heavy chain, β2-microglobulin light chain, and peptides. All of the H-2Kb dimers were labeled with approximately two Alexa 647 per H-2Kb dimer with the exception of the A11R-A11R-H-2Kb homodimer, which was labeled with approximately four Alexa 647 per dimer. For preparation of Alexa 647-labeled streptavidin-linked H-2Kb tetramers, H-2Kb monomers were first purified by size exclusion chromatography using NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare) to remove DTT prior to thiol modification, and then biotinylated by reacting with a 5-fold molar excess of biotin maleimide (Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature and subsequently re-purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). Biotinylation yield was determined by adding a 2-fold molar excess of streptavidin to the biotinylated H-2Kb monomers with analysis by 12% SDS-PAGE. The biotinylated H-2Kb monomers were subsequently oligomerized by stepwise addition of Alexa 647-streptavidin (Invitrogen) to the biotinylated H-2Kb to a final molar concentration of 1:6. Alexa 647-labeled H-2Kb tetramers/dimers/monomers were checked for the presence of intact peptide by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI). Alexa 647-labeled H-2Kb complexes were purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare), and purified fractions were mixed with UV absorbing matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnaminic acid) prior to laser desorption, ionization, and detection of the ionized species. The sample was analyzed on a Waters MALDI LR spectrometer. LCMV (Armstrong strain), an RNA virus in the Old World arenavirus family, was propagated in BHK-21 baby hamster kidney cells as previously described (25Selin L.K. Nahill S.R. Welsh R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). BL/6 mice were infected intraperitoneally with a non-lethal dose of 5 × 104 plaque-forming units of LCMV as previously described (25Selin L.K. Nahill S.R. Welsh R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Mice were considered immune at greater than 6 weeks after infection (9Cornberg M. Sheridan B.S. Saccoccio F.M. Brehm M.A. Selin L.K. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 934-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Splenocytes from LCMV immune mice were co-cultured with mouse RMA cells that were pulsed with 1 μm GP34 peptide, washed, and then γ-irradiated (3000 rads) as previously described (9Cornberg M. Sheridan B.S. Saccoccio F.M. Brehm M.A. Selin L.K. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 934-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). RMA is a Kb-positive, Rauscher virus-induced, T-lymphoma cell line of BL/6 origin. Briefly, the co-culture of splenocytes and GP34-pulsed RMA cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 100 units/ml of penicillin G, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids, 0.05 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% FBS for 5 days at 37 °C at 5% CO2. Following this initial culture period, cells were harvested and stimulated with GP34 peptide-pulsed RMA cells in the presence of 10% BD T-Stim (BD Biosciences), an IL-2 culture supplement. LCMV-GP34 peptide-pulsed RMA stimulation was repeated every 4 to 5 days. After 20 to 25 days of stimulation (four or five stimulations), T-cell lines were characterized by intracellular cytokine staining or MHC staining. Cell suspensions were incubated in staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% FBS and 0.2% sodium azide) containing anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Fc-block, clone 2.4G2). Cells were washed once with staining buffer and then stained with H-2Kb monomers/dimers/tetramers for 90 min. Thereafter, cells were washed twice with staining buffer and fixed in Cytofix (BD Pharmingen). Samples were analyzed using a BD Biosciences LSRII flow cytometer and FlowJo software (Tree Star). A suspension of 106 cells was stimulated with 1 μm synthetic peptide or a medium only control. Stimulations were performed for 5 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl of RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 units/ml of human recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2), and 0.2 μm brefeldin A (GolgiPlug; BD Pharmingen). After incubation, cell-surface antibody staining with anti-CD8α (clone 53–6.7) and anti-CD44 (clone IM7) was performed. Thereafter, cells were washed twice with staining buffer, and then fixed and permeabilized (Cytofix/Cytoperm; BD Pharmingen). Intracellular cytokine-producing cells were detected with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-mouse interferon-γ (IFN-γ, clone XMG1.2) and APC-labeled anti-mouse tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α, clone MP6-XT22) monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. The samples were analyzed as described above for cell surface staining. To evaluate the utility of bispecific MHC heterodimers in analysis of T cell cross-reactivity, we made use of a previously described system of heterologous immunity, in which infection of mice with the old world arenavirus LCMV confers partial T cell immunity to infection with the poxvirus VV (20Kim S.K. Cornberg M. Wang X.Z. Chen H.D. Selin L.K. Welsh R.M. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Some T cells responding to the LCMV peptide GP34 (AVYNFATM) can cross-react with VV peptide A11R (AIVNYANL) (5Cornberg M. Clute S.C. Watkin L.B. Saccoccio F.M. Kim S.K. Naumov Y.N. Brehm M.A. Aslan N. Welsh R.M. Selin L.K. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 2825-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The GP34 and A11R peptides have side chains that are identical at three of the eight positions (underlined in sequences above), and are conservatively substituted at three other positions. A crystal structure is available for the H-2Kb-GP34–41 complex (26Achour A. Michaëlsson J. Harris R.A. Odeberg J. Grufman P. Sandberg J.K. Levitsky V. Kärre K. Sandalova T. Schneider G. Immunity. 2002; 17: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and shows that the bound GP34 peptide places peptide side chains at the P2(V), P5(F), and P8(M) positions into pockets in the Kb binding site, with the intervening peptide side chains available for TCR interaction (26Achour A.

T cells recognizing this peptide form a substantial component of the overall Kb-restricted response to LCMV (27Puglielli M.T. Zajac A.J. van der Most R.G. Dzuris J.L. Sette A. Altman J.D. Ahmed R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The A11R peptide conforms to the Kb-binding motif (26Achour A. Michaëlsson J. Harris R.A. Odeberg J. Grufman P. Sandberg J.K.

No structural information is available for the Kb-A11R complex, but the peptide is known to bind to Kb (9Cornberg M. Sheridan B.S. Saccoccio F.M. Brehm M.A. Selin L.K. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 934-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), forming a subdominant epitope that persists in the Kb-restricted response to VV (5Cornberg M. Clute S.C. Watkin L.B.

These peptides, together with two unrelated Kb-binding LCMV-derived peptides NP205 and GP118, and control tight-binding designed peptide SIY (4Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J.

Open table in a new tab T cell cross-reactivity in this system was addressed first by intracellular cytokine staining (Fig. 1A). BL/6 mice were infected with LCMV and allowed to recover for 6 weeks. Splenocytes from the LCMV immune mice were stimulated in vitro with Kb-expressing RMA cells pre-pulsed with the LCMV-GP34 peptide, to expand the population of T cells that respond to this peptide, and were rested for 3–4 days prior to experimentation. After expansion, intracellular cytokine staining experiments (Fig. 1A) showed that the majority (56.3%) of the CD8+, CD44+ T cells secreted both TNFα (x axis) and IFNγ (y axis) in response to the GP34 peptide. The same cells were tested for their response to other peptides. In response to the VV-A11R peptide, 31.5% of T cells secreted both IFNγ and TNFα. Thus, at least a portion of the LCMV-GP34-specific T cells must be cross-reactive for VV-A11R. Similarly, if only the cells secreting TNFα are considered, 34.6% were positive in response to VV-A11R. Because nearly all (96.3%) were positive in response to LCMV-GP34, a majority of the 34.6% positive to VV-A11R must also cross-react with LCMV-GP34. The T cell population showed no reactivity against two other peptide epitopes from LCMV, GP118, and NP205 (Fig. 1A). MHC tetramer staining similarly demonstrates that a portion of the T cell population can engage both VV-A11R and LCMV-GP34 peptide epitopes (Fig. 1B). T cells were stained with fluorescently labeled streptavidin-linked tetramers carrying VV or LCMV peptides bound to biotinylated H-2Kb, or with control tetramers carrying an unrelated SIY peptide (SIYRYYGL). The SIY peptide is a self-antigen not expected to induce T cell responses in Kb+ mice (4Udaka K. Wiesmüller K.H. Kienle S. Jung G. Walden P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 670-678PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 1B, cognate tetramer staining (blue traces) is overlaid with control-SIY tetramer staining (red traces). Staining with A11R tetramer and GP34 tetramer clearly identifies in both cases positive and negative populations, with the negative staining population overlapping with the control tetramer stain. The fraction of cells staining positive for the VV-A11R tetramer is 50.9% and the fraction staining positive for LCMV-GP34 is 63.7%, again indicating that at least some of the T cells cross-react with both VV-A11R and LCMV-GP34 peptide complexes. The specificity of the MHC tetramers is further confirmed by the lack of staining for the related LCMV-GP118 tetramer, which completely overlaps with the control-SIY tetramer staining (Fig. 1B). In principle, cross-reactive T cell populations could be identified by co-staining with two differently labeled tetramers, but in practice competition between the two MHC tetramers greatly complicates this approach. We evaluated such tetramer cross-competition using the VV-A11R and LCMV-GP34 cross-reactive cell line. Double MHC tetramer staining experiments were performed using various mixtures of cognate MHC tetramers (VV-A11R and LCMV-GP34) and noncognate MHC tetramers (LCMV-GP118, control-SIY). In each experiment one MHC-tetramer was prepared using streptavidin coupled to PE, with another prepared using streptavidin coupled to allophycocyanin (APC), so that binding of both tetramers could be monitored simultaneously (Fig. 2). Prior to coupling to streptavidin, each MHC-peptide complex was evaluated by an SDS-PAGE mobility shift assay (supplemental Fig. S1) to ensure essentially complete biotinylation. When cognate VV-A11R-PE tetramer was mixed with non-cognate LCMV-GP118-APC tetramer or with the control-SIY-APC tetramer, the T cell staining percentages and intensities were similar to staining experiments performed with VV-A11R-PE tetramer alone. For example, the VV-A11R-PE tetramer in the presence of non-cognate LCMV-GP118-APC stained 52.8% of the cells (Fig. 2A), as compared with 50.9% for the VV-A11R-PE tetramer alone (Fig. 1B), or 50.5% for VV-A11R-PE in the presence of control SIY-APC tetramer (Fig. 2B). Similarly, staining of the cross-reactive cell population by the cognate LCMV-GP34-APC tetramer, which stained 63.7% of the cells (Fig. 1B), was not greatly altered in the presence of the non-cognate LCMV-GP118-PE tetramer, which stained 59.9% (Fig. 2C). However, staining of the LCMV-GP34-APC tetramer was dramatically reduced in the presence of the cognate VV-A11R-PE tetramer, with only 15.5% of the cells staining positive (Fig. 2E). For the VV-A11R-PE tetramer, the presence of the LCMV-GP34-APC tetramer had a much smaller effect, with the reduction in staining barely discernable (48.7% positive, Fig. 2E). The fluorescence intensity changes followed the same pattern, with the VV-A11R-PE tetramer exhibiting mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 843 in a single tetramer stain, 825 and 793 in a double tetramer stain with non-cognate tetramers LCMV-GP118-APC and SIY-APC, respectively, and 727 in a double tetramer stain with cognate LCMV-GP34-APC. LCMV-GP34-APC MFI was 1268 as a single tetramer, 1082 in the presence of non-cognate SIY-PE, and decreased substantially to 551 in the presence of cognate VV-A11R-PE. Overall, the presence of cognate tetramer causes a shift in the LCMV-GP34-APC staining intensity, so that the double positive population (upper right quadrant) now significantly overlaps with the singly positive VV-A11R-PE single positive population (upper left quadrant), with only 12.5% of the cell"

Among the α2-adrenoceptors, the α2B-subtype may also influence developmental signaling pathways involved in angiogenesis of the placenta. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether α2B-adrenoceptors are also involved in other developmental processes beyond placental angiogenesis. Ablation of α2B-adrenoceptors led to lethality of mutant mice during the first hours after birth. Despite normal breathing and drinking behavior, mutant mice developed cyanosis, which could be traced back to a defect in lung morphology with significantly reduced alveolar volume and thickened interalveolar septi. In α2B-deficient lungs and in isolated alveolar type II cells, expression of sonic hedgehog (SHH) was significantly increased, resulting in mesenchymal proliferation. In vitro α2B-adrenoreceptor stimulation suppressed expression of sonic hedgehog and the cell cycle genes cyclin D1 and Ki67. In vivo inhibition of enhanced SHH signaling by the smoothened antagonist cyclopamine partially rescued perinatal lethality, lung morphology, and altered gene expression in mutant mice. Thus, α2B-adrenoceptors in lung epithelia play an important role in suppressing sonic hedgehog-mediated proliferation of mesenchymal cells and thus prevent respiratory failure. α2-Adrenoceptors belong to the family of adrenergic receptors, which regulate the neuronal release of norepinephrine as part of a negative feedback loop.

In addition to the modulation of physiological functions in the adult organism, the α2B-receptor subtype also plays an important role during embryonic development (9Muthig V. Gilsbach R. Haubold M.

Mice lacking functional α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-adrenoceptors on a mixed genetic background died between embryonic days 9.5 and 11.5 from a severe defect in yolk sac and placental development (10Philipp M. Brede M.E. Hadamek K. Gessler M. Lohse M.J. Hein L. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This defect was mostly ascribed to loss of α2B-adrenoreceptor function as α2B-deficient mice, which were backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 background, showed a similar defect in placenta vasculogenesis (9Muthig V.

The purpose of the present study was to identify the function of α2B-adrenoceptors in embryonic and perinatal development in mice.

The targeted deletion of the α2B-adrenoceptor gene (Adra2b−) has been described previously (7Link R.E. Desai K. Hein L. Stevens M.E. Chruscinski A. Bernstein D. Barsh G.S. Kobilka B.K. Science. 1996; 273: 803-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). For this study, Adra2b−/− mice, which were backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 background (Harlan Winkelmann, Borchen, Germany) for 12 generations, were used (9Muthig V. Gilsbach R. Haubold M. Philipp M. Ivacevic T. Gessler M. Hein L. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All animal procedures were approved by the responsible animal care committee of the University of Freiburg, Germany. Genotyping was performed with primers as described previously (9Muthig V.

Cyclopamine (18 mg/kg of body weight, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) was applied subcutaneously to pregnant mice. Lungs and hearts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin or araldite. Cardiac sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Semithin araldite sections of the lung were stained with methylene blue (11Beetz N. Harrison M.D. Brede M. Zong X. Urbanski M.J. Sietmann A. Kaufling J. Barrot M. Seeliger M.W.

For immunodetection of sonic hedgehog, cryostat sections were incubated with primary antiserum (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) followed by an Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany). Nuclei were visualized by brief incubation with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich). Blood slides were stained with Giemsa and May-Grünwald solutions (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Alveolar type II cells were isolated as described with modifications (13Corti M. Brody A.R. Harrison J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions from bronchoalveolar lavage of neonatal mice were passed through 100-, 40- (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany), and 20-μm (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) filters and incubated with biotinylated anti-CD31, anti-CD45, and anti-CD16/32 antibodies (BD Biosciences). Then streptavidin-coated magnetic particles (Biotin Binder Dynabeads, Invitrogen) were added. Magnetic particles were captured using a magnetic tube separator (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), and the remaining cells were plated on tissue culture dishes for 16 h to remove further contaminating cells. Cell suspensions were finally seeded on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips. After 4–6 h of cultivation, cells were used for gene expression analysis or were cultivated for an additional 16 h and stained with methylene blue for cell identification. Total RNA was prepared from lung samples and primary alveolar type II cells with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For quantitative real-time PCR analyses, 35 μl of the amplification mixture (Qiagen, QuantiTect SYBR Green kit) was used containing 20 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA and 300 nmol/liter primers (supplemental Table 1, Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany). Reactions were incubated in triplicate on an MX3000P detector (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). The cycling conditions were: 15 s of polymerase activation at 95 °C and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, at 58 °C for 30 s, and at 72 °C for 30 s (5Gilsbach R. Röser C. Beetz N. Brede M. Hadamek K.

Recordings were obtained at a sampling frequency of 2 kHz using the ECG module of ADI Chart software (AD Instruments, Castle Hill, Australia). Blood glucose was determined using an AccuChek sensor (Roche Applied Science, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany). Data are presented as means ± S.E. of individual data points. Data were analyzed using one- or two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests or Student's t test, respectively, if not indicated otherwise. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Heterozygous intercrosses of α2B-adrenoceptor-deficient mice resulted in a percentage of Adra2b−/− mice at weaning age that was significantly lower than the predicted Mendelian ratio (Fig. 1a, 3 Adra2b−/− out of 98 offspring at postnatal day P25). Between embryonic days E10.5 and E18.5, however, the genotype distribution did not deviate significantly from the predicted Mendelian ratio. Most α2B-deficient mice died during the day of birth (Fig. 1a). Newborn α2B-deficient mice showed normal breathing rate (Fig. 1b) and drinking behavior, as evidenced by the presence of visible milk in their stomach. At this time, blood glucose levels did not differ between genotypes (Fig. 1c). No alterations in hematopoiesis could be identified as erythrocyte counts and morphology were normal in α2B-deficient mice on postnatal day 0 (Fig. 1d). Hepatic mRNA expression of hemoglobin chains did not differ early after birth (Fig. 1d). However, during the next hours, Adra2b−/− mice were retarded in their weight gain and became cyanotic. Cardiac structure and function did not differ between wild-type and α2B-mutant mice on postnatal day 0 (Fig. 2). ECG recordings revealed normal cardiac rhythm with no signs for conduction deficits in α2B-deficient mice after birth (Fig. 2, a–g). Upon microscopical investigation of Adra2b−/− hearts, all valves and chambers were properly developed, and postnatal closure of the ductus arteriosus Botalli was normal (Fig. 2, h–j, p = 0.34). However, the right ventricle was significantly dilated in Adra2b−/− as compared with wild-type hearts (internal diameter in Adra2b+/+, 564.8 ± 58.3 μm, n = 5, versus Adra2b−/−, 937.4 ± 87.4 μm, n = 4, p < 0.01). Organ weights of heart, kidney, and liver were similar between genotypes, but α2B-deficient mice had significantly lower body and lung weights than wild-type mice (Table 1).TABLE 1Body and organ weights of newborn Adra2b−/− and Adra2b+/+ mice (P0)Adra2b+/+nAdra2b−/−npBody weight P0 (g)1.322 ± 0.026311.004 ± 0.023240.0001Heart weight P0 (g)0.008 ± 0.001110.007 ± 0.00160.1796Lung weight P0 (g)0.029 ± 0.00190.019 ± 0.00240.0001Liver weight P0 (g)0.044 ± 0.003110.038 ± 0.00360.1786Kidney weight P0 (g)0.013 ± 0.00140.012 ± 0.00160.0922 Open table in a new tab Reduced lung weight, cyanosis, and dilatation of the right ventricle led us to investigate pulmonary development and morphology (Fig. 3). Between embryonic days E14.5 and E18.5, lungs from Adra2b−/− mice developed normally, and cellular versus alveolar/bronchial spaces were similarly distributed between genotypes (Fig. 3, a–l). However, early after birth, lungs of Adra2b−/− mice were less inflated and showed reduced alveolar spaces and thickened interalveolar septi (Fig. 3, j–l). Capillary density did not differ between genotypes. Adra2b−/− lungs were characterized by a significantly higher degree of mitosis and increased expression of the cell cycle markers cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) and Ki67 (Mki67) (Fig. 4, a–c). Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that α2B-adrenoceptors were expressed at 3.3- and 3.7-fold higher levels in the lung as compared with α2A- or α2C-adrenoceptors, respectively (Fig. 4d). To determine the cellular localization of α2B-adrenoceptors, bronchial epithelia, which stained positively for expression of SHH and interstitial lung tissue, were microdissected and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 4e). Bronchial specimens showed 5-fold higher α2B-mRNA expression than interstitial cells, suggesting that α2B-receptors are coexpressed with SHH in epithelial cells of the lung (Fig. 4f).FIGURE 4Rate of mitosis, cell cycle gene expression, and α2-adrenoceptor subtype distribution in the lung. a, Adra2b−/− lungs contained significantly more mitotic cells (inset, arrowhead) as compared with wild-type lungs on postnatal day 0 (bar, 10 μm). b and c, mRNA expression of cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 (Ccnd1, b) and Ki67 (Mki67, b) was significantly higher in Adra2b−/− lungs on day P0 (a–c, n = 5 per genotype, *, p < 0.05, ***, p < 0.001 versus Adra2b+/+). d, α2B-adrenoceptors were expressed at higher mRNA levels in the wild-type lung on day P0 than α2A- or α2C-adrenoceptors (d, n = 4–6 per genotype, **, p < 0.01 versus Adra2a). e and f, immunostaining of SHH in bronchial epithelia of the wild-type lung on day P0. e, lower panel, DAPI fluorescence to detect nuclei (bars, 20 μm). f, α2B-adrenoreceptor mRNA expression in bronchial epithelial cells and interstitial cells after microdissection from cryostat sections of wild-type lungs on day P0 (n = 4 per group).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To search for the mechanism of the defect in perinatal lung development in mutant mice, genes that have previously been shown to play an essential role for lung development were determined in their expression on day P0 (supplemental Table 2). Out of 40 genes tested, 6 were increased in their expression in Adra2b−/− lungs, including Ccnd1, Flt1, Mki67, Ptch1, Shh, and Vegfa (supplemental Table 2). Of these genes, sonic hedgehog (Shh) was most strongly up-regulated in Adra2b−/− versus wild-type lung tissue (supplemental Table 2). Also, the SHH receptor patched (Ptch1) was significantly increased in its expression (supplemental Table 2). However, smoothened (Smo), which interacts with patched, did not differ in its expression between genotypes (supplemental Table 2). To test whether Shh is regulated in epithelial cells, ATII cells were isolated on postnatal day 0. To validate the cell isolation procedure, the expression of Ddr2, a fibroblast marker (16Goldsmith E.C. Hoffman A. Morales M.O. Potts J.D. Price R.L. McFadden A. Rice M. Borg T.K. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 230: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), Pecam, an endothelial marker (17Kobayashi M. Inoue K. Warabi E. Minami T. Kodama T. J. Atheroscler.

Relative to Spb, expression of Pecam and Ddr2 was significantly reduced in primary cultured ATII cells as compared with intact lungs, confirming enrichment of ATII cells (Fig. 5a). Light microscopic analysis confirmed the purity of the cultivated ATII cells (18Dobbs L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: L134-L147PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kalina M. Riklis S. Histochemistry. 1988; 88: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and did not indicate morphological differences between genotypes (Fig. 5b). The expression of Shh mRNA was 3-fold higher in Adra2b−/− versus wild-type ATII cells (Fig. 5c). We hypothesized that α2B-receptors might modulate expression of Shh to control perinatal lung development. Lung slices from wild-type and α2B-deficient E17.5 embryos were maintained in DMEM in vitro and were stimulated with the α2-agonist medetomidine (Fig. 5, d–i). Medetomidine suppressed Shh mRNA expression in wild-type but not in α2B-deficient lungs (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, SHH protein levels were lower in lung specimens that were cultivated in the presence of medetomidine (Fig. 5e). Lung section histology was not affected by the in vitro culture (Fig. 5f). Expression of cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) and the sonic hedgehog target genes Gli1 and Gli2 but not Gli3 was significantly reduced by the α2-adrenoceptor agonist medetomidine (Fig. 5, g and i). To test whether dysregulated Shh expression might be causally related to the pulmonary phenotype in α2B-deficient mice, pregnant mice from heterozygous crosses were treated with the smoothened antagonist cyclopamine (20Chen J.K. Taipale J. Cooper M.K. Beachy P.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2743-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 21Cooper M.K. Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1603-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) starting on embryonic day E17.5. Cyclopamine treatment significantly increased the percentage of mutant mice surviving the immediate perinatal period (Fig. 6a, p = 0.017). One day after birth (P1), lung histology of cyclopamine-treated α2B-deficient mice did not differ from wild-type lungs (Fig. 6, b–d). Furthermore, expression of Shh and the cell cycle markers Ccnd1 and Mki67 was significantly reduced in Adra2b−/−lungs after cyclopamine treatment (Fig. 6, e–g). The main finding of the present study is that α2B-adrenoceptors are essential for perinatal survival and lung development in mice. α2B-Adrenoceptors may modulate the interaction between epithelial and mesenchymal cells by suppressing sonic hedgehog expression and signaling (Fig. 7). Ablation of α2B-adrenoceptor expression led to early postnatal respiratory failure. α2B-Adrenoceptors contribute to presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release (22Trendelenburg A.U. Philipp M.

Anesthesiology. 2005; 102: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, the α2B-subtype is unique among the adrenoceptors because it plays an essential role during embryonic development (9Muthig V. Gilsbach R. Haubold M. Philipp M. Ivacevic T. Gessler M. Hein L. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Philipp M. Brede M.E. Hadamek K. Gessler M. Lohse M.J. Hein L. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of α2B-receptors in extraembryonic development (9Muthig V. Gilsbach R. Haubold M. Philipp M. Ivacevic T. Gessler M. Hein L. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Philipp M. Brede M.E. Hadamek K. Gessler M. Lohse M.J. Hein L. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), i.e. placenta and yolk sac, the present study shows that α2B-receptors are also essential for perinatal survival and adaption of the lung of newborn mice. Several factors confirm the finding that perinatal lethality in Adra2b−/− mice is caused by lung failure. Several essential postnatal functions including breathing, drinking behavior, and cardiac rhythm appeared normal in α2B-deficient mice immediately after birth. Several hours after birth, mutant mice became cyanotic, which is consistent with the observed thickening of interalveolar septi and reduced air spaces in the lung. Thus, the distance for gas exchange between alveoles and capillaries may be increased in mutant mice, reducing gas exchange and ultimately causing respiratory failure. In accordance with this mechanism, hypoxia may elicit pulmonary vasoconstriction, which leads to increased vascular resistance and dilatation of the right ventricle. A similar chain of events has been observed in mice lacking pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptors (25Otto C. Hein L. Brede M. Jahns R. Engelhardt S. Gröne H.J. Schütz G. Circulation. 2004; 110: 3245-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast to the embryonic period, where α2B is essential for vascular development in the placenta, pulmonary vascular development was not significantly altered by α2B-ablation as capillary density did not differ between wild-type and Adra2b−/− lungs. Other organ systems that have been suggested to be regulated by α2B-receptors also developed normally in Adra2b−/− mice. α2B-Receptors are abundantly expressed in hematopoietic cells in the fetal liver (26Cussac D. Schaak S. Denis C. Flordellis C. Calise D. Paris H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, erythrocyte counts and morphology as well as hemoglobin synthesis in the liver were normal as compared with wild-type mice. Our data suggest that dysregulation of sonic hedgehog signaling in the lung is causally related to the developmental defect in the lung. SHH has previously been shown to play an important role in the determination of cell fate and embryonic patterning. General ablation of SHH expression caused severe lung malformations, hypoplasia, and deficient branching morphogenesis (27Pepicelli C.V. Lewis P.M. McMahon A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1083-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 28Chiang C. Litingtung Y. Lee E. Young K.E. Corden J.L. Westphal H. Beachy P.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). Transgenic re-expression of SHH in respiratory epithelial cells substantially rescued the peripheral lung morphogenesis defect observed in SHH-deficient mice (29Miller L.A. Wert S.E. Clark J.C. Xu Y. Perl A.K. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 231: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SHH under control of the surfactant protein C promoter led to a similar phenotype as observed in α2B-deficient mice, i.e. early postnatal lethality, thickened septi in the lung, and proliferation of mesenchymal cells (30Bellusci S. Furuta Y. Rush M.G. Henderson R. Winnier G. Hogan B.L. Development. 1997; 124: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the α2B-deficient mice, SHH transgenic pups died soon after birth due to respiratory failure (30Bellusci S. Furuta Y. Rush M.G. Henderson R. Winnier G. Hogan B.L. Development. 1997; 124: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SHH may play a causal role in the phenotype elicited by ablation of α2B-expression (Fig. 7). In vitro, stimulation of α2B-receptors suppressed expression of SHH and cell cycle markers cyclin D1 and Ki67. These results indicate that SHH is under tonic inhibition by α2B-adrenoceptors in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of enhanced SHH signaling by the smoothened antagonist cyclopamine partially rescued the perinatal lethality and the pulmonary phenotype. Cyclopamine has been demonstrated to specifically block hedgehog signaling by direct binding to the G protein-coupled receptor smoothened (20Chen J.K. Taipale J. Cooper M.K. Beachy P.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2743-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 21Cooper M.K. Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1603-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to identify the precise intracellular pathway linking α2B-receptors with SHH repression. In addition, it will be important to define the role of α2B-receptors in the development of pulmonary diseases, including lung fibrosis and inflammation. In conclusion, α2B-adrenoceptors suppress sonic hedgehog to control this important epithelial-mesenchymal signaling pathway, which is essential for lung development.
