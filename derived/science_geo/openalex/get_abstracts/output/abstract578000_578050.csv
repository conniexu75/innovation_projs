https://openalex.org/W2577502906,"Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for rare diseases (RDs) are scarce, may be difficult to identify through Internet searches and may vary in quality depending on the source and methodology used. In order to contribute to the improvement of the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients, Orphanet (www.orpha.net) has set up a procedure for the selection, quality evaluation and dissemination of CPGs, with the aim to provide easy access to relevant, accurate and specific recommendations for the management of RDs. This article provides an analysis of selected CPGs by medical domain coverage, prevalence of diseases, languages and type of producer, and addresses the variability in CPG quality and availability. CPGs are identified via bibliographic databases, websites of research networks, expert centres or medical societies. They are assessed according to quality criteria derived from the Appraisal of Guidelines, REsearch and Evaluation (AGREE II) Instrument. Only open access CPGs and documents for which permission from the copyright holders has been obtained are disseminated on the Orphanet website. From January 2012 to July 2015, 277 CPGs were disseminated, representing coverage of 1,122 groups of diseases, diseases or subtypes in the Orphanet database. No language restriction is applied, and so far 10 languages are represented, with a predominance of CPGs in English, French and German (92% of all CPGs). A large proportion of diseases with identified CPGs belong to rare oncologic, neurologic, hematologic diseases or developmental anomalies. The Orphanet project on CPG collection, evaluation and dissemination is a continuous process, with regular addition of new guidelines, and updates. CPGs meeting the quality criteria are integrated to the Orphanet database of rare diseases, together with other types of textual information and the appropriate services for patients, researchers and healthcare professionals in 40 countries."

Most of the patients were newly diagnosed and none of them received antibiotics. Using a reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) method, we determined the composition of microbiota. NOD2/CARD15 genotyping was also studied.Total bacterial DNA concentration was increased in tissue and blood samples of IBD patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, the active IBD cases had higher total bacterial DNA concentration levels compared to the inactive cases. Three species characterized dysbiosis in IBD, namely an increase of Bacteroides spp in active and inactive IBD samples, and a decrease in Clostridium leptum group (IV), and Faecalibacterium prausnitzi in both active and inactive IBD patients. No significant association between bacterial translocation and NOD2/CARD15 mutations was found.The composition of the microbiota in IBD patients differs from that of healthy controls. The high rate of bacterial DNA in the blood samples indicates translocation in inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2579334036,"Inflammation and apoptosis develop in skeletal muscle after major trauma, including burn injury, and play a pivotal role in insulin resistance and muscle wasting. We and others have shown that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), a major mediator of inflammation, plays an important role in stress (e.g., burn)-induced insulin resistance. However, it remains to be determined how iNOS induces insulin resistance. Moreover, the interrelation between inflammatory response and apoptosis is poorly understood, although they often develop simultaneously. Nuclear factor (NF)-κB and p53 are key regulators of inflammation and apoptosis, respectively. Sirt1 inhibits p65 NF-κB and p53 by deacetylating these transcription factors. Recently, we have shown that iNOS induces S-nitrosylation of Sirt1, which inactivates Sirt1 and thereby increases acetylation and activity of p65 NF-κB and p53 in various cell types, including skeletal muscle cells. Here, we show that iNOS enhances burn-induced inflammatory response and apoptotic change in mouse skeletal muscle along with S-nitrosylation of Sirt1. Burn injury induced robust expression of iNOS in skeletal muscle and gene disruption of iNOS significantly inhibited burn-induced increases in inflammatory gene expression and apoptotic change. In parallel, burn increased Sirt1 S-nitrosylation and acetylation and DNA-binding capacity of p65 NF-κB and p53, all of which were reversed or ameliorated by iNOS deficiency. These results indicate that iNOS functions not only as a downstream effector but also as an upstream enhancer of burn-induced inflammatory response, at least in part, by Sirt1 S-nitrosylation-dependent activation (acetylation) of p65 NF-κB. Our data suggest that Sirt1 S-nitrosylation may play a role in iNOS-mediated enhanced inflammatory response and apoptotic change, which, in turn, contribute to muscle wasting and supposedly to insulin resistance after burn injury."
https://openalex.org/W2578534549,"The worldwide need for human cornea equivalents continues to grow. Few clinical options are limited to allogenic and synthetic material replacements. We hypothesized that tissue engineered human cornea systems based on mechanically robust, patterned, porous, thin, optically clear silk protein films, in combination with human corneal stromal stem cells (hCSSCs), would generate 3D functional corneal stroma tissue equivalents, in comparison to previously developed 2D approaches. Silk film contact guidance was used to control the alignment and distribution of hCSSCs on RGD-treated single porous silk films, which were then stacked in an orthogonally, multi-layered architecture and cultured for 9 weeks. These systems were compared similar systems generated with human corneal fibroblasts (hCFs). Both cell types were viable and preferentially aligned along the biomaterial patterns for up to 9 weeks in culture. H&E histological sections showed that the systems seeded with the hCSSCs displayed ECM production throughout the entire thickness of the constructs. In addition, the ECM proteins tested positive for keratocyte-specific tissue markers, including keratan sulfate, lumican, and keratocan. The quantification of hCSSC gene expression of keratocyte-tissue markers, including keratocan, lumican, human aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 (ALDH3A1), prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTDGS), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4), within the 3D tissue systems demonstrated upregulation when compared to 2D single silk films and to the systems generated with the hCFs. Furthermore, the production of ECM from the hCSSC seeded systems and subsequent remodeling of the initial matrix significantly improved cohesiveness and mechanical performance of the constructs, while maintaining transparency after 9 weeks."
https://openalex.org/W2574396718,"In hemodialysis patients, fluid overload and malnutrition are accompanied by extracellular fluid (ECF) expansion and intracellular fluid (ICF) depletion, respectively. We investigated the relationship between ECF/ICF ratio (as an integrated marker reflecting both fluid overload and malnutrition) and survival and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the context of malnutrition-inflammation-arteriosclerosis (MIA) complex.Seventy-seven patients from a single hemodialysis unit were prospectively enrolled. The ECF/ICF volume was measured by segmental multi-frequency bioimpedance analysis. MIA and volume status were measured by serum albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), respectively.The mean ECF/ICF ratio was 0.56±0.06 and the cut-off value for maximum discrimination of survival was 0.57. Compared with the low ECF/ICF group, the high ECF/ICF group (ratio≥0.57, 42%) had higher all-cause mortality, CVD, CRP, PWV, and BNP, but lower serum albumin. During the 5-year follow-up, 24 all-cause mortality and 38 CVD occurred (18 and 24, respectively, in the high ECF/ICF group versus 6 and 14 respectively in the low ECF/ICF group, P<0.001). In the adjusted Cox analysis, the ECF/ICF ratio nullifies the effects of the MIA and volume status on survival and CVD and was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and CVD: hazard ratio (95% confidence interval); 1.12 (1.01-1.25) and 1.09 (1.01-1.18) for a 0.01 increase in the ECF/ICF ratio. The degree of malnutrition (albumin), inflammation (CRP), arteriosclerosis (PWV), and fluid overload (BNP) were correlated well with the ECF/ICF ratio.Hemodialysis patients with high ECF/ICF ratio are not only fluid overloaded, but malnourished and have stiff artery with more inflammation. The ECF/ICF ratio is highly related to the MIA complex, and is a major risk indicator for all-cause mortality and CVD."
https://openalex.org/W2575855038,"In a recent study, supplementation of infant formula with milk fat globule membranes (MFGM) decreased the incidence of otitis media in infants <6 months of age.The aim of the present study was to characterize the oral microbiota in infants fed MFGM-supplemented formula and compare it to that of infants fed standard formula or breast milk.In a prospective double-blinded randomized controlled trial, exclusively formula-fed infants <2 months of age were randomized to be fed experimental formula (EF, n = 80) with reduced energy and protein and supplemented with a bovine MFGM concentrate, or standard formula (SF, n = 80) until 6 months of age. A breast-fed reference (BFR, n = 80) group was also recruited. The oral microbiota was analyzed at 4 (n = 124) and 12 (n = 166) months of age using Illumina MiSeq multiplex sequencing and taxonomic resolution against the HOMD 16S rDNA database of oral bacteria.Species richness in the oral samples did not differ between the EF and SF groups, but partial least square modeling identified a few taxa that were significantly associated with being in either group, e.g. lower level of Moraxella catarrhalis in the EF group. Infants in the BFR group had significantly lower species richness at 4 months of age and their microbiota pattern differed markedly from the formula-fed groups.Supplementation of infant formula with MFGM yielded moderate effects on the oral microbiome. Moraxella catarrhalis was less prevalent in infants fed EF than in those fed SF and may be associated with the decrease in otitis media seen in the same group."
https://openalex.org/W2571707190,"Sphingolipids are a diverse class of essential cellular lipids that function as structural membrane components and as signaling molecules. Cells acquire sphingolipids by both de novo biosynthesis and recycling of exogenous sphingolipids. The individual importance of these pathways for the generation of essential sphingolipids in differentiated cells is not well understood. To investigate the requirement for de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis in adipocytes, a cell type with highly regulated lipid metabolism, we generated mice with an adipocyte-specific deletion of Sptlc1 Sptlc1 is an obligate subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for the first and rate-limiting step of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis. These mice, which initially developed adipose tissue, exhibited a striking age-dependent loss of adipose tissue accompanied by evidence of adipocyte death, increased macrophage infiltration, and tissue fibrosis. Adipocyte differentiation was not affected by the Sptlc1 deletion. The mice also had elevated fasting blood glucose, fatty liver, and insulin resistance. Collectively, these data indicate that de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis is required for adipocyte cell viability and normal metabolic function and that reduced de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis within adipocytes is associated with adipocyte death, adipose tissue remodeling, and metabolic dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2573477940,"The failure of pancreatic islet β-cells is a major contributor to the etiology of type 2 diabetes. β-Cell dysfunction and declining β-cell mass are two mechanisms that contribute to this failure, although it is unclear whether they are molecularly linked. Here, we show that the cell cycle regulator, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), couples primary β-cell dysfunction to the progressive deterioration of β-cell mass in diabetes. Mice with pancreas-specific deletion of Cdk2 are glucose-intolerant, primarily due to defects in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Accompanying this loss of secretion are defects in β-cell metabolism and perturbed mitochondrial structure. Persistent insulin secretion defects culminate in progressive deficits in β-cell proliferation, reduced β-cell mass, and diabetes. These outcomes may be mediated directly by the loss of CDK2, which binds to and phosphorylates the transcription factor FOXO1 in a glucose-dependent manner. Further, we identified a requirement for CDK2 in the compensatory increases in β-cell mass that occur in response to age- and diet-induced stress. Thus, CDK2 serves as an important nexus linking primary β-cell dysfunction to progressive β-cell mass deterioration in diabetes.

Thus, CDK2 serves as an important nexus linking primary β-cell dysfunction to progressive β-cell mass deterioration in diabetes. Diabetes is strongly associated with a failure of pancreatic islet β-cells, although the mechanisms of β-cell failure remain unclear (1.Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P.

Bonner-Weir S. Five stages of evolving beta-cell dysfunction during progression to diabetes.Diabetes. 2004; 53: S16-S21Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Further, ample evidence supports the notion that reduced β-cell mass is a contributor to insulin insufficiency (3.Weir G.C. Bonner-Weir S.

Understanding the link between β-cell function and β-cell mass and the compensatory mechanisms that are elicited in response to rising blood sugar will aid in designing the next generation of therapeutic agents to restore β-cell function while preserving β-cell mass in diabetes. Two common themes emerge from the many genome-wide association studies of type 2 diabetes: (i) there is an enriched set of loci that mainly affect β-cells, and (ii) there seem to be an overabundance of cell cycle genes involved (5.McCarthy M.I.

CDKs phosphorylate downstream substrates, chiefly the retinoblastoma (RB) family proteins, on specific serine/threonine phosphorylation sites, resulting in the release of transcription factors that in turn modulate the expression of target gene promoters.

Other studies have further validated the importance of cell cycle molecules in establishing β-cell mass and its regenerative capacity (4.Butler P.C. Meier J.J. Butler A.E. Bhushan A.

Biol. 2006; 22: 311-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), although a possible role in β-cell function has been understudied. Here, we provide evidence that CDK2 provides a novel link between changes in β-cell mass and β-cell function. Most interestingly, the earliest consequences of conditional Cdk2 deletion involved impaired β-cell function rather than deficits in β-cell mass. With advancing age or under conditions of overnutrition, CDK2 loss decreased β-cell proliferation and reduced β-cell mass, resulting in diabetes. These data warrant a reevaluation of the role of CDKs in β-cell function and suggest an intricate relationship between changes in β-cell mass and function in diabetes progression. CDK2 is preferentially expressed in the endocrine pancreas with no detectable expression in the exocrine pancreas (Fig. 1). The majority of CDK2+ cells were insulin+ β-cells, and it was rare to observe glucagon+ α-cells expressing CDK2. Germ line whole-body Cdk2 knock-out (Cdk2−/−) mice are viable but infertile due to defects in germ cell development (20.Berthet C. Aleem E. Coppola V. Tessarollo L. Kaldis P.

Although these studies elucidated the role of CDK2 in germ cell development, the importance of CDK2 in glucose homeostasis was not investigated. Here we show that whole-body germ line Cdk2−/− mice exhibit elevated fasting and fed-state hyperglycemia (Fig. 2, A and B). Further, Cdk2−/− mice exhibit severely impaired glucose tolerance (Fig. 2C), and glucose-stimulated insulin levels in plasma were reduced in Cdk2−/− mice (Fig. 2D). Cdk2−/− islets exhibited reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ex vivo (Fig. 2, E and F), indicative of β-cell dysfunction. Similar observations were seen in both male and female Cdk2−/− mice, eliminating any gender-specific effects of CDK2 loss. Together, these results are supportive of an important role for CDK2 in β-cell function.FIGURE 2β-Cell dysfunction, glucose intolerance, and hyperglycemia in global Cdk2 knock-out mice.

Similar findings were observed in mice derived from crosses using either of the Pdx1-Cre strains. Examination of embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) pancreas by immunofluorescence using antibodies to the key pancreas transcription factors Pdx1, Nkx2.2, and Nkx6.1 and the epithelial cell-specific marker E-cadherin revealed morphologically normal staining in the Cdk2-pKO embryos, compared with age-matched wild-type Cdk2-Con embryos (Fig. 3, A–F). Thus, CDK2 loss does not appear to affect early pancreas development. Cdk2-pKO mice were born at the predicted Mendelian frequency and appeared normal in size and weight compared with age- and sex-matched control littermates. To better understand the very early effects of CDK2 deletion in the pancreas, we examined control and Cdk2-pKO mice at post-natal days 2–10. Body weights, fed glucose levels, pancreas histology, α-cell and β-cell immunostaining patterns, α-cell and β-cell mass, indices of β-cell proliferation, and level of expression of α-cell- and β-cell-specific markers were all found to be similar in Cdk2-pKO mice compared with age- and sex-matched control mice (Fig. 4), indicating normal early pancreas development. Glucose tolerance and insulin secretion were also similar at 1 month in mice of both genotypes (data not shown).FIGURE 4Normal early development of Cdk2-pKO mice. Body weight (A) and fed morning glucose level (B) were measured during early neonatal stage after birth.

Fasting glucose levels in Cdk2-pKO mice trended toward high normal ranges after 6 months of age, with male fasting glucose levels being significantly elevated at 8 and 12 months of age (Fig. 5, C and D). Insulin and glucagon staining appeared normal in pancreases from 2-month-old Cdk2-pKO mice, despite the lack of CDK2 expression (Fig. 6A). Consistent with this, α- and β-cell mass (Fig. 6B) and pancreatic insulin content (Fig. 6C) were also similar in Cdk2-pKO and control pancreas at 2 months of age. However, despite maintaining normal β-cell mass and insulin content, 2-month-old Cdk2-pKO mice exhibited impaired glucose tolerance (Fig. 7A). Moreover, in vivo insulin secretion was defective during the glucose tolerance test (Fig. 7B). Western blotting analyses confirmed a lack of CDK2 expression in Cdk2-pKO islets (Fig. 7C) and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was severely blunted in these Cdk2-pKO islets ex vivo (Fig. 7D). Analyses were performed in Cdk2-pKO mice of both genders, and similar observations were obtained with respect to β-cell secretory defects and glucose intolerance (data not shown). We confirmed these findings in Cdk2-pKO mice generated using a different strain of Pdx1-Cre transgenic mice (22.Gu G. Dubauskaite J. Melton D.A. Direct evidence for the pancreatic lineage: NGN3+ cells are islet progenitors and are distinct from duct progenitors.Development. 2002; 129: 2447-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Furthermore, no changes in glucagon secretion were seen in 2-month-old Cdk2-pKO mice, compared with age- and sex-matched control mice (data not shown).FIGURE 6CDK2 loss does not affect young adult pancreas development.

Taken together, these results suggest that the loss of CDK2 significantly compromised β-cell insulin secretory function. Levels of insulin transcripts were unchanged in Cdk2-pKO mice at post-natal day 2 (Fig. 4G) or at 2 months of age (Fig. 9). To further study the effect of CDK2 deletion, we analyzed RNA transcripts of a set of genes known to participate in β-cell metabolism and insulin secretion and found that these were significantly reduced by CDK2 deletion. These included glucokinase (GCK), uncoupling protein 2, SNAP25, Kir6.2, and Rab27A (Fig. 9), suggesting that both proximal and distal steps in the β-cell secretory pathway are probably affected by CDK2 deletion. To examine the underpinnings of the insulin secretory defect caused by CDK2 deficiency, we acquired EM images of the pancreatic islets from control and Cdk2-pKO mice (Fig. 10A). Swollen mitochondria appeared clustered near the center of the β-cells from Cdk2-pKO islets, which we quantified as increased mitochondrial volume (proxied by mitochondrial surface area) in Cdk2-pKO β-cells relative to controls (Fig. 10B). There was no significant change in mitochondrial number (21.9 ± 0.7 versus 19.9 ± 0.8 mitochondria/10 μm2 in control and Cdk2-pKO β-cells, respectively; p = 0.085). To examine metabolic function, we monitored the ratio of endogenous NAD(P)H to flavin fluorescence in response to glucose (25.Merrins M.J. Van Dyke A.R. Mapp A.K. Rizzo M.A. Satin L.S. Direct measurements of oscillatory glycolysis in pancreatic islet beta-cells using novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors for pyruvate kinase M2 activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 33312-33322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 10C, Cdk2-pKO islets exhibited a reduced baseline, a slower rise time, and a reduced maximal NAD(P)H/flavin ratio in response to a glucose challenge. Thus, defects in mitochondrial morphology and function contribute to the secretory defect in Cdk2-deficient islets, consistent with a central role of the mitochondria in the triggering and amplifying pathways of insulin secretion (26.Ishii H.

Kulkarni R.N. Modulation of beta-cell function: a translational journey from the bench to the bedside.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2012; 14: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although no changes in phosphorylation of the transcription factor AKT were observed in Cdk2-pKO islets (Fig. 11, A and B), significantly reduced glucose-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor FOXO1 was observed in these islets at the serine 256 residue (Fig. 11, C and D). We also observed reduced phosphorylation of FOXO1Ser256 in MIN6 cells following incubation with the CDK2 inhibitor (Fig. 11E). Consistent with the hypothesis that FOXO1 inactivation was linked to β-cell failure, the expression levels of two FOXO1 target genes (28.Kitamura Y.I. Kitamura T. Kruse J.P. Raum J.C. Stein R. Gu W. Accili D. FoxO1 protects against pancreatic beta cell failure through NeuroD and MafA induction.Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), MafA and NeuroD, were significantly down-regulated in the Cdk2-pKO islets (Fig. 11F). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using glucose-stimulated MIN6 cells revealed a physical association between CDK2 and FOXO1Ser256 proteins (Fig. 11G). The CDK2-FOXO1Ser256 interaction was not observed in the absence of glucose, despite a high level of total FOXO1 protein being present, suggesting that the association of CDK2 with phosphorylated FOXO1Ser256 was glucose-dependent. To test whether CDK2 directly transfers a phosphate to FOXO1, we assayed kinase activity by immunoprecipitating endogenous CDK2 and exogenous HA-tagged CDK2. The data obtained suggested that efficient CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 (Fig. 11H) and histone H1 (a known CDK2 substrate) occurred (data not shown), supporting the hypothesis that FOXO1 is a substrate of CDK2 in β-cells. Moreover, a CDK2-dependent, glucose-stimulated phosphorylation of FOXO1Ser256 was also seen in normal human islets, and FOXO1Ser256 phosphorylation was reduced by the CDK2 inhibitor in this case (Fig. 11I). Importantly, compared with islets from non-diabetic human donors, reduced CDK2 protein was observed in human islets from type 2 diabetic donors under normal glucose conditions (Fig. 11J). Lower CDK2 levels were mostly associated with reduced levels of FOXO1Ser256 phosphorylation, despite there being abundant total FOXO1 protein present (Fig. 11J). To test whether metabolic stress might unmask additional roles of CDK2 with respect to β-cell mass and function, control and Cdk2-pKO mice were challenged with a modest high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, a relatively short time compared with the more usual protocol of 14–16 weeks of HFD feeding. We found that this HFD challenge resulted in elevated fasting glucose and significant glucose intolerance in Cdk2-pKO mice compared with littermate Cdk2-WT control mice (Fig. 12A). Furthermore, we observed mild insulin resistance in the Cdk2-pKO mice compared with controls, albeit this effect was only seen during the initial 30 min of insulin injection (Fig. 12B). In contrast, no defect in insulin sensitivity was observed in Cdk2-pKO mice fed a regular diet (data not shown). In addition, the HFD regimen significantly blunted insulin secretion in Cdk2-pKO mice under both low and high glucose conditions (Fig. 12C). Further, treating non-diabetic human islets with the CDK2 inhibitor, with or without the addition of free fatty acids to the culture medium, resulted in significantly reduced insulin secretion (Fig. 12D).

https://openalex.org/W2574982328,"Background Lifetime suicide attempts in patients with comorbidity between psychotic disorders and Substance Use Disorder (SUD), known as dual diagnosis, was associated with a worse clinical and cognitive state, poor prognosis and premature death. However, to date no previous study has examined the cognitive performance of these patients considering as independent the presence or absence of lifetime suicide attempts. Methods We explore executive functioning differences between suicide attempters and non-attempters in dual schizophrenia (DS) patients and the possible related factors for both executive performance and current suicide risk. Fifty DS male patients in remission of SUD and clinically stables, 24 with and 26 without lifetime suicide attempts, were evaluated. We considered Z scores for all neuropsychological tests and a composite summary score for both premorbid IQ and executive functioning. Results DS patients showed low performance in set-shifting, planning and problem solving tasks. Those with suicide attempts presented lower composite summary scores, together with worse problem solving skills and decision-making, compared with non-attempters. However, after controlling for alcohol dependence, only differences in decision-making remained. Executive functioning was related to the premorbid intelligence quotient, and several clinical variables (duration, severity, months of abstinence and relapses of SUD, global functioning and negative symptoms). A relationship between current suicide risk, and first-degree relatives with SUD, insight and positive symptoms was also found. Conclusions Our results suggest that problem solving and, especially, decision-making tasks might be sensitive to cognitive impairment of DS patients related to presence of lifetime suicide attempts. The assessment of these executive functions and cognitive remediation therapy when necessary could be beneficial for the effectiveness of treatment in patients with DS. However, further research is needed to expand our findings and overcome some limitations of this study."

https://openalex.org/W2059547926,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The R6 mouse models of HD express a mutant version of exon 1 HTT and typically develop motor and cognitive impairments, a widespread huntingtin (HTT) aggregate pathology and brain atrophy. Unlike the more commonly used R6/2 mouse line, R6/1 mice have fewer CAG repeats and, subsequently, a less rapid pathological decline. Compared to the R6/2 line, fewer descriptions of the progressive pathologies exhibited by R6/1 mice exist. The association between the molecular and cellular neuropathology with brain atrophy, and with the development of behavioral phenotypes remains poorly understood in many models of HD. In attempt to link these factors in the R6/1 mouse line, we have performed detailed assessments of behavior and of regional brain abnormalities determined through longitudinal, in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as an end-stage, ex vivo MRI study and histological assessment. We found progressive decline in both motor and non-motor related behavioral tasks in R6/1 mice, first evident at 11 weeks of age. Regional brain volumes were generally unaffected at 9 weeks, but by 17 weeks there was significant grey matter atrophy. This age-related brain volume loss was validated using a more precise, semi-automated Tensor Based morphometry assessment. As well as these clear progressive phenotypes, mutant HTT (mHTT) protein, the hallmark of HD molecular pathology, was widely distributed throughout the R6/1 brain and was accompanied by neuronal loss. Despite these seemingly concomitant, robust pathological phenotypes, there appeared to be little correlation between the three main outcome measures: behavioral performance, MRI-detected brain atrophy and histopathology. In conclusion, R6/1 mice exhibit many features of HD, but the underlying mechanisms driving these clear behavioral disturbances and the brain volume loss, still remain unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2574234460,"We investigated whether stimulating the cerebellum and primary motor cortex (M1) using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could affect postural control in young and older adults. tDCS was employed using a double-blind, sham-controlled design, in which young (aged 18–35) and older adults (aged 65+) were assessed over three sessions, one for each stimulatory condition–M1, cerebellar and sham. The effect of tDCS on postural control was assessed using a sway-referencing paradigm, which induced platform rotations in proportion to the participant’s body sway, thus assessing sensory reweighting processes. Task difficulty was manipulated so that young adults experienced a support surface that was twice as compliant as that of older adults, in order to minimise baseline age differences in postural sway. Effects of tDCS on postural control were assessed during, immediately after and 30 minutes after tDCS. Additionally, the effect of tDCS on corticospinal excitability was measured by evaluating motor evoked potentials using transcranial magnetic stimulation immediately after and 30 minutes after tDCS. Minimal effects of tDCS on postural control were found in the eyes open condition only, and this was dependent on the measure assessed and age group. For young adults, stimulation had only offline effects, as cerebellar stimulation showed higher mean power frequency (MPF) of sway 30 minutes after stimulation. For older adults, both stimulation conditions delayed the increase in sway amplitude witnessed between blocks one and two until stimulation was no longer active. In conclusion, despite tDCS’ growing popularity, we would caution researchers to consider carefully the type of measures assessed and the groups targeted in tDCS studies of postural control."
https://openalex.org/W2578147267,"This study investigates—for the first time to our knowledge—the existence and mechanisms of functional interactions between the endogenous mammalian prototoxin, lynx1, and α3- and β4-subunit–containing human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α3β4*-nAChRs). Concatenated gene constructs were used to express precisely defined α3β4*-nAChR isoforms (α3β4)2β4-, (α3β4)2α3-, (α3β4)2α5(398D)-, and (α3β4)2α5(398N)-nAChR in Xenopus oocytes. In the presence or absence of lynx1, α3β4*-nAChR agonist responses were recorded by using 2-electrode voltage clamp and single-channel electrophysiology, whereas radioimmunolabeling measured cell-surface expression. Lynx1 reduced (α3β4)2β4-nAChR function principally by lowering cell-surface expression, whereas single-channel effects were primarily responsible for reducing (α3β4)2α3-nAChR function [decreased unitary conductance (≥50%), altered burst proportions (3-fold reduction in the proportion of long bursts), and enhanced closed dwell times (3- to 6-fold increase)]. Alterations in both cell-surface expression and single-channel properties accounted for the reduction in (α3β4)2α5-nAChR function that was mediated by lynx1. No effects were observed when α3β4*-nAChRs were coexpressed with mutated lynx1 (control). Lynx1 is expressed in the habenulopeduncular tract, where α3β4*-α5*-nAChR subtypes are critical contributors to the balance between nicotine aversion and reward. This gives our findings a high likelihood of physiologic significance. The exquisite isoform selectivity of lynx1 interactions provides new insights into the mechanisms and allosteric sites [α(−)-interface containing] by which prototoxins can modulate nAChR function. —George, A.

It remains unclear what acts as the key regulator of the collective changes in gene expression at initiation of senescent reprogramming. Here we analyzed time series gene expression profiles obtained in two different senescence models in human diploid fibroblasts: replicative senescence and H2O2-induced senescence. Our results demonstrate that suppression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-mediated DNA methylation activity was an initial event prior to the display of senescent phenotypes. We identified seven DNMT1-interacting proteins, ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1), EZH2, CHEK1, SUV39H1, CBX5, PARP1, and HELLS (also known as LSH (lymphoid-specific helicase) 1), as being commonly down-regulated at the same time point as DNMT1 in both senescence models. Knockdown experiments revealed that, among the DNMT1-interacting proteins, only UHRF1 knockdown suppressed DNMT1 transcription. However, UHRF1 overexpression alone did not induce DNMT1 expression, indicating that UHRF1 was essential but not sufficient for DNMT1 transcription. Although UHRF1 knockdown effectively induced senescence, this was significantly attenuated by DNMT1 overexpression, clearly implicating the UHRF1/DNMT1 axis in senescence. Bioinformatics analysis further identified WNT5A as a downstream effector of UHRF1/DNMT1-mediated senescence. Senescence-associated hypomethylation was found at base pairs −1569 to −1363 from the transcription start site of the WNT5A gene in senescent human diploid fibroblasts.

Cell senescence is a cellular fate in which mitotic cells progressively lose their replicative potential, eventually ceasing cell division. It has been proposed that cell senescence is an etiology of aging itself as well as of various aging-associated diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular disease (1.Campisi J.

In our previous study of replicative senescence (RS) in human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs), we demonstrated that individual phenotypes develop at different stages of senescence rather than appearing simultaneously (5.Kim Y.M. Byun H.O. Jee B.A. Cho H. Seo Y.H. Kim Y.S. Park M.H. Chung H.Y. Woo H.G. Yoon G. Implications of time-series gene expression profiles of replicative senescence.Aging Cell. 2013; 12: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, time series gene expression profiles of RS indicate that stage-specific gene expression reprogramming is essential for stage-by-stage development of the senescent phenotype (5.Kim Y.M. Byun H.O. Jee B.A. Cho H. Seo Y.H. Kim Y.S. Park M.H. Chung H.Y. Woo H.G. Yoon G. Implications of time-series gene expression profiles of replicative senescence.Aging Cell. 2013; 12: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the initial gene expression reprogramming in RS occurs at a fairly early stage, prior to the appearance of the typical senescence marker SA-β-gal. Little attention has focused on the initially reprogrammed genes because of their uncertain link to senescence. However, the initial reprogramming phase includes differential expression of over 1200 genes, with about 800 down-regulated and 500 up-regulated genes (5.Kim Y.M. Byun H.O. Jee B.A. Cho H. Seo Y.H.

This may include the causal event that triggers the presenescent condition, preparatory to senescence, and is likely controlled by master regulators. In eukaryotic cells, DNA methylation is a key epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression and silencing. It most often occurs at the C5 position of cytosine, typically among the abundant CpG islands of a gene promoter region. CpG island hypermethylation is frequently linked to gene silencing, whereas hypomethylation is associated with gene transcription activation. DNA methylation patterns can vary throughout the life span of an organism, often changing to adapt to environmental conditions (6.Jaenisch R. Bird A. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression: how the genome integrates intrinsic and environmental signals.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4675) Google Scholar). Aged tissues show global loss of DNA methylation in all genomic compartments (promoter, intergenic, intronic, and exonic regions) (7.Wilson V.L. Jones P.A. DNA methylation decreases in aging but not in immortal cells.Science. 1983; 220: 1055-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 8.Gonzalo S. Epigenetic alterations in aging.J. Appl. Physiol. 2010; 109: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, hypermethylation on various tumor suppressor genes and Polycomb target genes has also been reported with age (9.Maegawa S. Hinkal G. Kim H.S. Shen L. Zhang L. Zhang J. Zhang N. Liang S. Donehower L.A. Issa J.P. Widespread and tissue specific age-related DNA methylation changes in mice.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). This suggests that aberrant DNA hypomethylation may be closely linked with a massive induction of diverse genes that accelerates the aging process. Correspondingly, the reversibility of such hypomethylation may be essential for maintaining the vitality of an organism. Humans exhibit two classes of DNA methylation activities executed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs): de novomethylation and maintenance methylation (10.Law J.A. Jacobsen S.E. Establishing, maintaining and modifying DNA methylation patterns in plants and animals.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 204-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar). Executed by DNMT3a and DNMT3b, de novo methylation forms the initial DNA methylation patterns during embryogenesis. On the other hand, maintenance methylation restores and preserves the DNA methylation patterns after each cellular DNA replication cycle. DNMT1 copies the DNA methylation patterns to daughter strands during DNA replication (10.Law J.A. Jacobsen S.E. Establishing, maintaining and modifying DNA methylation patterns in plants and animals.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 204-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar, 11.Goll M.G. Bestor T.H.

Biol. 1997; 270: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and, thus, may be linked with senescence-associated epigenetic modifications. Although DNMT1 possesses an enzymatic functional group that is critical for maintenance methylation, DNMT1 activity is delicately controlled by physical interactions with diverse proteins and posttranslational modifications (13.Qin W. Leonhardt H. Pichler G. Regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 by interactions and modifications.Nucleus. 2011; 2: 392-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding of PCNA to DNMT1 increases methylation activity (14.Schermelleh L. Haemmer A. Spada F. Rösing N. Meilinger D. Rothbauer U. Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H.

The overall integrated actions of these DNMT1-interacting proteins (DIPs) on DNMT1 contribute to maintenance methylation activity and the associated cellular phenotype. However, we do not yet clearly understand how DNMT1 and its interacting proteins are involved in senescence-associated gene reprogramming. In this study, we analyzed time series gene expression profiles of 53 known DIPs in two different cell senescence model systems: replicative senescence and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced senescence (HS) of human diploid fibroblasts. We further evaluated how these commonly regulated DIPs were related to DNMT1 expression and to DNMT1-associated senescent processes. We first induced senescence in HDFs using a subcytotoxic dose (250 μm) of H2O2 (Fig. 1A) and examined the corresponding changes in the expression of DNMT1, a key DNA maintenance methyltransferase. Both DNMT1 protein and mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the HS HDF model. In contrast, there were no detectable changes in the protein or mRNA levels of DNMT3A, a methyltransferase that is critical in de novo DNA methylation (Fig. 1, B and C). Similar results were obtained in the RS HDF model (Fig. 1, D–F), suggesting that cell senescence is specifically linked to the loss of maintenance DNA methylation because of decreased DNMT1 mRNA expression. We then exposed young HDFs (with a doubling time of 2 days, DT2) to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-AzC) for 5 days to block cellular DNA methylation activity—mainly maintenance methyltransferase activity. Subsequently, the HDFs exhibited senescent phenotypes that included gain of SA-β-gal and induction of the major cell cycle inhibitory regulators p21 and p16 (Fig. 1G). Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of DNMT1 alone was sufficient to induce HDF senescence (Fig. 1H). These results support the importance of specific loss-of-maintenance DNA methylation by DNMT1 suppression in senescence induction. To evaluate when DNMT1 expression began to decrease during senescence development, we established a detailed time series in the HS model and performed a gene expression profiling analysis. Gene expression changes were normalized by subtracting the expression levels from the control experiment, and variable genes with a median absolute deviation of greater than 0.3 were filtered. Genes that were aberrantly expressed with a greater than 2-fold difference at any time point after H2O2 treatment were considered to be differentially expressed with H2O2 treatment (HS signature). This definition yielded 714 HS signature genes, including 310 that were up-regulated (HS_UP) and 404 that were down-regulated (HS_DOWN) (Fig. 2A). We next compared these signature genes with the four previously reported RS signature gene modules (5.Kim Y.M. Byun H.O. Jee B.A. Cho H. Seo Y.H. Kim Y.S. Park M.H. Chung H.Y. Woo H.G. Yoon G. Implications of time-series gene expression profiles of replicative senescence.Aging Cell. 2013; 12: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar): G1, genes down-regulated genes after the early stage (earlier than DT3); G2, genes down-regulated after middle stage (DT3-DT7); G3, genes up-regulated at middle and advanced stages (DT10-DT20); and G4, genes up-regulated genes at advanced and very advanced stages (over DT30). Overall, 77.8% of the HS signature genes were matched with RS signature genes. Of the 310 HS_UP genes, most were found in the G3 (25.Palii S.S. Van Emburgh B.O. Sankpal U.T. Brown K.D. Robertson K.D. DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine induces reversible genome-wide DNA damage that is distinctly influenced by DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3B.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 752-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) or G4 (213) RS modules. Of the 403 HS_DOWN genes, most were found in the G1 (213) or G2 (105) RS modules (Fig. 2B). The similarity of these gene expression profiles between the two different cell senescence models supports the appropriateness of these gene profiles for mechanistic investigation of senescence. Gene set enrichment analysis of the HS signature revealed substantial enrichment of cell cycle-related genes among the HS_DOWN genes (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, DNMT1 expression began decreasing at the earliest time point, prior to the development of any clear senescent phenotype such as SA-β-gal (Fig. 2D, top of the heat map and bottom panels). We next analyzed the expression levels of previously reported DIPs (n = 53) (13.Qin W. Leonhardt H. Pichler G. Regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 by interactions and modifications.Nucleus. 2011; 2: 392-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Among these DIP genes, seven were commonly found in both RS and HS signature genes: UHRF1, EZH2, CHEK1, SUV39H1, CBX5, PARP1, and HELLS. Unexpectedly, each of these seven DIPs showed progressive down-regulation in a pattern similar to DNMT1 (Fig. 2D). In further experiments, we validated their protein expression levels (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these findings indicate that the decrease in DNMT1-mediated DNA methyltransferase activity observed during senescence development likely results from suppressed expressions of DNMT1 itself and of DIPs that probably play essential or auxiliary roles in promoting optimal DNMT1 activity. DIPs reportedly control DNMT1 activity through physical protein interactions (13.Qin W. Leonhardt H. Pichler G. Regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 by interactions and modifications.Nucleus. 2011; 2: 392-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here we further investigated whether any DIP contributed to regulating DNMT1 expression. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown, the seven DIPs were individually suppressed in HDF (DT2). Only UHRF1 knockdown led to decreased DNMT1 protein expression (Fig. 3A). Although UHRF1 suppression significantly down-regulated both mRNA and protein expression of DNMT1, DNMT1 knockdown did not alter UHRF1 expression (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating the role of UHRF1 as an upstream regulator of DNMT1 transcription. To verify the specificity of the effect of UHRF1 on DNMT1 expression, HELLS knockdown was used as a control (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, cDNA microarray analysis after UHRF1 knockdown in young HDFs showed down-regulation of six DIPs (all except CHEK1) (data not shown), suggesting that UHRF1 could potentially be a master regulator of DNMT1 and the DIPs. However, UHRF1 overexpression in HDF (DT5, stage with decreased UHRF1 expression) did not increase DNMT1 mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 3D). These findings indicate that, as an upstream regulator, UHRF1 is essential but not sufficient for DNMT1 expression. To date, there is no clear evidence to support the role of UHRF1 as a direct transcription regulator. However, DNMT1 promoter activity was significantly decreased by siRNA-mediated UHRF1 suppression (Fig. 3E), further supporting regulation of DNMT1 transcriptional activity by decreased UHRF1 expression. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated UHRF1 suppression increased the intracellular ROS level (Fig. 3F), and DNMT1 promoter activity was decreased by the augmented intracellular ROS upon exposure to exogenous H2O2 (Fig. 3, G and H). These results suggest that decreased UHRF1 expression indirectly down-regulates DNMT1 transcription via ROS generation. We next confirmed that UHRF1 knockdown in young HDFs (DT2) induced senescent phenotypes, including SA-β-gal, p21 and p16 induction, and intracellular ROS increase (Fig. 4, A–D). Compared with DNMT1 knockdown (Fig. 1D), UHRF1 knockdown more effectively led to the gain of senescent phenotypes (Fig. 4A). Unexpectedly, HELLS knockdown also induced senescent phenotypes but only slightly, implying that HELLS-mediated regulation of DNMT1 activity may partially contribute to senescence induction. Restoring the cellular DNMT1 level by overexpression effectively attenuated the senescence phenotypes acquired by UHRF1 knockdown, although not completely (Fig. 4, D–F). These findings suggest that UHRF1 is an effective upstream regulator of DNMT1 expression and, consequently, of senescence control. Hypomethylation induced by DNMT1 suppression in a gene promoter may activate transcription of certain effectors to induce senescence. To screen for downstream effectors of the UHRF1/DNMT1 axis, we performed cDNA microarrays after knockdown of UHRF1 or DNMT1, analyzed the commonly up-regulated genes, and finally matched the identified genes with the commonly up-regulated signature genes in the RS and HS models. This process identified the following six genes: WNT5A, LOXL4, PLA2G4C, PPP1R14A, SPINT2, and TACSTD2 (Fig. 5A). We next examined whether expression of these six putative targets was truly regulated by DNA methylation. In young HDFs (DT2), we inhibited DNA methylation with 5 days of exposure to 5-AzC. This treatment significantly induced the mRNA levels of five genes (WNT5A, LOXL4, PLA2G4C, PPP1R14A, and SPINT2), whereas TACSTD2 was slightly induced with 2.5 μm 5-AzC (Fig. 5B), implying their transcriptional regulation by DNA methylation. Among the six tested genes, we focused on WNT5A because of its previously reported potential link to senescence (20.Bitler B.G. Nicodemus J.P. Li H. Cai Q. Wu H. Hua X. Li T. Birrer M.J. Godwin A.K. Cairns P. Zhang R. Wnt5a suppresses epithelial ovarian cancer by promoting cellular senescence.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 6184-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As expected, the WNT5A protein level was dose-dependently induced by blocking DNA methylation using 5-AzC (Fig. 5C). We additionally validated the increases in both WNT5A mRNA and protein in the senescent cells using a time series of the RS and HS models (Fig. 5, D and E). Knockdown of either DNMT1 or UHRF1 clearly induced WNT5A protein expression, whereas HELLS knockdown showed a minor effect (Fig. 5F). Overall, these results indicate that WNT5A is a downstream target of the UHRF1/DNMT1 axis. Finally, to examine the DNA methylation status of the WNT5A promoter, we performed methylation-specific sequencing of four major CpG-rich regions, A to D. These regions were estimated by using the MethPrimer program to analyze the WNT5A promoter sequence from −1668 bp to +767 bp from the WNT5A transcription start (NC_000003.12) (Fig. 6A). Unexpectedly, young HDFs (DT2) showed no significant cytosine methylation within the indicated CpG-rich regions B, C, and D (data not shown). Only region A, which is relatively distal from the transcription start, showed abundant cytosine methylation in young HDFs as well as decreased methylation in senescent HDFs (DT7) (Fig. 6B). DNA methylation hot spots included three CpG dinucleotides located at −1490, −1483, and −1476 bp (marked as CpG sites 5, 6, and 7 in Fig. 6B) from the WNT5A transcription start (Fig. 6B). To further monitor the time series methylation status on this hot spot region of the WNT5A promoter, we performed methylation-specific PCR using both methylation-specific primers and non-methylation-specific primers. During the RS process, the methylation status gradually decreased, whereas non-methylation increased (Fig. 6C). As expected, WNT5A overexpression in young HDFs (DT2) induced senescence phenotypes without altered DNMT1 or UHRF1 expression, as evidenced by delayed cell growth and p21 and p16 induction (Fig. 6, D and E). Altogether, our results suggest that hypomethylation of CpG islands between −1569 and −1363 bp upstream of the WNT5A promoter increases WNT5A expression, eventually inducing senescence phenotypes. Compared with other degenerative cellular fates, including apoptosis and necrosis, the development of senescence shows relatively slower and more progressive acquisition. Moreover, senescence displays diverse cellular phenotypes, such as irreversible growth arrest (loss of cell division capacity), enlarged and flattened cellular morphology (increased cell mass and size), increased cell granularity, high ROS generation, gain of SA-β-gal, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype induction and release, that do not develop simultaneously but, rather, manifest sequentially (5.Kim Y.M. Byun H.O. Jee B.A. Cho H. Seo Y.H. Kim Y.S. Park M.H. Chung H.Y. Woo H.G. Yoon G. Implications of time-series gene expression profiles of replicative senescence.Aging Cell. 2013; 12: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although SA-β-gal is considered a key senescence marker, it develops at a later stage. Other senescence phenotypes appear earlier and are progressively amplified. However, these earlier phenotypes and the initial gene reprogramming have been scarcely investigated because of their ambiguous relationship with impending cellular senescence. We recently published bioinformatics data, including a detailed time series of the gene expression profiling of replicative senescence in HDF, which provides useful groundwork for further investigating this subject (5.Kim Y.M. Byun H.O. Jee B.A. Cho H. Seo Y.H. Kim Y.S. Park M.H. Chung H.Y. Woo H.G. Yoon G. Implications of time-series gene expression profiles of replicative senescence.Aging Cell. 2013; 12: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we further developed a time series for a stress-induced (H2O2-triggered) senescence model with the aim of identifying a common master regulator for initial gene reprogramming. We found that DNMT1, which can simultaneously regulate diverse gene expressions, was down-regulated as part of the earliest gene alterations, suggesting its potential role as a master regulator for the initial reprogramming and consequent senescent phenotypes. Although prior studies have reported global hypomethylation and DNMT1 involvement in senescence (7.Wilson V.L. Jones P.A. DNA methylation decreases in aging but not in immortal cells.Science. 1983; 220: 1055-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 8.Gonzalo S. Epigenetic alterations in aging.J. Appl.

Biochem. 2006; 98: 1230-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), this is the first investigation to pinpoint DNMT1 suppression as a primary event in senescence. DNMT1 is essential for maintenance of DNA methylation activity, in which the gene expression program of the mother cell is imprinted to the daughter cell following cell division—a critical epigenetic modification. Thus, it is clear that loss of DNMT1 expression during senescence development could effectively reprogram gene expression patterns. Loss of DNMT1 expression occurs gradually, resulting in slow accumulation of hypomethylated regions on cellular DNA and generating progressive gene reprogramming. Hypomethylation of a gene promoter region allows gene transcription, suggesting that the hypomethylation resulting from DNMT1 loss is likely linked to the induction of certain genes that may control senescence. This raises the question of how stage-specific genes can be induced by random hypomethylation. Although DNMT1 possesses the key enzymatic activity for maintenance methylation, its DNA binding and methylation activities are exquisitely regulated by its protein-protein interaction with diverse proteins. The actions of these specified DIPs and their additional interacting regulators may help determine the sensitivity to hypomethylation and target gene transcription. Recently, Qin et al. (13.Qin W. Leonhardt H. Pichler G. Regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 by interactions and modifications.Nucleus. 2011; 2: 392-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) thoroughly reviewed the actions of 53 DIPs on DNMT1 activity. Among these 53 DIPs, we identified seven (UHRF1, EZH2, CHEK1, SUV39H1, CBX5, PARP1, and HELLS) that decreased in expression at the same time point as DNMT1 in both the RS and HS models. Interestingly, we found no DIPs with increasing expression. EZH2 reportedly recruits DNMT1 to target genes, thereby mediating promoter methylation (23.Viré E. Brenner C. Deplus R. Blan"

Many of these proteins bind the C-terminal domain (CTD) of FtsZ, which serves as a hub for FtsZ regulation. FtsZ ring-associated proteins, ZapA–D (Zaps), are important FtsZ regulatory proteins that stabilize FtsZ assembly and enhance Z ring formation by increasing lateral assembly of FtsZ protofilaments, which then form the Z ring. There are no structures of a Zap protein bound to FtsZ; therefore, how these proteins affect FtsZ polymerization has been unclear. Recent data showed ZapD binds specifically to the FtsZ CTD. Thus, to obtain insight into the ZapD-CTD interaction and how it may mediate FtsZ protofilament assembly, we determined the Escherichia coli ZapD-FtsZ CTD structure to 2.67 Å resolution. The structure shows that the CTD docks within a hydrophobic cleft in the ZapD helical domain and adopts an unusual structure composed of two turns of helix separated by a proline kink.

We examined the impact of LXA4 on transcellular endothelial signaling via microRNA (miR)-containing microvesicles. We report LXA4 inhibition of MV release by TNF-α-treated HUVECs, associated with the down-regulation of 18 miR in endothelial microvesicles (EMVs) and the up-regulation of miR-126–5p, both in HUVECs and in EMVs. LXA4 upregulated miR-126–5p by ∼5-fold in HUVECs and promoted a release of microvesicles (LXA4-EMVs) that enhanced miR-126–5p by ∼7-fold in recipient HUVECs. In these cells, LXA4-EMVs abrogated the up-regulation of VCAM-1, induced in recipient HUVECs by EMVs released by untreated or TNF-α-treated HUVECs. LXA4-EMVs also reduced by ∼40% the expression of SPRED1, which we validated as an miR-126–5p target, whereas they stimulated monolayer repair in an in vitro wound assay. This effect was lost when the EMVs were depleted of miR-126–5p.

The total number of unweighted sample size was 9,905 participants: 4,460 men and 5,445 women, and OA prevalence was 5.3% and 18.4% respectively. OA patients were defined as participants with knee/hip joint pain and radiographic change of knee/hip joint. Occupational type was classified as either white, pink, blue, or green collar based on the occupational characteristics following physical demand: white for manager and professionals; pink for clerks and service/sales workers; blue for craft/trade workers, machine operators and assemblers, and elementary manual workers; and green for agricultural/fishery workers. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the odds of a participant’s having OA according to the occupational cluster, with gender stratification. The multiple logistic regression model showed that, compared to the white collar group, the ORs of the pink, blue, and green collar workers were 1.23 (95% CI 0.64–2.36), 1.85 (95% CI 1.18–2.88), and 2.91 (95% CI 1.86–4.54), respectively, in males, and 2.53 (95% CI 1.71–3.73), 2.86 (95% CI 1.94–4.21), and 3.90 (95% CI 2.60–5.83), respectively in females.

There is great interest in understanding their mechanisms to enable the development of β-lactamase-specific inhibitors. The mechanism of class A β-lactamases has been studied extensively, revealing Lys-73 and Glu-166 as general bases that assist the catalytic residue Ser-70. However, the specific roles of these two residues within the catalytic cycle remain not fully understood. To help resolve this, we first identified an E166H mutant that is functional but is kinetically slow. We then carried out time-resolved crystallographic study of a full cycle of the catalytic reaction. We obtained structures that represent apo, ES*-acylation, and ES*-deacylation states and analyzed the conformational changes of His-166. The “in” conformation in the apo structure allows His-166 to form a hydrogen bond with Lys-73. The unexpected “flipped-out” conformation of His-166 in the ES*-acylation structure was further examined by molecular dynamics simulations, which suggested deprotonated Lys-73 serving as the general base for acylation. The “revert-in” conformation in the ES*-deacylation structure aligns His-166 toward the water molecule that hydrolyzes the acyl adduct. Finally, when the acyl adduct is fully hydrolyzed, His-166 rotates back to the “in” conformation of the apo-state, restoring the Lys-73/His-166 interaction. Using His-166 as surrogate, our study identifies distinct conformational changes within the active site during catalysis. We suggest that the native Glu-166 executes similar changes in a less constricted way.

We suggest that the native Glu-166 executes similar changes in a less constricted way. Taken together, this structural series improves our understanding of β-lactam hydrolysis in this important class of enzymes. β-Lactamase is the one of the major mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. Enzymes of this family have evolved to become highly efficient in hydrolyzing and inactivating a wide spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics (1.Drawz S.M. Bonomo R.A. Three decades of β-lactamase inhibitors.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2010; 23: 160-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Most alarmingly, the widespread usage of antibiotics has led to the emergence of new β-lactamases that can hydrolyze even the “last resort” β-lactam antibiotics like meropenem and ertapenem (2.Papp-Wallace K.M. Endimiani A. Taracila M.A. Bonomo R.A. Carbapenems: past, present, and future.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2011; 55: 4943-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Pathogenic bacteria strains harboring these enzymes either in their chromosomes or on transmittable plasmids readily acquire super-resistance and pose serious threats to public health (3.Molton J.S. Tambyah P.A. Ang B.S. Ling M.L. Fisher D.A. The global spread of healthcare-associated multidrug-resistant bacteria: a perspective from Asia.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2013; 56: 1310-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To overcome the antibiotic resistance mediated by β-lactamases, extensive studies of their catalytic mechanism have been carried out. The large number of over 1,000 reported β-lactamases have been grouped into four classes (A to D) based on sequence alignment (1.Drawz S.M. Bonomo R.A. Three decades of β-lactamase inhibitors.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2010; 23: 160-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 4.Majiduddin F.K. Materon I.C. Palzkill T.G. Molecular analysis of β-lactamase structure and function.Int. J. Med.

Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although class B is unique by employing zinc ions for β-lactam hydrolysis, class A, C, and D all utilize a serine-based catalytic process that consists of two distinct steps. The first step is the acylation reaction when the catalytic serine residue carries out nucleophilic attack on the β-lactam substrate and forms the enzyme-substrate (ES*) acyl adduct (Fig. 1a). The second step is the subsequent deacylation step when a water molecule hydrolyzes the ES* acyl adduct so that the inactivated antibiotic is released with its β-lactam ring opened, and the active site is regenerated (Fig. 1a). For each step, a general base is needed to activate the normally non-reactive serine residue or the deacylation water molecule (Fig. 1a). Although class A, C, and D β-lactamases share the same two-step process, they have evolved substantially different strategies in terms of how to arrange the general bases for the acylation and deacylation reactions (1.Drawz S.M.

The catalytic prowess of these β-lactamases depends critically on the effectiveness of these general bases. The active site of class A β-lactamases contains two residues, Lys-73 and Glu-166, as general bases, and both are positioned in close proximity to the catalytic residue Ser-70 (1.Drawz S.M.

Three decades of the class A β-lactamase acyl-enzyme.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2009; 10: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Decades of comprehensive studies have confirmed distinct catalytic roles for these two residues. Lys-73 is assigned as the critical general base for the acylation step because mutating this residue completely abolishes this reaction. In contrast, Glu-166 is regarded as the exclusive general base for the deacylation reaction because Glu-166 mutations significantly reduce its kinetic rate. However, some crucial mechanistic details regarding the roles of these two general bases are still not well understood. For example, multiple structural studies have revealed that when the active site is at the apo-state, Lys-73 is protonated, and Glu-166 is deprotonated, thus forming an electrostatically favorable Lys-73–Glu-166 salt bridge within the active site (Fig. 1b) (7.Nukaga M.

Under such setup, Lys-73 is not ready to serve as a general base for the acylation reaction because only its deprotonated form can abstract a proton from Ser-70 to promote its nucleophilic attack on the substrate. It is reasonable to expect that when the active site proceeds from the apo-state to the acylation state, some changes may occur, likely triggered by the event of substrate binding, so that Lys-73 can become deprotonated and proceed to fulfill its catalytic role (Fig. 1b). Although quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) 2The abbreviations used are: QM/MMquantum mechanics/molecular mechanicsr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationDWdeacylation waterPDBProtein Data BankMDmolecular dynamics. studies have suggested such a possibility, no experimental evidence for such a transfer in a functional active site while turning over a natural substrate has been reported (10.Meroueh S.O.

Soc. 2005; 127: 15397-15407Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as the active site completes the acylation reaction and proceeds into the deacylation reaction, how the role of general base is switched from Lys-73 to Glu-166 is not known. These mechanistic details can be highly valuable in further improving our understanding of this important class of enzymes. quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics root mean square deviation deacylation water Protein Data Bank molecular dynamics. To gain in-depth understanding of how the active site of class A β-lactamases coordinates key catalytic residues such as Lys-73 and Glu-166 to facilitate efficient catalysis, it would be ideal if a complete catalytic cycle of hydrolyzing a natural substrate can be tracked and individual functional intermediates along the reaction pathway can be analyzed at atomic resolution. However, it is experimentally challenging to obtain such information given the ultrafast kinetic rates of wild-type class A β-lactamases that usually approach the diffusion limit for natural substrates (kcat/Km ∼108 m−1 s−1). Here, we report our work on a mutant class A β-lactamase with slowed kinetics so that the catalysis of natural substrates like cephaloridine can be tracked by in crystallo catalysis. These structures reveal novel conformational changes within the active site in sync with distinct catalytic steps and offer fresh perspective on mechanistic understanding of β-lactamase catalysis. PenP from Bacillus licheniformis has been used in our previous studies as a model enzyme for class A β-lactamases because of its high sequence identity (>80%) to the clinically significant TEM and SHV series and its amenability to mutational perturbations (11.Pan X. Wong W.T. He Y. Jiang Y. Zhao Y.

It shows high catalytic efficiency toward first-generation β-lactam antibiotics like penicillin and cephaloridine with kcat/Km in the order of 106 m−1 s−1, comparable with that for the TEM and SHV β-lactamases. In crystallo catalysis followed by time-resolved X-ray crystallography has been a powerful tool to capture functional intermediates within the active site of an enzyme to understand its catalytic mechanism. For example, this approach has been successfully applied on a time scale of minutes to visualize the formation of phosphodiester bond and to investigate novel catalytic mechanism mediated by a third Mg2+ ion not included in the classical model (14.Gao Y. Yang W. Capture of a third Mg2+ is essential for catalyzing DNA synthesis.Science. 2016; 352: 1334-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15.Nakamura T. Zhao Y. Yamagata Y. Hua Y.J. Yang W. Watching DNA polymerase η make a phosphodiester bond.Nature. 2012; 487: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This method has also been employed at a femtosecond time scale to analyze ultrafast motions in CO myoglobin (16.Barends T.R. Foucar L. Ardevol A. Nass K. Aquila A. Botha S. Doak R.B. Falahati K. Hartmann E. Hilpert M. Heinz M. Hoffmann M.C. Köfinger J. Koglin J.E. Kovacsova G. et al.Direct observation of ultrafast collective motions in CO myoglobin upon ligand dissociation.Science. 2015; 350: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, no such study has been done for β-lactamases probably because the turnover rate of the wild-type enzyme is so fast that reaction intermediates cannot be readily captured. To enable our investigation, we first set out to generate PenP derivatives that are kinetically slow but nonetheless functional. We targeted the general base Glu-166 as it is located on the structurally flexible Ω-loop, and mutations at this site would lead to minimal perturbation to the other residues within the active site. The E166H mutant was identified as a suitable candidate. As shown by electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) experiments, the rapid formation of the enzyme-substrate acyl adduct (ES*) in the acylation step and the subsequent hydrolysis of ES* back to enzyme only (E) during the deacylation step occur over a prolonged period of up to 2 min (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, the pH-dependent activity profile of E166H was measured by nitrocefin assay and showed a large shift from ∼7.0 to ∼8.5 in terms of optimal activity as compared with wild-type PenP (Fig. 2b) (17.Stojanoski V.

Chem. 2015; 290: 10382-10394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This shift suggests that His-166 probably replaces Glu-166 and directly participates in the catalytic reactions. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters of E166H turning over natural β-lactam antibiotics were measured using standard UV spectroscopy method (18.Chan P.H. So P.K. Ma D.L. Zhao Y. Lai T.S. Chung W.H.

Soc. 2008; 130: 6351-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). E166H shows ∼103-fold reduction in terms of kcat/Km value for hydrolysis of penicillin G at pH 7.0, in agreement with a previous report on the slowed kinetic profile of TEM-1 E166H mutant (19.Guillaume G.

For subsequent in crystallo catalysis, we will thus choose cephaloridine as the suitable substrate for investigation.TABLE 1Kinetics parameters for E166H hydrolyzing penicillin G and cephaloridineβ-LactamaseAntibioticsKmkcatkcat/Kmμms−1m−1s−1WTPenicillin G60.9 ± 5.3393.8 ± 18.5(6.5 ± 0.9) × 106Cephaloridine20.7 ± 4.18.2 ± 0.8(4.0 ± 1.0) × 105E166HPenicillin G149.4 ± 38.20.46 ± 0.07(3.1 ± 1.0) × 103Cephaloridine4.7 ± 0.80.022 ± 0.001(4.7 ± 1.1) × 103 Open table in a new tab With kinetically slowed E166H PenP β-lactamase we set out to crystallize this enzyme and tracked in crystallo catalysis of cephaloridine within its active site by time-resolved X-ray crystallography. Three structures were determined, representing the apo, ES*-acylation, and ES*-deacylation states, respectively (Table 2). We also tracked the progression of the slowed deacylation reaction until the cephaloridine substrate departed from the active site. Collectively, our structures represent for the first time a full cycle of β-lactam hydrolysis within the active site of a class A β-lactamase. Detailed analysis of these structures and their mechanistic implications are discussed below.TABLE 2Statistics of X-ray crystallography data collection and structure refinementApoES*-acylationES*-deacylationData collection PDB code5GHX5GHY5GHZ Space groupP1P1P1 Unit cell parameters a, b, and c (Å)43.331, 45.849, 66.13943.240, 45.940, 65.99043.290, 45.490, 66.100 α, β, γ (°)77.84, 75.65, 69.0976.84, 75.58, 69.0777.81, 75.48, 68.76 Resolution range (Å)50.00–1.24 (1.28–1.24)42.40–2.01 (2.11–2.01)42.02–1.93 (2.03–1.93) No. of total reflections483,575111,449121,668 No. of unique reflections118,37728,41531,135 I/σ14.7 (8.0)14.2 (5.3)18.0 (9.8) Completeness (%)91.5 (88.3)93.3 (89.1)91.2 (86.3) Rmerge (%)5.2 (17.2)6.8 (23.9)5.5 (12.8)Structure refinement Resolution (Å)33.27–1.2438.00–2.0137.4–1.93 Rcryst/Rfree (%)13.9/16.219.5/24.415.6/20.9 r.m.s.d. bonds (Å)/angles (°)0.030/2.6660.017/1.9300.018/1.869 No. of reflections Working set112,43826,97729,548 Test set593014341580 No. of atoms Protein atoms414340974112 Ligand/ion atoms164444 Water molecules868145485 Average B-factor (Å2) Main chain9.39619.14113.254 Side chain17.45023.27118.363 Open table in a new tab The apo structure of E166H solved at 1.24 Å resolution is nearly identical to the wild-type structure with overall root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of only ∼0.29 Å. The mutant His-166 side chain occupies a position largely identical to that of Glu-166 in the wild-type structure and is engaged in two H-bond interactions, one with Lys-73 via the Nϵ2 atom of the imidazole ring (distance 2.87 Å) and the other with a solvent water molecule via the Nδ1 atom (distance 2.84 Å) (Fig. 3, a and b). Beyond His-166, the rest of the E166H active site is identical to that of the wild type. The only notable difference is the absence of a water molecule (DW) that would be strategically positioned between Ser-70 and Glu-166 in the wild-type structure and has been speculated to serve as a bridging entity to facilitate the substrate-induced proton transfer from Lys-73 to Glu-166 (Fig. 3b). Although it is not possible to visualize protons at the resolution of our structure, we managed to derive the protonation states of Lys-73 and His-166 using the observed Lys-73/His-166 interaction as the critical clue. First of all, the possibility of protonated His-166 is ruled out because Lys-73 must also be protonated in this case given its stronger basicity. However, the resulting electrostatic repulsion between these two residues would render the Lys-73/His-166 interaction unsustainable. Second, Lys-73 is likely protonated given its predicted pKa value of ∼8.0–8.5 according to a previous study and our crystallization condition at pH 7.5 (9.Golemi-Kotra D. Meroueh S.O. Kim C. Vakulenko S.B. Bulychev A. Stemmler A.J. Stemmler T.L. Mobashery S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 34665-34673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). With protonated Lys-73 and deprotonated His-166, the Lys-73/His-166 interaction is underpinned by the terminal −NH3+ group of Lys-73 as the H-donor and the deprotonated Nϵ2 atom of His-166 as the H-acceptor (Fig. 3c). With this setup neither Lys-73 nor His-166 is at a suitable protonation state to serve as the general base for initiating acylation. For Lys-73, it needs to be deprotonated first to activate the catalytic Ser-70 by proton abstraction. For His-166, a critical deacylation water molecule must emerge between His-166 and Ser-70 so that the neutral His-166 can deprotonated the water and trigger its nucleophilic attack on Ser-70. Thus, in absence of a substrate, the E166H active site at apo-state is not catalytically ready, similar to what has been observed for other Class A β-lactamases (7.Nukaga M. Mayama K. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Ultrahigh resolution structure of a class A β-lactamase: on the mechanism and specificity of the extended-spectrum SHV-2 enzyme.J. Mol.

The ES* acylation structure was obtained when cephaloridine-soaked E166H crystals were flash frozen and immediately loaded onto X-ray source for data collection. This protocol ensures that the active site is “trapped” at a functional intermediate in which the ES* acyl adduct is already formed but the deacylation process hasn't started. For the ES* acylation structure, the Fo − Fc map unambiguously reveals an acyl-enzyme adduct with covalent linkage between C8 of cephaloridine and the Oγ atom of Ser-70 (Fig. 4a). The binding mode of cephaloridine is nearly identical to that seen in our previous report and that by Chen et al. (13.Wong W.T. Chan K.C. So P.K. Yap H.K. Chung W.H. Leung Y.C. Wong K.Y. Zhao Y.

Unexpectedly, the imidazole side chain group of His-166 adopts an alternative conformation and is completely flipped out of the active site in the ES*-acylation structure (Fig. 4, a and b). This motion by His-166 displaces the side chains of Asn-104 and Tyr-105, leading to a new H-bond formed between the flipped-out His-166 and Asn-104 (supplemental Fig. S1). Two water molecules emerge within the active site near the area vacated by the His-166 side chain. One water molecule (WAT1) is located within 2.77 Å from the carbonyl carbon of the acyl adduct, poised to act as the deacylation water to carry out nucleophilic attack on the ES* moiety for hydrolysis of the acyl adduct (Fig. 4b). The other water molecule (WAT2) is located between WAT1 and His-166, forming hydrogen bonds with both of them as well as the nearby residue Asn-132 (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, Lys-73 adopts a slightly altered conformation with its side chain tilted away from the Ser-70 Oγ atom (distance 3.21 Å) and engaged in stable H-bonds with the backbone carbonyl and hydroxyl side chain of Ser-130 (distance 2.97 Å and 2.94 Å, respectively) while maintaining H-bond with Asn-132 (distance 2.70 Å) (Fig. 4b). We are intrigued by this “flipped-out” conformation of His-166, which has never been reported in any other β-lactamase structures. Apparently it is tied to the acylation reaction. As the protonated Lys-73 at the apo-state needs to be deprotonated when serving as general base for the acylation reaction, one speculation is for a proton to be transferred from the −NH3+ group of Lys-73 side chain to the Nϵ2 atom of His-166 via the Lys-73/His-166 interaction. Simultaneously the deprotonated Lys-73 can abstract a proton from the Ser-70-OH group, and the activated Ser-70 becomes ready to carry out nucleophilic attack on the cephaloridine substrate (Fig. 4c). As all these events may occur in concurrent manner, the Lys-73/His-166 interaction thus becomes unsustainable when both residues become protonated. As a result, the protonated His-166 would adopt a “flipped-out” conformation to avoid electrostatic repulsion with Lys-73 (Fig. 4c). To test whether substrate-induced proton transfer from Lys-73 to His-166 would render the active site unsuitable for catalysis unless His-166 flips out, we carried out molecular dynamics (MD) analysis. Two models of the enzyme-substrate complex, one with His-166 adopting the “in” conformation and the other with flipped-out conformation, were constructed using the ES*-acylation structure as the starting conformation (Fig. 5, a and b). In both models the ES* acyl adduct was replaced with Ser-70 and cephaloridine. Lys-73 was set as deprotonated, and His-166 was protonated. In the MD trajectories with His-166 at the “in” conformation, the distance between the Hγ atom of the Ser-70 side chain (HG) and the Nϵ atom of Lys-73 side chain (NZ) is always larger than 3.5 Å after equilibration, suggesting that no H-bond is formed between them, and thus proton abstraction to activate Ser-70 could not occur under this conformation (Fig. 5a). In contrast, in the MD trajectories with His-166 at the flipped-out conformation, the distance between Ser-70:Hγ and Lys-73:Nϵ is stable at ∼1.8 Å, within the range for ready proton transfer (Fig. 5b). The distance between Ser-70:Oγ (OG) and C3 of cephaloridine is also steady at ∼3.0 Å, suitable to establish the covalent linkage for acyl adduct (Fig. 5b). Thus, our MD simulations suggest that the active site is only suitable for the acylation reaction if the protonated His-166 adopts the flipped-out conformation, in support of our crystal structure. The ES*-deacylation structure was obtained when cephaloridine-soaked E166H crystals were equilibrated in cephaloridine-free solution for 1 min first and then flash-frozen and mounted onto an X-ray source. This additional equilibration step is designed to capture the E166H active site at a state when the deacylation state is engaged, while the ES* acyl adduct is still intact. This state can be tracked by X-ray crystallography because the E166H mutation has significantly slowed down the kinetic rate of deacylation to the order of minutes. The ES*-deacylation structure is essentially the same as that for the ES*-acylation state with overall r.m.s.d. of only ∼0.3 Å. The Fo − Fc map reveals the full cephaloridine acyl adduct covalently linked to Ser-70 in an orientation identical to that in the ES*-acylation structure (Fig. 6a). Interestingly, His-166 side chain is reverted back into the active site and occupies the same position as seen in the apo structure (Fig. 6a). With this “revert-in” conformation, His-166 displaces the water molecule WAT2 seen in ES*-acylation structure, while the deacylation water WAT1 remains at the same position. This way His-166 is well positioned to serve as general base for deacylation by abstracting a proton from WAT1 (Fig. 6a). Intriguingly, close inspection reveals that this “revert-in” conformation of His-166 is not exactly the same as the “in” conformation in the apo structure because the imidazole ring is flipped 180° so that the Nϵ2 atom can form an H-bond with WAT1 (distance 3.0 Å) for proton abstraction (Fig. 6a). Except for the “revert-in” movement of His-166, the rest of the active site remains largely unchanged when the active site progresses from ES*-acylation to ES*-deacylation. Asn-170 side chain is positioned very close to WAT1 (distance 2.5 Å), probably to provide a structural role in coordinating the deacylation water molecule (Fig. 6b). Lys-73 remains tilted away from Ser-70 and forms H-bonds with Ser-130 and Asn-132 instead (Fig. 6b). We tracked the progression of the deacylation reaction by equilibrating soaked crystals in cephaloridine-free buffer for longer, i.e. 5 and 6 min before mounting them to X-ray source. In the “deacylation 5-min” structure the electron density for acyl adduct starts to deteriorate, particularly for the pyridine ring and the dihydrothiazine group, suggesting active in crystallo deacylation (Fig. 6b). In the “deacylation 6-min” structure only a small piece of electron density is visible that extends beyond the Oγ moiety of Ser-70, possibly representing the carbonyl group of cephalori"
https://openalex.org/W2573746235,"Daily activities within an ant colony need precise temporal organization, and an endogenous clock appears to be essential for such timing processes. A clock drives locomotor rhythms in isolated workers in a number of ant species, but its involvement in activities displayed in the social context is unknown. We compared locomotor rhythms in isolated individuals and behavioral rhythms in the social context of workers of the ant Camponotus rufipes. Both forager and nurse workers exhibited circadian rhythms in locomotor activity under constant conditions, indicating the involvement of an endogenous clock. Activity was mostly nocturnal and synchronized with the 12:12h light-dark-cycle. To evaluate whether rhythmicity was maintained in the social context and could be synchronized with non-photic zeitgebers such as feeding times, daily behavioral activities of single workers inside and outside the nest were quantified continuously over 24 hours in 1656 hours of video recordings. Food availability was limited to a short time window either at day or at night, thus mimicking natural conditions of temporally restricted food access. Most foragers showed circadian foraging behavior synchronized with food availability, either at day or nighttime. When isolated thereafter in single locomotor activity monitors, foragers mainly displayed arrhythmicity. Here, high mortality suggested potential stressful effects of the former restriction of food availability. In contrast, nurse workers showed high overall activity levels in the social context and performed their tasks all around the clock with no circadian pattern, likely to meet the needs of the brood. In isolation, the same individuals exhibited in turn strong rhythmic activity and nocturnality. Thus, endogenous activity rhythms were inhibited in the social context, and timing of daily behaviors was flexibly adapted to cope with task demands. As a similar socially-mediated plasticity in circadian rhythms was already shown in honey bees, the temporal organization in C. rufipes and honey bees appear to share similar basic features."
https://openalex.org/W2574403546,"The wheat curl mite (WCM), Aceria tosichella Keifer, is a major pest of cereals worldwide that also comprises a complex of at least 16 genetic lineages with divergent physiological traits, including host associations and specificity. The goal of this study was to test the extent to which host-plant species and landscape spatial variation influence WCM presence and population density across the entire area of Poland (>311,000 km2). Three important findings arose from the results of the study. (1) The majority of WCM lineages analyzed exhibited variation in patterns of prevalence and/or population density on both spatial and host-associated scales. (2) Areas of occurrence and local abundance were delineated for specific WCM lineages and it was determined that the most pestiferous lineages are much less widespread than was expected, suggesting relatively recent introductions into Poland and the potential for further spread. (3) The 16 WCM lineages under study assorted within four discrete host assemblages, within which similar host preferences and host infestation patterns were detected. Of these four groups, one consists of lineages associated with cereals. In addition to improving basic ecological knowledge of a widespread arthropod herbivore, the results of this research identify high-risk areas for the presence of the most pestiferous WCM lineages in the study area (viz. the entirety of Poland). They also provide insight into the evolution of pest species of domesticated crops and facilitate testing of fundamental hypotheses about the ecological factors that shape this pest community."
https://openalex.org/W2577922159,"Background On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake occurred off of Japan’s Pacific coast, which was followed by huge tsunamis that destroyed many coastal cities in the area. Due to the earthquake and subsequent tsunami, malfunctions occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi (Fukushima I) nuclear power plant, resulting in the release of radioactive material in the region. While recent studies have investigated the effects of these events on the mental health of adults in the region, no studies have yet been performed investigating similar effects among children. Methods and Findings This study aims to fill that gap by: 1) assessing the mental health of elementary and middle school children living within the Fukushima prefecture of Japan, and 2) identifying risk and protective factors that are associated with the children’s mental health scores. These factors were quantified using an original demographics survey, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R), the latter two of which have been previously validated in a Japanese setting. The surveys were distributed to approximately 3,650 elementary and middle school students during the months of February and March, 2012. The data suggests that those children who had been relocated to the city of Koriyama had significantly higher SDQ scores than those children who were native to Koriyama (p < .05) as well as a control group that lived outside of the Fukushima prefecture (p < .01). Using a multivariate regression, we also found that younger age and parental trauma were significantly correlated with higher SDQ scores (p < .001), while gender, displacement from one’s home, and exposure to violence were not. Conclusions These results suggest that, among children affected by natural disasters, younger children and those with parents suffering from trauma-related distress are particularly vulnerable to the onset of pediatric mental disturbances."

We generated NOX4 knockout HeLa cell lines using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system to explore the cellular functions of NOX4. After transfection of CRISPR-Cas9 construct, we performed T7 endonuclease 1 assays and DNA sequencing to generate and identify insertion and deletion of the NOX4 locus. We confirmed the knockout of NOX4 by Western blotting. NOX4 knockout cell lines showed reduced cell proliferation with an increase of sub-G1 cell population and the decrease of S/G2/M population. Moreover, NOX4 deficiency resulted in a dramatic decrease in invadopodium formation and the invasive activity. In addition, NOX4 deficiency also caused a decrease in focal adhesions and cell migration in HeLa cells. These results suggest that NOX4 is required for both efficient proliferation and invasion of HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2578549409,"Soluble ligands have commonly been targeted by antibody therapeutics for cancers and other diseases. Although monoclonal antibodies targeting such ligands can block their interactions with their cognate receptors, they can also significantly increase the half-life of their ligands by FcRn-mediated antibody recycling, thereby evading ligand renal clearance and requiring increasingly high antibody doses to neutralize the increasing pool of target. To overcome this issue, we generated a bispecific/biparatopic antibody (BiSAb) that targets two different epitopes on IL-6 to block IL-6-mediated signaling. The BiSAb formed large immune complexes with IL-6 that can bind Fcγ receptors on phagocytic cells and are rapidly internalized. In addition, rapid clearance of the BiSAb·IL-6 complex was observed in mice while the parental antibodies prolonged the serum half-life of IL-6. Intravital imaging of the liver in mice confirmed that the rapid clearance of these large immune complexes was associated with Fcγ receptor-dependent binding to Kupffer cells in the liver. The approach described here provides a general strategy for therapeutic antibodies with the ability to not only neutralize but also actively drive clearance of their soluble antigens.

https://openalex.org/W2575172902,"Evaluation of bone marrow involvement (BMI) is paramount in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) for prognostic and therapeutic reasons. PET/CT scanner (PET) is now a routine examination for the staging of DLBCL with prognostic and therapeutic implications. This study evaluates the role of PET for detecting marrow involvement compared to bone marrow biopsy (BMB). This monocentric study included 54 patients diagnosed with DLBCL between 2009 and 2013 and who had FDG PET/CT in a pre-treatment setting. A correlation analysis of the detection of BMI by PET and BMB was performed. A prognostic evaluation of BMI by BMB and/or PET/CT and correlation with an overall 2-year survival were analyzed. PET was more sensitive for the detection of BMI than BMB (92.3% vs. 38.5%). It can be considered a discriminatory Pre-BMB test with a negative predictive value of 97.6%. In addition, BMI by PET had a prognostic value with strong correlation with progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 3.81; p = 0.013) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 4.12; p = 0.03) while the BMB had not. PET shows superior performance to the BMB for the detection of marrow involvement in DLBCL. It may be considered as the first line examination of bone marrow instead of the biopsy."

TrkC diverse functions might be attributed to the hypothetical non-coding RNAs embedded within the gene. Using bioinformatics approaches, a novel microRNA named TrkC-miR2 was predicted within the TrkC gene capable of regulating the Wnt pathway. For experimental verification of this microRNA, the predicted TrkC-premir2 sequence was overexpressed in SW480 cells, which led to the detection of two mature TrkC-miR2 isomiRs, and their endogenous forms were detected in human cell lines as well. Later, an independent promoter was deduced for TrkC-miR2 after the treatment of HCT116 cells with 5-azacytidine, which resulted in differential expression of TrkC-miR2 and TrkC host gene. RT-quantitative PCR and luciferase assays indicated that the APC2 gene is targeted by TrkC-miR2, and Wnt signaling is up-regulated. Also, Wnt inhibition by using small molecules along with TrkC-miR2 overexpression and TOP/FOP flash assays confirmed the positive effect of TrkC-miR2 on the Wnt pathway. Consistently, TrkC-miR2 overexpression promoted SW480 cell survival, which was detected by flow cytometry, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays, and crystal violate analysis. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that TrkC-miR2 is significantly up-regulated (∼70 times) in colorectal tumor tissues compared with their normal pairs. Moreover, the TrkC-miR2 expression level discriminated grades of tumor malignancies, which was consistent with its endogenous levels in HCT116, HT29, and SW480 colorectal cancer cell lines. Finally, an opposite expression pattern was observed for TrkC-miR2 and the APC2 gene in colorectal cancer specimens.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved, are 18–27 nucleotides long, and are endogenously made non-coding RNAs in many organisms (6Aranha M.M. Santos D.M. Solá S. Steer C.J. Rodrigues C. miR-34a regulates mouse neural stem cell differentiation.PloS ONE. 2011; 6: e21396Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The complicated secondary structure of miRNA precursor (pri-miRNA) is quickly processed into 1 or more (∼70) nucleotides long hairpin-structured pre-miRNA molecule(s), which is further processed into its mature form located either at the 5′ or 3′ side of the stem loop (7Krol J.

MicroRNA: a matter of life or death.World J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 1: 41-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mature miRNA in mammalian cells often pairs imperfectly to its target transcripts, resulting in either mRNA degradation or translation inhibition (9Wang Y. Lee C.G.

Therefore, several bioinformatics tools have been developed for prediction of novel miRNAs. This software is designed based on conservation of predicted miRNA sequence, its precursor secondary structure, stability information, and similarity of the predicted miRNA to the known miRNAs (11Berezikov E.

After our successful bioinformatics prediction and experimental verification of hsa-miR-11181 (19Dokanehiifard S. Soltani B.M. Parsi S. Hosseini F. Javan M. Mowla S.J. Experimental verification of a conserved intronic microRNA located in the human TrkC gene with a cell type-dependent apoptotic function.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2015; 72: 2613-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as the first miRNA located in TrkC gene, we predicted and verified TrkC-miR2, which is located in the vicinity of hsa-miR-11181. Functional analysis of the novel TrkC-miR2 confirmed its regulatory effect on Wnt signaling pathway and suggested its potential as a CRC biomarker. Among 150 predicted stem loops within the introns of TrkC gene, one of them located in 14th intron of the gene (hg17, chr15: 86307074–86307177) and at the vicinity of TrkC-miR1 (hsa-miR-11181) locus (Fig. 1A) had the most characteristics of a real miRNA precursor. SSC profiler predicted a bona fide mature miRNA sequence within this precursor (Fig. 1B), and Microprocessor SVM tool recognized Drosha and Dicer recognition sites in it (Fig. 1C). UCSC software also plotted a saddle-like pattern of conservation for the stem loop, which is a prominent characteristic of real miRNAs (Fig. 1D). A miRNA mature form was also conserved between mammals including dog and cat with a subtle variation of sequence compared with rodents (Fig. 1E). The predicted mature miRNA and its precursor were named TrkC-miR2 and TrkC-premir2, respectively. Moreover, miRNA Spotter, MiRmat, Pmirp, and Mature Bayes software predicted TrkC-miR2–5p as bona fide miRNA. No identical or similar miRNA for TrkC-miR2 has been reported in miRBase database. Alibaba2.1 Prediction Server online bioinformatics tool predicted an independent promoter for TrkC-miR2 at ∼800 bp upstream of the corresponding stem-loop, which may interact with some transcription factors including NF-κB. After the overexpression of a recombinant plasmid vector containing sequences of predicted TrkC-miR2 precursor in SW480 cell line, mature predicted miRNA was specifically amplified (Fig. 2A). When, the amplification products were cloned in the TA vector and sequenced, TrkC-miR2–5p sequence was represented in multiple sequencing results showing two nucleotides variation in its 3′ end, which resulted in TrkC-miR2–5p-CT and TrkC-miR2–5p-GC introduction (Fig. 2B). The minimum size of these sequences was submitted to the EMBL-EBI database, accessible by EBI accession numbers HG969187, HG969188, and HG969189 for TrkC-miR2–5p-CT, TrkC-miR2–5p-GC, and TrkC-premir2, respectively. In several RNA-sequencing data (NCBI-SRA) analysis attempts, multiple reads were detected showing TrkC-miR2–5p-CT expression, whereas no read was found for TrkC-miR2–5p-GC. Instead, several reads were detected in which the miRNA sequence was one nucleotide smaller than TrkC-miR2-5p-GC, meaning one nucleotide longer than TrkC-miR2–5p-CT. This may suggest a novel TrkC-miR2 isomiR (Fig. 2C). Endogenous TrkC-miR2 expression was also detected in HEPG2, SW480, HEK293t, HeLa, and fibroblast human cell lines through RT-qPCR (Fig. 2D). The highest expression level of TrkC-miR2 was detected in HEK293t cells, and the TrkC-miR2–5p-CT level was higher than TrkC-miR2–5p-GC isomiR in most of these cell lines (Fig. 2D). The HCT-116 cell line was treated with 5-azacytidin epidrug, and the expression levels of TrkC-miR2 and TrkC were measured and compared with the levels of these genes in untreated HCT-116 cells. RT-qPCR results indicated that the TrkC expression level has been elevated up to 100 times in the epidrug-treated cells compared with the untreated ones. However, TrkC-miR2-5p expression level was not affected by epidrug treatment (Fig. 2E). ∼700 target genes were predicted for TrkC-miR2-5p using Dianna lab software. APC2 (ENSG00000115266) gene was the highest scored target gene in which 23 highly conserved TrkC-miR2-5p-specific MREs were predicted in its 3′-UTR. A DNA fragment containing the TrkC-miR2 precursor was PCR-amplified from the human genome and cloned in fusion with GFP/ORF in the pEGFP-C1 expression vector. Then, RT-qPCR indicated significant down-regulation (60%) of the APC2 expression level in the SW480 cells transfected with TrkC-miR2 precursor (Fig. 3A). When 3′-UTR sequence of APC2 was cloned downstream of Renilla luciferase ORF and co-expressed with TrkC-miR2 in HEK293t cells, a dual luciferase assay supported direct interaction with APC2 transcript, showing 55% reduction in luciferase count (Fig. 3B). When, mutated APC2, 3′-UTR (supplemental Fig. 1) was used in the same experiment, and TrkC-miR2 overexpression did not significantly change the luciferase expression level (Fig. 3C). Co-expression of TrkC-miR2 with cassettes containing APC (supplemental Fig. 2A), AxinI (supplemental Fig. 2B), and AxinII (supplemental Fig. 2C) 3′-UTRs sequences downstream of Renilla luciferase ORF showed no significant alteration of Renilla luciferase activity compared with mock or scrambled controls. TrkC-miR2 overexpression effect on the Wnt signaling pathway was investigated through TOP/FOP flash assay. To this aim, Wnt signaling positive SW480 cells was transiently co-transfected using pGL4-TOP and TrkC-miR2-overexpressing vectors, and results were compared with the situation that pGL4-TOP was co-transfected with scrambled or mock recombinant vectors. Luciferase activity in the SW480-TOP cells overexpressing TrkC-miR2 was significantly increased (∼2-fold, p ≪ 0.05) compared with the mock and scrambled negative vectors. For the reporter assay, relative luciferase activities of SW480-TOP cells were strongly higher than those of SW480-FOP cells (Fig. 4A). The effect of TrkC-miR2 overexpression on the Wnt signaling pathway was further investigated through RT-qPCR analysis against downstream genes of the pathway. The expression level of the genes involved in canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways (c-MYC, CCND1, AxinI, APC1, B-catenin, and TNFα) was significantly elevated after TrkC-miR2 overexpression in SW480 cell line (Fig. 4B). SW480 cells were also treated with XAV932 (increases AxinI expression), PNU74654 (inhibits β-catenin and TCF interaction), and IWP-2 (inhibits LRP) small molecules in order to manipulate Wnt signaling pathway at different steps. Then, these cells were co-transfected with pGL4-TOP and TrkC-miR2-overexpressing vectors, and results were compared with the situation that pGL4-TOP was co-transfected with scrambled or mock constructs. Luciferase activity in SW480-TOP cells, which were treated with XAV932 and IWP-2, was significantly increased when TrkC-miR2 was overexpressed compared with the mock and scrambled negative vectors (p ≪ 0.05). However, when β-catenin and TCF interaction was inhibited by using PNU74654, overexpression of TrkC-miR2 did not significantly change the Wnt signaling (Fig. 4C). Using anti-TrkC-miR2, this miRNA was significantly down-regulated in SW480 cells (Fig. 4D), which was followed by the elevation of APC2 gene expression (Fig. 4E) and non-significant reduction of the Wnt activity (Fig. 4F). Scavenging of TrkC-miR2 through overexpression of APC2-3′-UTR (Fig. 4D) also resulted in elevation of APC2 gene expression (Fig. 4E) and also non-significant reduction of Wnt activity (Fig. 4F). Mock and HBEGF-3′-UTR constructs were applied as controls. Although the overexpression of TrkC-premiR2 in HUH7 cells (Fig. 4G) resulted in significant down-regulation of APC2 gene expression (Fig. 4H), it was not effective on the Wnt signaling activity (Fig. 4, I and J). Endogenous expression of TrkC-miR2–5p-CT was detected through RT-qPCR in low (HT29), intermediate (HCT-116), and high (SW480) grades of human colon cancer cell lines. The highest expression level of TrkC-miR2–5p-CT was detected in SW480 cell line; however, the minimum expression level of it was detected in the HT29 cell line (Fig. 5A). 5p-CT was detected in 36 colorectal cancer sample pairs, whereas TrkC-miR2-5p-GC expression was not detected. TrkC-miR2–5p-CT was ∼70-fold up-regulated in tumor tissues compared with the paired adjacent non-tumor samples (p ≪ 0.0001) (Fig. 5B), which was supported with Mann-Whitney analysis (Fig. 5C). CRC tumor samples were distributed in all four grades (1–4). These data showed significant differences between different grades of malignancy (Fig. 5D). Although TrkC-miR2 expression was not significantly altered between the tumors at stages of 2–4 (Mann-Whitney test, p ≫ 0.05), a non-significant steady/gradual increase of TrkC-miR2 expression was detected during the increase of CRC stages (p ≪ 0.005) (Fig. 5E). To investigate the suitability of TrkC-miR2-5p-CT for discrimination of tumor versus non-tumor states of CRC samples, sensitivity and specificity were calculated using ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis. An area under the curve = 0.79 for TrkC-miR2-5p-CT (p value = 0.0001; Fig. 5F) was calculated, which is a score greater than the cutoff (0.7) needed for a considerable biomarker. The expression levels of TrkC-miR2 and APC2 were compared in ≫20 individuals tumor samples showing a significant negative correlation between them with a correlation coefficient (r) of −0.592 (p = 0.0046) (Fig. 5, G–I). SW480 and HUH7 cell lines were transfected using TrkC-premir2-overexpressing vector, and cell cycle distribution of the cells was examined (Fig. 6). No significant sub-G1 population alteration was detected in HUH7 cells overexpressing TrkC-premir2 compared with the control cells (Fig. 6A). However, overexpression of TrkC-premir2 in SW480 cells rendered a significant reduction in sub-G1 cell population compared with the negative control. Knockdown of this miRNA did not significantly alter the subG1 population rate (Fig. 6B). Consistently, an MTT assay (Fig. 6C) and crystal violet analysis (Fig. 6D) indicated no significant proliferation rate alteration in the transfected HUH7 cells overexpressing TrkC-premir2 compared with the related control cells. Furthermore, overexpression of TrkC-premir2 in SW480 cells resulted in significant elevation of survival rate detected by both MTT (Fig. 6E) and crystal violet assays (Fig. 6F) compared with the negative control. miRNAs are known to be involved in many processes including cancer and differentiation (20Dalmay T.

Hence, discovery of common regulatory factors for the Wnt signaling pathway may provide the possibility of cell fate manipulation in the cases of diseases like CRC and tissue regeneration. Our previous attempts resulted in discovery of hsa-miR-6165 (27Parsi S. Soltani B.M. Hosseini E. Tousi S.E. Mowla S.J.

Herein, we gathered bioinformatics and supportive experimental evidences showing the presence of a second novel miRNA located in the TrkC gene that has the potential of being considered as a regulator of Wnt signaling pathway and also has the potential to be used as a valuable biomarker for diagnosis of CRC. One of the bona fide predicted stem loops in TrkC intron 14th (Fig. 1A), named TrkC-premir2, showed the most criteria for producing novel TrkC-miR2 (Fig. 1B). A Drosha processing site was predicted in TrkC-premir2 (Fig. 1C), and like most of known miRNAs precursors (12Berezikov E. Guryev V. van de Belt J. Wienholds E. Plasterk R.H. Cuppen E.

Also, there was no SRA (Sequence Read Archive) read for TrkC-miR2–5p-GC consistent with the lower expression level we have detected for this isomiR compared with the level of TrkC-miR2–5p-CT. Interestingly several SRA reads were found containing one nucleotide longer than TrkC-miR2–5p-CT, which could be considered as another TrkC-miR2 isomiR (Fig. 2C).

https://openalex.org/W2578123310,"Background/Aims The epidemiologic shift of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection in the South Korean population resulted in a peak outbreak of hepatitis in 2009. The aim of this study was to clarify the seropositivity of anti-HAV antibody (anti-HAV) and its demographic characteristics before and after the peak outbreak from 2005 to 2014. Methods This retrospective study analyzed the anti-HAV data of all individuals from 1,795 medical institutions referred to a major central laboratory from January 2005 through December 2014, as a sentineal tool for monitoring annual variation of anti-HAV positivity. The prevalence of anti-HAV was adjusted for age and area with the standard population based on the 2010 Census data. Results A total of 424,245 individuals were included in this study. The overall age-adjusted anti-HAV prevalence decreased from 65.6% in 2005 to 62.2% in 2014. During the 10-year period, the seroprevalence continuously decreased in persons aged 30 to 39 years (69.6% to 32.4%) and those aged 40 to 49 years (97.9% to 79.3%) due to the cohort effect. In contrast, it increased in persons aged 10 to 19 years (15.4% to 35.2%), while it was the lowest (8.7%) in 2010 before rebounding to 20.2% in 2014 in persons aged 20 to 29 years due to a vaccination effect. Conclusion Although the HAV vaccination rate increased, the anti-HAV seropositivity in South Korea decreased from 65.6% to 62.2% in this study population. In particular, the immunity of young adults was still low, and an outbreak of HAV is possible in the near future. Therefore, continuous monitoring and optimal preventive measures to prevent future outbreaks should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2576474101,"An increasing area of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton is being planted in saline-alkaline soil in China. The Bt protein level in transgenic cotton plants and its control efficiency can be affected by abiotic stress, including high temperature, water deficiency and other factors. However, how soil salinity affects the expression of Bt protein, thus influencing the control efficiency of Bt cotton against the cotton bollworm (CBW) Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) in the field, is poorly understood. Our objective in the present study was to investigate the effects of soil salinity on the expression of Bt toxin (Cry1Ac) and the control efficiency of Helicoverpa armigera in field-grown transgenic Bt cotton using three natural saline levels (1.15 dS m-1 [low soil-salinity], 6.00 dS m-1 [medium soil-salinity] and 11.46 dS m-1 [high soil-salinity]). We found that the Bt protein content in the transgenic Bt cotton leaves and the insecticidal activity of Bt cotton against CBW decreased with the increasing soil salinity in laboratory experiments during the growing season. The Bt protein content of Bt cotton leaves in the laboratory were negatively correlated with the salinity level. The CBW populations were highest on the Bt cotton grown in medium-salinity soil instead of the high-salinity soil in field conditions. A possible mechanism may be that the relatively high-salinity soil changed the plant nutritional quality or other plant defensive traits. The results from this study may help to identify more appropriate practices to control CBW in Bt cotton fields with different soil salinity levels."

Inflammation plays a critical role in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, whether steatosis per se promotes liver cancer, and the molecular mechanisms that control the progression in this disease spectrum remain largely elusive. The Janus kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway mediates signal transduction by numerous cytokines that regulate inflammation and may contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. Mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of JAK2 (L-JAK2 KO) develop extensive fatty liver spontaneously. We show here that this simple steatosis was insufficient to drive carcinogenesis. In fact, L-JAK2 KO mice were markedly protected from chemically induced tumor formation. Using the methionine choline-deficient dietary model to induce steatohepatitis, we found that steatohepatitis development was completely arrested in L-JAK2 KO mice despite the presence of steatosis, suggesting that JAK2 is the critical factor required for inflammatory progression in the liver. In line with this, L-JAK2 KO mice exhibited attenuated inflammation after chemical carcinogen challenge. This was associated with increased hepatocyte apoptosis without elevated compensatory proliferation, thus thwarting expansion of transformed hepatocytes. Taken together, our findings identify an indispensable role of JAK2 in hepatocarcinogenesis through regulating critical inflammatory pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2579548242,"Nearly 21 million components of blood and whole blood and transfused annually in the United States, while on average only 13.6 million units of blood are donated. As the demand for Red Blood Cells (RBCs) continues to increase due to the aging population, this deficit will be more significant. Despite decades of research to develop hemoglobin (Hb) based oxygen (O2) carriers (HBOCs) as RBC substitutes, there are no products approved for clinical use. Lumbricus terrestris erythrocruorin (LtEc) is the large acellular O2 carrying protein complex found in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris. LtEc is an extremely stable protein complex, resistant to autoxidation, and capable of transporting O2 to tissue when transfused into mammals. These characteristics render LtEc a promising candidate for the development of the next generation HBOCs. LtEc has a short half-life in circulation, limiting its application as a bridge over days, until blood became available. Conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG-LtEc) can extend LtEc circulation time. This study explores PEG-LtEc pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. To study PEG-LtEc pharmacokinetics, hamsters instrumented with the dorsal window chamber were subjected to a 40% exchange transfusion with 10 g/dL PEG-LtEc or LtEc and followed for 48 hours. To study the vascular response of PEG-LtEc, hamsters instrumented with the dorsal window chamber received multiple infusions of 10 g/dL PEG-LtEc or LtEc solution to increase plasma LtEc concentration to 0.5, then 1.0, and 1.5 g/dL, while monitoring the animals’ systemic and microcirculatory parameters. Results confirm that PEGylation of LtEc increases its circulation time, extending the half-life to 70 hours, 4 times longer than that of unPEGylated LtEc. However, PEGylation increased the rate of LtEc oxidation in vivo. Vascular analysis verified that PEG-LtEc showed the absence of microvascular vasoconstriction or systemic hypertension. The molecular size of PEG-LtEc did not change the colloid osmotic pressure or blood volume expansion capacity compared to LtEc, due to LtEc’s already large molecular size. Taken together, these results further encourage the development of PEG-LtEc as an O2 carrying therapeutic."

Mitochondria perform many important functions and are essential for all eukaryotes (1Friedman J.R. Nunnari J. Mitochondrial form and function.Nature. 2014; 505: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Whereas a small number of proteins are synthesized in the organelle, >95% of the mitochondrial proteome is nuclear-encoded, synthesized in the cytosol, and subsequently imported into mitochondria (2Chacinska A.

Thus, nuclear-encoded proteins not only need to be targeted to mitochondria but also sorted to their correct intra-mitochondrial destination. The mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) is of special interest.

Biogenesis of α-helically anchored OM proteins involves a number of import pathways, many of which are still poorly characterized. β-Barrel proteins are first imported into the IMS by the translocase of the OM (TOM), where they bind to the small translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) chaperones that hand them over to the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) by which they are integrated into the OM (2Chacinska A.

The insertion of some of the single membrane-spanning OM proteins depends exclusively on TOM subunits. Tom22 on the other hand requires the TOM receptors but subsequently is inserted into the OM by SAM and Mdm10 (19Thornton N. Stroud D.A. Milenkovic D. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Becker T.

However, most of what we know about mitochondrial protein import stems from work done in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a few related organisms.

T. brucei has a mitochondrion that in the insect stage of the parasite’s life cycle is capable of oxidative phosphorylation. In our study we have identified the features of the import signal of POMP10. Moreover, we show that its import is independent of both Sam50 and the trypanosomal functional analog of Tom40, termed archaic translocase of the mitochondrial OM 40 (ATOM40) (32Mani J. Desy S.

However, using RNAi-mediated ablation it could be demonstrated that the biogenesis of POMP10 does require the trypanosomatid-specific OM protein termed peripheral ATOM36 (pATOM36) that is loosely associated with the ATOM complex (35Pusnik M. Mani J. Schmidt O. Niemann M. Oeljeklaus S. Schnarwiler F. Warscheid B. Lithgow T. Meisinger C. Schneider A. An essential novel component of the non-canonical mitochondrial outer membrane protein import system of trypanosomatids.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 3420-3428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pATOM36 has recently been shown to mediate assembly of the ATOM complex as well as mitochondrial DNA inheritance (36Käser S. Oeljeklaus S. Týč J. Vaughan S. Warscheid B. Schneider A. Outer membrane protein functions as integrator of protein import and DNA inheritance in mitochondria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113: E4467-E4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). POMP10 is an abundant mitochondrial OM protein that is conserved in all kinetoplastids and which in T. brucei has a predicted molecular mass of 62.2 kDa. It does not have either conserved domains or orthologues outside the kinetoplastids. RNAi-mediated ablation of POMP10 does not affect growth or mitochondrial morphology (Fig. 1); its function therefore remains unknown. Most prediction programs indicate that POMP10 has a single transmembrane domain at its very N terminus (Table 1) that on both sides is flanked by positively charged amino acids (7Niemann M. Wiese S. Mani J. Chanfon A. Jackson C. Meisinger C. Warscheid B. Schneider A.

Bioinformatic analysis suggests it to be a signal-anchored protein, which would expose its soluble C-terminal domain to the cytosol. To experimentally confirm the predicted topology, we produced a transgenic cell line expressing a full-length POMP10 variant whose C terminus is fused to GFP. Fig. 2A shows that the POMP10-GFP fusion is expressed and that during cell fractionation it behaves like the mitochondrial marker proteins. This was confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF) analysis, which yields a staining pattern that is identical to the mitochondrial OM protein ATOM40 (see Fig. 4A). Protease protection assays using mitochondria isolated under isotonic conditions show that GFP-tagged POMP10 is protease-sensitive in intact mitochondria like the previously characterized protein import receptor ATOM69 (32Mani J.

On the other hand, the small TIM chaperone TIM9, which serves as a soluble marker of the IMS, is resistant to the treatment, illustrating that the purified mitochondria that were used in the assay have an intact OM. Only when the membrane barrier is destroyed by the addition of detergent does TIM9 become susceptible to the treatment and become degraded. To identify the signal that directs POMP10 to the OM, we produced a series of transgenic cell lines that allow tetracycline-inducible expression of a number of POMP10 variants, all of which were fused to GFP at their C terminus. The variants include a deletion of the membrane-spanning domain as well as a series of constructs in which the soluble domain was replaced by GFP. The differences between the latter concerns point mutations that replace the positively charged amino acids of either the cytosolic or the IMS-exposed membrane-flanking regions with neutral or negatively charged amino acids, respectively. Moreover, in one variant all positively charged residues were deleted (Fig. 3A). The immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts from all transgenic cell lines using an anti-GFP antiserum shows that all POMP10-GFP fusions are expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 3B). The localization of the different POMP10-GFP fusions was analyzed by IF as well as by isolation of crude mitochondrial fractions using digitonin extraction (37Schneider A. Bouzaidi-Tiali N. Chanez A.-L. Bulliard L. ATP production in isolated mitochondria of procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, to test whether the mitochondrially localized fusion proteins are stably inserted into the OM, we performed carbonate extraction at pH 10.8 and 11.5, respectively. This treatment disrupts protein-protein interactions but should not interfere with protein-lipid interactions. Insolubility after carbonate extraction at high pH is used as an operational definition for integral membrane proteins (38Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. Isolation of intracellular membranes by means of sodium carbonate treatment: application to endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that the full-length POMP10-GFP fusion is correctly localized to mitochondria and behaves as an integral membrane protein (Fig. 5A). However, if the N-terminal transmembrane domain is deleted, the POMP10-GFP fusion becomes soluble at low digitonin concentration, and it accumulates outside mitochondria in a punctate-like pattern as evidenced by IF (Fig. 4B). However, the complementary fusion protein in which the transmembrane domain, including the positively charged flanking residues, was directly fused to the GFP, on the other hand, was correctly localized and inserted into the OM (Fig. 4C and Fig. 5B). Further GFP variants that were tested either had the three N-terminal positively charged amino acids that flank the transmembrane domain (Fig. 4D) or the four positively charged lysines that flank the region C-terminally (Fig. 4E) or both (Fig. 4F) replaced by serines. All these POMP10-GFP fusions are still mitochondrially localized as evidenced by IF, which results in a staining pattern that is congruent with the mitochondrial marker ATOM40. Moreover, like the full-length POMP10, all these variants are recovered in a crude mitochondrial fraction obtained by digitonin extraction (Fig. 4, D–F, right panel). However, the carbonate extraction experiments in Fig. 5, C–E, show that replacing the positive charges by neutral ones on either side of the membrane-spanning domain causes a fraction of each of the POMP10-GFP fusions to be released into the supernatant. The soluble fraction became larger at higher pH and/or if both sides of the membrane-spanning domain carried neutral residues (Fig. 5E), indicating that in the absence of positively charged flanking amino acids the transmembrane domain, although still targeted to the mitochondrial OM, is less efficiently inserted into or anchored in the lipid bilayer. Overexpression of most of the truncated POMP10-GFP constructs (Fig. 4, D–F) that are targeted to mitochondria altered the morphology of the mitochondrial network as evidenced by enlarged sections that stain positive for mitochondrial marker proteins. All of these cell lines also grew more slowly, albeit to different extents, when expressing GFP fusion proteins (Fig. 6). This suggests that the altered mitochondrial morphology affects the overall fitness of the cells. However, the mechanism by which overexpression of the POMP10 membrane-spanning domain and its mutant derivatives when fused to GFP affects mitochondrial morphology remains to be elucidated. Although the membrane-spanning domain of POMP10-GFP is still targeted to mitochondria if the flanking positively charged amino acids are replaced by neutral amino acids (Fig. 4F), targeting was abolished if the transmembrane flanking regions were lost or if the positive residues were replaced by negatively charged glutamates (Fig. 4, G and H). IF analysis shows that the resulting POMP10-GFP fusions appear in part to be localized to discrete structures that do not overlap with the mitochondrial marker ATOM40. Moreover, the protein is released into the supernatant at low concentrations of digitonin. Having identified the signal that targets POMP10 to the mitochondrial OM, we wanted to investigate which protein factors might mediate its biogenesis. The mitochondrial OM of T. brucei contains three protein complexes involved in mitochondrial protein import. The most important one is the ATOM complex, the pore-forming component of which is the β-barrel protein ATOM40 (32Mani J. Desy S. Niemann M. Chanfon A. Oeljeklaus S. Pusnik M. Schmidt O. Gerbeth C.

As a functional analogue of the TOM complex, it is required for import of essentially all mitochondrial proteins. Insertion of β-barrel protein from the IMS side into the OM requires the SAM complex, the pore-forming component of which is the β-barrel protein SAM50 (39Sharma S. Singha U.K. Chaudhuri M. Role of Tob55 on mitochondrial protein biogenesis in Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2010; 174: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally, there is the trypanosomatid-specific protein pATOM36 that dynamically associates with the ATOM complex (35Pusnik M. Mani J. Schmidt O. Niemann M. Oeljeklaus S. Schnarwiler F. Warscheid B.

Among the different cytological preparations, liquid based cytology (LBC) represents a feasible and reliable method ensuring also the application of ancillary techniques (i.e immunocytochemistry-ICC and molecular testing). Methods We recorded 10348 LBC peritoneal effusions between January 2000 and December 2014. They were classified as non-diagnostic (ND), negative for malignancy-NM, atypical-suspicious for malignancy-SM and positive for malignancy-PM. Results The cytological diagnosis included 218 ND, 9.035 NM, 213 SM and 882 PM. A total of 8048 (7228 NM, 115SM, 705 PM) cases with histological follow-up were included. Our NM included 21 malignant and 7207 benign histological diagnoses. Our 820 SMs+PMs were diagnosed as 107 unknown malignancies (30SM and 77PM), 691 metastatic lesions (81SM and 610PM), 9 lymphomas (2SM and 7PM), 9 mesotheliomas (1SM and 8SM), 4 sarcomas (1SM and 3PM). Primary gynecological cancers contributed with 64% of the cases. We documented 97.4% sensitivity, 99.9% specificity, 98% diagnostic accuracy, 99.7% negative predictive value (NPV) and 99.7% positive predictive value (PPV). Furthermore, the morphological diagnoses were supported by either 173 conclusive ICC results or 50 molecular analyses. Specifically the molecular testing was performed for the EGFR and KRAS mutational analysis based on the previous or contemporary diagnoses of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and colon carcinomas. We identified 10 EGFR in NSCCL and 7 KRAS mutations on LBC stored material. Conclusions Peritoneal cytology is an adjunctive tool in the surgical management of tumors mostly gynecological cancers. LBC maximizes the application of ancillary techniques such as ICC and molecular analysis with feasible diagnostic and predictive yields also in controversial cases."
https://openalex.org/W2578675006,"Many pathogens, including those infecting insects, are transmitted via dormant stages shed into the environment, where they must persist until encountering a susceptible host. Understanding how abiotic conditions influence environmental persistence and how these factors influence pathogen spread are crucial for predicting patterns of infection risk. Here, we explored the consequences of environmental transmission for infection dynamics of a debilitating protozoan parasite (Ophryocystis elektroscirrha) that infects monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus). We first conducted an experiment to observe the persistence of protozoan spores exposed to natural conditions. Experimental results showed that, contrary to our expectations, pathogen doses maintained high infectivity even after 16 days in the environment, although pathogens did yield infections with lower parasite loads after environmental exposure. Because pathogen longevity exceeded the time span of our experiment, we developed a mechanistic model to better explore environmental persistence for this host-pathogen system. Model analysis showed that, in general, longer spore persistence led to higher infection prevalence and slightly smaller monarch population sizes. The model indicated that typical parasite doses shed onto milkweed plants must remain viable for a minimum of 3 weeks for prevalence to increase during the summer-breeding season, and for 11 weeks or longer to match levels of infection commonly reported from the wild, assuming moderate values for parasite shedding rate. Our findings showed that transmission stages of this butterfly pathogen are long-lived and indicated that this is a necessary condition for the protozoan to persist in local monarch populations. This study provides a modeling framework for future work examining the dynamics of an ecologically important pathogen in an iconic insect."

This type of therapy may be useful in a rehabilitative setting, though several questions remain regarding the most effective way to promote and sustain synchronization. The purpose of this study was to describe a new technique for using synchronization to influence a person’s gait and to compare walking behavior under this paradigm with that of side by side walking. Thirty one subjects walked on a motorized treadmill that was placed on a platform that oscillated vertically at various frequencies and amplitudes. Synchronization with the platform and stride kinematics were recorded during these walking trials and compared with previously reported data from side by side walking. The results indicated that vertical oscillation of the treadmill surface at frequencies that matched subjects preferred stride or step frequency resulted in greater unintentional synchronization when compared with side by side walking data (up to 78.6±8.3% of the trial vs 59.2±17.4%). While intermittent phase locking was observed in all cases, periods of synchronization occurred more frequently and lasted longer while walking on the oscillating treadmill (mean length of periods of phase locking 11.85 steps vs 5.18 steps). Further, stride length, height and duration were altered by changing the frequency of treadmill oscillation. These results suggest that synchronization to a haptic signal may hold implications for use in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2576288502,"In kidney, transcellular transport of Ca2+ is mediated by transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 and Na+-Ca2+ exchanger 1 proteins in distal convoluted and connecting tubules (DCTs and CNTs, respectively). It is not yet understood how DCT/CNT cells can adapt to differences in tubular flow rate and, consequently, Ca2+ load. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which DCT/CNT cells sense fluid dynamics to control transepithelial Ca2+ reabsorption and whether their primary cilia play an active role in this process. Mouse primary DCT/CNT cultures were subjected to a physiologic fluid shear stress (FSS) of 0.12 dyn/cm2. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 and Na+-Ca2+ exchanger 1 mRNA levels were significantly increased upon FSS exposure compared with static controls. Functional studies with 45Ca2+ demonstrated a significant stimulation of transepithelial Ca2+ transport under FSS compared with static conditions. Primary cilia removal decreased Ca2+ transport in both static and FSS conditions, a finding that correlated with decreased expression of genes involved in transepithelial Ca2+ transport; however, FSS-induced stimulation of Ca2+ transport was still observed. These results indicate that nephron DCT and CNT segments translate FSS into a physiologic response that implicates an increased Ca2+ reabsorption. Moreover, primary cilia influence transepithelial Ca2+ transport in DCTs/CNTs, yet this process is not distinctly coupled to FSS sensing by these organelles.—Mohammed, S. G., Arjona, F.

https://openalex.org/W2578845525,"Purpose To assess the immunomodulatory and clinical effects of lenalidomide with standard treatment of gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients and Methods Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were treated in first line with lenalidomide orally for 21 days of a 28 days cycle and the standard regimen for gemcitabine. In Part I, which we previously have reported, the dose of lenalidomide was defined (n = 12). In Part II, every other consecutive patient was treated with either lenalidomide (Group A, n = 11) or gemcitabine (Group B, n = 10) during cycle 1. From cycle 2 on, all Part II patients received the combination. Results A significant decrease in the proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the frequency of DCs were noted in patients at baseline compared to healthy control donors while the frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK-cells and MDSCs were significantly higher in patients compared to controls. In Group A, a significant increase in the absolute numbers of activated (HLA-DR+) CD4 and CD8 T cells and CD8 effector memory T cells (p<0.01) was noted during treatment. A statistical increment in the absolute numbers of Tregs were seen after cycle 1 (p<0.05). The addition of gemcitabine, reduced most lymphocyte subsets (p<0.05). In Group B, the proportion of lymphocytes remained unchanged during the study period. There was no difference in overall survival, progression free survival and survival rate at one year comparing the two groups. Discussion Patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma had impaired immune functions. Lenalidomide augmented T cell reactivities, which were abrogated by gemcitabine. However, addition of lenalidomide to gemcitabine seemed to have no therapeutic impact compared to gemcitabine alone in this non-randomized study. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01547260"
https://openalex.org/W2572816055,"Purpose To identify Myo/Nog cells in the adult retina and test their role in protecting retinal photoreceptors from light damage. Methods Light damage was induced by exposing albino rats raised in dim cyclic light to 1000 lux light for 24 hours. In one group of rats, Myo/Nog cells were purified from rat brain tissue by magnetic cell sorting following binding of the G8 monoclonal antibody (mAb). These cells were injected into the vitreous humour of the eye within 2 hours following bright light exposure. Retinal function was assessed using full-field, flash electroretinogram (ERG) before and after treatment. The numbers of Myo/Nog cells, apoptotic photoreceptors, and the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in Muller cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results Myo/Nog cells were present in the undamaged retina in low numbers. Light induced damage increased their numbers, particularly in the choroid, ganglion cell layer and outer plexiform layer. Intravitreal injection of G8-positive (G8+) cells harvested from brain mitigated all the effects of light damage examined, i.e. loss of retinal function (ERG), death of photoreceptors and the stress-induced expression of GFAP in Muller cells. Some of the transplanted G8+ cells were integrated into the retina from the vitreous. Conclusions Myo/Nog cells are a subpopulation of cells that are present in the adult retina. They increase in number in response to light induced stress. Intravitreal injection of Myo/Nog cells was protective to the retina, in part, by reducing retinal stress as measured by the Muller cell response. These results suggest that Myo/Nog cells, or the factors they produce, are neuroprotective and may be therapeutic in neurodegenerative retinal diseases."

Environmental and clinical toxigenic strains of V. parahaemolyticus that were isolated in Mexico from 1998 to 2012, including those from the only outbreak that has been reported in this country, were characterized genetically to assess the presence of the O3:K6 pandemic clone, and their genetic relationship to strains that are related to the pandemic clonal complex (CC3). Pathogenic tdh+ and tdh+/trh+ strains were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Also, the entire genome of a Mexican O3:K6 strain was sequenced. Most of the strains were tdh/ORF8-positive and corresponded to the O3:K6 serotype. By PFGE and MLST, there was very close genetic relationship between ORF8/O3:K6 strains, and very high genetic diversities from non-pandemic strains. The genetic relationship is very close among O3:K6 strains that were isolated in Mexico and sequences that were available for strains in the CC3, based on the PubMLST database. The whole-genome sequence of CICESE-170 strain had high similarity with that of the reference RIMD 2210633 strain, and harbored 7 pathogenicity islands, including the 4 that denote O3:K6 pandemic strains.

https://openalex.org/W245801375,"Cervical range of motion (ROM) is commonly assessed in clinical practice and research. In a previous study we decomposed active cervical sagittal ROM into contributions from lower and upper levels of the cervical spine and found level- and direction-specific impairments in women with chronic non-specific neck pain. The present study aimed to validate these results and investigate if the specific impairments can be explained by the neutral posture (defining zero flexion/extension) or a movement strategy to avoid large gravitationally induced torques on the cervical spine.Kinematics of the head and thorax was assessed in sitting during maximal sagittal cervical flexion/extension (high torque condition) and maximal protraction (low torque condition) in 120 women with chronic non-specific neck pain and 40 controls. We derived the lower and upper cervical angles, and the head centre of mass (HCM), from a 3-segment kinematic model. Neutral head posture was assessed using a standardized procedure.Previous findings of level- and direction-specific impairments in neck pain were confirmed. Neutral head posture was equal between groups and did not explain the direction-specific impairments. The relative magnitude of group difference in HCM migration did not differ between high and low torques conditions, lending no support for our hypothesis that impairments in sagittal ROM are due to torque avoidance behaviour.The direction- and level-specific impairments in cervical sagittal ROM can be generalised to the population of women with non-specific neck pain. Further research is necessary to clarify if torque avoidance behaviour can explain the impairments."
https://openalex.org/W2575700652,"NUB1 (Nedd8 ultimate buster 1) is an adaptor protein which negatively regulates the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 as well as neddylated proteins levels through proteasomal degradation. However, molecular mechanisms underlying this function are not completely understood. Here, we report that the oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 is a new NUB1 interacting protein which induces its ubiquitination. Interestingly, we found that Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of NUB1 is not a proteolytic signal. Instead of promoting the conjugation of polyubiquitin chains and the subsequent proteasomal degradation of NUB1, Mdm2 rather induces its di-ubiquitination on lysine 159. Importantly, mutation of lysine 159 into arginine inhibits NUB1 activity by impairing its negative regulation of Nedd8 and of neddylated proteins. We conclude that Mdm2 acts as a positive regulator of NUB1 function, by modulating NUB1 ubiquitination on lysine 159."
https://openalex.org/W2579610241,"Postnatal human cardiomyocyte proliferation declines rapidly with age, which has been suggested to be correlated with increases in oxidative DNA damage in mice and plays an important role in regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation. However, the relationship between oxidative DNA damage and age in humans is unclear.Sixty right ventricular outflow myocardial tissue specimens were obtained from ventricular septal defect infant patients during routine congenital cardiac surgery. These specimens were divided into three groups based on age: group A (age 0-6 months), group B (age, 7-12 months), and group C (>12 months). Each tissue specimen was subjected to DNA extraction, RNA extraction, and immunofluorescence.Immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR analysis revealed that DNA damage markers-mitochondrial DNA copy number, oxoguanine 8, and phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated-were highest in Group B. However immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR demonstrated that two cell proliferation markers, Ki67 and cyclin D2, were decreased with age. In addition, wheat germ agglutinin-staining indicated that the average size of cardiomyocytes increased with age.Oxidative DNA damage of cardiomyocytes was not correlated positively with age in human beings. Oxidative DNA damage is unable to fully explain the reduced proliferation of human cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2574269525,"Intercellular amino acid transport is essential for the growth of all multicellular organisms, and its dysregulation is implicated in developmental disorders. By an unknown mechanism, amino acid efflux is stimulated in plants by overexpression of a membrane-localized protein (GLUTAMINE DUMPER 1 (GDU1)) that requires a ubiquitin ligase (LOSS OF GDU 2 (LOG2). Here we further explore the physiological consequences of the interaction between these two proteins. LOG2 ubiquitin ligase activity is necessary for GDU1-dependent tolerance to exogenous amino acids, and LOG2 self-ubiquitination was markedly stimulated by the GDU1 cytosolic domain, suggesting that GDU1 functions as an adaptor or coactivator of amino acid exporter(s). However, other consequences more typical of a ligase-substrate relationship are observed: disruption of the LOG2 gene increased the in vivo half-life of GDU1, mass spectrometry confirmed that LOG2 ubiquitinates GDU1 at cytosolic lysines, and GDU1 protein levels decreased upon co-expression with active, but not enzymatically inactive LOG2. Altogether these data indicate LOG2 negatively regulates GDU1 protein accumulation by a mechanism dependent upon cytosolic GDU1 lysines. Although GDU1-lysine substituted protein exhibited diminished in vivo ubiquitination, overexpression of GDU1 lysine mutants still conferred amino acid tolerance in a LOG2-dependent manner, consistent with GDU1 being both a substrate and facilitator of LOG2 function. From these data, we offer a model in which GDU1 activates LOG2 to stimulate amino acid export, a process that could be negatively regulated by GDU1 ubiquitination and LOG2 self-ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W2578298786,"Regular surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients is essential to detect HCC earlier and to improve prognosis. This study investigated whether prescription of oral medication contributes to adherence to surveillance, early tumor detection, and overall survival (OS).A total of 401 CHB patients who were newly diagnosed with HCC were included: 134 patients received no medication (group 1), 151 received hepatoprotective agents such as ursodeoxycholic acid and silymarin (group 2), and 116 received antiviral agents (group 3) at two years before HCC diagnosis. The primary endpoint was OS, and secondary endpoints were compliance to regular surveillance and HCC status at diagnosis.Compared to group 1, both group 2 and 3 had higher rates of good compliance to regular surveillance (defined as participation in >80% of imaging intervals being ≤6 months) (58.2%, 90.1%, and 97.4%, respectively; P<0.001), more HCC diagnosed at a very early stage (20.9%, 32.5%, and 36.2%; P = 0.019) and smaller tumor size (2.8±2.4cm, 1.9±1.1cm, and 1.8±0.9cm; P<0.001). Finally, compared to group 1, both group 2 (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.97; P = 0.035) and group 3 (hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.71; P = 0.002) had significantly longer OS. In mediation analysis, prolonged OS is resulted considerably from indirect effect mediated by shorter imaging interval (>100% in group 2 and 14.5% in group 3) rather than direct effect of medication itself.Prescription of oral medication improves compliance to surveillance and enables early detection of HCC, which is associated with enhanced survival."
https://openalex.org/W2572913447,"By analyzing the different phenotypes of two Chinese DFNA9 families with the same mutation located in the intervening region between the LCCL and vWFA domains of cochlin and testing the functional changes in the mutant cochlin, we investigated the different pathogeneses for mutations in LCCL and vWFA domains.Targeted next-generation sequencing for deafness-related genes was used to identify the mutation in the proband in family #208. The probands of family #208 and family #32 with the same p.C162Y mutation were followed for more than 3 years to evaluate the progression of hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction using pure-tone audiometry, caloric testing, electrocochleogram, vestibular-evoked myogenic potential, and video head-impulse test. The disruption of normal cleavage to produce secreted LCCL domain fragments and the tendency to form aggregations of mutant cochlins were tested by in vitro cell experiments.The two families showed different clinical symptoms. Family #32 was identified as having early-onset, progressive sensorineural hearing loss, similar to the symptoms in DFNA9 patients with cochlin mutations in the vWFA domain. The proband of family #208 endured late-onset recurrent paroxysmal vertigo attacks and progressively deteriorating hearing, similar to symptoms in those with cochlin mutations in the LCCL domain. We therefore suggest that the disrupted cleavage of the LCCL domain fragment is likely to cause vestibular dysfunction, and aggregation of mutant cochlin caused by mutations in the vWFA domain is responsible for early-onset hearing loss. The p.C162Y mutation causes either disruption of LCCL domain fragment cleavage or aggregation of mutant cochlin, resulting in the different phenotypes in the two families.This study demonstrates that DFNA9 families with the same genotype may have significantly different phenotypes. The mutation site in cochlin is related to the pathological mechanism underlying the different phenotypes."

By studying epitope-tagged derivatives of mouse astrotactin-2 (Astn2) produced in transfected cells, we determined that the amino and carboxyl termini reside in the extracellular space and are initially linked by two transmembrane segments and a single cytoplasmic domain. We further show that Astn2 undergoes proteolytic cleavage in the second transmembrane domain (TM2) and that a disulfide bond holds the resulting two fragments together. Recombinant Astn1 also undergoes TM2 cleavage, as does Astn2 isolated from mouse cerebellum. Astn2 intramembrane proteolysis is insensitive to replacement of TM2 by the transmembrane domain of CD74 or by 21 alanines. However, replacement of TM2 by the transmembrane domain of CD4, the asialoglycoprotein receptor, or the transferrin receptor eliminates intramembrane proteolysis, as does leucine substitution of residues that overlap or are immediately upstream of the cleavage site. Replacement of the transmembrane domain of CD74 or the asialoglycoprotein receptor with Astn2 TM2 leads to the appearance of a carboxyl-terminal fragment consistent with intramembrane proteolysis. These experiments define a highly unusual transmembrane topology for the astrotactins, reveal intramembrane proteolysis as a feature of astrotactin maturation, and constrain the substrate sequences that are permissive for cleavage of one type 2 transmembrane segment.

https://openalex.org/W2578033638,"Introduction Literature data have shown that the consumption of dietary proteins may cause modulatory effects on the host immune system, process denominated oral tolerance by bystander suppression. It has been shown that the bystander suppression induced by dietary proteins can improve inflammatory diseases such as experimental arthritis. Here, we evaluated the effects of oral tolerance induced by ingestion of ovalbumin (OVA) on TNBS-induced colitis in mice, an experimental model for human Crohn’s disease. Methods and Results Colitis was induced in BALB/c mice by instilling a single dose of TNBS (100 mg/kg) in ethanol into the colon. Tolerized mice received OVA (4mg/mL) dissolved in the drinking water for seven consecutive days, prior to or concomitantly with the intrarectal instillation. Control groups received protein-free water and ethanol by intrarectal route. We observed that either the prior or concomitant induction of oral tolerance were able to reduce the severity of colitis as noted by recovery of body weight gain, improvement of clinical signs and reduction of histological abnormalities. The in vitro proliferation of spleen cells from tolerant colitic mice was lower than that of control mice, the same as the frequencies of CD4+ T cells secreting IL-17 and IFN-γ. The frequencies of regulatory T cells and T cells secreting IL-10 have increased significantly in mice orally treated with OVA. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-γ) were lower in supernatants of cells from tolerant colitic mice, whereas IL-10 levels were higher. Conclusion Our data show that the modulation of immune response induced by oral tolerance reduces the severity of experimental colitis. Such modulation may be partially attributed to the increase of Treg cells and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in peripheral lymphoid organs of tolerant mice by bystander suppression."
https://openalex.org/W4255614860,"Uroplakins are a widespread group of vertebrate integral membrane proteins that belong to two different families: UPK1a and UPK1b belong to the large tetraspanin (TSPAN) gene family, and UPK3a, UPK3b, UPK3c, UPK3d, UPK2a and UPK2b form a family of their own, the UPK2/3 tetraspanin-associated family. In a previous study, we reported that uroplakins first appeared in vertebrates, and that uroplakin tetraspanins (UPK1a and UPK1b) should have originated by duplication of an ancestor tetraspanin gene. However, the evolutionary origin of the UPK2/3 family remains unclear. In this study, we provide evidence that the UPK2/3 family originated by gene duplication and domain loss from a protoPTPRQ-like basal deuterostome gene. PTPRQs are members of the subtype R3 tyrosine phosphatase receptor (R3 PTPR) family, which are characterized by having a unique modular composition of extracellular fibronectin (FN3) repeats, a transmembrane helix, and a single intra-cytoplasmic phosphotyrosine phophatase (PTP) domain. Our assumption of a deuterostome protoPTPRQ-like gene as an ancestor of the UPK2/3 family by gene duplication and loss of its PTP and fibronectin (FN3) domains, excluding the one closest to the transmembrane helix, is based on the following: (i) phylogenetic analyses, (ii) the existence of an identical intron/exon gene pattern between UPK2/3 and the corresponding genetic region in R3 PTPRs, (iii) the conservation of cysteine patterns and protein motifs between UPK2/3 and PTPRQ proteins and, (iv) the existence in tunicates, the closest organisms to vertebrates, of two sequences related to PTPRQ; one with the full subtype R3 modular characteristic and another without the PTP domain but with a short cytoplasmic tail with some sequence similarity to that of UPK3a. This finding will facilitate further studies on the structure and function of these important proteins with implications in human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2572269208,"Emergency events can influence a child's kinematics prior to a car-crash, and thus its interaction with the restraint system. Numerical Human Body Models (HBMs) can help understand the behaviour of children in emergency events. The kinematic responses of two child HBMs-MADYMO 6 and 10 year-old models-were evaluated and compared with child volunteers' data during emergency events-braking and steering-with a focus on the forehead and sternum displacements. The response of the 6 year-old HBM was similar to the response of the 10 year-old HBM, however both models had a different response compared with the volunteers. The forward and lateral displacements were within the range of volunteer data up to approximately 0.3 s; but then, the HBMs head and sternum moved significantly downwards, while the volunteers experienced smaller displacement and tended to come back to their initial posture. Therefore, these HBMs, originally intended for crash simulations, are not too stiff and could be able to reproduce properly emergency events thanks, for instance, to postural control."
https://openalex.org/W2575142489,"Each cycle of translation initiation in bacterial cell requires free 50S and 30S ribosomal subunits originating from the post-translational dissociation of 70S ribosome from the previous cycle. Literature shows stable dissociation of 70S from model post-termination complexes by the concerted action of Ribosome Recycling Factor (RRF) and Elongation Factor G (EF-G) that interact with the rRNA bridge B2a/B2b joining 50S to 30S. In such experimental models, the role of full-length nascent protein was never considered seriously. We observed relatively slow release of full-length nascent protein from 50Sof post translation ribosome, and in that process, its toe prints on the rRNA in vivo and in in vitro translation with E.coli S30 extract. We reported earlier that a number of chemically unfolded proteins like bovine carbonic anhydrase (BCA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), lysozyme, ovalbumin etc., when added to free 70Sin lieu of the full length nascent proteins, also interact with identical RNA regions of the 23S rRNA. Interestingly the rRNA nucleotides that slow down release of the C-terminus of full-length unfolded protein were found in close proximity to the B2a/B2b bridge. It indicated a potentially important chemical reaction conserved throughout the evolution. Here we set out to probe that conserved role of unfolded protein conformation in splitting the free or post-termination 70S. How both the RRF-EFG dependent and the plausible nascent protein-EFG dependent ribosome recycling pathways might be relevant in bacteria is discussed here."
https://openalex.org/W2575375621,"Cool-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein 1 (Cat-1) is a signaling scaffold as well as an ADP-ribosylation factor-GTPase-activating protein. Although best known for its role in cell migration, we recently showed that the ability of Cat-1 to bind paxillin, a major constituent of focal complexes, is also essential for the anchorage-independent growth of HeLa cervical carcinoma cells. Here we set out to learn more about the underlying mechanism by which Cat-paxillin interactions mediate this effect. We show that knocking down paxillin expression in HeLa cells promotes their ability to form colonies in soft agar, whereas ectopically expressing paxillin in these cells inhibits this transformed growth phenotype. Although knocking down Cat-1 prevents HeLa cells from forming colonies in soft agar, when paxillin is knocked down together with Cat-1, the cells are again able to undergo anchorage-independent growth. These results suggest that the requirement of Cat-1 for this hallmark of cellular transformation is coupled to its ability to bind paxillin and abrogate its actions as a negative regulator of anchorage-independent growth. We further show that knocking down Cat-1 expression in HeLa cells leads to a reduction in Akt activation, which can be reversed by knocking down paxillin. Moreover, expression of constitutively active forms of Akt1 and Akt2 restores the anchorage-independent growth capability of HeLa cells depleted of Cat-1 expression. Together, these findings highlight a novel mechanism whereby interactions between Cat-1 and its binding partner paxillin are necessary to ensure sufficient Akt activation so that cancer cells are able to grow under anchorage-independent conditions."
