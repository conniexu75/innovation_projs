https://openalex.org/W1983031892,"While working on the metabolism of narcotic drugs, Axelrod observed that repeated administration of drugs produced tolerance
 to the drugs, but also reduced the body's ability to demethylate them enzymatically. In this article, he proposed a mechanism
 for tolerance to narcotic drugs. According to Axelrod, his hypothesis--that the continuous interaction of narcotic drugs
 with the demethylating enzymes deactivated the enzymes and possibly even the receptors of narcotic drugs, thus decreasing
 the subject's response to narcotic drugs--stimulated considerable criticism from some of his colleagues."

https://openalex.org/W2056358869,"IN the course of our studies of the chemical effects of X-rays on nucleic acids in aqueous solutions1, we have had occasion to measure the amounts of peroxide produced. Two methods were employed: (a) the reaction with titanium sulphate reagent2 and spectrophotometric measurement of the resulting complex at 405 mµ ; (b) the oxidation of potassium iodide3 and determination of the liberated iodine (I3 −) by the absorption at 353 mµ. It was found that, in solutions of thymus deoxyribonucleic acid and also of yeast ribonucleic acid irradiated in the presence of oxygen, the yields of total peroxide, as determined by the iodide method, were always greater than those of hydrogen peroxide, estimated by titanium sulphate. This observation can be explained by the presence of organic hydroperoxides in the irradiated nucleate solutions, since it is known that hydro-peroxides will oxidize iodide ions, but do not give, in general, the coloured complex with the titanium sulphate reagent."

https://openalex.org/W1973707671,"IN view of the blocking effect often exerted by the close chemical analogue of a pharmacologically specific agent, we tried to determine whether the psychological symptoms induced by D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD 25) could be influenced by one of its psychologically inactive derivatives. The 2-brom derivative of LSD 25 (BOL 148) exerts no psychological effects1."
https://openalex.org/W2158890128,"My conclusions, which, I confess, are tentative and based mainly on studies of one kind of cell, the grasshopper neuroblast, may be summarized as follows. The late prophase orientation of the chromosomes is a carry-over from the late telophase orientation. It is apparently maintained by means of the centromeres, which appear to be attached within a limited region of the nucleus throughout telophase, interphase, and prophase. Metaphase orientation of the chromosomes may be explained as the resultant of two forces: a force involving the centromere and spindle, which is responsible for keeping the centromeres in the equatorial plane of the spindle, and a repulsion force involving the noncentromeric portion of the chromosomes, which results in a tendency toward uniform spacing of the chromosomes outside the spindle. Anaphase separation of sister chromatids and their subsequent movement toward the poles of the spindle involves at least four distinct phases: (i) the initial poleward movement of the centromeres, which may be due to intrinsic repulsion or to a force acting between spindle and centromeres that produces an angle of almost 90 degrees between the separated and unseparated portions of the chromatids; (ii) the autonomous separation of the noncentromeric part of the chromosome; (iii) elongation of the spindle, beginning just after the sister chromatids are separated proximally and ending when the longer chromatids are about to lose contact distally; and (iv) the later movement apart of the daughter chromosomes, probably resulting from a pushing force exerted by elongation of the interzonal fibers."

https://openalex.org/W2009039061,"IT is generally believed that the absence of mitotic activity in migrating epithelial cells is one of the characteristic features of repair in epithelia. Migration alone is held to be responsible for epithelialization in the early stages of healing. Increased mitotic activity occurs later at some distance from the wound margins, and spreading cells are considered to exhibit mitosis only after they have become firmly fixed to the underlying tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2054075764,"Bell, Archer and Tomlin1, using the thromboplastin generation test, recently found the prolonged clotting time of horse blood to be due to a deficiency of anti-hæmophilic factor. However, Soulier and Larrieu2 have used horse plasma as a source of this factor. The thrombin generation test3,4 is useful in differentiating between classical hæmophilia and Christmas disease5. Applied to citrated horse plasma (containing 130,000 platelets per c.mm.) the following results were obtained (Fig. 1)."

Couillard of Brussels, I have discovered an easy method of procuring clean spores, newly hatching and developing specimens of the large free-living Amoebae (proteus, lescherae, discoides, kerrii). These stages are difficult to separate from ordinary stock cultures of the Amoebae. Hence, I am frequently asked for spores by teachers whose pupils are interested in the life-history of the large Amoebae."

Later, Eyquem (personal communication), Hill and Haberman2 and Dunsford (personal communication) produced reagents in goats, and Eyquem (personal communication) in donkeys. I have tried to produce a reagent in a variety of animals, including rabbits, hens, sheep and the horse. Rabbits, of course, have been used in many laboratories; but it seemed it would be an advantage if an animal could be used from which more serum was available when immunization was satisfactorily completed. Sheep were found to be satisfactory animals."
