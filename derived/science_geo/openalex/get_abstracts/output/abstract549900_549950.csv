The absorption of bluer light by an inexpensive overlying solar cell in a tandem arrangement would provide a step in the right direction by improving overall efficiency. Inorganic-organic perovskite cells can be tuned to have an appropriate band gap, but these compositions are prone to decomposition. McMeekin et al. show that using cesium ions along with formamidinium cations in lead bromide–iodide cells improved thermal and photostability. These improvements lead to high efficiency in single and tandem cells. Science , this issue p. 151"

https://openalex.org/W2230836247,"The cortico-hippocampal circuit is critical for storage of associational memories. Most studies have focused on the role in memory storage of the excitatory projections from entorhinal cortex to hippocampus. However, entorhinal cortex also sends inhibitory projections, whose role in memory storage and cortico-hippocampal activity remains largely unexplored. We found that these long-range inhibitory projections enhance the specificity of contextual and object memory encoding. At the circuit level, these γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-releasing projections target hippocampal inhibitory neurons and thus act as a disinhibitory gate that transiently promotes the excitation of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons by suppressing feedforward inhibition. This enhances the ability of CA1 pyramidal neurons to fire synaptically evoked dendritic spikes and to generate a temporally precise form of heterosynaptic plasticity. Long-range inhibition from entorhinal cortex may thus increase the precision of hippocampal-based long-term memory associations by assessing the salience of mnemonormation to the immediate sensory input."

These proteins are folded into a barrel shape composed of β-strands and inserted into the outer membrane by the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex. Bakelar et al. determined the crystal structure of a four-component BAM subcomplex. The structure of a central β barrel in BAM changes in the presence of the accessory components to create a lateral opening that may be involved in how BAM inserts proteins into the outer membrane.

It has dispersed globally with its human host, resulting in a distinct phylogeographic pattern that can be used to reconstruct both recent and ancient human migrations. The extant European population of H. pylori is known to be a hybrid between Asian and African bacteria, but there exist different hypotheses about when and where the hybridization took place, reflecting the complex demographic history of Europeans. Here, we present a 5300-year-old H. pylori genome from a European Copper Age glacier mummy. The ""Iceman"" H. pylori is a nearly pure representative of the bacterial population of Asian origin that existed in Europe before hybridization, suggesting that the African population arrived in Europe within the past few thousand years."

Signals in the atmospheric environment are processed into physiological outputs, including the immune response. Branchfield et al. show that rare airway cells called pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) sense and respond to airborne cues (see the Perspective by Whitsett and Morrisey). Inactivating Roundabout genes in mouse PNECs prevents normal PNEC clustering and causes an increase in the production of neuropeptides, which in turn trigger a heightened immune response. Thus PNECs, despite their rarity, are sensitive and effective rheostats on the airway wall that receive, interpret, and respond to environmental stimuli.

Introns are removed by a complex molecular machine, the spliceosome. Wan et al. determined the structure of a key subcomplex, the tri-SNP, that comprises three small nuclear RNAs and more than 30 proteins. The structure, determined by electron microscopy at 3.8 Å resolution, unexpectedly shows a primary RNA transcript bound in the tri-SNP. Further analysis revealed how the spliceosome assembles to achieve its complex functions. Science , this issue p. 466"

https://openalex.org/W2238576212,"Perilipins (PLINs) play a key role in energy storage by orchestrating the activity of lipases on the surface of lipid droplets. Failure of this activity results in severe metabolic disease in humans. Unlike all other lipid droplet-associated proteins, PLINs localize almost exclusively to the phospholipid monolayer surrounding the droplet. To understand how they sense and associate with the unique topology of the droplet surface, we studied the localization of human PLINs inSaccharomyces cerevisiae,demonstrating that the targeting mechanism is highly conserved and that 11-mer repeat regions are sufficient for droplet targeting. Mutations designed to disrupt folding of this region into amphipathic helices (AHs) significantly decreased lipid droplet targetingin vivoandin vitro Finally, we demonstrated a substantial increase in the helicity of this region in the presence of detergent micelles, which was prevented by an AH-disrupting missense mutation. We conclude that highly conserved 11-mer repeat regions of PLINs target lipid droplets by folding into AHs on the droplet surface, thus enabling PLINs to regulate the interface between the hydrophobic lipid core and its surrounding hydrophilic environment."

This pattern has largely eluded mechanistic explanation. Using 30 years of tree demography and growth data from a forest plot in Panama, Farrior et al. show that the power-law size structure emerges after natural local disturbances such as the gaps formed by falling trees. A model of forest dynamics identifies the structural parameter governing the power-law distribution.

https://openalex.org/W2261216599,"Mitochondria migration during mitosis Every time a cell divides, it is faced with the problem of ensuring adequate distribution of all components to the daughter cells. This includes components that are present in relatively small numbers, like the mitochondria and their DNA-containing nucleoids. Jajoo et al. used quantitative time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of single yeast cells to explore how this works. Unlike chromosomes or macromolecules, mitochondria and nucleoids are distributed in proportion to the volume of cytoplasm received by each daughter cell. Partitioning errors are kept low by even distribution of the mitochondrial volume and roughly equal spacing of the nucleoids before they are distributed. Science , this issue p. 169"

https://openalex.org/W2240118929,"NusG, referred to as Spt5 in archaeal and eukaryotic organisms, is the only transcription factor conserved in all three domains of life. This general transcription elongation factor binds to RNA polymerase (RNAP) soon after transcription initiation and dissociation of the RNA polymerase σ factor. Escherichia coli NusG increases transcription processivity by suppressing RNAP pausing, whereas Bacillus subtilis NusG dramatically stimulates pausing at two sites in the untranslated leader of the trpEDCFBA operon. These two regulatory pause sites participate in transcription attenuation and translational control mechanisms, respectively. Here we report that B. subtilis NusG makes sequence-specific contacts with a T-rich sequence in the non-template DNA (ntDNA) strand within the paused transcription bubble. NusG protects T residues of the recognition sequence from permanganate oxidation, and these T residues increase the affinity of NusG to the elongation complex. Binding of NusG to RNAP does not require interaction with RNA. These results indicate that bound NusG prevents forward movement of RNA polymerase by simultaneously contacting RNAP and the ntDNA strand. Mutational studies indicate that amino acid residues of two short regions within the NusG N-terminal domain are primarily responsible for recognition of the trp operon pause signals. Structural modeling indicates that these two regions are adjacent to each another in the protein. We propose that recognition of specific sequences in the ntDNA and stimulation of RNAP pausing is a conserved function of NusG-like transcription factors."

https://openalex.org/W2224504938,"Head motion (HM) is a well known confound in analyses of functional MRI (fMRI) data. Neuroimaging researchers therefore typically treat HM as a nuisance covariate in their analyses. Even so, it is possible that HM shares a common genetic influence with the trait of interest. Here we investigate the extent to which this relationship is due to shared genetic factors, using HM extracted from resting-state fMRI and maternal and self report measures of Inattention and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity from the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behaviour (SWAN) scales. Our sample consisted of healthy young adult twins (N = 627 (63% females) including 95 MZ and 144 DZ twin pairs, mean age 22, who had mother-reported SWAN; N = 725 (58% females) including 101 MZ and 156 DZ pairs, mean age 25, with self reported SWAN). This design enabled us to distinguish genetic from environmental factors in the association between head movement and ADHD scales. HM was moderately correlated with maternal reports of Inattention (r = 0.17, p-value = 7.4E-5) and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity (r = 0.16, p-value = 2.9E-4), and these associations were mainly due to pleiotropic genetic factors with genetic correlations [95% CIs] of rg = 0.24 [0.02, 0.43] and rg = 0.23 [0.07, 0.39]. Correlations between self-reports and HM were not significant, due largely to increased measurement error. These results indicate that treating HM as a nuisance covariate in neuroimaging studies of ADHD will likely reduce power to detect between-group effects, as the implicit assumption of independence between HM and Inattention or Hyperactivity-Impulsivity is not warranted. The implications of this finding are problematic for fMRI studies of ADHD, as failing to apply HM correction is known to increase the likelihood of false positives. We discuss two ways to circumvent this problem: censoring the motion contaminated frames of the RS-fMRI scan or explicitly modeling the relationship between HM and Inattention or Hyperactivity-Impulsivity."
https://openalex.org/W2230261500,"Flavonols are a group of secondary metabolites that affect diverse cellular processes. They are considered putative negative regulators of the transport of the phytohormone auxin, by which they influence auxin distribution and concomitantly take part in the control of plant organ development. Flavonols are accumulating in a large number of glycosidic forms. Whether these have distinct functions and diverse cellular targets is not well understood. The rol1-2 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana is characterized by a modified flavonol glycosylation profile that is inducing changes in auxin transport and growth defects in shoot tissues. To determine whether specific flavonol glycosides are responsible for these phenotypes, a suppressor screen was performed on the rol1-2 mutant, resulting in the identification of an allelic series of UGT89C1, a gene encoding a flavonol 7-O-rhamnosyltransferase. A detailed analysis revealed that interfering with flavonol rhamnosylation increases the concentration of auxin precursors and auxin metabolites, whereas auxin transport is not affected.

Of the major auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; IAA) produced by plants, only a minor fraction of ∼1% exists in this active form. Auxin can be conjugated to amino acids and/or sugars (mainly Glc in Arabidopsis) for storage in an inactive form or as an initial step for degradation (32Ostin A. Kowalyczk M. Bhalerao R.P.

In Arabidopsis, the most abundant degradation products of auxin are produced via oxidation, resulting predominantly in oxIAA (2-oxindole-3-acetic acid) and oxIAA-Glc (2-oxindole-3-acetyl-glucose, glucosyl-ester of oxIAA) (35Novák O.

Three oxidative metabolites of indole-3-acetic acid from Arabidopsis thaliana.Phytochemistry. 2007; 68: 1651-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This oxidation contributes to the formation of auxin gradients (37Pencík A. Simonovik B. Petersson S.V. Henyková E. Simon S. Greenham K. Zhang Y. Kowalczyk M. Estelle M. Zažímalová E. Novák O.

Cheng Y. Murphy A.S. Evidence of oxidative attenuation of auxin signalling.J. Exp. Bot. 2013; 64: 2629-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This correlation suggests that the anti-oxidant activity of flavonols (4Brown J.E. Khodr H. Hider R.C. Rice-Evans C.A. Structural dependence of flavonoid interactions with Cu2+ ions: implications for their antioxidant properties.Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) influences auxin degradation. The rol1-2 (repressor of lrx1) mutant is affected in one of three RHM genes, RHM1, encoding rhamnose synthase, which converts UDP-Glc to UDP-Rha (43Diet A. Link B. Seifert G.J. Schellenberg B. Wagner U. Pauly M. Reiter W.D. Ringli C.

The rol1-2 mutant was identified in a screen for alterations in cell wall structures and shows modifications in the Rha-rich cell wall component pectin (43Diet A. Link B. Seifert G.J. Schellenberg B. Wagner U. Pauly M. Reiter W.D. Ringli C.

In addition, rol1-2 also shows changes in the flavonol glycosylation profile, mainly a reduction in the degree of rhamnosylation, whereas the overall quantity of flavonols is not affected (30Ringli C. Bigler L. Kuhn B.M. Leiber R.M. Diet A. Santelia D. Frey B. Pollmann S. Klein M.

Geisler M. Bigler L. Ringli C. Flavonols accumulate asymmetrically and affect auxin transport in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2011; 156: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This confirms the importance of RHM1, which is co-expressed with genes important for flavonol biosynthesis (26Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Tohge T. Matsuda F. Nakabayashi R. Takayama H. Niida R. Watanabe-Takahashi A. Inoue E. Saito K. Comprehensive flavonol profiling and transcriptome coexpression analysis leading to decoding gene-metabolite correlations in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 2160-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and for flavonol glycosylation. rol1-2 seedlings are characterized by shorter roots and root hairs than in the wild type. The rol1-2 seedling shoot develops deformed trichomes and hyponastic cotyledons with brick-shaped pavement cells, whereas the wild type develops regular trichomes and epinastic cotyledons with puzzle-shaped jigsaw-like pavement cells (30Ringli C. Bigler L. Kuhn B.M. Leiber R.M. Diet A. Santelia D. Frey B. Pollmann S. Klein M.

There is no obvious growth defect detectable in rol1-2 adult plants, presumably due to the functional redundancy among the three RHM genes (45Reiter W.D. Vanzin G.F. Molecular genetics of nucleotide sugar interconversion pathways in plants.Plant. Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 95-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The short root phenotype of the rol1-2 mutant is most likely induced by the changes in pectin structures (43Diet A. Link B. Seifert G.J. Schellenberg B. Wagner U. Pauly M. Reiter W.D. Ringli C. The Arabidopsis root hair cell wall formation mutant lrx1 is suppressed by mutations in the RHM1 gene encoding a UDP-l-rhamnose synthase.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1630-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). By contrast, the aberrant shoot phenotype of the rol1-2 mutant is connected to the altered flavonol composition. Mutations affecting steps in flavonoid biosynthesis (Fig. 1) upstream of flavonols such as tt4 or tt6, mutations in the flavonol synthase (FLS1), or mutations in a positive regulator of flavonol biosynthesis encoded by MYB111 all suppress rol1-2, resulting in wild type-like shoot development, whereas root development is comparable with the rol1-2 single mutant (30Ringli C. Bigler L. Kuhn B.M. Leiber R.M. Diet A. Santelia D. Frey B. Pollmann S. Klein M. The modified flavonol glycosylation profile in the Arabidopsis rol1 mutants results in alterations in plant growth and cell shape formation.Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1470-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 44Kuhn B.M. Geisler M. Bigler L. Ringli C. Flavonols accumulate asymmetrically and affect auxin transport in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2011; 156: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A mutation in TT7, blocking quercetin accumulation, or any step farther downstream in the pathway has no effect on the rol1-2 shoot phenotype (30Ringli C. Bigler L. Kuhn B.M. Leiber R.M. Diet A. Santelia D. Frey B. Pollmann S. Klein M. The modified flavonol glycosylation profile in the Arabidopsis rol1 mutants results in alterations in plant growth and cell shape formation.Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1470-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 44Kuhn B.M. Geisler M. Bigler L. Ringli C. Flavonols accumulate asymmetrically and affect auxin transport in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2011; 156: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that the rol1-2 phenotype is induced by the accumulation of flavonol glycosides that interfere with proper plant development and that kaempferols are sufficient to induce this defect. Yin et al. (31Yin R. Han K. Heller W. Albert A. Dobrev P.I. Zažímalová E. Schäffner A.R. Kaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-rhamnoside is an endogenous flavonol inhibitor of polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis shoots.New Phytol. 2014; 201: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) have shown that the dwarf growth phenotype of the flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase mutant ugt78d2 correlates with the over-accumulation of 3-O-7-O-rhamnosylated kaempferol (K-R-3-R-7), and interfering with K-R-3-R-7 biosynthesis suppresses the growth defect of the ugt78d2 mutant. By contrast, the flavonol species inducing the rol1-2 phenotype is most likely not K-R-3-R-7, because this compound is present in lower amounts than in the wild type. Thus, it is likely that several flavonol glycosides can have an effect on plant development. Both rol1-2 and ugt78d2 show changes in auxin concentration or transport activity. For rol1-2, it was shown that auxin transport is reverted to wild-type levels when blocking flavonol accumulation (44Kuhn B.M. Geisler M. Bigler L. Ringli C. Flavonols accumulate asymmetrically and affect auxin transport in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2011; 156: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), thus indicating that flavonols do interfere with auxin distribution. Aiming at the identification of flavonol glycosides that induce the rol1-2 phenotype, EMS-induced suppressor mutants of rol1-2 were selected for specific changes in flavonol glycosylation. Several alleles of the 7-O-rhamnosyltransferase locus UGT89C1 were identified. The auxin transport activity in rol1-2 is not changed by a ugt89c1 mutation, but the levels of auxin conjugates and catabolites are strongly increased in the ugt89c1 mutant background. This indicates that flavonols affect not only auxin transport but also auxin turnover, and in this way modify auxin homeostasis. All lines described in this study are in the Col-0 genetic background. The rol1-2 allele and fls1-3 allele used in this study are described elsewhere (43Diet A. Link B. Seifert G.J. Schellenberg B. Wagner U. Pauly M. Reiter W.D. Ringli C.

Geisler M. Bigler L. Ringli C. Flavonols accumulate asymmetrically and affect auxin transport in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2011; 156: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For all analyses described, the ugt89c1-3 nonsense allele was used. Seeds were surface-sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.03% Triton X-100, plated on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium containing 0.6% Phytagel, 2% sucrose, 100 μg/ml myo-inositol, stratified for 4 days at 4 °C, and grown in a vertical orientation in a 16-h light, 8-h dark cycle at 22 °C. For propagation and crossings, 10-day-old plants were transferred to soil, grown in a 16-h light, 8-h dark cycle at 22 °C, and irradiated with white light (Biolux, Osram). The EMS screen was performed as described (44Kuhn B.M. Geisler M. Bigler L. Ringli C. Flavonols accumulate asymmetrically and affect auxin transport in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2011; 156: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and 75,000 M2 seedlings were screened for a suppressed rol1-2 mutant phenotype. All ugt89c1 alleles were backcrossed at least three times to Col-0 and rol1-2 prior to analysis. Plant transformation was done as described (43Diet A. Link B. Seifert G.J. Schellenberg B. Wagner U. Pauly M. Reiter W.D. Ringli C.

For the UGT89C1 complementation construct, the UGT89C1 genomic clone was PCR-amplified with the primers F7RT_PC 5′-GGCGCGCCAGACTACAGTTTGGCTAACCAG-3′ and F7RT_R3C 5′-TGAACCGCGTGTGTAATGTATC-3′, encompassing 1.5-kb promoter, 1.3-kb coding sequence, and 0.35-kb terminator sequence. The resulting fragment (UGT89C1:UGT89C1) was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) for sequencing. For the GFP fusion construct, a BamHI site was introduced into UGT89C1:UGT89C1 clone by PCR 3′ of the ATG (N-terminal fusion). PCR was performed with the primers F7RT_R4_NGFP 5′-GGATCCCATGATTGATGTTTTTTTCTTTC-3′ and F7RT_F6_NGFP 5′-GGATCCACAACAACAACAACGAAGAAGC-3′.

Yamada K.M. ECM-modulated cellular dynamics as a driving force for tissue morphogenesis.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2013; 23: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Depending on the source of the tissue, the difference in the composition and organization of the proteins in the ECM dictate the physical properties of that particular tissue. For example, bones consist of highly mineralized ECM that supports and resist compression (3Sapir-Koren R. Livshits G. Bone mineralization and regulation of phosphate homeostasis.IBMS BoneKEy. 2011; 8: 286-300Crossref Google Scholar), whereas skin has dense interpenetrating matrix, which is elastic, strong, and regenerative (4Watt F.M.

Cells within the tissue sense the physicochemical properties of the ECM and bind to each other through a gamut of different cell adhesion molecules, including integrins, cadherins, and trans-membrane proteoglycans, and regulate their own functions (5Choi Y. Chung H. Jung H. Couchman J.R. Oh E.S. Syndecans as cell surface receptors: unique structure equates with functional diversity.Matrix Biol. 2011; 30: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These interactions between the cell and its surrounding ECM through integrins and other receptors directly control cell adhesion, cell proliferation, and tissue organization (6Geiger B. Bershadsky A.

Amyloids are unique protein folds responsible for both disease and function in host organisms (7Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, functional amyloid, and human disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (4634) Google Scholar). Although the initial identification of amyloids emerged from their association with several human diseases, including Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, many amyloids with native functions in the host were also discovered from unicellular to multicellular organisms, including mammals (7Chiti F.

These amyloidogenic ECM components help these organisms to adhere onto the surface and form colonies. The above studies suggest that amyloids possess many ECM-like features and may be capable of supporting cell adhesion. In this context, amyloid fibrils functionalized with cell-adhesive RGD motifs were shown to support cell adhesion (31Gras S.L.

However, it remains unclear whether this cell-adhesive property is dependent on the sequence composition or is a consequence of the amyloid nature. Here we demonstrate that irrespective of the sequence, amyloid fibrils are capable of supporting cell adhesion. Unless specified, all chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma. Water was double-distilled and deionized using a Milli-Q system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). All of the peptide hormones except human galanin and somatostatin were a kind gift from Prof. Roland Riek (ETH Zurich). Somatostatin was purchased from BACHEM, and human galanin peptides were custom synthesized by USV Ltd. (Mumbai, India) with >95% purity. Purity of all of these peptides was further confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. To test the adhesion of cells on amyloid fibrils, the amyloid fibrils were prepared by dissolving the peptides of kassinin (2 mg/ml), GLP 1 (0.25 mg/ml), rat UCN (2 mg/ml), oCRF (2 mg/ml), glucagon (2 mg/ml), GIP (2 mg/ml), mouse UCN III (2 mg/ml), and Aβ(25–35) (1 mg/ml) in 5% d-mannitol with 0.01% sodium azide and incubated at 37 °C with slight rotation. The peptides of somatostatin (2 mg/ml), human GRF (2 mg/ml), bombesin (2 mg/ml), VIP (2 mg/ml), helodermin (2 mg/ml), GRP (2 mg/ml), galanin (1 mg/ml), β-endorphin (2 mg/ml), and Sub P (1 mg/ml) were also similarly dissolved in 5% d-mannitol with 0.01% sodium azide and incubated in the presence of 400 μm low molecular weight heparin at 37 °C in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. α-Synuclein (α-Syn) protein was expressed and purified according to the protocol described by Volles and Lansbury (38Volles M.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Relationships between the sequence of α-synuclein and its membrane affinity, fibrillization propensity, and yeast toxicity.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1510-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) in E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain. For α-Syn, 30 mg/ml lyophilized protein was dissolved in 20 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, and low molecular weight α-Syn was prepared by passing the dissolved protein through 100 kDa cut-off membrane as described before (39Singh P.K. Kotia V. Ghosh D. Mohite G.M. Kumar A. Maji S.K. Curcumin modulates α-synuclein aggregation and toxicity.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2013; 4: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The Eppendorf tubes containing peptide/protein solutions were placed into an EchoTherm model RT11 rotating mixture (Torrey Pines Scientific) at 50 rpm inside a 37 °C incubator. At suitable intervals, thioflavin T (ThT), circular dichroism (CD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to analyze the aggregation. CD spectroscopy is a commonly used technique to monitor the secondary structural transitions during protein/peptide aggregation studies (40Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Protein secondary structure analyses from circular dichroism spectroscopy: methods and reference databases.Biopolymers. 2008; 89: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). To study the conformational changes during the aggregation of proteins/peptides, 15 μl of peptide solutions was diluted in 5% d-mannitol to 200 μl such that the final peptide concentration was of 20 μm. For α-Syn, 10 μl of protein solution was diluted in 20 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, to 200 μl such that the final concentration was 15 μm. The protein/peptide solution was placed into a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell (Hellma, Forest Hills, NY), and the spectra were acquired using a JASCO 810 instrument. All measurements were done at 25 °C. Spectra were recorded over the wavelength range of 198–260 nm. Three independent experiments were performed with each sample. Raw data were processed by smoothing and subtraction of buffer spectra as per the manufacturer's instructions. ThT is an amyloid detection dye widely used to probe amyloid formation during protein aggregation (41LeVine 3rd, H. Thioflavine T interaction with synthetic Alzheimer's disease β-amyloid peptides: detection of amyloid aggregation in solution.Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to track amyloid formation in the aggregating mixtures of proteins/peptides, a 10-μl aliquot of peptide/protein samples was diluted to 500 μl in 5% d-mannitol containing 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide such that the final concentration of the peptide/protein was of 8 μm. For α-Syn, 10 μl of protein solution was diluted to 500 μl such that the final concentration was of 6 μm. These solutions were then mixed with 2 μl of 1 mm ThT prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fluorescence was measured immediately after the addition of ThT. The fluorescence experiment was carried out using a Fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon Inc.), with excitation at 450 nm and emission from 460 to 500 nm. The intensity values at 480 nm were plotted. Three independent experiments were performed for each sample. To examine the morphology of the protein/peptide amyloid fibrils under EM, aliquots of peptide/protein samples were diluted in distilled water to obtain a final concentration of ∼50 μm. The diluted solutions were spotted on a glow-discharged, carbon-coated Formvar grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) and incubated for 5 min. The grids were then washed with distilled water and stained with 1% (w/v) aqueous uranyl formate solution. Uranyl formate solution was freshly prepared and filtered through 0.22-μm sterile syringe filters (Millipore). EM analysis was performed using an FEI Tecnai G2 12-electron microscope at 120 kV with nominal magnifications in the range of 26,000–60,000. Images were recorded digitally by using the SIS Megaview III imaging system. At least two independent experiments were carried out for each sample. The images obtained were analyzed in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) to calculate fibril diameter. It was suggested previously that BSA could form amyloid fibrils at low pH and in the presence of high salt conditions (42Bhattacharya M. Jain N. Mukhopadhyay S. Insights into the mechanism of aggregation and fibril formation from bovine serum albumin.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2011; 115: 4195-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 43Usov I. Adamcik J. Mezzenga R. Polymorphism complexity and handedness inversion in serum albumin amyloid fibrils.ACS Nano. 2013; 7: 10465-10474Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To further examine the conditions required for BSA amyloid formation, lyophilized BSA (Sigma) was dissolved in PBS, pH 7.4, with a concentration of 21 mg/ml, and the concentration was determined by UV absorption measurement at 280 nm, considering the molar absorptivity of BSA as 43,824 m−1 cm−1. The 300 μm stock solution of BSA was used for the further study. The 300 μm BSA and 5 m NaCl stock solutions were used to search the optimal conditions for BSA amyloid formation. The concentration of BSA in the reaction was varied from 5 to 100 μm using 20 mm glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 3.0, and the NaCl concentration was varied from 0 to 300 μm. All solutions were incubated at 65 °C, and the aggregation and amyloid formation were monitored using ThT binding studies (data not shown). The condition that showed the highest ThT binding was considered as the amyloid-forming condition and was used for further studies. The secondary structural changes were determined by CD spectroscopy, and morphological analysis was done using an electron microscope. Further amyloid formation was confirmed using Congo Red (CR) binding by UV spectral assay and birefringence study. CR is a dye routinely used for detecting amyloid formation in protein/peptide aggregation studies (44Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Quantifying amyloid by Congo red spectral shift assay.Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In order to confirm the amyloid nature of BSA aggregates, CR binding studies were performed. For CR binding, a 10-μl aliquot of aggregated BSA (of 100 μm concentration) was mixed with 160 μl of PBS buffer containing 10% ethanol. Then 30 μl of 100 μm CR solution in PBS (containing 10% ethanol) was added. After a 5-min incubation in the dark at room temperature, CR absorbance was measured in the range of 300–700 nm using a JASCO V-650 spectrophotometer. Similarly, the CR alone spectrum was also recorded as a control. Three independent experiments were performed for each sample. To further confirm the binding of CR to amyloid fibrils, CR birefringence was performed. 50 μl of incubated solutions of protein/peptide aggregates was subjected to ultracentrifugation (Optima Max-XP, Beckman Coulter) at 90,000 rpm for 1 h and was washed once by distilled water. The pellets obtained were then used for performing CR birefringence. To do that, pellets were stained with CR solution for 20 min during continuous vortexing. The mixtures were again centrifuged at 90,000 rpm for 1 h, and pellets were washed twice with 500 μl of 20% ethanol. The pellets were resuspended in Milli-Q water and then spread evenly onto glass slides and air-dried at room temperature. The slides were analyzed using a microscope (Olympus SZ61 stereo zoom) equipped with two polarizer equipped with a CCD camera. The preparation of polyamino acid (PAA) amyloids was reported previously (45Fändrich M. Dobson C.M.

B. 2011; 115: 11010-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 1 mg of lyophilized powder of positively charged poly-l-lysine (PLL) (Mr 70,000–150,000; Sigma) and negatively charged polyglutamic acid (PE) (Mr 2000–15,000; Sigma) were separately dissolved in 1 ml of sterile Milli-Q water. The pH of PLL solution was adjusted to 11.1 by adding a few drops of 10 mm NaOH, and the pH of PE was adjusted to pH 4.1 with dilute HCl. These freshly prepared PAAs were then incubated at 65 °C for 48 h. For preparing poly-l-alanine (PLA) (Mr 1000–5000; MP Biomedicals) amyloid, 2 mg of PLA was dissolved in 100 μl of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) because it does not dissolve in most of the other solvents studied due to the highly hydrophobic nature of PLA. 10 μl of PLA solution was then gradually added into 190 μl of sterile Milli-Q water casted on a clean coverslip, and the entire setup was dried in steam. The resultant dried aggregates were collected and were used for the study. The secondary structure of PAA aggregates was analyzed using FTIR, and morphological analysis was done using an electron microscope. Further amyloid formation was confirmed using a CR binding by birefringence study and x-ray diffraction studies. For secondary structural analysis of the aggregated PAAs, FTIR spectroscopy was performed. FTIR spectra of the PAAs were recorded using a Vertex-80 FTIR instrument (Bruker, Germany) equipped with a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector. 10 μl of each aggregated PAA was spotted and dried on translucent KBr pellet that was made prior to the experiment by compressing ground KBr powder. 10 μl of sterile Milli-Q water was spotted on another KBr pellet and used for the background spectrum. FTIR spectra (1500–1800 cm−1) were recorded as an average of 32 scans, and raw data corresponding to the amide-I region (1600–1700 cm−1) was deconvoluted by the Fourier self-deconvolution method. The deconvoluted spectra were then subjected to a Lorenzian curve-fitting procedure using Opus-65 software. Two independent experiments were performed for each sample. For x-ray diffraction studies, sample solutions were dried either in glass capillary tubes or at the center of two glass rods arranged end to end. The resulting film was mounted parallel to the x-ray beam. The images were obtained using a Rigaku R Axis IV++ detector (Rigaku, Japan) mounted on a rotating anode. The sample to detector distance was 300 mm, and the image files were analyzed using Adxv software. Lyophilized powder of Aβ42 was a kind gift from Prof. Sudipta Maiti, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (Navy Nagar, India). 1 mg of Aβ42 fibril was suspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and the peptide was dissolved by adding a few drops of 10 mm NaOH into it, after which the pH of the solution was brought back to pH 7.4. The final concentration of this solution was 300 μm. Aβ(25–35) was purchased from BACHEM. For amyloid fibril preparation, 0.5 mg of this peptide was dissolved in 500 μl of sterile Milli-Q water to obtain 1 mm solution. Both of the Aβ solutions were incubated at 37 °C, and the aggregation and amyloid formation was monitored using ThT binding studies (data not shown). The secondary structural changes were determined by CD spectroscopy (data not shown), and morphological analysis was done using an electron microscope. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was carried out to evaluate the toxicity of all amyloid fibrils formed in presence and absence of heparin using neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (HiMedia, Mumbai, India) medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 humidified environment at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well on a 96-well plate. After 24 h of incubation, the old culture medium was replaced with fresh medium along with the addition of various amyloid fibrils at 10 μm final concentration, and cells were further incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, 10 μl of a 5 mg/ml MTT stock in PBS was added to each well, and the incubation was continued for 4 h. Finally, 100 μl of a solution containing 50% dimethylformamide and 20% SDS (pH 4.7) was added to each well and incubated. After overnight incubation in a 5% CO2 humidified environment at 37 °C, absorption values at 560 nm were determined with an automatic microplate reader (Spectramax M2, Molecular Devices). For evaluation of cell adhesion on amyloid fibrils, the fibrils were coated on glass coverslips. To do so, round glass coverslips of 12-mm diameter were first washed with 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min and then rinsed with PBS and subsequently sterilized. All coverslips were kept in 24-well plates and coated subsequently with different substrates. Glass coverslips were coated with 10 μg/cm2 of collagen and each amyloid fibril. For coating, each fibril solution was diluted in PBS, pH 7.4, and applied to the surface of the coverslip and kept at 4 °C overnight. The next day, excess solution was removed, and the surfaces were washed with PBS and blocked with 2% F127 Pluronic (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature before plating the cells. Mouse fibroblasts (L929 and NIH 3T3), neuroblastoma cell SH-SY5Y, and PC12 cells were obtained from the National Centre For Cell Science (Pune, India) and maintained as per established protocols. All cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and plated at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well. For density-dependent experiments, glass coverslips were coated with kassinin at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 7.5 μm at 37 °C for 2 h, blocked with 2% F127 Pluronic (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature to prevent nonspecific cell attachment, and UV-sterilized. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured for 24 h and plated at a seeding density of 4500 cells/cm2 on the coated substrates. For drug studies, cells were cultured for 24 h and then exposed to 10 μm (for NIH"
https://openalex.org/W2236390775,"The driving force behind Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles and much associated climate change is widely considered to be orbital forcing. However, previous versions of the iconic Devils Hole (Nevada) subaqueous calcite record exhibit shifts to interglacial values ~10,000 years before orbitally forced ice age terminations, and interglacial durations ~10,000 years longer than other estimates. Our measurements from Devils Hole 2 replicate virtually all aspects of the past 204,000 years of earlier records, except for the timing during terminations, and they lower the age of the record near Termination II by ~8000 years, removing both ~10,000-year anomalies. The shift to interglacial values now broadly coincides with the rise in boreal summer insolation, the marine termination, and the rise in atmospheric CO2, which is consistent with mechanisms ultimately tied to orbital forcing."

Merging old and new perspectives on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2014; 89: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 2Rosas-Ballina M. Tracey K.J. Cholinergic control of inflammation.J. Intern. Med. 2009; 265: 663-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). As with other nicotinic receptors, conventional thinking has focused on the function of α7 as a ligand-gated ion channel that is activated by the transmitter acetylcholine (ACh). However, this traditional perspective has been challenged and enlarged upon by numerous observations. First, α7 receptors can be activated by choline as well as ACh (3Papke R.L. Bencherif M. Lippiello P. An evaluation of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation by quaternary nitrogen compounds indicates that choline is selective for the α7 subtype.Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 213: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), removing it from the position of being strictly optimized for synaptic function and suggesting that it may respond to tissue factors, especially in the context of playing a role in the modulation of inflammation (4de Jonge W.J. Ulloa L. The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor as a pharmacological target for inflammation.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 151: 915-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Additional insights have come from the exploration of the rich pharmacology of this receptor, beginning with the identification of a variety of selective agonists and partial agonists that control the conformational dynamics of activation and desensitization in ways that are totally unlike the behavior of other nAChRs, such as those of the neuromuscular junction and autonomic ganglia that are clearly optimized for fast synaptic transmission (1Papke R.L. Merging old and new perspectives on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2014; 89: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Horenstein N.A. Leonik F.M. Papke R.L. Multiple pharmacophores for the selective activation of nicotinic α7-type acetylcholine receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1496-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To a large degree, the specializations of synaptic nAChR arise from the evolution of different types of subunits that create the ACh-binding site at the interface between α and non-α-type subunits. In contrast to synaptic-type nAChR, α7 receptors form as functional homopentameric receptors with five putative agonist-binding sites at the subunit interfaces (6Palma E. Bertrand S. Binzoni T. Bertrand D. Neuronal nicotinic α7 receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes presents five putative binding sites for methyllycaconitine.J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Activation of the α7 ion channel is most likely to occur with submaximal occupancy of the “orthosteric” agonist-binding sites (7Williams D.K. Stokes C. Horenstein N.A. Papke R.L. The effective opening of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with single agonist-binding sites.J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and even under optimal conditions, the channels activated by orthosteric agonists open with relatively low probability and for very brief periods of time compared with other nAChRs (8Williams D.K. Peng C. Kimbrell M.R. Papke R.L. The intrinsically low open probability of α7 nAChR can be overcome by positive allosteric modulation and serum factors leading to the generation of excitotoxic currents at physiological temperatures.Mol. Pharmacol. 2012; 82: 746-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The richness of α7 nAChR pharmacology also comes from the identification of highly selective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), which, to varying degrees, allow orthosteric agonists to overcome the factors that limit the channel's open probability (9Hurst R.S. Hajós M. Raggenbass M. Wall T.M. Higdon N.R. Lawson J.A. Rutherford-Root K.L. Berkenpas M.B. Hoffmann W.E. Piotrowski D.W. Groppi V.E. Allaman G. Ogier R. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Arneric S.P. A novel positive allosteric modulator of the α7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor: in vitro and in vivo characterization.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4396-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). PNU-120596, one of the most efficacious of such agents, destabilizes one of the non-conducting states promoted by high levels of agonist occupancy and induces a novel conducting state that is long-lived and associated with protracted bursts of openings (10Williams D.K. Wang J. Papke R.L. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of the α7 nAChR positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 provides evidence for two distinct desensitized states.Mol. Pharmacol. 2011; 80: 1013-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Data suggest that the binding site for such PAMs is within the transmembrane domains of the receptor (11Young G.T. Zwart R. Walker A.S. Sher E. Millar N.S. Potentiation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors via an allosteric transmembrane site.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A new class of α7 receptor activators has also recently been discovered, which, in addition to being able to potentiate orthosteric activation, can directly activate the receptor's ion channel through an allosteric mechanism. The prototypical compound with such ago-PAM activity is GAT107, the active isomer of 4BP-TQS (13Papke R.L. Horenstein N.A. Kulkarni A.R. Stokes C. Corrie L.W. Maeng C.Y. Thakur G.A.

The PAM activity of TQS, as well as the direct allosteric activation (DAA) produced by GAT107, appears to rely on binding to the same transmembrane site as other PAMs of the PNU-120596 type. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the DAA produced by GAT107 also relies on the binding of the drug to a separate site in addition to the transmembrane PAM site (Fig. 1A, note that this figure is based on a previous model (13Papke R.L.

In this study we provide several additional lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that DAA relies on the binding of GAT107 and active analogs to a unique site. A structural model suggests that this site is in the extracellular domain of the receptor extending into the vestibule of the ion channel. The properties of site-directed mutants support this model. Acetylcholine chloride (ACh), atropine, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The methanethiosulfonate compounds 2-(aminocarbonyl)ethyl methanethiosulfonate, 2-(quinuclidinium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA), and carboxymethyl methanethiosulfonate were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc.

MS m/z (M+ +1) for C21H23BrN2O2S, 448.06. A homology model for the α7 nAChR was constructed using the humanized AChBP structure Protein Data Bank code 3SQ9 (18Li S.X. Huang S. Bren N. Noridomi K.

Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) as the starting structure. The initial monomeric model was created using SwissModel (19Biasini M. Bienert S. Waterhouse A.

The resulting structure was assembled into a pentamer using the matchmaker routine within Chimera (20Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. UCSF Chimera–a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis.J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27950) Google Scholar). The structure was then relaxed by minimization with Amber 14 in a truncated octahedron of TIP3P water using the default PME method with a 10 Å cutoff. This preminimization utilized 5000 cycles of steepest decent followed by another 5000 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization. Each subunit then had ACh docked in and was reminimized as above but with the ACh molecules held fixed. This was repeated with the protein fixed and ACh, TIP3P water, and sodium counterions left unrestrained. Finally, the entire system was minimized with no restraints for 25,000 cycles of steepest decent followed by conjugate gradient minimization. The resulting structure was then subjected to a short 40-ps MD simulation for equilibration to 300 K at constant volume with weak restraint on the protein and then a 200-ps simulation at constant pressure until the density equilibrated to 1.03 g/ml. A subsequent 50-ns run at constant energy (NVE) was performed, over which time the system remained stable. A frame from this trajectory at 18.8 ns was minimized as above, and the bound ACh was extracted from the structure for docking using Glide (Schrodinger, Portland, OR) for docking at standard precision. Grids were calculated for a dimeric subunit, and during docking, ligand flexibility was allowed. Different poses were compared using the Glide Emodel score, which is more appropriate for ranking conformers than the Glide score. Molecular overlays for were prepared with the MatchMaker function within Chimera (20Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E.

The human α7 nAChR clone was obtained from Dr. J. Lindstrom (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The human resistance-to-cholinesterase 3 (RIC-3) clone, obtained from Dr. M. Treinin (Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel), was co-injected with α7 to improve the level and speed of α7 receptor expression without affecting the pharmacological properties of the receptors (22Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. Conservation within the RIC-3 gene family. Effectors of mammalian nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expression.J. Biol.

Subsequent to linearization and purification of the plasmid cDNAs, cRNAs were prepared using the mMessage mMachine in vitro RNA transfection kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Mutants were made as described previously (23Papke R.L. Stokes C. Williams D.K. Wang J. Horenstein N.A. Cysteine accessibility analysis of the human α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligand-binding domain identifies L119 as a gatekeeper.Neuropharmacology. 2011; 60: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cysteine mutants described (W149C, Y93C, and D101C) were made in a C116S pseudo wild-type Cys-null background to prevent the possible formation of spurious disulfides. Oocytes were surgically removed from mature X. laevis frogs (Nasco, Ft. Atkinson, WI) and injected with appropriate nAChR subunit cRNAs as described previously (24Papke R.L. Stokes C. Working with OpusXpress: methods for high volume oocyte experiments.Methods. 2010; 51: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Frogs were maintained in the Animal Care Service facility of the University of Florida, and all procedures were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. In brief, the frog was first anesthetized for 15–20 min in 1.5 liter of frog tank water containing 1 g of 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate buffered with sodium bicarbonate. The harvested oocytes were treated with 1.25 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington) for 2 h at room temperature in calcium-free Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.38 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 15 mm HEPES, and 12 mg/liter tetracycline, pH 7.6) to remove the follicular layer. Stage V oocytes were subsequently isolated and injected with 50 nl of 5–20 ng of nAChR subunit cRNA. Recordings were carried out 1–7 days after injection. Experiments were conducted using OpusXpress 6000A (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) (24Papke R.L. Stokes C. Working with OpusXpress: methods for high volume oocyte experiments.Methods. 2010; 51: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both the voltage and current electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at −60 mV. The oocytes were bath-perfused with Ringer's solution (115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 μm atropine, pH 7.2) at 2 ml/min. To evaluate the effects of experimental compounds compared with ACh-evoked responses of various nAChR subtypes expressed in oocytes, control responses were defined as the average of two initial applications of ACh made before test applications. The solutions were applied from a 96-well plate via disposable tips, and the test compounds were applied alone, co-applied with ACh, or co-applied with GAT107. Unless otherwise indicated, drug applications were 12 s in duration followed by a 181-s washout period. A typical recording for each oocyte constituted two initial control applications of ACh, one or more experimental compound applications, and then a follow-up control application of ACh to determine primed potentiation of the ACh-evoked responses. The control ACh concentration was 60 μm for wild-type α7 unless otherwise indicated. The responses were calculated as both peak current amplitudes and net charge, as described previously (25Papke R.L. Porter Papke J.K. Comparative pharmacology of rat and human α7 nAChR conducted with net charge analysis.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The average responses of the two initial ACh controls (60 μm unless otherwise indicated) from each cell were used for normalization. Statistical analyses were conducted based on unpaired t test comparisons of the normalized net-charge responses of groups of replicate oocytes. Data were collected at 50 Hz, filtered at 20 Hz, and analyzed by Clampfit 9.2 or 10.0 (Molecular Devices) and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Data were expressed as means ± S.E. from at least four oocytes for each experiment and plotted by KaleidaGraph 3.0.2 (Abe Beck Software, Reading, PA). Type II PAMs produce extremely large increases (>100,000-fold) in the single-channel currents of a small fraction of the receptors (≤1%), so they are intrinsically variable in amplitude and duration (10Williams D.K. Wang J. Papke R.L. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of the α7 nAChR positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 provides evidence for two distinct desensitized states.Mol. Pharmacol. 2011; 80: 1013-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), making it difficult to identify truly “representative” responses. Therefore, we displayed multicell averages for comparisons of these complex responses. The averages of normalized data were calculated using an Excel (Microsoft) template for each of the 10,500 points in each of the 210-s traces (acquired at 50 Hz). Following subtraction of the basal holding current, data from each cell, including the ACh controls, were normalized by dividing each point by the peak of the ACh control from the same cell. The normalized data were then averaged, and standard errors of the mean (S.E.) for the multicell averages were calculated on a point-by-point basis. The dark lines in the figures represent the average normalized currents, and the shaded areas the range of the S.E. Scale bars in the figures of averaged traces reflect the scaling factor relative to the average peak current amplitude of the ACh controls (con.) used for the normalization procedures. Also provided are those values converted to current amplitudes, based on the scaling factors and average ACh controls. Cell-attached records were obtained from A7R3HC10 cells and HEK293 cells stably expressing human α7 and human RIC-3, as described previously (8Williams D.K. Peng C. Kimbrell M.R. Papke R.L.

https://openalex.org/W2223972310,"Background Huntington’s disease patients have a number of peripheral manifestations suggestive of metabolic and endocrine abnormalities. We, therefore, investigated a number of metabolic factors in a 24-hour study of Huntington’s disease gene carriers (premanifest and moderate stage II/III) and controls. Methods Control (n = 15), premanifest (n = 14) and stage II/III (n = 13) participants were studied with blood sampling over a 24-hour period. A battery of clinical tests including neurological rating and function scales were performed. Visceral and subcutaneous adipose distribution was measured using magnetic resonance imaging. We quantified fasting baseline concentrations of glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein (a), fatty acids, amino acids, lactate and osteokines. Leptin and ghrelin were quantified in fasting samples and after a standardised meal. We assessed glucose, insulin, growth hormone and cortisol concentrations during a prolonged oral glucose tolerance test. Results We found no highly significant differences in carbohydrate, protein or lipid metabolism markers between healthy controls, premanifest and stage II/III Huntington’s disease subjects. For some markers (osteoprotegerin, tyrosine, lysine, phenylalanine and arginine) there is a suggestion (p values between 0.02 and 0.05) that levels are higher in patients with premanifest HD, but not moderate HD. However, given the large number of statistical tests performed interpretation of these findings must be cautious. Conclusions Contrary to previous studies that showed altered levels of metabolic markers in patients with Huntington’s disease, our study did not demonstrate convincing evidence of abnormalities in any of the markers examined. Our analyses were restricted to Huntington’s disease patients not taking neuroleptics, anti-depressants or other medication affecting metabolic pathways. Even with the modest sample sizes studied, the lack of highly significant results, despite many being tested, suggests that the majority of these markers do not differ markedly by disease status."
https://openalex.org/W2238399847,"Alteration in the L-type current density is one aspect of the electrical remodeling observed in patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmias. Changes in channel function could result from variations in the protein biogenesis, stability, post-translational modification, and/or trafficking in any of the regulatory subunits forming cardiac L-type Ca(2+) channel complexes. CaVα2δ1 is potentially the most heavily N-glycosylated subunit in the cardiac L-type CaV1.2 channel complex. Here, we show that enzymatic removal of N-glycans produced a 50-kDa shift in the mobility of cardiac and recombinant CaVα2δ1 proteins. This change was also observed upon simultaneous mutation of the 16 Asn sites. Nonetheless, the mutation of only 6/16 sites was sufficient to significantly 1) reduce the steady-state cell surface fluorescence of CaVα2δ1 as characterized by two-color flow cytometry assays and confocal imaging; 2) decrease protein stability estimated from cycloheximide chase assays; and 3) prevent the CaVα2δ1-mediated increase in the peak current density and voltage-dependent gating of CaV1.2. Reversing the N348Q and N812Q mutations in the non-operational sextuplet Asn mutant protein partially restored CaVα2δ1 function. Single mutation N663Q and double mutations N348Q/N468Q, N348Q/N812Q, and N468Q/N812Q decreased protein stability/synthesis and nearly abolished steady-state cell surface density of CaVα2δ1 as well as the CaVα2δ1-induced up-regulation of L-type currents. These results demonstrate that Asn-663 and to a lesser extent Asn-348, Asn-468, and Asn-812 contribute to protein stability/synthesis of CaVα2δ1, and furthermore that N-glycosylation of CaVα2δ1 is essential to produce functional L-type Ca(2+) channels."
https://openalex.org/W2233277607,"The aim of the present investigation was to verify the effect of H2O2-induced oxidative stress on SO4= uptake through Band 3 protein, responsible for Cl-/HCO3- as well as for cell membrane deformability, due to its cross link with cytoskeletal proteins. The role of cytoplasmic proteins binding to Band 3 protein has been also considered by assaying H2O2 effects on hemoglobin-free resealed ghosts of erythrocytes. Oxidative conditions were induced by 30 min exposure of human erythrocytes to different H2O2 concentrations (10 to 300 μM), with or without GSH (glutathione, 2 mM) or curcumin (10 μM), compounds with proved antioxidant properties. Since SO4= influx through Band 3 protein is slower and better controllable than Cl- or HCO3- exchange, the rate constant for SO4= uptake was measured to prove anion transport efficiency, while MDA (malondialdehyde) levels and -SH groups were estimated to quantify the effect of oxidative stress. H2O2 induced a significant decrease in rate constant for SO4= uptake at both 100 and 300 μM H2O2. This reduction, observed in erythrocytes but not in resealed ghosts and associated to increase in neither MDA levels nor in -SH groups, was impaired by both curcumin and GSH, whereas only curcumin effectively restored H2O2-induced changes in erythrocytes shape. Our results show that: i) 30 min exposure to 300 μM H2O2 reduced SO4= uptake in human erythrocytes; ii) oxidative damage was revealed by the reduction in rate constant for SO4= uptake, but not by MDA or -SH groups levels; iii) the damage was produced via cytoplasmic components which cross link with Band 3 protein; iv) the natural antioxidant curcumin may be useful in protecting erythrocytes from oxidative injury; v) SO4= uptake through Band 3 protein may be reasonably suggested as a tool to monitor erythrocytes function under oxidative conditions possibly deriving from alcohol consumption, use of drugs, radiographic contrast media administration, hyperglicemia or neurodegenerative diseases."

For confirmation, we increased group sizes and examined samples by pyrosequencing which revealed that DNA methylation in the NCAPH2/LMF2 promoter region was significantly decreased in the AD (n = 30) and aMCI (n = 28) groups as compared to the NC group (n = 30) (P < 0.0001, ANCOVA). No association was found between methylation levels and APOE genotype. NCAPH2/LMF2 methylation levels were considered to potentially be a convenient and useful biomarker for diagnosis of AD and aMCI."
https://openalex.org/W2227926474,"Background Natural killer cells are involved in the complex mechanisms underlying autoimmune diseases but few studies have investigated their role in autoimmune hepatitis. Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors are key regulators of natural killer cell-mediated immune responses. Methods and Findings KIR gene frequencies, KIR haplotypes, KIR ligands and combinations of KIRs and their HLA Class I ligands were investigated in 114 patients diagnosed with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis and compared with a group of 221 healthy controls. HLA Class I and Class II antigen frequencies were compared to those of 551 healthy unrelated families representative of the Sardinian population. In our cohort, type 1 autoimmune hepatitis was strongly associated with the HLA-B18, Cw5, DR3 haplotype. The KIR2DS1 activating KIR gene and the high affinity HLA-C2 ligands were significantly higher in patients compared to controls. Patients also had a reduced frequency of HLA-Bw4 ligands for KIR3DL1 and HLA-C1 ligands for KIR2DL3. Age at onset was significantly associated with the KIR2DS1 activating gene but not with HLA-C1 or HLA-C2 ligand groups. Conclusions The activating KIR gene KIR2DS1 resulted to have an important predictive potential for early onset of type 1 autoimmune hepatitis. Additionally, the low frequency of the KIR-ligand combinations KIR3DL1/HLA-Bw4 and KIR2DL3/HLA-C1 coupled to the high frequency of the HLA-C2 high affinity ligands for KIR2DS1 could contribute to unwanted NK cell autoreactivity in AIH-1."

It was long considered to consist of three genetically distinct α chains (α1, α2, and α3). Intracellularly, heterotrimeric molecules associate to form dimers and tetramers, which are then secreted and assembled to microfibrils. The identification of three novel long collagen VI α chains, α4, α5, and α6, led to the question if and how these may substitute for the long α3 chain in collagen VI assembly. Here, we studied structural features of the novel long chains and analyzed the assembly of these into tetramers and microfibrils. N- and C-terminal globular regions of collagen VI were recombinantly expressed and studied by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Ab initio models of the N-terminal globular regions of the α4, α5, and α6 chains showed a C-shaped structure similar to that found for the α3 chain. Single particle EM nanostructure of the N-terminal globular region of the α4 chain confirmed the C-shaped structure revealed by SAXS. Immuno-EM of collagen VI extracted from tissue revealed that like the α3 chain the novel long chains assemble to homotetramers that are incorporated into mixed microfibrils. Moreover, SAXS models of the C-terminal globular regions of the α1, α2, α4, and α6 chains were generated. Interestingly, the α1, α2, and α4 C-terminal globular regions dimerize.

https://openalex.org/W2228484160,"Objective To determine whether breech presentation is an independent risk factor for neonatal morbidity, mortality, or long-term neurologic morbidity in very preterm infants. Design Prospective population-based cohort. Population Singletons infants without congenital malformations born from 27 to 32 completed weeks of gestation enrolled in France in 1997 in the EPIPAGE cohort. Methods The neonatal and long-term follow-up outcomes of preterm infants were compared between those in breech presentation and those in vertex presentation. The relation of fetal presentation with neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcomes was assessed using multiple logistic regression models. Results Among the 1518 infants alive at onset of labor included in this analysis (351 in breech presentation), 1392 were alive at discharge. Among those eligible to follow up and alive at 8 years, follow-up data were available for 1188 children. Neonatal mortality was significantly higher among breech than vertex infants (10.8% vs. 7.5%, P = 0.05). However the differences were not significant after controlling for potential confounders. Neonatal morbidity did not differ significantly according to fetal presentation. Severe cerebral palsy was less frequent in the group born in breech compared to vertex presentation but there was no difference after adjustment. There was no difference according to fetal presentation in cognitive deficiencies/learning disabilities or overall deficiencies. Conclusion Our data suggest that breech presentation is not an independent risk factor for neonatal mortality or long-term neurologic deficiencies among very preterm infants."

Despite concern regarding the financial burden of CDs in the country, economic studies have focused only on diabetes, hypertension, and cancer. Furthermore, these estimated financial burdens were based on hypothetical epidemiology models or ideal healthcare scenarios. The present study estimates the annual expenditure per patient and the financial burden for the nine most prevalent CDs, excluding cancer, for each of the two largest public health providers in the country: the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS).Using the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey 2012 (ENSANUT) as the main source of data, health services consumption related to CDs was obtained from patient reports. Unit costs for each provided health service (e.g. consultation, drugs, hospitalization) were obtained from official reports. Prevalence data was obtained from the published literature. Annual expenditure due to health services consumption was calculated by multiplying the quantity of services consumed by the unit cost of each health service.The most expensive CD in both health institutions was chronic kidney disease (CKD), with an annual unit cost for MoH per patient of US$ 8,966 while for IMSS the expenditure was US$ 9,091. Four CDs (CKD, arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic ischemic heart disease) accounted for 88% of the total CDs financial burden (US$ 1.42 billion) in MoH and 85% (US$ 3.96 billion) in IMSS. The financial burden of the nine CDs analyzed represents 8% and 25% of the total annual MoH and IMSS health expenditure, respectively.The financial burden from the nine most prevalent CDs, excluding cancer, is already high in Mexico. This finding by itself argues for the need to improve health promotion and disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment to ensure CD primary and secondary prevention. If the status quo remains, the financial burden could be higher."
https://openalex.org/W2235349355,"The fast transient outward potassium current (Ito,f) plays a critical role in the electrical and contractile properties of the myocardium. Ito,f channels are formed by the co-assembly of the pore-forming α-subunits, Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, together with the accessory β-subunit KChIP2. Reductions of Ito,f are common in the diseased heart, which is also associated with enhanced stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs). We used cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes to examine how chronic β-AR stimulation decreases Ito,f. To determine which downstream pathways mediate these Ito,f changes, adenoviral infections were used to inhibit CaMKIIδc, CaMKIIδb, calcineurin, or nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). We observed that chronic β-AR stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO) for 48 h reduced Ito,f along with mRNA expression of all three of its subunits (Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and KChIP2). Inhibiting either CaMKIIδc nor CaMKIIδb did not prevent the ISO-mediated Ito,f reductions, even though CaMKIIδc and CaMKIIδb clearly regulated Ito,f and the mRNA expression of its subunits. Likewise, calcineurin inhibition did not prevent the Ito,f reductions induced by β-AR stimulation despite strongly modulating Ito,f and subunit mRNA expression. In contrast, NF-κB inhibition partly rescued the ISO-mediated Ito,f reductions in association with restoration of KChIP2 mRNA expression. Consistent with these observations, KChIP2 promoter activity was reduced by p65 as well as β-AR stimulation. In conclusion, NF-κB, and not CaMKIIδ or calcineurin, partly mediates the Ito,f reductions induced by chronic β-AR stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2237340462,"This study has been undertaken to explore the therapeutic effects of deguelin and specific siRNAs in HeLa cells. The data provided clearly show the silencing of ERK 1/2 with siRNAs and inhibition of ERK1/2 with deguelin treatment in HeLa cells. Additionally, we are providing information that deguelin binds directly to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 in the hydrophobic grooves, thereby releasing BAD and BAX from dimerization with these proteins. This results in increased apoptotic activity through the intrinsic pathway involved in rupture of mitochondrial membrane and release of cytochrome C. Evidence for inhibition of ERK1/2 by deguelin and escape of BAD phosphorylation at serine 112 through ERK/RSK pathway has been further fortified by obtaining similar results by silencing ERK 1/2 each with specific siRNAs. Increase in BAD after treatment with deguelin or siRNAs has been interpreted to mean that deguelin acts through several alternative pathways and therefore can be used as effective therapeutic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2236397857,"Acquiring expertise in complex visual tasks is time consuming. To facilitate the efficient training of novices on where to look in these tasks, we propose an attentional highlighting paradigm. Highlighting involves dynamically modulating the saliency of a visual image to guide attention along the fixation path of a domain expert who had previously viewed the same image. In Experiment 1, we trained naive subjects via attentional highlighting on a fingerprint-matching task. Before and after training, we asked subjects to freely inspect images containing pairs of prints and determine whether the prints matched. Fixation sequences were automatically scored for the degree of expertise exhibited using a Bayesian discriminative model of novice and expert gaze behavior. Highlighted training causes gaze behavior to become more expert-like not only on the trained images but also on transfer images, indicating generalization of learning. In Experiment 2, to control for the possibility that the increase in expertise is due to mere exposure, we trained subjects via highlighting of fixation sequences from novices, not experts, and observed no transition toward expertise. In Experiment 3, to determine the specificity of the training effect, we trained subjects with expert fixation sequences from images other than the one being viewed, which preserves coarse-scale statistics of expert gaze but provides no information about fine-grain features. Observing at least a partial transition toward expertise, we obtain only weak evidence that the highlighting procedure facilitates the learning of critical local features. We discuss possible improvements to the highlighting procedure."

ChnAC has been isolated from various bacteria and utilized as an enzymatic tool for study and evaluating the sequencing of GAGs. Despite its substrate specificity and the fact that its crystal structure has been determined to a high resolution, the direction in which ChnAC catalyzes the cleavage of oligosaccharides remain unclear. Herein, we have determined the structural cues of substrate depolymerization and the cleavage direction of ChnAC using model substrates and recombinant ChnAC protein. Several structurally defined oligosaccharides were synthesized using a chemoenzymatic approach and subsequently cleaved using ChnAC. The degradation products resulting from this process were determined by mass spectrometry. The results revealed that ChnAC cleaved the β1,4-glycosidic linkages between glucuronic acid and glucosamine units when these bonds were located on the reducing end of the oligosaccharide. In contrast, the presence of a GlcNAc-α-1,4-GlcA unit at the reducing end of the oligosaccharide prevented ChnAC from cleaving the GalNAc-β1,4-GlcA moiety located in the middle or at the non-reducing end of the chain. These interesting results therefore provide direct proof that ChnAC cleaves oligosaccharide substrates from their reducing end toward their non-reducing end.

We employed a newly developed PLGA-curcumin nanoformulation (PLGA-curcumin) in order to improve the solubility of curcumin, which has been a major obstacle in properly characterizing curcumin's mechanism of action and efficacy. We found that curcumin administered intrathecally or orally significantly attenuated hyperalgesia in mice with morphine-induced OIH. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the effects of curcumin on OIH correlated with the suppression of chronic morphine-induced CaMKIIα activation in the superficial laminae of the spinal dorsal horn. These data suggest that PLGA-curcumin may reverse OIH possibly by inhibiting CaMKIIα and its downstream signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2226612555,"Waist circumference (WC) is a good proxy measure of central adiposity. Due to the multiplicity of existing WC cut-offs and different measurement methods, the decision to use one rather than another WC chart may lead to different prevalence estimates of abdominal obesity in the same population. Aim of our study was to assess how much the prevalence of abdominal obesity varies in Italian schoolchildren using the different available WC cut-offs.We measured WC at just above the uppermost lateral border of the right ilium in 1062 Italian schoolchildren aged 7-14 years, 499 living in Northern Italy and 563 in Southern Italy. Abdominal obesity was defined as WC ≥90th percentile for gender and age according to nine WC charts.We found an extremely high variability in the prevalence of abdominal obesity detected in our study-populations according to the different WC charts, ranging in the overall group from 9.1% to 61.4%. In Northern Italy children it varied from 2.4% to 35.7%, and in Southern ones from 15.1% to 84.2%.On the basis of the chosen WC cut-offs the prevalence of abdominal obesity varies widely, because percentile-charts are strongly influenced by the population status in a particular moment. A further rate of variability may lay on the site of WC measurement and on the statistical method used to calculate WC cut-offs. Risk-weighted WC cut-offs measured in a standardized anatomic site and calculated by the appropriate method are needed to simply identify by WC measurement those children at high risk of cardio-metabolic complications to whom specific and prompt health interventions should be addressed."

Although FLNb shows high amino acid sequence similarity with FLNa, we reveal that only FLNa, but not FLNb, plays an essential role in tetherin turnover. We further showed that FLNa deficiency inhibited Vpu-mediated enhancement of virus release through interfering with the activity of Vpu to down-regulate cellular tetherin.

To date, however, the time-dependent changes of this parameter during acute kidney injury remain elusive. The aim of the present work was to define the time-course of urinary calprotectin secretion after ischaemia/reperfusion-induced kidney injury in comparison to neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, thereby monitoring the extent of tubular damage in nephron sparing surgery for kidney tumours.The study population consisted of 42 patients. Thirty-two patients underwent either open or endoscopic nephron sparing surgery for kidney tumours. During the surgery, the renal arterial pedicle was clamped with a median ischaemic time of 13 minutes (interquartile range, 4.5-20.3 minutes) in 26 patients. Ten retro-peritoneoscopic living donor nephrectomy patients and 6 nephron sparing surgery patients in whom the renal artery was not clamped served as controls. Urinary calprotectin and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentrations were repeatedly measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and assessed according to renal function parameters.Urinary concentrations of calprotectin and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin increased significantly after ischaemia/reperfusion injury, whereas concentrations remained unchanged after nephron sparing surgery without ischaemia/reperfusion injury and after kidney donation. Calprotectin and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels were significantly increased 2 and 8 hours, respectively, post-ischaemia. Both proteins reached maximal concentrations after 48 hours, followed by a subsequent persistent decrease. Maximal neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and calprotectin concentrations were 9-fold and 69-fold higher than their respective baseline values. The glomerular filtration rate was only transiently impaired at the first post-operative day after ischaemia/reperfusion injury (p = 0.049).Calprotectin and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin can be used to monitor clinical and sub-clinical tubular damage after nephron sparing surgery for kidney tumours. Urinary calprotectin concentrations start rising within 2 hours after ischaemia/reperfusion-induced kidney injury."
https://openalex.org/W2410612108,"Cellular signaling through protein tyrosine phosphorylation is well established in mammalian cells. Although lacking the classic tyrosine kinases present in humans, plants have a tyrosine phospho-proteome that rivals human cells. Here we report a novel plant tyrosine phosphatase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtRLPH2) that, surprisingly, has the sequence hallmarks of a phospho-serine/threonine phosphatase belonging to the PPP family. Rhizobiales/Rhodobacterales/Rhodospirillaceae-like phosphatases (RLPHs) are conserved in plants and several other eukaryotes, but not in animals. We demonstrate that AtRLPH2 is localized to the plant cell cytosol, is resistant to the classic serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and microcystin, but is inhibited by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate and is particularly sensitive to inhibition by the adenylates, ATP and ADP. AtRLPH2 displays remarkable selectivity toward tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides versus serine/threonine phospho-peptides and readily dephosphorylates a classic tyrosine phosphatase protein substrate, suggesting that in vivo it is a tyrosine phosphatase. To date, only one other tyrosine phosphatase is known in plants; thus AtRLPH2 represents one of the missing pieces in the plant tyrosine phosphatase repertoire and supports the concept of protein tyrosine phosphorylation as a key regulatory event in plants."

Using unique data from national registers in three Nordic countries, we aimed to characterize mortality directionality in children aged 0 to 9 years.The cohort study included all children born in Denmark from 1973 to 2008 (n = 2,433,758), Sweden from 1973 to 2006 (n = 3,400,212), and a random sample of 89.3% of children born in Finland from 1987 to 2007 (n = 1,272,083). Children were followed from 0 to 9 years, and cumulative mortality and mortality rates were compared by age, gender, cause of death, and calendar periods. Among the 7,105,962 children, there were 48,299 deaths during study period. From 1981-1985 to 2001-2005, all-cause mortality rates were reduced by between 34% and 62% at different ages. Overall mortality rate ratio between boys and girls decreased from 1.25 to 1.21 with the most prominent reduction in children aged 5-9 years (from 1.59 to 1.19). Neoplasms, diseases of the nervous system and transport accidents were the most frequent cause of death after the first year of life. These three leading causes of death declined by 42% (from 6.2 to 3.6 per 100,000 person years), 43% (from 3.7 to 2.1) and 62% (from 3.9 to 1.5) in boys, and 25% (from 4.1 to 3.1 per 100000 person years), 42% (from 3.4 to 1.9) and 63% (from 3.0 to 1.1) in girls, respectively. Mortality from neoplasms was the highest in each age except infants when comparing cause-specific mortality, and half of deaths from diseases of the nervous system occurred in infancy. Mortality rate due to transport accidents increased with age and was highest in boys aged 5-9 years.Mortality rate in children aged 0-9 years has been decreasing with diminished difference between genders over the past decades. Our results suggest the importance of further research on mortality by causes of neoplasms, and causes of transport accidents-especially in children aged 5-9 years."

Analysis of standard deviation revealed that the submucosal thickness in the manual fixation group was much more variable than in the fixation device group (p = 0.012, 0.042, and 0.001 for 2, 3, and 4 cm tissue specimens, respectively; Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variances).Among variously sized resected tissue specimens, submucosal thicknesses were more variable in the conventional fixation group, while the thicknesses were comparatively consistent in the fixation device group. After endoscopic submucosal dissection, pathologic preparation using this fixation device could offer more objective assessment of specimens."

Deregulation of the response can lead to severe consequences for the host organism ranging from immune deficiencies to autoimmunity. Tracking cell division and differentiation by flow cytometry using fluorescent probes is a major method for measuring progression of lymphocyte responses, both in vitro and in vivo. In turn, mathematical modeling of cell numbers derived from such measurements has led to significant biological discoveries, and plays an increasingly important role in lymphocyte research. Fitting an appropriate parameterized model to such data is the goal of these studies but significant challenges are presented by the variability in measurements. This variation results from the sum of experimental noise and intrinsic probabilistic differences in cells and is difficult to characterize analytically. Current model fitting methods adopt different simplifying assumptions to describe the distribution of such measurements and these assumptions have not been tested directly. To help inform the choice and application of appropriate methods of model fitting to such data we studied the errors associated with flow cytometry measurements from a wide variety of experiments. We found that the mean and variance of the noise were related by a power law with an exponent between 1.3 and 1.8 for different datasets. This violated the assumptions inherent to commonly used least squares, linear variance scaling and log-transformation based methods. As a result of these findings we propose a new measurement model that we justify both theoretically, from the maximum entropy standpoint, and empirically using collected data. Our evaluation suggests that the new model can be reliably used for model fitting across a variety of conditions. Our work provides a foundation for modeling measurements in flow cytometry experiments thus facilitating progress in quantitative studies of lymphocyte responses."

The other, citing heavy time pressures, asked me to draft the letter myself. I was sympathetic, but I felt queasy pretending to be someone else as I described my own work. To appease my conscience, I wrote as myself: “I” meant me and “you” meant my colleague. This was risky. If the colleague simply signed and sent the letter, neglecting the required pronoun switcheroo, the letter would instantly reveal its true originator. I am grateful that the colleague saved me that embarrassment, and even added authentic language to the letter.

> “This is an injustice to both the applicant and the responsible VIP.” 

Later, at a workshop on winning grant-writing strategies, I asked the instructor about this practice, describing my discomfort. The response was, “Get over it.” The practice is common, after all. A letter from an established senior person—a VIP for short—can strengthen an application for school admission, a job, or a grant. To write an informed, original letter from scratch, however, would require more knowledge of the candidate and the project than the VIP has time to acquire. It would be a poor professional investment, with the VIP's own duties, articles, and grant proposals clamoring for attention. Furthermore, as a salary comparison would show, the VIP's time is far more precious than the applicant's. (But how valid is this? Who knows what the applicant might achieve years hence? What was an hour of young Einstein's time worth?)

So the VIP says, “Sure! Glad to help! Of course, I'm a busy person. Draft it for me.” The applicant may be startled. How awkward, trying to write words of praise about oneself while pretending that they are someone else's. How much flattery is too much, or too little? Besides, isn't this a deception that betrays academia's dedication to truth?

In fact, a reviewer can often detect words that originated with the applicant. The discovery correctly devalues the letter, harming the applicant's chances. When the VIP does write an original and well-informed letter, the reviewer may still assume that its authorship, like that of so many other letters, is partly misrepresented. This is an injustice to both the applicant and the responsible VIP.

Pity the applicant receiving two such requests, feeling doubly queasy trying to draft two different letters for the same committee. Facing time pressure, the applicant may give both VIPs similar drafts, hoping they will make the extra effort to customize their letters enough to disguise the common origin. On a committee reviewing one such applicant, I read two letters that were virtually identical. The applicant took the fall, but the fault lies with the two VIPs, whose indifference doomed the application.

The worst consequence of this practice is the message imprinted on a young applicant's mind: “Everybody does it.” Apparently, minor frauds like this are not just condoned but expected by academic leaders. Apparently, people rise in the system by offloading work to the less powerful. Apparently, the words of the more prestigious are not golden; sometimes they are not even their own. Perhaps around the corner a slightly larger fraud is acceptable, including those too-common courtesy authorships for the highly placed. Then that leads to larger ones: covering up data problems and, ultimately, falsifying data. Thus do we introduce young people to our system. Several students I know lost some respect for VIPs who had students writing letters that they should be writing themselves.

You can help fix this. If you are a VIP asked to write a letter of support and you write it yourself, just add a notation: “The content of this letter is original with the undersigned author.” Applicant, go ahead and encourage your VIP to add it. The readers will know to exempt the letter from the usual degraded valuation. If this practice catches on, our scientific culture may swing back toward reverence for integrity.
