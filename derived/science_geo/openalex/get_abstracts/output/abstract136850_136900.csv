https://openalex.org/W2107705149,"Capsaicin, the main pungent ingredient in ""hot"" chili peppers, elicits buming pain by activating specific (vanilloid) receptors on sensory nerve endings. The cloned vanilloid receptor (VR1) is a cation channel that is also activated by noxious heat. Here, analysis of heat-evoked single channel currents in excised membrane patches suggests that heat gates VR1 directly. We also show that protons decrease the temperature threshold for VR1 activation such that even moderately acidic conditions (pH < or = 5.9) activate VR1 at room temperature. VR1 can therefore be viewed as a molecular integrator of chemical and physical stimuli that elicit pain. Immunocytochemical analysis indicates that the receptor is located in a neurochemically heterogeneous population of small diameter primary afferent fibers. A role for VR1 in injury-induced hypersensitivity at the level of the sensory neuron is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1986605182,"It has been suggested that some glutamatergic synapses lack functional AMPA receptors. We used quantitative immunogold localization to determine the number and variability of synaptic AMPA receptors in the rat hippocampus. Three classes of synapses show distinct patterns of AMPA receptor content. Mossy fiber synapses on CA3 pyramidal spines and synapses on GABAergic interneurons are all immunopositive, have less variability, and contain 4 times as many AMPA receptors as synapses made by Schaffer collaterals on CA1 pyramidal spines and by commissural/associational (C/A) terminals on CA3 pyramidal spines. Up to 17% of synapses in the latter two connections are immunonegative. After calibrating the immunosignal (1 gold = 2.3 functional receptors) at mossy synapses of a 17-day-old rat, we estimate that the AMPA receptor content of C/A synapses on CA3 pyramidal spines ranges from <3 to 140. A similar range is found in adult Schaffer collateral and C/A synapses."

https://openalex.org/W2020634566,"To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying activity-dependent synaptic remodeling in the developing mammalian visual system, we screened for genes whose expression in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is regulated by spontaneously generated action potentials present prior to vision. Activity blockade did not alter expression in the LGN of 32 known genes. Differential mRNA display, however, revealed a decrease in mRNAs encoding class I major histocompatibility complex antigens (class I MHC). Postnatally, visually driven activity can regulate class I MHC in the LGN during the final remodeling of retinal ganglion cell axon terminals. Moreover, in the mature hippocampus, class I MHC mRNA levels are increased by kainic acid-induced seizures. Normal expression of class I MHC mRNA is correlated with times and regions of synaptic plasticity, and immunohistochemistry confirms that class I MHC is present in specific subsets of CNS neurons. Finally, beta2-microglobulin, a cosubunit of class I MHC, and CD3zeta, a component of a receptor complex for class I MHC, are also expressed by CNS neurons. These observations indicate that class I MHC molecules, classically thought to mediate cell-cell interactions exclusively in immune function, may play a novel role in neuronal signaling and activity-dependent changes in synaptic connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2118958219,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. Disease alleles contain a trinucleotide repeat expansion of variable length, which encodes polyglutamine tracts near the amino terminus of the HD protein, huntingtin. Polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin, but not normal huntingtin, forms nuclear inclusions. We describe a Drosophila model for HD. Amino-terminal fragments of human huntingtin containing tracts of 2, 75, and 120 glutamine residues were expressed in photoreceptor neurons in the compound eye. As in human neurons, polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induced neuronal degeneration. The age of onset and severity of neuronal degeneration correlated with repeat length, and nuclear localization of huntingtin presaged neuronal degeneration. In contrast to other cell death paradigms in Drosophila, coexpression of the viral antiapoptotic protein, P35, did not rescue the cell death phenotype induced by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin."

https://openalex.org/W1971156703,"Recently, we have identified a novel form of synaptic plasticity that acts to stabilize neocortical firing rates by scaling the quantal amplitude of AMPA-mediated synaptic inputs up or down as a function of neuronal activity. Here, we show that the effects of activity blockade on quantal amplitude are mediated through the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Exogenous BDNF prevented, and a TrkB-IgG fusion protein reproduced, the effects of activity blockade on pyramidal quantal amplitude. BDNF had opposite effects on pyramidal neuron and interneuron quantal amplitudes and modified the ratio of pyramidal neuron to interneuron firing rates. These data demonstrate a novel role for BDNF in the homeostatic regulation of excitatory synaptic strengths and in the maintenance of the balance of cortical excitation and inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2048932608,"We report the cloning of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor–binding protein (ABP), a postsynaptic density (PSD) protein related to glutamate receptor–interacting protein (GRIP) with two sets of three PDZ domains, which binds the GluR2/3 AMPA receptor subunits. ABP exhibits widespread CNS expression and is found at the postsynaptic membrane. We show that the protein interactions of the ABP/GRIP family differ from the PSD-95 family, which binds N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. ABP binds to the GluR2/3 C–terminal VKI-COOH motif via class II hydrophobic PDZ interactions, distinct from the class I PSD-95–NMDA receptor interaction. ABP and GRIP also form homo- and heteromultimers through PDZ–PDZ interactions but do not bind PSD-95. We suggest that the ABP/GRIP and PSD-95 families form distinct scaffolds that anchor, respectively, AMPA and NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2146831587,"Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates long-term potentiation and other forms of neuronal plasticity. Functional differences between the neuronal CaMKIIalpha and CaMKIIbeta isoforms are not yet known. Here, we use green fluorescent protein-tagged (GFP-tagged) CaMKII isoforms and show that CaMKIIbeta is bound to F-actin in dendritic spines and cell cortex while CaMKIIalpha is largely a cytosolic enzyme. When expressed together, the two isoforms form large heterooligomers, and a small fraction of CaMKIIbeta is sufficient to dock the predominant CaMKIIalpha to the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, CaMKIIbeta functions as a targeting module that localizes a much larger number of CaMKIIalpha isozymes to synaptic and cytoskeletal sites of action."

https://openalex.org/W2113401699,"Current understanding suggests that mammalian rod photoreceptors connect only to an ON-type bipolar cell. This rod-specific bipolar cell excites the All amacrine cell, which makes connections to cone-specific bipolar cells of both ON and OFF type; these, in turn, synapse with ganglion cells. Recent work on rabbit retina has shown that rod signals can also reach ganglion cells without passing through the rod bipolar cell. This route was thought to be provided by electrical gap junctions, through which rods signal directly to cones and thence to cone bipolar cells. Here, we show that the mouse retina also provides a rod pathway bypassing the rod bipolar cell, suggesting that this is a common feature in mammals. However, this alternative pathway does not require cone photoreceptors; it is perfectly intact in a transgenic mouse whose retina lacks cones. Instead, the results can be explained if rods connect directly to OFF bipolar cells."
https://openalex.org/W2056806829,"Estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ are members of the family of nuclear hormone receptors and act as ligand-inducible transcriptional factors, which regulate the expression of target genes on binding to cognate response elements. We report here the characterization of steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3), a coactivator of nuclear receptor transcription that is a member of a family of steroid receptor coactivators that includes SRC-1 and transcription intermediate factor-2. SRC-3 enhanced ERα and progesterone receptor-stimulated gene transcription in a ligand-dependent manner, but stimulation of ERβ-mediated transcription was not observed. Protein-protein interaction assays, including real-time interaction analyses with BIAcore, demonstrated that the affinity of the ERα interaction with SRC-3 was much higher than that observed for the ERβ interaction with SRC-3. Mutational analysis suggests a potential interplay between the transactivation function-1 and -2 domains of ERα and SRC-3. Furthermore, an intrinsic transactivation function was observed in the C-terminal half of SRC-3. Finally, SRC-3 was differentially expressed in various tissues and, among several tumor cells examined, was most abundant in the nuclear fraction of MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

Estradiol (E2)1 exerts numerous biological effects in different tissues through an interaction with the estrogen receptor (ER), a member of the steroid/nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar, 2Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analyses, transient transfection studies, and mutational dissections of ER indicate that ER can be subdivided into several functional domains (3Katzenellenbogen J.A. O'Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The N-terminal A/B domain contains a transactivation function, referred to as TAF-1. The DNA binding domain, the C region, contains two zinc fingers and is responsible for DNA recognition. The ligand binding domain (LBD) and a second transactivation function, referred to as TAF-2, is located at the C-terminal of ER. On binding to hormone, the receptor undergoes an activation and transformation step. The activated ER interacts with specific estrogen response elements that are located in the promoter region of estrogen-regulated genes and influences the rate of gene transcription. Over the past decade, numerous studies have provided a basic understanding of both the effects of ligand (agonist and antagonist) on the ER and the relationship between the structure and function of the ER (4Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, little is known regarding the mechanisms involved in the gene-specific and tissue-selective effects mediated by either estrogens or antiestrogens. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms by which ligand-activated ER influences the basal transcriptional machinery and regulates target gene transcription are mostly unknown. Recently, a new estrogen receptor, named ERβ, has been isolated from rat prostate and human testis (5Kuiper G.G.J.M. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4239) Google Scholar, 6Mosselman S. Polman J. Dijkema R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain of ERβ is 90% identical to that of ERα. However, the overall homology between the LBD of ERα and ERβ is <60%. Like ERα, ERβ can stimulate transcription from an estrogen response element in a ligand-dependent manner. Currently, the biological significance of the existence of two ER subtypes is not clear. However, the potential functional differences and differential localization between ERα and ERβ (7Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar) may contribute to the selective actions of E2 in different target tissues. The mechanisms by which nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) regulate target gene transcription is currently under intensive investigation. The ligand-activated NRs may promote formation of the preinitiation complex of the basal transcriptional apparatus and facilitate transcription by RNA polymerase II. These effects may be transmitted in part by direct interactions between NRs and basal transcriptional factors (8Schulman I.G. Chakravarti D. Juguilon H. Romo A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

A. 1995; 92: 1535-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, NR-induced transcription of different target genes may be transmitted through indirect interactions, mediated by intermediary transcriptional coactivators. Recently, a number of NR-associated proteins that interact with steroid and thyroid receptors have been reported (for review, see Refs. 13Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 14Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Among these NR-associated proteins, several corepressors have been described that inhibit basal level transcription by interacting with unliganded thyroid hormone receptor and retinoic acid receptor (15Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Yorchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstorm M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 16Chen J.D.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ligand causes the dissociation of these corepressors from the thyroid hormone receptor and retinoic acid receptor. Furthermore, proteins that interact with NRs in a ligand-dependent manner and augment transcription have also been identified (12Blanco J.G. Wang I.-M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Jurutka P.W.

Members of this family have been shown to augment ERα-stimulated gene transcription and, to date, only SRC-1 has been shown to modulate ERβ-mediated gene transcription (27Tremblay G.B. Tremblay A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D. Jenkins N.A. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). To further understand the molecular mechanisms of gene transcription mediated by ERα, a human cDNA library was screened using the yeast two-hybrid assay to identify potential coactivators. One potential coactivator was discovered, which we referred to as SRC-3, that was homologous to SRC-1 and TIF-2, and we now know that it is identical to ACTR/RAC3/AIB1/TRAM-1. Interestingly, SRC-3 enhanced ERα- and progesterone receptor-stimulated gene transcription, but stimulation of ERβ-mediated transcription was not observed. Protein-protein interaction assays, including real-time interaction analyses with BIAcore, demonstrated that the affinity of the ERα interaction with SRC-3 was much higher than that observed for the ERβ interaction with SRC-3. The distinct tissue distribution and intriguing selectivity between ERα and ERβ make SRC-3 a unique member of a family of steroid receptor coactivators. All recombinant DNA and plasmid constructions were performed according to standard procedures, and DNA sequences of plasmid constructs were verified by standard DNA sequencing (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 17β-Estradiol and progesterone were purchased from Sigma. ICI 182,780 was obtained from the Zeneca Pharmaceuticals. Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Charcoal- and DEAE-treated FBS was purchased from HyClone. The BIAcore 2000 system, sensor chips CM 5 (certified), Tween 20, the amine coupling kit containingN-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, and ethanolamine hydrochloride were all obtained from BIAcore Inc. The buffer used for all experiments was 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5. HiTrap Me affinity columns, Superdex 200 (30 × 10), Mono Q, and Fast Desalting columns were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.. ERα was obtained from PanVera Inc. The yeast MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system (CLONTECH) was used according to the supplier's protocol. pAS2-ER contained the LBD of the human estrogen receptor in the GAL4 DNA binding domain expression plasmid pAS2. This bait plasmid was transformed in the presence of 10−7m 17 β-estradiol into yeast CG1945 cells along with a human liver cDNA library constructed in the GAL4 activation domain vector (pACT2). Transformants (1.5 × 106) were plated onto synthetic complete plates lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan, and His+/Leu+/Trp+clones were recovered and assayed for β-galactosidase activity using filter assays. Plasmids of these positive clones were isolated from yeast. Full-length cDNA was obtained by screening a human lymphoma cDNA library (CLONTECH). Poly(A)+ mRNAs (5 μg) of various human tissues (CLONTECH) were separated in a formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Corp.). Prehybridization was carried out for 4 h in 50% formamide, 5 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% glycine, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C. Hybridization was conducted overnight under the same conditions with 2 × 106 cpm/ml denatured probe (0.8-kbp fragment of SRC-3). The membrane was washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min and exposed to X-OMAT AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) overnight at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Human cancer cells lines used in this study, including MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, A549 human lung cancer cells, HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells, and Ishikawa endometrial adenocarcinoma cells, were grown in 150-mm cell culture plates with DMEM, 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). When cells reached confluence, nuclear extract and cytosolic proteins were prepared as described previously (29Suen C.-S. Chin W.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1719-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For Western blots, 100 μg of nuclear and cytosolic proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, Ponceau S staining was performed to ensure equal loading of each sample. SRC-3 protein was detected using a rabbit antipeptide antibody specific to an internal 15-amino acid sequence (912–926, CQTPSSGDWGLPNSK) that shows minimal sequence similarity to both SRC-1 and TIF-2. The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody. The immunoreactive SRC-3 was visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham) following the procedures recommended by the supplier. The full-length cDNA encoding hERβ was cloned into a pET-28 (Novogen) expression vector using HindIII and XhoI restriction sites. This plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS. The transformants were grown to 0.6 OD units at 37 °C. After induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cells were grown for 3 h and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in four volumes of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme) and sonicated three times for 30 s on ice. After a 10-min incubation on ice, sodium deoxycholate was added to 0.05%. The mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 15 min, and crude cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 50,000 × g. Receptor-containing supernatant was loaded on a HiTrap Ni2+ affinity column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 500 mmNaCl, 50 mm imidazole. Receptor was eluted with two column volumes of a linear gradient of imidazole 50–500 mm in the same buffer. ERβ-containing fractions were pooled and loaded on a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.005% Nonidet P-40. Fractions containing ERβ were pooled and loaded onto a Mono Q column, and bound proteins were eluted with 50–500 mm NaCl gradient of the same buffer. Fractions containing receptor, eluting between 350 and 450 mm, were pooled and applied onto a Fast Desalting column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Nonidet P-40. The resulting fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, and binding of [3H]estradiol and the purity of the receptor were ∼80%. Yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays (CLONTECH) and surface plasmon resonance methods were used to examine protein-protein interactions. For yeast two-hybrid protein-protein interaction assays, both the N-terminal (TAF-1) and the ligand binding domain (TAF-2) of hERα were ligated into the pAS2 vector, and clone 31, the original clone identified in yeast that contains amino acids 620–1423 of SRC-3, was subcloned into the pACT2 plasmid. After cotransformation of plasmids into yeast strain CG1945, colonies were selected on SD/-His/-Trp/-Leu plates. For mammalian two-hybrid assays, the LBDs of hERα and hERβ were ligated into the pM vector (ERα/pM and ERβ/PM), and clone 31 was ligated into the pVP16 vector (31/VP16). The reporter plasmid expressing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was under control of the GAL4 response element (pG5CAT). Human lung A549 cells were routinely maintained in minimal essential medium containing 5% FBS. Cells were seeded into six-well plates (Falcon), and plasmids were transiently introduced by using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method protocol (Promega). Transfections were done in the presence or absence of 17β-estradiol (10 nm) using plasmid pSVGal (0.25 μg) as an internal control, reporter plasmid pG5CAT (2 μg), ER/pM (0.8 μg), 31/VP16 (0.8 μg), and pGEM-4Z as a carrier DNA (Promega). In preliminary experiments, increasing amounts of pcDNA vector containing ERα provided increasing estrogen-induced luciferase activity without changing the levels of the β-galactosidase activity in the co-transfection, thus demonstrating that the amount of pcDNA vector did not significantly alter the expression of the control plasmid. After 48 h, cells were harvested, and extracts were assayed for CAT activity. To study the interactions of clone 31 with either ERα or ERβ in real time, surface plasmon resonance analysis using a BIAcore 2000 system was used as described previously (30Cheskis B.J. Karathanasis S. Lyttle C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11384-11391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, clone 31 was expressed in the prokaryotic expression system pFLAGMAC (Kodak). To immobilize SRC-3, the surface of a CM 5 sensor chip (certified) was first modified with streptavidin according to instructions from the manufacturer. A surface with 1200 resonance units of streptavidin was obtained by injecting 50 μl of streptavidin at 10 μg/ml. Thirty μl of biotinylated anti-FLAG-antibody at a concentration 0.5 mg/ml were then injected, resulting in 547 resonance units being captured. Finally, the surface with immobilized coactivator was obtained by injection of 50 μl of E. coli extract containing FLAG-SRC-3 (5 mg/ml). 347 resonance units of SRC-3 were immobilized. After each injection of ER, the surface with immobilized coactivator was regenerated with one 10-ml injection of 0.05% SDS solution in 0.005% Nonidet P-40. One cycle of regeneration was sufficient to remove bound protein. Each binding cycle was performed with a constant flow (10 ml/min) of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5. Samples of ER were injected across the surface via a sample loop. Once the injection plug had passed the surface, the formed complexes were washed with the buffer for an additional 500–1000 s. All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Data were collected at 1 Hz and analyzed on a Compaq PC using the Clamp 3 program obtained from Dr. David Mishka (University of Utah). This program uses a “global fitting” analysis method for the determination of rate binding constants for macromolecular interactions. The best description for experimental data was obtained with a model describing monomolecular interactions with surface heterogeneity. CHO cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 tissue culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). To measure the coactivator activity of SRC-3, CHO cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in six-well plates in phenol red-free DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5% charcoal- and dextran-treated FBS. Using the calcium phosphate/DNA precipitation method, cells were transfected with 0.05 μg of receptor expression vector, 2 μg of reporter plasmid, and 0–3 μg of SRC-3 expression vectors. Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase served as an internal control, and pGEM4Z plasmid was used as a carrier DNA. After 4 h, cells were treated with 10% glycerol and incubated in the presence or absence of 10 nm E2 and/or 1 μm antiestrogen ICI 182,780 in phenol-red free medium for 20 h, unless otherwise stated. Luciferase assays were performed according to the supplier's protocol (Promega), and light emission was detected using a microlumat LB96P luminometer (Wallac Inc). The yeast two-hybrid assay using the LBD of human ERα was used to identify a clone, clone 31, that interacted only in the presence of ligand. A full-length cDNA was isolated, and the sequence revealed a long open reading frame of 4269 bp encoding a putative protein of 1423 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of ∼155 kDa. This protein, referred to as SRC-3, had significant homology (30–40%) to SRC-1 and TIF-2 (18Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W.

A Northern analysis using 5 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA from various human tissues was performed to determine the size of the message and the tissue distribution of SRC-3. A major mRNA transcript with an approximate size of 8.5–9.0 kb was detected (Fig. 1 A). The transcript was abundant in uterus, mammary gland, pituitary, testis, heart, and skeletal muscle, it was relatively low in bone marrow, and it was barely detectable in liver, lung, brain, kidney, stomach, and adrenal gland (Fig. 1 A; data not shown) indicating that SRC-3 is differentially expressed among tissues. Also, a minor species (∼5.5 kb) was found in testis and skeletal muscle, suggesting a potential alternative splicing variant of SRC-3. Finally, the transcript of SRC-3 was expressed abundantly in Burkitt's lymphoma cells, colorectal SW480 cells (Fig. 1 B), and MCF-7 breast cancer cells (data not shown). Antipeptide antibodies were generated and used to examine the expression of SRC-3 protein. A single band with a molecular weight of ∼160 kDa was detected predominantly in the nuclear fraction of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, suggesting SRC-3 is present in the nucleus (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from several human cancer cell lines clearly showed that SRC-3 was highly expressed and most abundant in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1 D). In yeast, clone 31, containing the last 803 amino acids of SRC-3, interacted with the LBD (TAF-2) but not the N terminus (TAF-1) of hERα (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, this interaction was dependent on the presence of ligand (Fig. 2 A). To test whether this interaction between the hERα and clone 31 occurs in mammalian cells, a mammalian two-hybrid protein-protein interaction assay was conducted. In the absence of clone 31 (31/VP16), E2 (10 nm) stimulated CAT activity ∼8-fold when cells were transfected with the LBD of ERα (ERα/PM), consistent with the presence of a known transcription activation function (TAF-2) in this region (Fig. 2 B). However, in the presence of clone 31, E2-stimulated CAT activity was increased by an additional 10–15-fold. Furthermore, the interaction between clone 31 and hERα was dependent on the presence of E2, and antiestrogen ICI 182,780 inhibited this interaction. Recently, a second estrogen receptor, ERβ, has been cloned, and the homology between the LBD of the ERα and ERβ is ∼55%. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether clone 31 can also interact with the LBD of ERβ. Like ERα, CAT activity was stimulated by E2 when cells were transfected with the LBD of ERβ (ERβ/pM), suggesting the presence of a transcription activation function within the LBD of ERβ. Nevertheless, in the presence of clone 31, E2-stimulated CAT activity was only marginally enhanced (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that the affinity of the interaction of clone 31 with ERα was higher than that with ERβ. To evaluate further the interaction between clone 31 and ERs, surface plasmon resonance analyses, which effectively monitor interactions between macromolecules in real time, were conducted. One of the interacting components, clone 31, was immobilized on the surface of a sensor chip, whereas the other, either ERα or ERβ, was injected by constant flow. A surface with 347 resonance units of the immobilized clone 31 was titrated with increasing amounts of purified ERα or ERβ and saturable interactions were detected for both proteins (data not shown). Two overlaid injections of equal concentrations of each receptor in the presence of 1 μm E2 are presented (Fig. 2 D). “On” and “off” rates as well as the equilibrium dissociation constant of the protein-protein interactions were obtained using global fitting analysis. The affinity of clone 31 interaction with ERα is significantly higher than the affinity of interaction with ERβ. The apparent K Dwas 1.02 nm for the interaction between SRC-3 and ERα and 768 nm for the interaction with ERβ. Furthermore, the effect of ligand on the interaction of clone 31 with ERα was also determined. ERα was incubated overnight with E2 (1 μm) or ICI 182,780 (1 μm) before it was injected over the surface with immobilized clone 31. Overlaid injections of ERα liganded with either E2 or ICI 182,780 and unliganded ERα are presented (Fig. 2 E). Analysis indicated that E2 promotes and ICI 182,780 inhibits clone 31 interaction with ERα. The transcriptional activity of ERα in the presence or absence of SRC-3 was assessed to determine whether SRC-3 is indeed a transcriptional coactivator that enhances E2-stimulated gene transcription. In the absence of SRC-3, E2 stimulated ERα-mediated reporter gene transcription ∼4–5-fold over that of the control (Fig. 3 A and B). However, the E2-stimulated transcriptional activity was enhanced up to 22-fold in the presence of increasing amounts of SRC-3, and antiestrogen ICI 182,780 completely blocked this transcriptional activation. Furthermore, in the absence of E2, SRC-3 did not affect basal level transcription of ERα under the assay conditions used (data not shown). The protein-protein interaction assay described above demonstrated a preferential interaction of clone 31 with the LBD of ERα over ERβ (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, we investigated whether ERβ-stimulated reporter gene transcription could also be augmented by SRC-3. As in the case of hERα, E2 stimulated ERβ-mediated reporter gene transcription (Fig. 3 C). However, this ERβ-stimulated transcriptional activity was not augmented with increasing amounts of SRC-3 (Fig. 3 C). In some experiments, a slight augmentation was observed, but never >2-fold. A radioligand binding assay indicated that similar amounts of ERα and ERβ were expressed in the assay, a result consistent with the similar amounts of transcriptional activity observed in the absence of SRC-3 (data not shown). This preferential stimulation of ERα activity by SRC-3 is consistent with our previous finding that clone 31, a C-terminal derivative of SRC-3, interacted preferentially with the LBD of the ERα. To further characterize this potential receptor selectivity of SRC-3, the activity of progesterone receptor (PR)-mediated gene transcription was analyzed. Progesterone stimulated PR-mediated gene transcription ∼20-fold over the basal level transcription (Fig. 3 D). As in the case of ERα, the transcriptional acti"

https://openalex.org/W2002173877,"Glutamatergic transmission at mossy fiber (MF) synapses on CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus is mediated by AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors and undergoes presynaptic modulation by metabotropic glutamate receptors. The recruitment of different receptors has thus far been studied by altering presynaptic stimulation to modulate glutamate release and interfering pharmacologically with receptors and transporters. Here, we introduce two novel experimental manipulations that alter the fate of glutamate molecules following release. First, an enzymatic glutamate scavenger reduces the postsynaptic response as well as presynaptic modulation by metabotropic receptors. At physiological temperature, however, the scavenger is effective only when glutamate uptake is blocked, revealing a role of active transport in both synaptic and extrasynaptic communication. Second, AMPA and kainate receptor–mediated postsynaptic signals are enhanced when extracellular diffusion is retarded by adding dextran to the perfusion solution, as is feedback modulation by metabotropic receptors, suggesting that the receptors are not saturated under baseline conditions. These results show that manipulating the spatiotemporal profile of glutamate following exocytosis can alter the involvement of different receptors in synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2129132772,"Voltage-activated K+ channels are integral membrane proteins containing a potassium-selective transmembrane pore gated by changes in the membrane potential. This activation gating (opening) occurs in milliseconds and involves a gate at the cytoplasmic side of the pore. We found that substituting cysteine at a particular position in the last transmembrane region (S6) of the homotetrameric Shaker K+ channel creates metal binding sites at which Cd2+ ions can bind with high affinity. The bound Cd2+ ions form a bridge between the introduced cysteine in one channel subunit and a native histidine in another subunit, and the bridge traps the gate in the open state. These results suggest that gating involves a rearrangement of the intersubunit contacts at the intracellular end of S6. The recently solved structure of a bacterial K+ channel shows that the S6 homologs cross in a bundle, leaving an aperture at the bundle crossing. In the context of this structure, the metal ions form a bridge between a cysteine above the bundle crossing and a histidine below the bundle crossing in a neighboring subunit. Our results suggest that gating occurs at the bundle crossing, possibly through a change in the conformation of the bundle itself."

https://openalex.org/W1990656070,"Acute desensitization of olfactory signaling is a critical property of the olfactory system that allows animals to detect and respond to odorants. Correspondingly, an important feature of odorant-stimulated cAMP increases is their transient nature, a phenomenon that may be attributable to the unique regulatory properties of the olfactory adenylyl cyclase (AC3). AC3 is stimulated by receptor activation and inhibited by Ca2+ through Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation at Ser-1076. Since odorant-stimulated cAMP increases are accompanied by elevated intracellular Ca2+, CaMKII inhibition of AC3 may contribute to termination of olfactory signaling. To test this hypothesis, we generated a polyclonal antibody specific for AC3 phosphorylated at Ser-1076. A brief exposure of mouse olfactory cilia or primary olfactory neurons to odorants stimulated phosphorylation of AC3 at Ser-1076. This phosphorylation was blocked by inhibitors of CaMKII, which also ablated cAMP decreases associated with odorant-stimulated cAMP transients. These data define a novel mechanism for termination of olfactory signaling that may be important in olfactory responses."

For a variety of these transcription factors the ability to physically recruit auxiliary proteins, denoted corepressors, is crucial for the ability to silence gene expression. We and others have previously implicated the SMRT corepressor in the actions of the PLZF transcription factor and in the function of its oncogenic derivative, PLZF-retinoic acid receptor (RARα), in promyelocytic leukemia. We report here that PLZF, and a structurally similar transcriptional repressor, BCL-6, can interact with a variety of corepressor proteins in addition to SMRT, including the mSin3A protein and (for PLZF) histone deacetylase-1. Unexpectedly, these additional interactions with corepressor components are nonequivalent for these otherwise similar oncoproteins, suggesting that transcriptional repression by BCL-6 and by PLZF may differ in mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the oncogenic PLZF-RARα chimera lacks several important corepressor interaction sites that are present in the native PLZF protein. Thus the t(11;17) translocation that creates the PLZF-RARα chimera generates an oncoprotein with potentially novel regulatory properties distinct from those of either parental protein. Our results demonstrate that otherwise similar transcription factors can differ notably in their interactions with the corepressor machinery.

Notably, it appears that not all of these potential corepressor polypeptides necessarily assemble in the cell into a single corepressor complex. The retinoblastoma protein, for example, appears to recruit HDAC without a detectable co-association with mSin3 (9Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Therefore, different forms of corepressor complex, each with a distinct polypeptide composition, may be utilized by different transcription factors. Once recruited to the DNA, the corepressor assemblage mediates gene silencing by multiple mechanisms that may include covalent modification of the chromatin template by the HDAC component (reviewed in Refs. 36Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar and 37Wolffe A.P.

The specific set of these corepressor components recruited by a given transcription factor is therefore likely to determine the actual mechanism of gene silencing and to influence the nature of the final transcriptional outcome.The interactions between corepressor complex and the PLZF and BCL-6 proteins are of particular interest. Both PLZF and BCL-6 were initially identified as human oncogenes activated by chromosomal translocations (42Chen Z. Brand A.J. Chen A. Chen S.J. Tong J.H. Wang Z.Y. Waxman S. Zelent A.

PLZF is associated with t(11;17) translocations found in acute promyelocytic leukemias; these translocations result in synthesis of a novel chimeric protein bearing the N-terminal regions of PLZF linked to the central and C-terminal portions of a retinoic acid receptor (RARα) (Fig. 1 A) (42Chen Z.

In contrast, BCL-6 is associated with translocations found in human large cell and follicular lymphomas; these latter translocations result in overexpression of an otherwise structurally unaltered BCL-6 protein (4Chang C.C.

Both the native PLZF and BCL-6 polypeptides are composed of an N-terminal “POZ” motif linked to a more C-terminal cluster of reiterated C2-H2 “zinc-fingers” (Fig. 1 A), and both proteins are able to function as transcriptional repressors (4Chang C.C.

Consistent with these concepts, both BCL-6 and PLZF interact with the SMRT corepressor complex, at least in part through interactions mediated by the POZ domains (7Hong S.-H. David G. Wong C.-W.

Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). This prior work, however, did not fully establish the precise network of interactions between these POZ domain proteins and the different corepressor components, and did not directly examine potential differences in the interactions of the individual PLZF, BCL-6, and PLZF-RARα polypeptides with the corepressor complex.We wished to better understand the interactions between these POZ domain-containing proteins and the different components of the SMRT corepressor complex. We report here that PLZF and BCL-6 interact not only with SMRT, but also with additional components of the corepressor complex, and that domains outside of the POZ motif contribute substantially to these corepressor interactions. Unexpectedly, these additional interactions with the corepressor complex are nonequivalent for these otherwise similar oncoproteins, suggesting that transcriptional repression by BCL-6 and by PLZF may differ in mechanism and/or in manifestation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the PLZF-RARα chimera lacks several important corepressor interaction sites that are present in the native PLZF protein. Thus the t(11;17) translocation that creates the PLZF-RARα chimera generates an oncoprotein with potentially novel regulatory properties distinct from those of either parental protein. We conclude that otherwise similar transcription factors can differ notably in their interactions with the corepressor machinery, and that these differences appear to result in distinctive transcriptional properties. The study of eukaryotic gene regulation has focused primarily on the mechanisms of transcriptional activation. However, many transcriptional factors function not as activators, but as repressors, or can operate bimodally by mediating both negative and positive effects on gene transcription. Transcription factors capable of repression of gene expression include the Ying-Yang-1 protein, the Mad·Max complex, nuclear hormone receptors such as those for thyroid hormone and retinoic acid, the retinoblastoma gene product, the BCL-6 protein, and the PLZF polypeptide (1Ayer D.E.

Different transcription factors interact with different corepressor components; nuclear hormone receptors, for example, bind primarily to the SMRT·N-CoR component, whereas Mad·Max binds to the mSin3A/B polypeptide, and Ying-Yang 1 and the retinoblastoma protein appear to preferentially recruit the HDAC subunit (6Yang W.-M.

Notably, it appears that not all of these potential corepressor polypeptides necessarily assemble in the cell into a single corepressor complex. The retinoblastoma protein, for example, appears to recruit HDAC without a detectable co-association with mSin3 (9Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Therefore, different forms of corepressor complex, each with a distinct polypeptide composition, may be utilized by different transcription factors. Once recruited to the DNA, the corepressor assemblage mediates gene silencing by multiple mechanisms that may include covalent modification of the chromatin template by the HDAC component (reviewed in Refs. 36Pazin M.J.

The specific set of these corepressor components recruited by a given transcription factor is therefore likely to determine the actual mechanism of gene silencing and to influence the nature of the final transcriptional outcome. The interactions between corepressor complex and the PLZF and BCL-6 proteins are of particular interest. Both PLZF and BCL-6 were initially identified as human oncogenes activated by chromosomal translocations (42Chen Z. Brand A.J. Chen A. Chen S.J. Tong J.H. Wang Z.Y. Waxman S. Zelent A.

PLZF is associated with t(11;17) translocations found in acute promyelocytic leukemias; these translocations result in synthesis of a novel chimeric protein bearing the N-terminal regions of PLZF linked to the central and C-terminal portions of a retinoic acid receptor (RARα) (Fig. 1 A) (42Chen Z.

In contrast, BCL-6 is associated with translocations found in human large cell and follicular lymphomas; these latter translocations result in overexpression of an otherwise structurally unaltered BCL-6 protein (4Chang C.C.

Both the native PLZF and BCL-6 polypeptides are composed of an N-terminal “POZ” motif linked to a more C-terminal cluster of reiterated C2-H2 “zinc-fingers” (Fig. 1 A), and both proteins are able to function as transcriptional repressors (4Chang C.C.

This prior work, however, did not fully establish the precise network of interactions between these POZ domain proteins and the different corepressor components, and did not directly examine potential differences in the interactions of the individual PLZF, BCL-6, and PLZF-RARα polypeptides with the corepressor complex. We wished to better understand the interactions between these POZ domain-containing proteins and the different components of the SMRT corepressor complex. We report here that PLZF and BCL-6 interact not only with SMRT, but also with additional components of the corepressor complex, and that domains outside of the POZ motif contribute substantially to these corepressor interactions. Unexpectedly, these additional interactions with the corepressor complex are nonequivalent for these otherwise similar oncoproteins, suggesting that transcriptional repression by BCL-6 and by PLZF may differ in mechanism and/or in manifestation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the PLZF-RARα chimera lacks several important corepressor interaction sites that are present in the native PLZF protein. Thus the t(11;17) translocation that creates the PLZF-RARα chimera generates an oncoprotein with potentially novel regulatory properties distinct from those of either parental protein. We conclude that otherwise similar transcription factors can differ notably in their interactions with the corepressor machinery, and that these differences appear to result in distinctive transcriptional properties. We are grateful to Suk-Hyun Hong and to William Gross, who helped pioneer the PLZF-RARα and BCL-6 experiments in our laboratory, and to Valentia Taryanik for providing tireless technical services. We also thank D. Ayer, A. Dejean, R. Eisenman, C. A. Hassig, S. L. Schreiber, and J. Streitman for generously providing molecular clones, and A. Dejean for sharing information prior to publication. After this manuscript was first prepared, a parallel study was published that, by use of both in vitroand in vivo methodologies, demonstrated a similar multiplicity of interactions between PLZF, BCL-6, and the different components of the SMRT-mSin3A-HDAC complex (David, G., Alland, L., Hong, S.-H., Wong, C.-W., DePinho, R.

https://openalex.org/W2067454609,"We have tested whether action potential–evoked Ca2+ influx is required to initiate clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis in the lamprey reticulospinal synapse. Exo- and endocytosis were temporally separated by a procedure involving tonic action potential stimulation and subsequent removal of extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+e). A low concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]e of 11 μM) was found to be required for the induction of early stages of endocytosis. However, the entire endocytic process, from the formation of clathrin-coated membrane invaginations to the generation of synaptic vesicles, proceeded in the absence of action potential-mediated Ca2+ entry. Our results indicate that the membrane of synaptic vesicles newly incorporated in the plasma membrane is a sufficient trigger of clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1994364763,"In the central nervous system, (Na+ + K+)-coupled glutamate transporters restrict the neurotoxicity of this transmitter and limit the duration of synaptic excitation at some synapses. The various isotransporters exhibit a particularly high homology in an extended hydrophobic domain of ill-defined topology that contains several determinants involved in ion and transmitter binding. Here, we describe the determination of the membrane topology of the cloned astroglial glutamate transporter GLT-1. A series of functional transporters containing single cysteines was engineered. Their topological disposition was determined by using a biotinylated sulfhydryl reagent. The glutamate transporter has eight transmembrane domains long enough to span the membrane as et heiices. Strikingly, between the seventh and eighth domains, a structure reminiscent of a pore loop and an outward-facing hydrophobic linker are positioned."

Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Beginning with TFIID, whose TATA box-binding protein subunit recognizes the TATA box present in many promoters, these factors can assemble in an ordered pathway in vitro onto a promoter (2Van Dyke M.W.

There is evidence that transcription by RNAP II in Saccharomyces cerevisiaegenerally depends on such a holoenzyme (10Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and that recruitment of yeast holoenzyme to a promoter would lead to a high rate of transcription (11Barberis A. Pearlberg J. Simkovich N. Farrell S. Reinagel P. Bamdad C. Sigal G. Ptashne M. Cell. 1995; 81: 359-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). During or shortly after initiation by RNAP II, the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of its largest subunit becomes heavily phosphorylated and remains so during transcript elongation (12Payne J.M. Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19621-19629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated form of RNAP II is designated RNAP IIO, whereas the unphosphorylated form is designated RNAP IIA. One subunit of TFIIH is a protein kinase that can phosphorylate the CTD (13Emili A. Ingles C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the CTD by P-TEFb, a different Drosophila CTD kinase, has been shown to enhance the processivity of chain elongation by RNAP II in vitro(14Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Concomitant with or following the termination of transcription, the CTD must be dephosphorylated by a protein phosphatase, since RNAP IIO cannot assemble directly into a preinitiation complex on either the adenovirus-2 major late or murine dihydrofolate reductase promoterin vitro (15Lu H. Flores O. Weinmann R. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10004-10008Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 16Chesnut J.D. Stephens J.H. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

Accordingly, CTD phosphatase may function as a global regulator of gene expression by controlling the pool of RNAP IIA available for initiation. A phosphatase whose activity is stimulated by RAP74 and dephosphorylates the CTD in a processive manner has been purified from HeLa cell extracts (18Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Certain activator proteins increase the efficiency of RNA chain elongation downstream from the promoter. For example, RNAP II pauses with an unphosphorylated CTD about 25–40 nucleotides downstream from the initiation site of Drosophila hsp70 genes and is stimulated by heat shock and the heat shock factor to become phosphorylated and leave these pause sites (Ref. 20O'Brien T. Hardin S. Greenleaf A. Lis J.T. Nature. 1994; 370: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar and references therein). Increasing evidence supports the idea that a fully phosphorylated CTD is essential for processive elongation. Indeed, the ability of an activator to stimulate elongation has correlated with its ability to bind TFIIH (21Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 22Blau J. Xiao H. McCracken S. O'Hare P. Greenblatt J. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As well, the CTD kinase, P-TEFb, is needed for activation of elongation by the HIV-1 transactivator Tat (23Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), and Tat can stimulate phosphorylation of the CTD by TFIIHin vitro (24Parada C.A. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 384: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In concert with CTD kinases that act on RNAP II in an elongation complex, CTD phosphatase may also play a role in the regulation of transcript elongation. TFIIF is a general transcription factor comprised of two subunits, RAP30 and RAP74, and both subunits mediate its interaction with RNAP II (25Sopta M. Carthew R.W. Greenblatt J. J. Biol.

Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4838) Google Scholar) was used to clone human proteins that interact with RAP74. This article describes the molecular cloning and properties of FCP1, an essential subunit of a TFIIF-associating CTDphosphatase. FCP1 also appears to be a component of a human RNAP II holoenzyme complex. Yeast manipulations and growth media were as described previously (35Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). To test the ability of yeast cells to grow on medium containing 3-aminotriazole (AT), 3 μl of a cell suspension (approximately 2000 cells) were applied onto SD medium containing 100 μg/ml adenine and 30 mm AT. As a control, a similar number of cells was also applied onto medium lacking AT but containing 100 μg/ml adenine and histidine. Plasmids expressing either lamin, p53, or SNF1 fused to the GAL4 AD have been described previously (34Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4838) Google Scholar, 36Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). pAD-FCP1a plasmids encoding amino acids 443–842, 579–842, 627–842, and 727–842 were isolated in the original two-hybrid screen. pET23d/RAP74 expressing RAP74 under the control of the T7 promoter was a gift of Z. Burton (Michigan State University) and has been described (37Wang B.Q. Kostrub C.F. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All other plasmids were constructed specifically for this work, and details will be provided upon request. Yeast strain Y153 (36Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar) was cotransformed to tryptophan and leucine prototrophy by introduction of plasmid pAS-RAP74 and of a human lymphocyte cDNA library constructed in plasmid pSE1107 (36Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Yeast were transformed as described (38Scheistl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by plating directly on SD minimal medium supplemented with adenine and 30 mm AT and grown for 7–9 days at 30 °C. Under these conditions, 50 of approximately three million transformants were able to form colonies. Library-derived plasmids were isolated from these 50 transformants, recovered in Escherichia coli, and reintroduced individually into Y153 along with pAS-RAP74 or with other plasmids encoding unrelated GAL4 DBD fusion proteins (lamin, p53, SNF1, p62 subunit of TFIIH; see Fig. 1). Of these 50 plasmids, 13 were able to support yeast growth on medium containing AT in the presence of pAS-RAP74 but not when pAS-RAP74 was substituted for another plasmid encoding an unrelated GAL4 DBD fusion protein. These 13 plasmids that encoded putative TFIIF (RAP74)-interacting proteins were grouped into the following three classes: RAP30, FCP1a, and one other on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the encoded cDNAs. Isolation of the 5′-end of the FCP1 mRNA was performed using a 5′-rapid amplification of mRNA ends (5′-RACE; Ref. 39Frohman M. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar) protocol and a c-RACE protocol (40Maruyama I.N. Rakow T.L. Maruyama H.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3796-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 5′-RACE was performed using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) following procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was synthesized using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from human placenta. The first PCR amplification was performed using oligonucleotides AP1 (provided with the kit) and either FCP1–51 (5′-GCTCAGCACCAGCCGAGTGAGGATCTTCGC-3′) or FCP1–504 (5′-GCTGCCGAAGTGAAGACGTGC-3′). The second PCR amplification was performed with oligonucleotides AP2 (provided with the kit) and FCP1–52 (5′-CCGTGGCGTGGTAATCGTCCCGCGTCTTC-3′) if FCP1–51 was used for the first amplification. If FCP1–504 was used for the first amplification, the second amplification was performed using oligonucleotide AP2 and either FCP1–501 (5′-TCAGCTTGCTCGGAGCTCACC-3′) or FCP1–503 (5′-AGGAAGTCCTTGCAGTGTGGACG-3′). The 5′-end of the FCP1 mRNA was also isolated using a c-RACE protocol essentially as described (40Maruyama I.N. Rakow T.L. Maruyama H.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3796-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, FCP1 cDNA was synthesized with oligonucleotide FCP1–501 and human placental poly(A)+ RNA using either Moloney murine leukemia virus (Life Technologies, Inc.) or SuperScript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) reverse transcriptase. cDNA synthesis with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase was carried out using either 0.5 or 3 mm dNTPs in the reaction. FCP1 cDNA was also synthesized from total CaCO2 RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All four cDNAs were subjected to a first PCR amplification using two FCP1-specific oligonucleotide primers: FCP1-C1 (5′-TGCTTCCCGTTCTTACTCTGC-3′) and FCP1-C2 (5′-CGCTGTCCACGGCGACCG-3′). The secondary PCR amplification was performed using two other FCP1-specific oligonucleotides: FCP1-C3 (5′-AACTGGGTGAGGTCTTGGCC-3′) and FCP1-C4 (5′-ATGGTGCACAGCGTCGCGG-3′. In total, three different 5-RACE conditions and four different c-RACE conditions were used. For each condition, the final PCR product was cloned into the pCR II plasmid (Invitrogen) and sequenced. All seven conditions identified the same 5′-end of the FCP1 mRNA (within 30 base pairs). The complete nucleotide sequence of the 5′-end and the remaining portion of the FCP1 cDNA was determined using a combination of deletions, commercially available primers, and primers designed on the basis of the FCP1 sequence and can be found under GenBankTM accession numberAF081287. A human multiple tissue Northern blot containing approximately 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the indicated tissues (CLONTECH) was probed with a FCP1a probe or a β-actin control probe (supplied by the manufacturer) as recommended by the manufacturer. The FCP1a probe was aBglII fragment from pAD-FCP1a (579–842) encoding amino acids 579–842 of FCP1a and all 3′-untranslated sequences. A plasmid pJA518 that was used to express the carboxyl terminus of FCP1a as a polyhistidine fusion in bacteria was constructed by inserting a 374-base pair StuI-AluI FCP1 fragment into the BamHI site (made blunt) of pRSET-C (Invitrogen). Plasmid pJA518 was introduced into bacterial strain JA328, which was constructed by inserting plasmid pREP4 (Qiagen), which carries the lacI gene of E. coli, into bacterial strain BL21(DE3). Overproduction of lac repressor from pREP4 further reduces the expression of T7 RNAP in BL21(DE3) cells grown under non-inducing conditions. JA328 cells carrying plasmid pJA518 were grown in Luria broth medium at 30 °C to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.5, at which point FCP1a protein synthesis was induced by the addition of 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside to the growth medium, and the cells were grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the FCP1a polyhistidine fusion protein was purified under denaturing conditions by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography on His-Bind resin (Novagen) according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. The purified protein was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and remained completely soluble after dialysis. 40-μl columns containing GST, GST-FCP1a (amino acids 760–842), or GST-RAP74-(436–517) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads at a concentration of 3–4 mg/ml (or as otherwise indicated) were prepared as described previously (41Lin Y.-S. Green M.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 971-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Columns were first equilibrated with 200 μl of ACB buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1 m NaCl and then loaded with either 800 μl of HeLa whole cell extract (at a concentration of 6–8 mg/ml and prepared as described previously (25Sopta M. Carthew R.W. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10353-10360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) that was dialyzed against ACB buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl or with 4 μg of purified recombinant protein mixed with molecular weight markers in a total volume of 120 μl of ACB buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl. After loading, the columns were washed with 400 μl of ACB buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl. The bound proteins were eluted sequentially with 120 μl of ACB buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 120 μl of ACB buffer containing 0.1% SDS. Aliquots of the input proteins and of the NaCl and SDS eluates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting or silver staining. Human RNAP II holoenzyme was purified from HeLa whole cell extract by affinity chromatography on GST-TFIIS and GST-elongin A-(1–123) columns and by Sepharose CL-2B chromatography as described elsewhere (9Pan G. Aso T. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24563-24571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Western blotting was by the enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with antibodies that have been described elsewhere (9Pan G. Aso T. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24563-24571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A portion of the FCP1 open reading frame (amino acids 443–669) was expressed in bacteria as a polyhistidine fusion protein. Plasmid pJA533 that was used to express FCP1 was constructed by inserting a BglII-SmaI fragment from pAD-FCP1a-(443–842) between the BamHI and PvuII sites of pRSET-C (Invitrogen). pJA533 was introduced into bacterial strain JA328 (BL21[DE3] + pREP4). JA328 cells carrying plasmid pJA533 were grown in Luria broth medium at 30 °C to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.5 at which point FCP1 protein synthesis was induced by the addition of 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside to the growth medium, and the cells were grown for a further 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the FCP1 polyhistidine fusion protein was purified under denaturing conditions by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography on His-Bind resin (Novagen) according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. The purified protein was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Two rabbits were each immunized with 1 mg of protein emulsified in complete Freund adjuvant and boosted every 4 weeks with 0.5 mg of protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant until a high serum titer was obtained. Anti-FCP1 antibodies were affinity purified using the antigen as described (42Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 313-315Google Scholar). 500 μl of HeLa cell nuclear transcription extract prepared as described (43Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar) were incubated with 1 μg of affinity purified anti-FCP1 antibodies or control IgG (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 4 °C and then loaded onto 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose columns that had been prewashed with 400 μl of BC100 buffer (Ref. 44Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar; 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 100 mm KCl) containing 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and equilibrated with BC100 buffer before loading. The flow through fractions were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. 32P-Labeled RNAP IIO used as substrate for CTD phosphatase assays was prepared as described by Chesnutet al. (16Chesnut J.D. Stephens J.H. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10500-10506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNAP IIO was purified by the method of Kim and Dahmus (45Kim W.-Y. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18880-18885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CTD phosphatase assays were performed as described previously (18Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CTD phosphatase was purified from HeLa cells as described by Chambers and Dahmus (18Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Following chromatography on HiTrap Q, which was used in place of Resource Q, fractions containing CTD phosphatase activity were pooled and loaded onto a 1.5-ml ceramic hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad). The column was developed with a 15-ml linear gradient of KH2PO4 from 0.012 to 0.6 m. Peak fractions from phenyl-Superose were chromatographed directly on Mono Q. The final step in the purification process was the sedimentation of CTD phosphatase on a glycerol gradient. FCP1 was also purified by a different method involving affinity chromatography on a GST-RAP74-(436–517) column. HeLa whole cell extract (100 ml) (25Sopta M. Carthew R.W. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10353-10360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol was chromatographed on a 90-ml heparin-Sepharose column and eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient to 0.5 m KCl. Pooled fractions containing FCP1 (60 ml) were brought to 0.7 m(NH4)2SO4 and loaded onto a 5-ml phenyl-Sepharose column. This column was washed first with a gradient from 0.7 m to no (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol and then with the same gradient in buffer containing 0.05% CHAPS. The fractions containing FCP1 eluted from the phenyl-Sepharose column at the end of the second gradient and were pooled (9.8 ml) and concentrated with a Centricon concentrator to 0.9 ml. This fraction was passed successively through two 100-μl columns containing first 1 mg/ml GST and then 1 mg/ml GST-RAP74-(436–517). The columns were washed with 1 ml of affinity chromatography buffer (ACB) containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.05% CHAPS and eluted with 50-μl aliquots of ACB containing 0.05% CHAPS and 0.5 mNaCl. Fractions containing FCP1 were pooled (100 μl). The yeast two-hybrid system (34Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4838) Google Scholar, 36Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar) was used to identify cDNAs in a human peripheral lymphocyte library that encodes proteins that interact with RAP74. Of approximately 3 million yeast transformants, 13 cDNAs were identified that could interact specifically with a fusion protein containing the entire RAP74 open reading frame fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD; amino acids 1–147) and not with several other unrelated GAL4 DBD fusion proteins (Fig. 1 a). In this assay, the protein-protein interaction was detected by the activation of aHIS3 reporter gene under the control of upstream activating sequenceGal. Increased expression of HIS3 renders yeast cells resistant to the histidine analog 3-aminotriazole (AT). Among the 13 cDNAs encoding RAP74-interacting proteins, one class comprised cDNAs encoding RAP30 (eight isolates), the small subunit of TFIIF, and one isolate was a novel, uncharacterized cDNA. The remaining four isolates contained various portions of a novel cDNA termed FCP1a (FCP: TFIIF-associating CTDphosphatase). Seven additional FCP1a cDNA clones were obtained by screening two different cDNA libraries from CaCO2 cells (a colon carcinoma cell line) and fetal brain tissue. Oligonucleotide primers were then designed and used to isolate the 5′-end of the FCP1a cDNA using either a 5′-rapid amplification of mRNA ends (5′-RACE) (39Frohman M. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar) or a c-RACE protocol (40Maruyama I.N. Rakow T.L. Maruyama H.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3796-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both protocols identified the same 5′-end of this FCP1a cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence of FCP1a (842 amino acids) is presented in Fig. 1 c. Northern blot analysis under high stringency conditions (Fig. 1 b, upper panel) revealed an mRNA of approximately 3.6 kilobase pairs in all human tissues that were examined (heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas). When comparison was made to the amounts of β-actin mRNA in these samples (Fig. 1 b, lower panel), results indicated that the amounts of FCP1 mRNA are of the same order of magnitude in all tissues. Other less abundant mRNAs were also visible, and under low stringency hybridization conditions, additional mRNAs of various sizes also hybridized to the FCP1 probe, suggesting that FCP1 may belong to a family of proteins (data not shown). Several FCP1 cDNAs cloned from fetal brain and CaCO2 libraries contained a 163-base pair deletion and encoded a deleted form of FCP1 (FCP1b) that lacks the last 139 amino acids of FCP1a and would, therefore, be unable to interact as strongly with RAP74 (see below). This form of FCP1 would terminate with a unique 62-amino acid sequence read in a different frame and would be comprised of 765 amino acids (see Fig. 1 c). It is probable that the FCP1a and FCP1b mRNAs are produced by the use of alternate splice acceptor sites. The following experiments tested whether FCP1 is related to a previously reported, RAP74-stimulated CTD phosphatase (18Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Fig. 2,a and b, shows that FCP1 immunoreactivity co-purifies precisely with CTD phosphatase activity on phenyl-Superose and Mono Q, two columns that are final steps in the purification of CTD phosphatase (18Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility of this immunoreactive band corresponded to the 150-kDa polypeptide shown previously to co-chromatograph with CTD phosphatase activity (18Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate for the phosphatase assay was 32P-labeled RNAP IIO in which the most carboxyl-terminal serine of the largest RNAP II subunit, IIo, was tagged with 32P. The terminal serine lies outside the consensus CTD repeat and can be selectively phosphorylated with casein kinase II. Dephosphorylation of the CTD by CTD phosphatase results in the removal of unlabeled phosphate within the consensus repeat and an increase in electrophoretic mobility corresponding to that of the unphosphorylated IIa subunit (compare the first two lanes in Fig. 2, a and b). CTD phosphatase was also purified nearly to homogeneity by heparin-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography followed by affinity chromatography on a GST-RAP74-(436–527) column. This preparation contained a major 150-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 3 a, lane 2) that did not bind to a GST control column (lane 1) and trace amounts of other lower molecular weight polypeptides (lane 3). The 150-kDa polypeptide reacted in an immunoblot with affinity purified antibody raised against amino acids 443–669 of recombinant FCP1 (Fig. 3 b, lane 2). This highly purified material also contained CTD phosphatase activity (Fig. 3 d, lanes 10–14). Both affinity purified CTD phosphatase and CTD phosphatase purified by conventional chromatography (Fig. 2, a and b) were strongly stimulated by RAP74 (compare lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 11 and 12 in Fig. 3 d) and had approximately the same specific activities relative to their contents of FCP1. The assay shown in lane 14 contained only phosphorylated RNA polymerase II and affinity purified CTD phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W2105023838,"The synaptic localization of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type glutamate receptor (GluR) channel is a prerequisite for synaptic plasticity in the brain. We generated mutant mice carrying the carboxy-terminal truncated GluRε2 subunit of the NMDA receptor channel. The mutant mice died neonatally and failed to form barrelette structures in the brainstem. The mutation greatly decreased the NMDA receptor–mediated component of hippocampal excitatory postsynaptic potentials and punctate immunofluorescent labelings of GluRε2 protein in the neuropil regions, while GluRε2 protein expression was comparable. Immunostaining of cultured cerebral neurons showed the reduced punctate staining of the truncated GluRε2 protein at synapses. These results suggest that the carboxy-terminal region of the GluRε2 subunit is important for efficient clustering and synaptic localization of the NMDA receptor channel."
https://openalex.org/W2026987815,"We report the cloning and expression of the fifth member of the mammalian UDP-GalNAc:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (ppGaNTase) family. Degenerate polymerase chain reaction amplification and hybridization screening of a rat sublingual gland (RSLG) cDNA library were used to identify a novel isoform termed ppGaNTase-T5. Conceptual translation of the cDNA reveals a uniquely long stem region not observed for other members of this enzyme family. Recombinant proteins expressed transiently in COS7 cells displayed transferase activity in vitro. Relative activity and substrate preferences of ppGaNTase-T5 were compared with previously identified isoforms (ppGaNTase-T1, -T3, and -T4); ppGaNTase-T5 and -T4 glycosylated a restricted subset of peptides whereas ppGaNTase-T1 and -T3 glycosylated a broader range of substrates. Northern blot analysis revealed that ppGaNTase-T5 is expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner; abundant expression was seen in the RSLG, with lesser amounts of message in the stomach, small intestine, and colon. Therefore, the pattern of expression of ppGaNTase-T5 is the most restricted of all isoforms examined thus far. The identification of this novel isoform underscores the diversity and complexity of the family of genes controllingO-linked glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1530872731,"Subclinical lead toxicity, defined as a blood lead level of 10 micrograms per deciliter or higher, is estimated to affect 1 in every 20 children in the United States. The results of numerous studies argue that efforts to prevent neurocognitive impairment associated with lead exposure should emphasize primary prevention--the elimination of residential lead hazards before a child is unduly exposed. These data contrast, paradoxically, with current practices and policies that rely almost exclusively on secondary prevention efforts--attempts to reduce a child9s exposure to residential lead hazards only after a child has been unduly exposed. There is also a paucity of data demonstrating the safety or benefits of lead hazard controls for children with blood lead levels below 25 mg/dl. Despite a strong federal commitment to children9s health, it is unlikely that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency9s final residential lead standards will adequately protect urban children from undue lead exposure. The author argues it is time to establish a scientifically based strategy to eliminate subclinical lead toxicity resulting from residential lead hazards."

Thus, we investigated the effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on glutamate release from cortical neurons. Treatment of cultured cortical neurons with BDNF induced rapid and transient release of glutamate. This effect was suggested to be mediated by TrkB activation because K252a inhibited the release of glutamate and BDNF phosphorylated TrkB within 30 s. BDNF-induced glutamate release was observed even when using Ca2+-free assay buffer but was inhibited by BAPTA-AM, a cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator. Therefore, BDNF-induced glutamate release was independent of extracelluar Ca2+ but dependent on intracellular Ca2+. Because normal neurotransmitter release is exocytotic, the involvement of the exocytotic pathway in BDNF-induced glutamate release was examined. As botulinum toxin is known to cleave exocytosis-associated proteins, thereby inhibiting exocytosis, it was applied to neurons prior to the release assay. Although botulinum toxin B cleaved VAMP2 and inhibited Ca2+-triggered glutamate release, it did not inhibit the BDNF-induced release of glutamate.

Neurotrophins are the best characterized neurotrophic factors promoting differentiation, maturation, and survival of various types of neurons in both central and peripheral nervous systems (1Davies A.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1334-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 2Lewin G.R. Barde Y.-A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). In addition to their roles in the long term developmental processes, there is increasing interest in the involvement of neurotrophins in neural transmission and synaptic plasticity (3Thoenen H. Science. 1995; 270: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar, 4Lo D.C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 979-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 5Berninger B. Poo M.-M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Katz L.C. Schatz C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that neurotrophins themselves are secreted in response to depolarizing stimuli such as high K+ or glutamate, as well as constitutive secretion (7Blochl A. Thoenen H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1220-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Heymach Jr., J.V. Kruttgen A. Suter U. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25430-25437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These findings strongly support the hypothesis that neurotrophins are involved in activity-dependent neural plasticity. In culturedXenopus neuromuscular synapses, BDNF1 and neurotrophin-3 elevated the frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents and enhanced the amplitude of evoked synaptic currents within 10 min (9Lohof A.M. Ip N.Y. Poo M.-M. Nature. 1993; 363: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Similar phenomena were observed for the effects of BDNF and neurotrophin-4 on the synapses in hippocampal culture. BDNF and neurotrophin-4 rapidly increased both the frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents and the amplitude of evoked synaptic currents (10Lessmann V. Gottmann K. Heumann R. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nerve growth factor and BDNF have been reported to augment the evoked release of acetylcholine and glutamate from hippocampal synaptosomes (11Knipper M. Leung L.S. Zhao D. Rylett R.J. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 2433-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These reports indicated an effect of neurotrophins on neurotransmitter release. In addition to these results, neurotrophins induced long lasting potentiation of neurotransmission (12Kang H. Schuman E.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar) or enhanced long term potentiation (13Figurov A. Pozzo-Miller L.D. Olafsson P. Wang T. Lu B. Nature. 1996; 381: 706-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) in hippocampal slices. Although several electrophysiological studies have been performed, the molecular basis of the presynaptic modulation of neurotransmitter release by neurotrophins is still unknown. The first step of neural transmission is regulated, stimulation-induced release of neurotransmitters. Thus, we tested the effects of BDNF on glutamate release through the activation of TrkB from cultured cortical neurons by measuring levels of the transmitter itself. In addition, we also analyzed the mechanisms of the release using botulinum toxin. Here, we demonstrated that BDNF induced glutamate release by a pathway independent of exocytosis. BDNF was a kind gift from Regeneron Pharmaceutical Co. Anti-TrkB monoclonal antibody was kindly supplied by Dr. S. Koizumi (Novartis Pharma K. K.). Anti-VAMP2 antibody was prepared as described previously (14Oho C. Seino S. Takahashi M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 186: 208-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from Transduction Lab. The method of primary culture of cortical neurons was essentially as described previously (15Takei N. Endo Y. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral cortices were removed from 17-day-old embryonic rat fetuses and dissociated using trypsin/DNase I. Neurons were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/cm2 in culture dishes and cultivated in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Medium was changed every 3 or 4 days. After 7–10 days, cells were used for release assay and collected for immunoprecipitation or Western blot analysis. Glutamate release from cultured neurons was determined essentially as described previously (16Takei N. Sasaoka K. Inoue K. Takahashi M. Endo Y. Hatanaka H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were washed seven times with assay buffer and Ringer's solution containing 130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 5.5 mm glucose. High K+ solution contained 50 mm KCl, and Ca2+-free solution contained no CaCl2. The assay buffer was changed every 1 min, collected into tubes on ice, and filtrated to remove cell debris. To make derivatives of amino acids detectable by fluorescence monitoring, samples were mixed witho-phthalaldehyde (4:1) and allowed to stand for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were then applied to high pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed using a fluorescence monitor (excitation 340 nm, emission 445 nm). For TrkB immunoprecipitation, cells were washed three times with 1 mm NaVO4containing TN buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (TN buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmsodium orthovanadate), and incubated at 4 °C on a mixing plate for 3 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with protein G-anti-TrkB antibody conjugate and incubated for 4–5 h at 4 °C on a mixing plate. The conjugate was prepared for incubation in radioimmune precipitation buffer for 3 h and washed 5 times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. The protein G-anti-TrkB-antigen complex was washed 5 times with radioimmune precipitation buffer and finally SDS sample buffer. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described previously (16Takei N. Sasaoka K. Inoue K. Takahashi M. Endo Y. Hatanaka H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cells were collected and sonicated in TN buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and protein concentration was determined. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were exposed to the first antibody (anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-VAMP2), washed, and then exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Cappel, 1:2000). Peroxidase activity was visualized on x-ray film after reaction with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Treatment of primary cultured cortical neurons with BDNF for 1 min induced a rapid and transient increase in glutamate release (Fig. 1 A). This was similar to the high K+-evoked release of glutamate (Fig. 1 B), except that the amount and rate of release in response to BDNF were both less than those induced by high K+. BDNF-induced glutamate release occurred slightly more slowly than that induced by high K+. To determine whether neurons or astrocytes released glutamate in response to BDNF, we examined the glutamate release from pure astrocyte cultures. Although astrocytes spontaneously released a considerable amount of glutamate, BDNF did not increase the release (Fig. 1 C). We also confirmed that glutamatergic neurons in the cultured cortical cells expressed TrkB using a double staining technique. 2N. Takei, T. Numakawa, and H. Hatanaka, unpublished observation. These results, combined with the observation that astrocytes do not express full-length TrkB, indicated that BDNF acts on glutamatergic neurons directly and triggers glutamate release. BDNF induced glutamate release in a dose-dependent manner. Fig. 2 represents the ratio of BDNF-induced glutamate release. The effect was observed at a dose of 10 ng/ml and was saturated at 100 ng/ml. The involvement of TrkB activation in this rapid and transient response was also examined. As shown in Fig. 3 A, pretreatment with K252a completely blocked the BDNF-induced release of glutamate but did not have any effect on the basal release. Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkB, i.e. activation of the receptor, was observed within 30 s in response to BDNF (Fig. 3 B). This effect was blocked by K252a (Fig. 3 B) under conditions identical to those used in the release assay. In contrast to BDNF, nerve growth factor had no effect on glutamate release from cortical neurons (Fig. 3 C). This was expected because of the absence or low level of expression of TrkA in the cortex. Thus, the involvement of p75 was also excluded. Taken together, these results indicated that BDNF induces the release of glutamate through activation of TrkB but not p75. Next, Ca2+ dependence was investigated. In Ca2+-free Ringer's solution, BDNF still induced glutamate release in a similar manner to that under normal conditions in the presence of 1.8 mmCa2+ (Fig. 4). The same result was obtained when EGTA was added to the Ringer's solution (data not shown). Although the amount of glutamate released was decreased under both basal conditions and in BDNF-treated cells, the ratio of basal to induced release was unchanged. This decrease may have been because of calcium-dependent spontaneous exocytosis. In contrast, the cell membrane-permeable calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, completely blocked BDNF-induced release. These results indicated that BDNF-induced glutamate release is independent of the extracellular calcium level but is dependent on the intracellular calcium level. We examined whether an exocytotic pathway was involved in the BDNF-induced glutamate release using botulinum toxin B (BoTX/B), which cleaves VAMP2 and inhibits exocytosis. Pretreatment of cortical neurons with BoTX/B for 8–12 h caused complete inhibition of ionomycin-evoked glutamate release (Fig. 5 B). Ionomycin is a Ca2+-ionophore and is known to elicit typical Ca2+-triggered exocytosis. BDNF-induced glutamate release was affected little by BoTX/B (Fig. 5 A). To confirm the effects of BoTX/B on the cleavage of VAMP2 in cultured neurons, Western blotting was performed after the release assay. As shown in Fig. 5 C, BoTX/B markedly reduced the VAMP2 protein levels. Similarly, BoTX/A, which cleaves synaptosome-associated membrane protein-25 (SNAP-25), and the combination of BoTX/A and BoTX/B did not affect BDNF-induced glutamate release (data not shown). These results strongly suggested that BDNF-induced glutamate release is independent of the normal exocytotic pathway. We then tested the Na+ dependence of BDNF-induced glutamate release using TTX, a blocker of sodium channels. TTX was found to inhibit the glutamate release induced by BDNF (Fig. 6), indicating that BDNF-induced glutamate release is sodium-dependent. In summary, BDNF induced glutamate release through activation of TrkB. This effect was dependent on intracellular but not extracelluar Ca2+, was non-exocytotic, and was sodium-dependent. The main findings of this study were that BDNF induces glutamate release through the activation of TrkB and that its mechanism is non-exocytotic. BDNF induced rapid and transient release of glutamate from cortical neurons but not from astrocytes in culture. We also confirmed that glutamatergic neurons express TrkB in culture by immunocytochemistry.2 This result is in agreement with the observations of postsynaptic events as revealed by electrophysiological and optical recording studies. Electrophysiological recording studies showed that BDNF rapidly increased the frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents in hippocampal neurons suggesting glutamate release from presynapses (10Lessmann V. Gottmann K. Heumann R. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We reported that synchronized oscillation of Ca2+, which is thought to reflect synaptic transmission, was potentiated by BDNF in hippocampal (17Sakai N. Yamada M. Numakawa T. Ogura A. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1997; 778: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and cortical neurons. 3N. Sakai and H. Hatanaka, unpublished observation. The synchronized Ca2+oscillation potentiated by BDNF was blocked by glutamate antagonist (17Sakai N. Yamada M. Numakawa T. Ogura A. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1997; 778: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that BDNF induced glutamate release. These pre- and postsynaptic reactions induced by BDNF suggest that BDNF is a physiological messenger in glutamatergic synapses. BDNF-induced glutamate release was inhibited by K252a, a Trk kinase inhibitor, and phosphorylation of TrkB was observed within 30 s. In addition, TrkB-IgG also blocked BDNF-induced glutamate release (data not shown). Nerve growth factor, which does not phosphorylate TrkB, had no effect on glutamate release in cortical cultures. Although the dose of BDNF seems relatively high compared with its affinity to TrkB, the effect of BDNF on glutamate release is dose-dependent. The dose shift may be explained by the experimental procedures. There were no proteins such as bovine serum albumin to prevent the adsorption of BDNF to pipette tips and culture dishes in this assay buffer, so the actual amount of BDNF that acted on the neurons may have been reduced. These results indicated that BDNF induces the release of glutamate through activation of TrkB. Normal, regulated release of neurotransmitters produces Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (18DeCamilli P. Jahn R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 625-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 19Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 20Bennet M.K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and neurotrophins increase Ca2+ levels in neurons (21Berninger B. Garcia D.E. Inagaki N. Hahnel C. Lindholm D. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 22Wildering W.C. Lodder J.C. Kits K.S. Bulloch A.G.M. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 2778-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ca2+ dependence was then investigated. BDNF-induced glutamate release was independent of the extracellular calcium level but dependent on the intracellular calcium level. These observations suggest two possibilities: 1) Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores may be required to generate a Ca2+ transient; or 2) a specific level of free Ca2+ may be necessary as a basal condition. We examined whether an exocytotic pathway was involved in the BDNF-induced glutamate release using BoTX/B. BoTX/B is known to cleave VAMP2 (23Niemann H. Blasi J. Jahn R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), a synaptic vesicle membrane protein that forms a component of the SNARE complex (18DeCamilli P. Jahn R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 625-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 19Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 24Goda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), thereby inhibiting exocytosis (18DeCamilli P. Jahn R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 625-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar,19Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 23Niemann H. Blasi J. Jahn R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Whereas ionomycin-evoked glutamate release, which is known to elicit the Ca2+-triggered typical exocytosis, was inhibited completely by BoTX/B, BDNF-induced glutamate release was not affected by this treatment. This result strongly suggested that BDNF-induced glutamate release is independent of the normal exocytotic pathway mediated by SNARE complexes (18DeCamilli P. Jahn R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 625-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 19Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 24Goda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There is another pathway of glutamate release distinct from exocytosis known as reverse transport through glutamate transporters (25Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 26Attwel D. Barbour B. Szatkowski M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 has been cloned (27Kanai Y. Hediger M. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) and was reported to be expressed on glutamatergic neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (28Kanai Y. Bhide P.G. DiFiglia M. Hediger M.A. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The glutamate transporter usually serves as an uptake carrier removing glutamate that has been released into the synaptic cleft under normal conditions. However, when the extracellular K+ level or intracellular Na+ level is high, the transporter works in the reverse direction (26Attwel D. Barbour B. Szatkowski M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Indeed, high K+-induced glutamate release was not completely inhibited by BoTX under our culture conditions (data not shown). Thus, we tested the Na+ dependence of BDNF-induced glutamate release using TTX, a blocker of sodium channels. TTX was found to inhibit the glutamate release induced by BDNF. Although the result of the TTX experiment should be discussed carefully, in the case of neurotransmitter release independent of extracellular Ca2+but dependent on Na+, it has been suggested that increases in intracellular Na+ concentration, rather than changes in membrane potential, are involved in inducing the release of transmitters by the mechanism of reverse transport (25Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, in our study it was likely that TTX inhibited BDNF-induced release of glutamate by blocking the increase of Na+ concentration and not through inhibition of synaptic transmission. These results suggest that BDNF increases the release of glutamate through reverse transport. Alternatively, BDNF may increase the uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles resulting in high vesicular glutamate concentration. In this case, a quantum of glutamate is increased; thus BDNF elevates the basal release. However, the electrophysiological data ran counter to this hypothesis. Neurotrophins increase the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents without affecting their amplitude (10Lessmann V. Gottmann K. Heumann R. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This suggests that the effect is not attributable to an increase in quantum. BDNF also induced dopamine release from mesencephalic neurons via the TrkB pathway (29Blochl A. Sirrenberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21100-21107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the same mechanism is involved in both responses, as there have been no reports concerning Ca2+and Na+ dependence or exocytosis. However, catecholamine is also released from the cytosolic pool via transporters (25Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the case of acetylcholine as reported by Lohof et al. (9Lohof A.M. Ip N.Y. Poo M.-M. Nature. 1993; 363: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), it is again not clear whether the same mechanisms are involved, as the time course is different and there is no evidence of reverse uptake of acetylcholine. However, there have been reports of Ca2+-independent and Na+-dependent release of acetylcholine (25Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that BDNF induces rapid and transient release of glutamate from cortical neurons through the activation of TrkB. This is a presynaptic event corresponding to the physiological responses observed in postsynapses reported previously (9Lohof A.M. Ip N.Y. Poo M.-M. Nature. 1993; 363: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 10Lessmann V. Gottmann K. Heumann R. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 12Kang H.

BDNF-induced release of glutamate is unusual in that it occurs via a non-exocytotic mechanism. We suggest that this glutamate release occurs via reverse transport through the glutamate transporter, although confirmation is still required by direct evidence, possibly through the use of knock-out mutants. Transmitter release through the non-exocytotic pathway induced by physiological stimulation such as BDNF may be a novel mechanism of synaptic transmission. It has been reported that the expression (30Lindholm D. Castren E. Berzaghi M. Blochl A. Thoenen H. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1362-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and release (7Blochl A. Thoenen H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1220-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) of neurotrophins are modulated by glutamatergic transmission. In addition, we reported previously (16Takei N. Sasaoka K. Inoue K. Takahashi M. Endo Y. Hatanaka H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) that long term treatment with BDNF up-regulates the exocytotic machinery and transmitter release. Therefore, it is possible to envisage a feed forward enhancement of synaptic transmission and subsequent strengthening of the synaptic connections by BDNF and glutamate. We thank Dr. R. M. Lindsay (Regeneron Pharmaceutical Co.) for the kind gift of BDNF and Dr. S. Koizumi (Novartis Pharma K. K.) for the generous gift of anti-TrkB monoclonal antibody. We thank Dr. A.

To elucidate the ecdysone hierarchy governing this event, we cloned and characterized the ecdysone receptor (AaEcR) and the nuclear receptorUltraspiracle (AaUSP), a retinoid X receptor homologue, from the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, which form a functional complex capable of ligand and DNA binding. Here we analyzed the DNA-binding properties of the AaEcR·AaUSP heterodimer with respect to the effects of nucleotide sequence, orientation, and spacing between half-sites in natural Drosophila and synthetic ecdysone response element (EcREs). By using an electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay, we showed that AaEcR·AaUSP exhibits a broad binding specificity, forming complexes with inverted (IR) and direct (DR) repeats of the nuclear receptor response element half-site consensus sequence AGGTCA separated by spacers of variable length. A single nucleotide spacer was optimal for both imperfect (IRhsp-1) and perfect (IRper-1) inverted repeats; adding or removing 1 base pair in an IRhsp-1 spacer practically abolished binding. However, changing the half-site to the consensus sequence AGGTCA (IRper-1) increased binding of AaEcR·AaUSP 10-fold over IRhsp-1 and, at the same time, reduced the stringency of the spacer length requirement, with IRper-0 to IRper-5 showing detectable binding. Spacer length was less important in DRs of AGGTCA (DR-0 to DR-5); although 4 bp was optimal, DR-3 and DR-5 bound AaEcR·AaUSP almost as efficiently as DR-4. Furthermore, AaEcR·AaUSP also bound DRs separated by 11–13 nucleotide spacers. Competition experiments and direct estimation of binding affinity (K d) indicated that, given identical consensus half-sites and an optimal spacer, the AaEcR·AaUSP heterodimer bound an IR with higher affinity than a DR. Co-transfection assays utilizing CV-1 cells demonstrated that the mosquito EcR·USP heterodimer is capable of transactivating reporter constructs containing either IR-1 or DR-4. The levels of transactivation are correlated with the respective binding affinities of the response elements (IRper-1 > DR-4 > IRhsp-1).

Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2825) Google Scholar, 6Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mechanism of Steroid Hormone Regulation of Gene Transcription. R. G. Landes Co., Austin1994: 25-59Google Scholar). Steroid hormone receptors, including the estrogen (ER), progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptors, were originally thought to bind exclusively as homodimers to inverted repeats (IR) with the consensus half-site AGGTCA or AGAACA separated by three nucleotides (IR-3) (3Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar, 6Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mechanism of Steroid Hormone Regulation of Gene Transcription. R. G. Landes Co., Austin1994: 25-59Google Scholar). However, glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors have recently been shown to form complexes on direct repeats with variable spacing between half-sites (7Aumais J.P. Lee H.S. DeGannes C. Horsford J. White H.J. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 12568-12577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The vitamin D receptor (VDR) and non-steroid nuclear receptors, including thyroid hormone (TR) and retinoic acid (RAR) receptors, bind to cognate response elements as heterodimers with a shared partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2825) Google Scholar). Response elements for these receptors are composed of direct repeats with consensus half-sites, AGGTCA, spaced by 3, 4, or 5 nucleotides (DR-3, DR-4, and DR-5) (8Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). The subsequent demonstration that a DR-1 serves as an RXR and peroxisome proliferator activating receptor response element, and that a DR-2 serves as a second RAR response element has expanded the model to the so-called 1 to 5 rule (9Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar). More recently, widely spaced, directly repeated AGGTCA elements have been shown to act as promiscuous enhancers for different classes of nuclear receptors; for example, a DR-15 reporter gene can be activated by RAR·RXR, VDR·RXR, and ER (10Kato S. Sasaki H. Suzawa M. Masushige S. Tora L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5858-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These heterodimers can also regulate target gene expression by binding to response elements consisting of inverted or everted repeats. For example, an inverted repeat without spacing (IR-0) has been reported to function as a response element for TR, RAR, and VDR, whereas everted repeats with a 6-bp spacer or a 12-bp spacer serve as response elements for TR and VDR, respectively (11Umesono K.

The insect steroid hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), regulates essential processes in development, molting, metamorphosis, and reproduction (14Riddiford L.M. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I.

The functional ecdysone receptor in Drosophila is a heterodimer of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) protein (19Koelle M.R. Talbot W.S. Segraves W.A. Bender M.T. Cherbas P. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 59-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) and an RXR homologue, Ultraspiracle (USP) (20Thomas H.E. Stunnenberg H.G. Steward A.F.

The first ecdysone response element (EcRE) was identified in the promoter of the Drosophila heat shock protein-27 gene. It is an imperfect palindrome with only a 1-bp spacer (IRhsp-1), rather than the 3-bp spacer typical of vertebrate steroid HREs (23Riddihough G. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3729-3734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several EcREs have been identified in the regulatory regions of the following four more Drosophilagenes: Eip28/29 (24Cherbas L. Lee K. Cherbas P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), Fbp-1 (25Antoniewski C. Laval M. Hahan A. Lepesant J.-A. Mol. Cell.

O'Grady M.S. Edmondson R.G. Lassieur S.M. Benes H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), each containing imperfect inverted repeats with a 1-bp spacer (IR-1). These findings, together with DNA binding and in vitro transactivation studies, suggested that natural Drosophila EcREs are predominantly IR-1s. However, it was later found thatDrosophila EcR·USP (DmEcR·DmUSP) can bind synthetic DRs of (A/G)GGTCA with spacers of 3–5 nucleotides and can activate reporter gene constructs containing these direct repeats in Drosophila Schneider-2 (S2) cells (28Horner M.A. Chen T.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2977-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Finally, the EcRE of the Drosophila nested gene (ng) is a direct repeat of AGGTCA with a 12-nucleotide spacer (30D'Avino P.P. Crispi S. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Furia M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 113: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The maintenance and dispersal of mosquito-borne disease depends upon successful reproduction of the mosquito, and 20E plays a crucial role in regulation of vitellogenesis and oogenesis (15Bownes M. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1986; 31: 507-553Crossref Google Scholar, 16Hagedorn H.H. Koolman J. Ecdysone from Chemistry to Mode of Action.

The processes of egg maturation and disease transmission are intimately associated through the mutual requirement for blood. Therefore, elucidation of the role of ecdysone receptor in mosquito reproduction is of significant biological and epidemiological importance. Although several target genes for the 20E-mediated regulatory cascade have been identified (32Raikhel, A. S., Miura, K., and Segraves, W. A. (1998)Am. Zool., in pressGoogle Scholar, 33Lin Y. Hamblin M.T. Edwards M.J. Barillas-Mury C. Kanost M.R. Knipple D.C. Wolfner M.F. Hagedorn H.H. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 558-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Deitsch K. Chen J. Raikhel A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), native EcREs in mosquitoes are still unknown. In the mosquito Aedes aegypti, cDNAs of one ecdysone receptor (AaEcR) (35Cho W.-L. Kapitskaya M.Z. Raikhel A.S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and two USP isoforms (36Kapitskaya M. Wang S. Cress E.D. Dhadialla T.S. Raikhel A.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have been cloned. Compared with vertebrate nuclear receptors, insect EcR and USP homologues show unexpectedly high levels of sequence diversity (36Kapitskaya M. Wang S. Cress E.D. Dhadialla T.S. Raikhel A.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,37Cherbas P. Cherbas L. Gilbert L.I. Tata J.R. Atkinson B.G. Metamorphosis, Postembryonic Reprogramming of Gene Expression in Amphibian and Insect Cells. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 175-222Google Scholar). It is, therefore, difficult to predict the DNA binding specificity of the mosquito EcR·USP heterodimer. Although DNA binding domain determinants of half-site sequence specificity have been identified (38Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 39Mader S. Chen J.Y. Chen Z. White J. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Cell. 1989; 57: 1131-1138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), determinants of half-site spacing and orientation as well as flanking sequence preferences are less well understood. In order to address these questions, we have analyzed the DNA binding properties of the AaEcR·AaUSP heterodimer. We used electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays (EMSA) with synthetic oligonucleotides and in vitro synthesized AaEcR and AaUSP to investigate the effects of the sequence, orientation, and spacing of half-sites on the DNA binding properties of the mosquito EcR·USP heterodimer. Finally, we have used CV-1 cells in order to correlate the DNA binding properties of AaEcR·AaUSP with their ability to transactivate the reporter gene constructs containing EcREs. The nuclear receptor proteins were synthesized by coupled in vitrotranscription-translation (TNT) system (Promega). AaEcR and AaUSPb cDNAs containing full open reading frames were subcloned into pGEM3Z (Promega) as described previously (36Kapitskaya M. Wang S. Cress E.D. Dhadialla T.S. Raikhel A.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For comparison, the 2.1-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment from pZ7-1-DmUSP (41Henrich V.C. Sliter T.J. Lubahn D.B. MacIntyre A. Gilbert L.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4143-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and the 3.3-kilobase pair BamHI fragment from pACT-DmEcR-B1 (19Koelle M.R. Talbot W.S. Segraves W.A. Bender M.T. Cherbas P. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 59-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) bearing the entire open reading frames of DrosophilaUSP and EcR, respectively, were subcloned into pGEM7Z (+) (Promega). The in vitro transcription/translation reactions programmed by the circular plasmid DNAs utilized the SP6 promoter. To confirm the synthesis of proteins with expected sizes, control TNT reactions were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine, and the resulting reactions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography. Oligonucleotides were purchased either from the Macromolecular Structure Facility of the Biochemistry Department at Michigan State University or Life Technologies, Inc. For DNA binding studies, a pair of sense and antisense oligonucleotides was annealed and resolved by 15 or 20% non-denaturing PAGE, and the appropriate bands of double-stranded oligonucleotides were electroeluted. Ten picomoles of double-stranded oligonucleotide were end-labeled with T4 DNA kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 μCi of [γ32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), and the unincorporated radioactivity was removed through a Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) spin column. One microliter of each TNT reaction was used alone or in combination as a protein source for EMSA. Proteins were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of the electrophoretic mobility shift buffer, containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05 mg/ml of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 0.3 mg/ml single-stranded DNA (5′-CTAACAAAGTTCGCCTGGACTAGAACGGCC-3′), 0.5 μm 20E, and for competition experiments, the indicated amounts of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides. This was followed by the addition of 0.05 pmol of 32P-labeled probe and incubation for another 30 min. The reaction mixture was resolved using a 6% non-denaturing PAGE at a constant voltage of 150 V for 90 min at room temperature. The gel was dried, and the distribution of radioactivity was visualized either by autoradiography or by PhosphorImaging for quantitative analysis using ImageQuantTM software (Molecular Dynamics). K d values of AaEcR·AaUSP binding to potential EcREs were estimated according to Fawell et al.(42Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) using the EMSA procedure described above. Protein samples were first incubated in the electrophoretic mobility shift buffer containing 0.5 μm 20E for 30 min and then with several different concentrations of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides for another 30 min. Bound and free probes were separated by non-denaturing PAGE and quantified by the PhosphorImager. Saturation curves and Scatchard plots (43Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1969; 51: 660-673Crossref Scopus (17789) Google Scholar) were calculated for at least three independent experiments, and the mean value was taken as the K d. The antiserum raised against AaEcR (anti-AaEcR) was prepared as follows. The HincII-EcoRI fragment of the AaEcR cDNA clone was subcloned into pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs) and expressed in Escherichia coli TB1 strain. The AaEcR protein, which was fused to maltose-binding protein, was concentrated by amylose resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fusion protein was further purified by SDS-PAGE followed by electroelution. A New Zealand White rabbit was immunized by subcutaneous injection with 100 μg of the purified fusion protein emulsified in TiterMax (CytRx) adjuvant. Blood was collected at 2-week intervals, and the titer of specific antibodies was estimated by Western blotting of the TNT reaction programmed by pGEM3Z-AaEcR. The monoclonal antibody against DmUSP (anti-DmUSP), described in Khoury Christianson et al. (44Khoury Christianson A.M. King D.L. Hatzivassiliou E. Casas J.E. Hallenbeck P.L. Nikodem V.M. Mitsialis S.A. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11503-11507Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. F. C. Kafatos (European Molecular Biological Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany). The BamHI-EcoRI fragment of AaEcR cDNA (35Cho W.-L. Kapitskaya M.Z. Raikhel A.S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the EcoRI fragments of AaUSPb cDNA (36Kapitskaya M. Wang S. Cress E.D. Dhadialla T.S. Raikhel A.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the corresponding sites of pCDNA3.1/zeo (Invitrogen). Translatability of these constructs was checked byin vitro TNT-coupled transcription/translation (Promega), which was followed by EMSA to verify binding properties of the expressed receptors. The reporter plasmid ΔMTV-5xIRhsp-1-CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase), containing five copies of IRhsp-1 was used in initial transfection assays (22Yao T.-P. Segraves W.A. Oro A.E. McKeown M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1992; 71: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). To make other reporter plasmids, oligonucleotides IRhsp-1(agcttcaaGGGTTCaTGCACTtgtccatcg), DR-4 (agcttcaagTGACCTcctgTGACCTtgtccatcg), and IRper-1 (agcttcaagAGGTCAaTGACCTtgtccatcg) were ligated into theHindIII site of ΔMTV-CAT (45Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Constructs harboring a single copy of either IRhsp-1, IRper-1, or DR-4 were used for a comparative study of transactivation by EcR·USP. Three copies of DR-4 were placed before the CAT gene to make the reporter construct ΔMTV-3xDR4-CAT. All reporter constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The expression plasmid CMV-β-galactosidase was a kind gift from Dr. L. Karl Olson (Department of Physiology, Michigan State University). The green African monkey kidney CV-1 cell line (American Tissue Culture Collection, Bethesda, MD) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. 2 × 105cells were seeded in 6-well plates for 18–24 h before transfection. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. In brief, 0.4 μg each of AaEcR, AaUSP, and CMV-β-galactosidase expression plasmid, and 1.2 μg of the reporter plasmid were mixed with LipofectAMINE and transfected in OPTI-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 3–5 h. The transfection mixture was removed, and the cells were further incubated in OPTI-MEM supplemented by 5% charcoal-stripped calf serum for 36–48 h in the presence of ethanol vehicle or 1 μm Muristerone A (Sigma). Each well received 2.4 μg of total DNA. pCDNA3.1/Zeo (+) was used as a carrier for equalizing the amount of DNA allocated to each well. CAT assays were performed as described by Herbomel et al. (46Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) for 2 h and β-galactosidase assays for 60–90 min. CAT activity was normalized with β-galactosidase activity. By using EMSA with in vitro TNT-expressed mosquito EcR and USP isoforms, we previously demonstrated that the AaEcR·AaUSP complex bound a 30-base pair oligonucleotide corresponding to theDrosophila hsp27 EcRE (36Kapitskaya M. Wang S. Cress E.D. Dhadialla T.S. Raikhel A.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This element was designated as IRhsp-1 (an imperfect inverted repeat with a 1-bp spacer). In this study, we report in detail the DNA binding characteristics of mosquito EcR heterodimerized with the mosquito USPb isoform (designated hereafter as USP). Our analyses indicated, however, that the binding properties of the AaEcR·AaUSPa heterodimer are generally similar to those of AaEcR·AaUSPb (not shown). First, we confirmed binding of the AaEcR·AaUSP heterodimer to IRhsp-1 by utilizing anti-AaEcR and anti-DmUSP antibodies: when EMSA were performed in the presence of either of the antibodies, AaEcR·AaUSP·IRhsp-1 complexes were supershifted (not shown). Next, we investigated the role of IR spacer nucleotide length in the binding of the AaEcR·AaUSP heterodimer. In the first series of experiments, we tested the ability of IRhsps with various spacer lengths to compete against IRhsp-1 binding to the AaEcR·AaUSP complex (Fig. 1). A 50-fold molar excess of the appropriate cold IR was added to each EMSA reaction with radiolabeled IRhsp-1, and the intensity of the resulting bands was measured. Self-competition with cold IRhsp-1 led to a 96% reduction in binding intensity (Fig. 1, A and B). IRhsp-0 also was revealed to be an efficient competitor, displacing 82% of the bound IRhsp-1 probe. However, the ability of IRhsps to compete with IRhsp-1 progressively declined as the number of spacer nucleotides increased from 2 to 5. In a second series of experiments, the direct binding of IRhsp-0–5 to AaEcR·AaUSP was tested by EMSA: apart from IRhsp-1, only IRhsp-0 exhibited a detectable retarded band (not shown). Next, we tested AaEcR·AaUSP binding to a perfect inverted repeat consisting of AGGTCA half-sites with a 1-bp spacer (IRper-1). The EMSA revealed a strong retarded band when both TNT-generated AaEcR and AaUSP proteins were included in the reaction (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Binding of AaEcR·AaUSP to IRper-1 was confirmed by supershift assays incorporating anti-AaEcR and anti-DmUSP (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, a faster migrating weak band, which was supershifted by anti-DmUSP, was detected when AaUSP alone was tested with IRper-1 (not shown). Perfect inverted repeats with nucleotide spaces from 0 to 5 (IRper-0–5) had much higher affinity to AaEcR·AaUSP than the imperfect repeats motifs (IRhsp-0–5); the retarded bands were clearly recognizable in all reactions (Fig. 2 B). The retarded bands with IRper-0 and IRper-1 were considerably more intense than those formed by IRper-2 to IRper–5. Together with the results of IRhsps, this indicates preferential binding of AaEcR·AaUSP to IR motifs with 1 and 0 nucleotide spacers (Fig. 2 B). This preference was also confirmed by competition EMSA (Fig. 3). AaEcR·AaUSP was incubated with a fixed amount of radiolabeled IRper-1 and competed by increasing amounts of unlabeled IRpers of various spacers. In the self-competition control, binding was almost completely competed away by inclusion of a 25-fold molar excess of cold IRper-1. IRper-0 also competed well, with a 25-fold molar excess competing away 93% of IRper-1 binding to AaEcR·AaUSP. Twenty five-fold molar excess of IRper-2, IRper-3, and IRper-5 displaced only 56, 11, and 32% of binding, respectively. IRper-5 consistently showed stronger competition than IRper-3. Efficiency of competition indicates that the DNA binding affinity of AaEcR·AaUSP toward IRpers follows the order IR-1 > IR-0 > IR-2 > IR-5 > IR-3. We also measured the binding of mosquito EcR·USP to a set of synthetic elements containing direct repeats with spacers ranging from 0 to 5. The mosquito EcR·USP complex effectively bound direct repeats (DRs) of AGGTCA containing a 4-bp spacer (DR-4) (Fig. 4). The composition of the AaEcR·AaUSP complex was verified by supershift experiments using either anti-AaEcR or anti-DmUSP. The latter supershifted the AaEcR·AaUSP·DR-4 complex as efficiently as it did the control complex DmEcR·DmUSP·DR-4 (not shown). We investigated the possible effect of DR-4 flanking regions on AaEcR·AaUSP binding by testing the following three DR-4 response elements: DR-4/3C with flanking regions from Drosophila ngelements (30D'Avino P.P. Crispi S. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Furia M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 113: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), DR-4/HS with flanking regions from Drosophilahsp27 EcRE (23Riddihough G. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3729-3734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and DR-4/VT with flanking regions from the thyroid response element (47Glass C.K. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 313-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled IRhsp-1 was displaced from AaEcR·AaUSP equally efficiently by 50-fold molar excess of cold DR-4s containing any of the three flanking regions (Fig. 4, lanes 1–5). Labeled DR-4s with different flanking regions strongly bound AaEcR·AaUSP, forming specific retardation bands of similar size and intensity (Fig. 4, lanes 6–11). Thus, the flanking DNA sequences did not much affect specific binding of the heterodimer. Also of note is that incubation of AaEcR·AaUSP with DR-4/3C resulted in an additional band of higher mobility than the specific heterodimer ban"
https://openalex.org/W2011032265,"Receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin molecules (FcR) present on leukocyte cell membranes mediate a large number of cellular responses that are very important in host defense, including phagocytosis, cell cytotoxicity, production and secretion of inflammatory mediators, and modulation of the immune response. Cross-linking of FcR with immune complexes leads, first to activation of protein-tyrosine kinases. The molecular events that follow and that transduce signals from these receptors to the nucleus are still poorly defined. We have investigated the signal transduction pathway from Fc receptors that leads to gene activation and production of cytokines in monocytes. Cross-linking of FcR, on the THP-1 monocytic cell line, by immune complexes resulted in both activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and interleukin 1 production. These responses were completely blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In contrast, expression of dominant negative mutants of Ras and Raf-1, in these cells, did not have any effect on FcR-mediated nuclear factor activation, suggesting that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was not used by these receptors. However, MAPK activation was easily detected by in vitro kinase assays, after FcR cross-linking with immune complexes. Using the specific MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MAPK kinase) inhibitor PD98059, we found that MAPK activation is necessary for FcR-dependent activation of the nuclear factor NF-κB. These results strongly suggest that the signaling pathway from Fc receptors leading to expression of different genes important to leukocyte biology, initiates with tyrosine kinases and requires MAPK activation; but in contrast to other tyrosine kinase receptors, FcR-mediated MAPK activation does not involve Ras and Raf.

In contrast, expression of dominant negative mutants of Ras and Raf-1, in these cells, did not have any effect on FcR-mediated nuclear factor activation, suggesting that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was not used by these receptors. However, MAPK activation was easily detected by in vitro kinase assays, after FcR cross-linking with immune complexes. Using the specific MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MAPK kinase) inhibitor PD98059, we found that MAPK activation is necessary for FcR-dependent activation of the nuclear factor NF-κB. These results strongly suggest that the signaling pathway from Fc receptors leading to expression of different genes important to leukocyte biology, initiates with tyrosine kinases and requires MAPK activation; but in contrast to other tyrosine kinase receptors, FcR-mediated MAPK activation does not involve Ras and Raf. receptor(s) for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G molecules extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK containing the influenza hemagglutinin epitope tag interleukin 1 interleukin 8 mitogen-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein MAPK/ERK kinase tumor necrosis factor myelin basic protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay natural killer nuclear factor κB insoluble immune complex. Antibodies (immunoglobulins) present two main functions in host defense: the binding to antigen via their antigen-combining sites and the mobilization of cellular defense mechanisms via their carboxyl-terminal Fc portion. Cross-linking of receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G molecules (FcγR)1 on many cells of the immune system triggers various functions such as phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, generation of the respiratory burst, and production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines (1Unkeless J.C.

They are coded for by different genes and differ in their relative avidity for IgG, molecular structure, and cellular distribution (4Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev.

Activation of FcγR as well as other immunoreceptors (such as TCR, BCR, and FcεRI) results in common molecular events involving activation of Src family kinases followed by activation of Syk family kinases (5Keegan A.D.

One of the major cellular responses initiated by FcγR cross-linking, specially in myelomonocytic and natural killer (NK) cells, is the activation of genes encoding cytokines important in inflammation, such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (2Van de Winkel J.G.J.

The signaling pathway from FcγR to the nucleus is not known, but it probably shares elements with the biochemical cascade used by other receptors known to activate gene transcription. In particular, receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity have been shown to induce transcription of genes via activation of the Ras signaling pathway (20Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), which turns on sequentially Ras, Raf-1, MEK, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (21Macdonald S.G. Crews C.M. Wu L.

Due to the fact that recent reports indicate that MAPK is activated after FcγR cross-linking in various cell types (26Durden D.L. Kim H.M. Calore B. Liu Y. J.

Inflammation. 1998; 22: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it has been assumed that the classical Ras pathway is activated upon FcR signaling. However, no direct proof that Ras is used in FcγR signaling has been provided, except for a single report on NK cells (33Galandrini R. Palmieri G. Piccoli M. Frati L. Santoni A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because activation of the transcription factor NF-κB is required for IL-1 gene induction (34Haskill S. Johnson C. Eierman D. Becker S. Warren K. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1690-1694PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cogswell J.P. Godlevski M.M. Wisely G.B. Clay W.C. Leesnitzer L.M. Ways J.P. Gray J.G. J.

Biol. 1993; 13: 6231-6240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to investigate directly if FcγR cross-linking on monocytic cells resulted in activation of this nuclear factor, and then we used this response as a final read-out to examine the involvement of the several elements of the Ras pathway in FcγR signaling, leading to gene activation and cytokine production. We found that stimulation of the THP-1 monocytic cell line with insoluble immune complexes results in production of IL-1 and also in activation of the nuclear factor NF-κB. Moreover, activation of this nuclear factor is mediated by MAPK but activation of this kinase does not seem to involve the classical Ras pathway defined for other receptor tyrosine kinases (20Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 37Khosravi-far R. Channing D.J. Cancer Metast. Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), since expression of dominant negative mutants of Ras and Raf did not have any effect on either MAPK activation or NF-κB activation. In contrast, the MAPK kinase (MEK) specific inhibitor, PD98059, efficiently blocked activation of this nuclear factor to basal levels. These results indicate that MAPK is an important element in FcγR -mediated induction of cytokine genes (e.g. IL-1) in monocytes, and strongly suggest that activation of MEK and subsequently of MAPK occurs via a pathway that is independent of Ras and Raf. The following antibodies were used: Anti-pan ERK monoclonal antibody (catalog no. E171120, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel, Aurora, OH) The specific MEK (MAPK kinase) inhibitor PD98059 was from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The plasmids HIV-luc and E18pal-luc were a generous gift from Dr. John Westwick and Dr. David A. Brenner of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC. HIV-luc contains NF-κB-responsive elements within the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat promoter placed upstream of the luciferase (luc) gene and directs the expression of luciferase in response to activation of the nuclear factor NF-κB. E18pal-luc that activates luciferase transcription in response to the nuclear factor Ets. The plasmid encoding HA-MAPK was a gift from Mike Weber from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA. Plasmids that direct the synthesis of normal or mutant forms of Ras and Raf were a gift from Dr. Channing Der from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC. Ras constructs were all cloned in the retroviral vector pZIP. The Ras N17 (asparagine 17) mutant is a dominant negative form of this gene, while the Ras L61 (leucine 61) mutant is an active oncogenic form (38Chen S.Y. Huff S.Y. Lai C.C. Der C.J. Powers S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2691-2698PubMed Google Scholar). The Raf 23–284 construct, which contains the amino-terminal domain of Raf-1 and acts as a dominant negative mutant (39Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S. Campbell-Burk S. Bell R.M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), was cloned in the pCGN vector. To test the dominant negative mutants, cells were transfected with the Ras pathway-responsive reporter system GAL-Elk/5XGal-luc (40Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 412-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The plasmid pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) containing the cDNA for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was a gift of David Garcı́a Dı́az from the School of Medicine, University of Mexico, Mexico City. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Insoluble immune complexes (IIC) were prepared by mixing 300 μl of rabbit anti-horse ferritin antibody (28 mg/ml) (Miles Laboratories Ltd., Slough, United Kingdom) and 30 μl of horse ferritin type I (100 mg/ml) (Sigma) in Eppendorf tubes and incubating at 37 °C for 60 min, followed by 12 h on ice. Insoluble immune complexes were separated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g and were washed three times with sterile PBS. IIC were resuspended in 750 μl of PBS and kept sterile at 4 °C until use. Anti-ferritin antibodies were subjected to pepsin digestion to prepare F(ab′)2 fragments. Briefly, 2.8 mg were dissolved in 0.1m citrate buffer, pH 3.5, and pepsin (EC 3.4.23.1) (Sigma) was added at 25 μg/ml. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h and then neutralized with 3 m Tris-HCl, pH = 8.6. Undigested antibody was separated in a protein A-Sepharose column. Purity of F(ab′)2 fragments was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The human monocytic THP-1 cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY), 20 μm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. THP-1 cells (1 × 106) were stimulated with 40 μl insoluble immune complexes in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 complete medium for various times (0–48 h) at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation time, cells were centrifuged at 20,000 × g and the supernatant collected and immediately frozen at −80 °C. Interleukin 1 was measured in the supernatants with an ELISA kit (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments, 30 μmPD98059 or 10 μm herbimycin A (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added 1 h before stimulation. THP-1 monocytic cells were transiently transfected with a DEAE-dextran method as described previously (41Rosales C. Juliano R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2302-2305PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells in 0.5 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA by incubating cells with 200 μg/ml DEAE-dextran (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala Sweden) for 60 min and after one wash, with 0.1 mm chloroquine for another hour at 37 °C. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were resuspended in 4 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and stimulated with 40 μl of insoluble immune complexes. Cells were collected after a 5-h incubation at 37 °C and lysed with 65 μl of lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA). To evaluate transfection efficiencies in selected experiments, cells were transfected with the plasmid pGL3 control (Promega, Madison, WI), which constitutively expresses luciferase from the SV40 promoter. Cells were also transfected with the plasmid pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) containing the cDNA for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Efficiency was estimated from the number of cells presenting green fluorescence at 24 h after transfection. Luciferase enzymatic activity was determined in cell lysates using a luminometer (Monolight 2010 Luminometer, Ann Arbor, MI). Briefly, 50 μl of cell lysate were mixed with 100 μl of buffer (30 mm triglycine, pH 7.8, 3 mm ATP, 15 mm MgSO4, 10 mm dithiothreitol), and 100 μl of substrate (250 μmd-luciferin, pH 6.5). Light produced was measured during 20 s. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, pH = 7.5) containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin A, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml pepstatin, for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 5 min and kept cold on ice. Total cell lysates or MAP kinase immunoprecipitates were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation; Nestle Food Co., Glendde, CA) and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) overnight at room temperature. Membranes were subsequently probed with anti-pan ERK monoclonal antibody at 0.1 μg/ml in blocking buffer, for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed with PBS six times for 5 min each and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel, Aurora, OH), for 1 h at room temperature. After washing six more times with PBS, antibody-reactive proteins were detected with a chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A series of new monoclonal antibodies to anti-phosphotyrosine were obtained following standard techniques (42Schook L.B. Monoclonal Antibody Production: Techniques and Applications. Marcel Dekker, New York1987Google Scholar, 43Zola H. Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987Google Scholar). Briefly, BALB/c mice were immunized with phosphotyrosine-coupled KLH in Freund's adjuvant. Splenocytes from these animals were fused to SP2/O myeloma cells and hybridomas selected by ELISA. Positive hybridomas secreted antibodies binding to phosphotyrosine-coupled ovalbumin, but not to tyrosine-coupled ovalbumin. Several hybridomas were cloned and characterized. Clone AFT8, an IgG1 producer, was selected for anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots. Monoclonal antibody AFT8 was purified from ascitis fluid by affinity chromatography in a protein A-Sepharose column. MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated from THP-1 cell lysates (1.5 × 107cell equivalent) with 1 μg of anti-pan ERK monoclonal antibody. The antibody was first incubated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) for 2 h at 4 °C, and then mixed with the cell lysate for another 2 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were then washed once with cold RIPA buffer and four more times with cold washing buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1m NaCl). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm ATP), containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (1.11 TBq/mmol; 2 mCi/ml) (NEN Life Science Products) and 10 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Reaction was stopped by adding 30 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The phosphorylated substrate bands were analyzed by autoradiography. To evaluate the amount of protein immunoprecipitated, an aliquot of the sample was separated and Western blotted with anti-MAPK antibodies. In some experiments, HA epitope-tagged MAP kinase was transfected into THP-1 cells. After overnight culture to allow for cell recovery, the THP-1 cells were stimulated in various forms. HA-MAPK was immunoprecipitated from THP-1 cell lysates (1.5 × 107 cell equivalent) with 14 μg/ml of anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim). The antibody was first incubated with cell lysates for 2 h and then 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) were added and the mixture incubated for another 4 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were then washed once with cold RIPA buffer and four more times with cold washing buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to a kinase assay just as described above. THP-1 monocytic cells were stimulated with insoluble immune complexes for various periods of time, and IL-1 produced and secreted in the supernatant was measured with a commercial ELISA kit. FcγR cross-linking by immune complexes induced a rapid and strong production of IL-1 by these cells (Fig. 1). IL-1 production reached a maximum (around 400 pg/ml) at about 24 h of stimulation. Previous treatment of cells with the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A (44Uehara Y. Fukazawa H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) abolished cytokine production, indicating that FcγR-mediated production of IL-1 requires protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Because treatment of cells with the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A (44Uehara Y. Fukazawa H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 370-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) abolished cytokine production, we decided to look more directly at the effect of this drug on the FcR response. Stimulation of THP-1 cells with insoluble immune complexes caused rapid phosphorylation on tyrosine of several proteins. Prominent phosphotyrosine bands are increased at 1 min of stimulation at around 30, 35, 40, 44, and 70 kDa (Fig. 2). Treatment of cells with herbimycin A prior to stimulation completely abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. Moreover, several other bands that were tyrosine-phosphorylated in the resting state also showed a significant reduction in presence of herbimycin A (Fig. 2). This result is in agreement with previous data indicating that Fc receptors recruit tyrosine kinases for their signaling (3Sánchez-Mejorada G. Rosales C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 10Santana C. Noris G. Espinoza B. Ortega E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It also shows that herbimycin A is working well and it is blocking the tyrosine phosphorylation needed for FcγR-mediated IL-1 production. Because the IL-1 gene, as well as other early immediate genes (such as those for IL-8 and TNF), requires activation of the nuclear factor NF-κB for transcriptional activation (34Haskill S. Johnson C. Eierman D. Becker S. Warren K. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1690-1694PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sporn S.A. Eierman D.F. Johnson C.E. Morris J. Martin G. Ladner M. Haskill S. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4434-4441PubMed Google Scholar), we evaluated NF-κB activation in response to FcγR cross-linking in monocytes. THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with the NF-κB reporter plasmid, HIV-luc, and luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates. Stimulation of transfected THP-1 cells by immune complexes resulted in a strong activation of the nuclear factor NF-κB, as indicated by an increase (around 4-fold) in luciferase activity (Fig. 3 A). Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with herbimycin A also completely blocked NF-κB activation (Fig. 3 A). Specificity of this response was tested by transfecting cells with the plasmid E18pal-luc that activates luciferase transcription in response to activation of the nuclear factor Ets. Stimulation of THP-1 cells with insoluble immune complexes did not induce luciferase activity from this plasmid (Fig. 3 B). Treatment of the cells with 15 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide induced luciferase activity from this plasmid (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the response observed after immune complex stimulation is not due to general cell activation. To confirm that only immune complexes were stimulating the cells via Fc receptors, transfected THP-1 cells were treated with various preparations of antibody and immune complexes (Fig. 4). None of the following stimuli caused activation of NF-κB as indicated by an increase in luciferase activity: ferritin, the protein used to form the immune complexes, F(ab′)2 fragments of the anti-ferritin antibodies, and immune complexes formed with these F(ab′)2 fragments and ferritin (Fig. 4). The complete IgG molecule of anti-ferritin antibodies caused only a small activation, while the insoluble immune complexes gave the optimal response previously observed (Fig. 4). These data collectively indicate that FcγR aggregation is responsible for nuclear factor activation and production of IL-1, and that both events require protein-tyrosine kinase activity to take place. There is evidence that cross-linking of several immunoreceptors in leukocytes activates various elements of the Ras consensus signaling pathway (26Durden D.L. Kim H.M. Calore B. Liu Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4039-4047PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402PubMed Google Scholar, 28Izquierdo M. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Cantrell D.A.

To explore the possibility that FcγR signaling leading to nuclear factor activation in monocytic cells also involved elements of the Ras pathway, THP-1 cells were co-transfected with the NF-κB-driven reporter plasmid and an expression plasmid directing the synthesis of a mutant form of Ras or Raf. Transfected THP-1 cells were then stimulated with insoluble immune complexes and NF-κB activation evaluated by measuring luciferase activity in cell lysates. Expression of either wild-type Ras (not shown) or the dominant negative mutant Ras N17 did not affect FcγR-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 5 A). That the mutant Ras proteins were functional in these cells was confirmed by co-transfection of THP-1 cells with the corresponding Ras construct and the mitogen-responsive reporter system Gal-Elk/5XGal-luc, which detects Ras pathway activation (40Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 412-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 41Rosales C. Juliano R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2302-2305PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved for 48 h and then stimulated with 10% serum in the medium. Five hours after serum stimulation, a 3-fold increase in Ras activity was detected by measuring the luciferase activity (Fig. 5 B). Co-expression of the dominant negative mutant Ras N17 blocked serum-induced activation of the reporter system to basal levels (Fig. 5 B). Moreover, the presence of the activated oncogenic Ras L61 enhanced the Ras signaling initiated by serum (Fig. 5 B). These results also confirmed that, in these cells, the mutant forms of Ras were affecting Ras signaling activity as expected. After Ras activation, the serine-threonine kinase Raf is the next element in the Ras signaling pathway (20Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A.

To explore if this kinase was involved in FcγR signaling in monocytes, THP-1 cells were also co-transfected with the NF-κB reporter plasmid and the dominant negative mutant form of Raf-1, Raf 23–284.

Now that detailed structural information is emerging on parts of the catalytic regions of adenylyl cyclase that reside in the cytosol (1Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 2Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) the complexity of the membrane-inserted portion of the enzyme stands out as an unresolved mystery. All cloned adenylyl cyclases possess 12 putative transmembrane-spanning domains (3Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). As originally noted by Krupinski et al. (4Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.J. Feinstein P.G. Orth K. Slaughter C. Reed R.R. Gilman A.G. Science. 1989; 244: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), these structures closely resemble the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transporters, which include the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and P-glycoprotein (5Cooper D.M.F. Karpen J.W. Fagan K.A. Mons N.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, unlike ion channels, the transmembrane-spanning domains of the adenylyl cyclases possess few charged amino acids, nor do they share detailed homology among family members. The puzzle of the function of the membrane components is accentuated by the fact that parts of the cytosolic domains of adenylyl cyclases, when expressed separately from the membrane segments, can be regulated by G-protein subunits and forskolin (6Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Dessauer C.W. Scully T.T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22272-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Some years ago Schultz et al. (8Schultz J.E. Klumpp S. Benz R. Schurhoff-Goeters W.J. Schmid A. Science. 1992; 255: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) showed that adenylyl cyclase fromParamecium was stimulated by membrane depolarization. More recently, cAMP accumulation in sea urchin (Lytechinus pictus) sperm was also found to be stimulated in response to membrane depolarization (9Beltran C. Zapata O. Darszon A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7591-7598Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both of these findings are quite tantalizing within the context of the transmembrane organization mentioned above. However, no structural information has yet emerged on the adenylyl cyclases from these sources, and indeed, it is clear that these cyclases differ in significant regulatory properties from mammalian enzymes, so whether they share the structural features of the mammalian adenylyl cyclases is unknown. A more recent report observed that as a result of long term (0.5 h) depolarization of cerebellar granular cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, cAMP accumulation was elevated; this led the authors to suggest that the endogenous adenylyl cyclase of granule cells was voltage-sensitive (10Reddy R. Smith D. Wayman G. Wu Z. Villacres E.C. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14340-14346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). While voltage sensitivity was an attractive interpretation of those data, a number of other possibilities could also have been envisaged. In the present study we have characterized the expression and regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in primary cultured cerebellar granular cells. Adenylyl cyclase immunoreactivity was localized on or near the plasma membrane throughout the cell bodies, axons, and dendrites of these cells. In axons, cyclase immunoreactivity appeared clustered and concentrated on the growth cone. Such localization, coincident with voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (11Zimprich F. Bolsover S.R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), indicates that adenylyl cyclase is well positioned to respond to neuronal depolarization. We then explored cAMP accumulation in these cells in response to short term depolarization. We found that, indeed, when membrane depolarization acted as a driving force for Na+ or Ca2+ entry, cAMP accumulation was stimulated. In the absence of Ca2+, Na+ entered the cells in response to membrane depolarization via nimodipine-sensitive Ca2+ channels. However, membrane depolarization by itself did not affect adenylyl cyclase activity. A similar stimulation was achieved by the pore-forming agent, gramicidin, in the presence of increasing concentrations of extracellular Na+, where no change in membrane potential would be expected. Although these results demonstrate that the adenylyl cyclase activity of cultured granule neurons is not sensitive to membrane potential per se, they do indicate that as a result of membrane depolarization under normal circumstances the influx of Na+, as well as Ca2+, will elevate cAMP levels. The antiserum raised against a C-terminal region common to adenylyl cyclases has been described (12Jacobowitz O. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10630-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar,13Mons N. Harry A. Dubourg P. Premont R.T. Iyengar R. Cooper D.M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8473-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, 15 μg of particulate protein prepared from either whole cerebellum or phosphate-buffered saline-washed granule cell cultures was loaded per lane, separated on 8% gels, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Antiserum was diluted 1:2000 and incubated with the blot overnight at 4 °C before visualization with chemiluminescence. We used the method of Slesinger and Lansman (14Slesinger P.A. Lansman J.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 435: 101-121Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Growth media consisted of minimum essential media (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2 mml-glutamine, Earle's salts, 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, and penicillin/streptomycin. Rat pups aged 6–9 days were euthanized by an overdose of CO2, followed by decapitation. Whole cerebella were removed, washed with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution, digested in 2.5% trypsin for 10 min, washed, and then gently triturated through three fire-polished pipettes of decreasing diameter in the presence of pancreatic deoxyribonuclease (Sigma, Poole, UK; 2000 Kunitz units/ml). The cell suspension was plated on poly-d-lysine-coated plastic six-well dishes at 5 × 106 cells/well for cAMP determinations or onto glass coverslips at 2 × 105 cells/coverslip for fluorescence immunocytochemistry. Cytosine arabinoside (Sigma, 10 μm) was added once to cells 3 days after plating to kill dividing cells. One-half of the media was replaced on days 3 and 6, and cells were used for experiments 6–8 days after plating. To characterize the cultures at this age, cells were fixed as described for immunofluorescence and stained with the pan-cyclase antibody (1:4000) using the immunoperoxidase method and then examined under phase-contrast microscopy to assess cell types. Cyclase-positive granule neurons constituted 97 ± 2% of the cells. About 1% of the cells were astrocytes, which also stained intensely for adenylyl cyclase in both their cell bodies and distal processes. The remaining cells were unidentified and stained only weakly. All steps were carried out at room temperature. Cells grown on coverslips were washed twice in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and then fixed in 4% freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, for 1 h. Coverslips were then washed extensively, quenched in 0.25% NH4Cl for 10 min, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. All subsequent steps were carried out in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were blocked for 15 min in 4% normal goat serum and incubated for 1 h with the pan-cyclase antiserum (1:500). Visualization was with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-rabbit Fab fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Black and white micrographs of areas of interest were digitally scanned and presented using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). cAMP accumulation in intact cells was measured according to the method of Evans et al. (15Evans T. Smith M.M. Tanner L.I. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (16Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) with some modifications. [2-3H]Adenine (Amersham International, Little Chalfont, UK; 1.5 μCi/well) was added to the culture medium of cerebellar neurons on 24-well plates to label the ATP pool (2 h, 37 °C). The cells were then washed once and incubated with a nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer containing 135 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11.5 mm glucose, 11.6 mm HEPES, and 0.1 mm EGTA adjusted to pH 7.4 with 2 m Tris base (900 μl/well). (A background Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm in such a buffer would yield a free Ca2+concentration of 5 nm.) All experiments were carried out in triplicate at 37 °C in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (400 μm, Sigma), which was preincubated with the cells for 10 min prior to a 2-min assay. Cells were assayed in the presence of forskolin (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK). [Ca2+]i1was measured in populations of cerebellar neurons plated on 9 × 22-mm glass coverslips, loaded with 2 μm fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at room temperature as described (17Byron K.L. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6945-6952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coverslips were mounted vertically in a polymethylmethacrylate cuvette with 2.5 ml of a Ca2+-containing Krebs buffer (as described under “cAMP Accumulation”) in a Perkin-Elmer LS50 spectrofluorimeter with the coverslip at a 30o angle to the incident light. Solution changes were effected by perfusing fresh solution into the bottom of the cuvette while continuously removing solution from the top of the cuvette. Estimation of the [Ca2+]i was performed as described previously using the ratio of 510 nm emission values arising from alternating excitation at 340 and 380 nm (17Byron K.L. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6945-6952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Culture medium was removed from the cells by washing three times in extracellular solution containing (mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4. Glass microelectrodes (Clarke Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, UK) of 5 MΩ resistance were fabricated on a Flaming and Brown P90 pipette puller (Sutter Instruments) and filled with intracellular solution containing (mm): 140 KCl, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2. All current recordings were made using an Axopatch 1D patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments) and acquired onto computer using a National Instruments PC1200 A/D interface (National Instruments, Newbury, UK) and V-Clamp software (Strathclyde, UK, John Dempster). Cell-attached patches of 2–10 GΩ resistance were routinely produced, and breakthrough to whole cell was monitored under voltage clamp with 20-mV imposed voltage steps. Immediately after formation of a whole cell, as judged by the increase in capacitance transients, the cells were held under current clamp and the membrane potential recorded. Extracellular K+ was raised by 1:1 substitution with Na+. Complete and rapid solution changes were effected by removal of the bathing medium and a 3-ml wash in new solution. Using a pan-specific antibody (18Jacobowitz O. Chen J. Iyengar R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), adenylyl cyclase immunoreactivity was seen to be enriched in homogenates of cerebellar granule cell cultures relative to whole cerebellum (Fig. 1 A). Based on earlier functional analyses, this species would be expected to be predominantly Ca2+-stimulable (19Caldwell K.K. Boyajian C.L. Cooper D.M.F. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and from in situhybridization analysis, it would be expected to be AC1 rather than AC8 (20Mons N. Yoshimura M. Cooper D.M.F. Synapse. 1993; 14: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Cali J.J. Zwaagstra J.C. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Krupinski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12190-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the individual cell level, a very discrete labeling pattern was apparent. Adenylyl cyclase immunoreactivity was most prominent on the soma, but was also abundant on both axonal and dendritic processes (Fig. 1 B and C). While the immunoreactivity on the soma and dendrites was distributed diffusely, on axons and on growth cones we observed a much more punctate pattern, with a remarkable concentration in discrete boutons on developing presynaptic terminals (Fig. 1 D). Growth cones contain clusters of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (11Zimprich F. Bolsover S.R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and Ca2+-activated adenylyl cyclases located there would be expected to respond readily to depolarization. Indeed, Ca2+-activated adenylyl cyclase activity has been implicated in the control of growth cone guidance (22Ming G.L. Song H.J. Berninger B. Holt C.E. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1225-1235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The simplest means of globally elevating membrane potential in a population of neurons is to increase extracellular [KCl] relative to [NaCl]. Cerebellar granular neurons were exposed to a range of progressively increasing extracellular K+ concentrations in the absence of Ca2+, by substituting KCl for NaCl in the bathing medium. As extracellular K+ was increased in 10 mmincrements, cAMP accumulation steadily increased. However, beyond 45 mm, the stimulation began to diminish (Fig. 2 A). When K+concentrations were increased in 20 mm increments up to 145 mm, a clearly biphasic response was evident, resulting in almost no stimulation relative to 5 mm K+ at the highest concentration (Fig. 2 B). The initial stimulation at lower K+ levels could be interpreted to reflect a voltage-dependent effect, since membrane potential is expected to depolarize as a function of a K+ gradient. Since no Ca2+ is present in the bathing medium, the observed stimulation cannot reflect the Ca2+-dependent stimulation of the endogenous Ca2+-stimulable adenylyl cyclase. Indeed, this effect mimics rather closely what had been reported previously over a more protracted time course (30 min; Ref. 10Reddy R. Smith D. Wayman G. Wu Z. Villacres E.C. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14340-14346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and which was interpreted to reflect a voltage sensitivity of the adenylyl cyclase. However, the diminution in the effect with higher [K+] is not consistent with what would be expected to be a steady depolarization of the membrane potential with increasing [K+]. (Indeed when the inert N-methyl-d-glucamine is substituted for NaCl, no significant stimulation of cAMP accumulation was observed as a function of increasing extracellular [K+]; results not shown.) To confirm our assumptions with regard to the effect on membrane potential of increasing extracellular K+, we measured the resting membrane potential in single cells over a range of extracellular [K+] (Fig. 3).Figure 3Measurement of resting membrane potential of single granule cells over a range of extracellular K+concentrations. Whole cell current clamp recording of the membrane potential shows a roughly linear relationship between extracellular K+ and membrane potential (circles). This relationship is approximated by the Nernst equation (drawn line). We have not made any attempt to fit the data to take account of Cl− and Na+ permeabilities. Neither Ca2+-free (squares) nor the presence of 10 μm nimodipine (triangles) in the extracellular solution affect the membrane potential.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Whole cell membrane potentials of cerebellar granular cells were measured under current clamp with various extracellular [K+] as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An approximately linear relationship was observed between membrane potential and extracellular K+(Fig. 3), which approximated the prediction of the Nernst equation (solid line) assuming K+ to be the only charge carrier. Neither the absence of Ca2+ nor the presence of the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nimodipine, in the bathing medium exerted any significant effect on the measured membrane potential (Fig. 3). Clearly, given the time required in making the various membrane potential measurements, the potentials established by the various extracellular [K+] are sustained for extended periods of time, including the duration of the cAMP determinations. However, a paradox is apparent in assuming a simple relationship between membrane potential and adenylyl cyclase activity, given that the effect of increasing extracellular [K+] on membrane potential is linear, but the consequence for adenylyl cyclase is biphasic. Thus, other mechanisms for the effect of increasing extracellular [K+] on adenylyl cyclase were considered. We considered the possibility that the effect of increasing membrane potential on adenylyl cyclase actually reflected the entry of Na+ into the neurons. We reasoned that in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, as membrane potential is increased, voltage-activated Ca2+ channels gate mainly Ca2+, allowing it to flow into neurons. However, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, Na+ would be the predominant charge carrier through these channels, since at low divalent cation concentrations, monovalent cations permeate efficiently through Ca2+ channels (23Lansman J.B. Hess P. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 88: 321-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). As extracellular [K+] is increased relative to [Na+] (e.g. beyond 80 mm), the driving force for Na+ decreases, and less of the cation would enter the cell. Thus, the consequences of incremental increases in the extracellular ratio of [K]:[Na] from 0.03 to 6.25 (viz. 5:145 to 125:20) would be a biphasic response, an increase and then a decrease in intracellular Na+. To explore this possibility, we examined the effect of the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nimodipine, on the cAMP accumulation in response to an elevated extracellular ratio of [K]:[Na]. To confirm that the nimodipine was effective under these conditions, we first examined its actions in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Under such circumstances, increasing extracellular K+ from 5 to 45 mm caused a profound stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 4). In the presence of nimodipine, this effect was largely eliminated. When a similar experiment was performed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the approximately 2-fold stimulation in response to 45 mm K+persisted. However, this effect was eliminated by the inclusion of nimodipine in the assay (Fig. 4). These results establish that Ca2+ entering through L-type channels prominently stimulates cerebellar neuron adenylyl cyclase. They also strongly support our hypothesis that in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, it is the entry of Na+ through the same L-type channels that stimulates cAMP accumulation. To confirm the assumption that nimodipine was exerting its effect as a consequence of blocking L-type channels, the response of fura-2-loaded granule cells to increasing extracellular K+ was examined. Exposure of granule cells to a medium including 40 mmK+ and 1 mm Ca2+ caused an immediate sharp rise in [Ca2+]i, which settled down to an elevated plateau, as long as Ca2+ was retained in the bathing medium (Fig. 5). Inclusion of nimodipine (10 μm) in the medium largely precluded this effect (Fig. 5). Thus, it seems fair to conclude that L-type channels carry cations in response to depolarization by elevated K+ in the granule cells. To separate unequivocally the effect of membrane depolarization from the proposed action of Na+ entry, we used the bacterial pore-forming agent, gramicidin. Gramicidin incorporates into eukaryotic membranes and generates large pores that allow the equilibration of ions on both sides of the membrane and, consequently, is expected to collapse the membrane potential (24Wang K.W. Tripathi S. Hladky S.B. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Granule cells were treated with gramicidin in 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) for 10 min prior to assay in various combinations of Na+and NMDG. As Na+ was increased to 40 mm a clear stimulation in activity was apparent (Fig. 6). Given that the presence of gramicidin brings the membrane potential to zero, this effect of Na+must reflect a direct effect of the cation on the adenylyl cyclase. The present study has explored the possibility that adenylyl cyclase in cultured cerebellar granular cells is regulated by membrane potential. The localization of adenylyl cyclase immunoreactivity noted along the axons and dendrites of these cells, along with the striking concentrations in growth cones, would appear to predispose the enzyme to such regulation. When the cells were depolarized by increasing the external [K]:[Na] ratio, a clear stimulation of cAMP accumulation was observed both in the presence and absence of external Ca2+. However, this stimulation was biphasic, peaking at approximately 45 mm K+ and declining thereafter. Such a biphasic stimulation of cAMP accumulation was incompatible with a simple membrane potential-dependent stimulation, since we were able to show (and as would be predicted by the Nernst equation) that membrane potential increased linearly as a function of increasing the external [K]:[Na] ratio. Nevertheless, it might be argued that the initial stimulatory response to membrane depolarization did reflect a sensitivity to membrane potential and that the loss of the response at higher K+ reflected some additional deleterious effect of high K+. These possibilities are resolved by the observation that, in fact, it is due to the activity of L-type channels that adenylyl cyclase activity is stimulated either in the absence or presence of external Ca2+. Earlier studies had established that primary-cultured cerebellar granule cells (as used in the present study) express predominantly L-type Ca2+ channels at early cell ages (25Harrold J. Ritchie J. Nicholls D. Smith W. Bowman D. Pocock J. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 683-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although neurons from more developed animals show a significant representation of other channel types (26Randall A. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2995-3012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conclusion that it is the entry of cations though L-type channels that stimulates adenylyl cyclase is confirmed by the fact that nimodipine, which exerts no effect on membrane potential, reverses the depolarization-dependent stimulation of cAMP accumulation, either in the absence or presence of extracellular Ca2+. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that gramicidin-generated pores in the membranes permit the membrane potential-independent entry of sodium ions into the cell, which mimics the effect of depolarization. Thus, it must be concluded that it is not membrane potential per se, but membrane potential-driven entry of sodium into cerebellar granular cells that permits the stimulation of cAMP accumulation. It should also be noted that in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, no increase in [Ca2+]i was elicited either by depolarization or the treatment of cerebellar granule cells with gramicidin and Na+ (not shown). Thus, the effect of sodium could not reflect any release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The one earlier suggestion that cerebellar granular cell adenylyl cyclase was sensitive to membrane potential utilized different assay conditions (e.g. extended assay times, 30 min, and hyperosmotic treatments with extracellular KCl) from those used presently (10Reddy R. Smith D. Wayman G. Wu Z. Villacres E.C. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14340-14346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, those data were qualitatively similar to those reported here, and they can readily be incorporated with the present results and interpretation. Thus, although the possibility that mammalian adenylyl cyclase might be sensitive to membrane potential remains attractive, particularly in the light of the complex membrane-insertion profile of adenylyl cyclases, the present data do not support such a prospect. It is possible that the reports of membrane potential sensitivity of adenylyl cyclase from Paramecium and L. pictussperm do indeed reflect sensitivity to membrane potential, since the assays were performed in the absence of either K+ or Na+ (8Schultz J.E. Klumpp S. Benz R. Schurhoff-Goeters W.J. Schmid A. Science. 1992; 255: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Beltran C. Zapata O. Darszon A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7591-7598Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, other functions must be sought for the complex organization of mammalian adenylyl cyclases in membranes. One possibility is a requisite association of adenylyl cyclases with Ca2+ entry channels (27Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 28Fagan K.A. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In nonexcitable cells, Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclases are regulated exclusively by capacitative Ca2+ entry and not at all by nonspecific elevations of Ca2+ in the cytosol. It is possible that adenylyl cyclases are physically associated with Ca2+ channels via the transmembrane regions (28Fagan K.A. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9297-9305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2054877609,"HLA-DM catalyzes the release of invariant chain fragments from newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, stabilizes empty class II molecules, and edits class II-associated peptides by preferentially releasing those that are loosely bound. The ability of HLA-DM to carry out these functionsin vitro is pH dependent, with an optimum at pH 4.5–5.5 and poor activity at pH 7. The structural basis for these properties of HLA-DM is unknown. Sequence homology suggests that HLA-DM resembles classical, peptide-binding MHC class II molecules. In this study, we examined whether HLA-DM has a secondary structure composition consistent with an MHC fold and whether HLA-DM changes conformation between pH 5 and pH 7. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of recombinant soluble HLA-DM (sDM) indicate that HLA-DM belongs to the α/β class of proteins and structurally resembles both MHC class I and class II molecules. The CD peak around 198 nm increases upon going from neutral to endosomal pH and drops sharply upon denaturation below pH 3.5, distinguishing at least three states of sDM: the denatured state and two highly similar folded states. Fluorescence emission spectra show a slight blue-shift and a ≈20% drop in intensity at pH 5 compared with pH 7. Unfolding experiments using guanidinium chloride show that the stability of sDM is somewhat reduced but not lost at pH 5. These results indicate that sDM undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change between neutral and endosomal pH. The change seems to involve both hydrogen bonding patterns and the hydrophobic core of sDM and may contribute to the pH dependence of DM activity. HLA-DM catalyzes the release of invariant chain fragments from newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, stabilizes empty class II molecules, and edits class II-associated peptides by preferentially releasing those that are loosely bound. The ability of HLA-DM to carry out these functionsin vitro is pH dependent, with an optimum at pH 4.5–5.5 and poor activity at pH 7. The structural basis for these properties of HLA-DM is unknown. Sequence homology suggests that HLA-DM resembles classical, peptide-binding MHC class II molecules.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)1 encoded glycoproteins bind antigenic peptides and display them on the surface of antigen-presenting cells for inspection by T lymphocytes bearing αβ antigen receptors. MHC molecules can be divided into class I and class II molecules, which share a common tertiary fold with a characteristic peptide binding groove but differ in their domain connectivity, specificity requirements for peptide, and ability to stimulate selectively CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes, respectively (1Germain R.N. Cell. 1994; 76: 287-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). These highly polymorphic “classical” MHC molecules belong to a larger family, which includes more distantly related and less polymorphic molecules encoded in the class II and class Ib regions of the MHC and elsewhere in the genome (2Stroynowski I. Forman J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Among the functions identified for such “nonclassical” MHC molecules are antigen presentation to unconventional T cells, accessory functions in MHC class II antigen presentation, and other, unrelated functions. Classical MHC class II molecules load peptides in endosomal compartments, and this process is regulated by at least three additional molecules: invariant chain (Ii), HLA-DM, and HLA-DO (3Busch R. Mellins E.D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Jensen P.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R128-R131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ii, which lacks homology to MHC molecules, associates with class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum, facilitates their assembly, and targets them to endosomes. Here, Ii is degraded, leaving Ii-derived peptides in the antigen binding groove (class II-associated Ii peptides, CLIP). CLIP must be released from class II molecules to permit normal binding of endosomal peptides, a process that is accelerated by HLA-DM (5Mellins E. Smith L. Arp B. Cotner T. Celis E. Pious D.

Finally, DM stabilizes class II peptide binding sites against inactivation (25Denzin L.K. Hammond C. Cresswell P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2153-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar,26Kropshofer H. Arndt S.O. Moldenhauer G. Hämmerling G.J. Vogt A.B. Immunity. 1997; 6: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The function of HLA-DO has been studied less extensively, but there is some evidence that it modulates DM function (27Denzin L.K. Sant'Angelo D.B. Hammond C. Surman M.J. Cresswell P.

The intron-exon structure and promoter regions of the DMA and DMB genes that encode DM αβ dimers show similarities to class II α and β chain genes (30Radley E. Alderton R.P. Kelly A. Trowsdale J. Beck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18834-18838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both DMA and DMB cDNAs show weak sequence homology to classical class I and class II MHC molecules (31Kelly A.P. Monaco J.J. Cho S.G. Trowsdale J. Nature. 1991; 353: 571-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 32Cho S.G. Attaya M. Monaco J.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The lowest degree of homology is seen in the membrane-distal domains, which contain the antigen-binding site of classical MHC proteins. Consistent with an MHC-like fold, a Cys residue (Cys-79) in the β1domain of DM, which is conserved among MHC molecules, is important for proper DM folding (33Busch R. Doebele R.C. von Scheven E. Fahrni J. Mellins E.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 734-743PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike classical class II molecules, however, no evidence for peptide binding activity of HLA-DM has been found, raising the possibility that it lacks a ligand binding groove (16Denzin L.K. Cresswell P. Cell. 1995; 82: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar,34Kropshofer H. Hämmerling G.J. Vogt A.B. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which DM alters peptide loading of class II molecules is starting to be elucidated. HLA-DM associates directly with MHC class II molecules (35Sanderson F. Thomas C. Neefjes J. Trowsdale J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); the most stable association seems to be with empty molecules (25Denzin L.K. Hammond C. Cresswell P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2153-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 26Kropshofer H. Arndt S.O. Moldenhauer G. Hämmerling G.J. Vogt A.B. Immunity. 1997; 6: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), but peptide-loaded molecules also may have some affinity for DM (35Sanderson F. Thomas C. Neefjes J. Trowsdale J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). DM accelerates peptide dissociation from MHC class II molecules (15Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 16Denzin L.K. Cresswell P.

Science. 1996; 274: 618-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This result suggests that DM stabilizes an “open” class II conformation without altering interactions between class II specificity pockets and side chains of the bound peptide, perhaps by breaking hydrogen bonds between class II and the peptide (38Roche P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 526-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Antibody-blocking experiments and the characterization of a HLA-DR mutant defective for DM binding suggest that a specific face of the class II molecule is involved in DM interactions (16Denzin L.K. Cresswell P. Cell. 1995; 82: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 24Guerra C.B. Busch R. Doebele R.C. Liu W. Sawada T. Kwok W.W. Chang M.Y. Mellins E.D. J.

Based on hydrophobic dye binding studies, it has been proposed that the interaction involves hydrophobic sites that are buried at the DM-class II interface (40Ullrich H.J. Döring K. Grüneberg U. Jähnig F. Trowsdale J. Van Ham S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13163-13168Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Peptide loading of class II molecules occurs in acidic (pH 4.5–5.5) late endosomal compartments (23Stang E. Guerra C.B. Amaya M. Paterson Y. Bakke O. Mellins E.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4696-4707PubMed Google Scholar, 24Guerra C.B. Busch R. Doebele R.C. Liu W. Sawada T. Kwok W.W. Chang M.Y. Mellins E.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4289-4297PubMed Google Scholar). Structural features of both MHC class II molecules and HLA-DM may contribute to ensuring efficient peptide loading under these conditions. In some instances, titratable side chains at the peptide-MHC class II interface may provide optimal interactions at endosomal pH (41Fremont D.H. Hendrickson W.A. Marrack P. Kappler J. Science. 1996; 272: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition, MHC class II molecules change conformation between pH 7 and pH 5, as shown by spectroscopy and by differential hydrophobic dye binding (42Runnels H. Moore J.C. Jensen P.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 43Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Wettstein D.A. Allbritton N.L. Davis M.M. J. Exp.

The most pronounced rearrangements may occur at sites that are distant from the peptide binding groove (43Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Wettstein D.A. Allbritton N.L. Davis M.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); nevertheless, they are associated with accelerated peptide binding and release at low pH. Not all peptide/MHC class II combinations behave like this; examples of pH-independent peptide binding are not uncommon. Even in these cases, however, peptide binding becomes pH dependent upon adding HLA-DM (15Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). DM binding to class II molecules and its catalytic activity are greater at pH 4.5–5.5 than at neutral pH (15Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 17Sherman M.A. Weber D.A. Jensen P.E.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic dye binding of HLA-DM also increases at pH 5, but the effects seem modest compared with those previously seen for classical class II molecules (28Liljedahl M. Winqvist O. Surh C.D.

Busch, unpublished observations.We therefore wished to determine the nature and extent of any changes in HLA-DM conformation between neutral and endosomal pH. Here, we have used far-ultraviolet circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy to analyze both the secondary structure composition of the lumenal domains of HLA-DM and the effect of pH on their conformation and stability. Drosophila melanogaster-derived S2 cells expressing recombinant soluble HLA-DM (sDM) have been described (15Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Briefly, expression vectors were constructed that contained truncated DMA*0101 and DMB*0101 cDNAs under the control of a metallothionein promoter. For both chains, the transmembrane regions and cytoplasmic tails were replaced by epitope tag sequences, which are recognized by the monoclonal antibodies, M2 and KT3, respectively. A similar strategy was used to generate transfectants expressing full-length DM, as well as full-length and soluble HLA-DR1, all without epitope tags. After transfection and antibiotic selection, highly expressing subclones were isolated, and expression of transfected cDNA was induced in serum-free spinner cultures by adding 1 mmCuSO4. For full-length molecules, cells were harvested after 24 h, washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+/Mg2+, and stored at −80 °C; for soluble molecules, culture supernatant was harvested after 7 days. Insect cell-derived recombinant DR1 was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as described (46Gorga J.C. Horejsi V. Johnson D.R. Raghupathy R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16087-16094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble DR1 was purified similarly, except that concentrated culture supernatants were loaded onto the column and detergent was omitted. For purification of sDM, culture supernatants were centrifuged (3000 × g, 20 min), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mmiodoacetamide were added. Filtered (<0.2 μm) supernatants were passed over a glycine-coupled CNBr-Sepharose column and an M2 immunoaffinity column (Eastman Kodak) connected in series. After washing in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, specifically bound material was eluted from the M2 column using 100 μm FLAG peptide (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys; Eastman Kodak) in wash buffer, and the column was regenerated by alternating 20-min washes in 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.5, and wash buffer. The column eluate was concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Centriprep-30 and Centricon-30, Amicon) and loaded onto a 2 × 30-cm Sephacryl S200-HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was eluted in phosphate-buffered saline. Fractions containing sDM dimer without contaminating proteins were pooled and again concentrated. After a buffer exchange into water, sDM was stored in aliquots at −20 °C. The final yield of pure sDM dimer was approximately 4 mg per liter of culture supernatant. Full-length recombinant DM was affinity purified from S2 cell transformants. A previously described polyclonal antiserum raised to sDM (11323; see Ref. 33Busch R. Doebele R.C. von Scheven E. Fahrni J. Mellins E.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 734-743PubMed Google Scholar for a description of its reactivity) was affinity purified using sDM covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia; 5 mg of sDM per ml of beads) and eluted using 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.0. The affinity-purified immunoglobulin, in turn, was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (2 mg of IgG per ml of beads). A CHAPS (1% w/v) extract from 1010 S2 transformants was applied to the anti-DM affinity column. The column was washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% CHAPS, 150 mm NaCl, and then with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% CHAPS, 500 mm NaCl. DM was eluted with 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.8, 1% CHAPS and immediately neutralized with 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing DM were pooled and further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia). Protein was quantified by Bradford assay and by a DM-specific competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified sDM as a standard, and silver staining of purified full-length DM failed to detect any contaminating proteins (data not shown). The final yield was approximately 0.5 mg of full-length DM per 1010 cells. Fractions from various stages of the purifications were separated by SDS-PAGE (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Total proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and large amounts of protein (up to 20 μg/lane) were loaded to assess purity. Soluble DM α and β chains were identified by immunoblotting using epitope tag-specific mAbs, using previously described protocols (15Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 33Busch R. Doebele R.C. von Scheven E. Fahrni J. Mellins E.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 734-743PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the stability of sDM heterodimers following storage, samples were rerun on a Sephacryl S200-HR column in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) or sodium acetate (pH 5.0) buffers containing 150 mm NaCl. Amino-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation was performed by the Stanford University Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility. The derived amino acid sequences encoded by the sDMA and sDMB were used to calculate an extinction coefficient ε280 = 79270m−1 cm−1 in 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 6 m guanidinium chloride (48Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar, 49Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient of sDM was not affected measurably by the presence or absence of denaturant (data not shown). The calculated extinction coefficient agreed to within 3% with an empirical value derived from quantitative amino acid analysis (performed by the Stanford University Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility) and was used routinely to quantitate sDM by UV spectrophotometry. DM-dependent peptide binding to DR1 was measured essentially as described (15Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 nmrecombinant full-length or soluble HLA-DR1 was allowed to bind 1 μm N-terminally biotinylated HA307–319 peptide in the presence of varying amounts of full-length or soluble recombinant HLA-DM. After incubation in 150 mm sodium citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C for 1 h, HLA-DR molecules were captured on microtiter plates coated with the anti-DR monoclonal antibody, LB3.1. Bound peptide was detected using Eu3+-conjugated streptavidin, which was quantitated by time-resolved fluorescence. A standard curve was generated by serial dilution of DR1 molecules maximally loaded with the biotinylated HA307–319 peptide and fitting to a 4-parameter binding equation, which was used to convert bound fluorescence to percent occupancy. Far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra were acquired on an Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermostatted cuvette, using previously described conditions (44Reich Z. Altman J.D.

Samples contained 100–250 μg/ml sDM in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, or 5 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5. A 1-mm path length cuvette was used, and samples were recovered after analysis and quantitated by UV absorption spectrophotometry as described above. Five CD spectra were acquired using previously described parameters (44Reich Z. Altman J.D. Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Kozono H. Ogg G. Morgan C. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), averaged, and smoothed using a 9-point (2.25 nm) sliding window; the buffer background was then subtracted. For pH titrations, samples were made up in appropriate mixtures of 5 mm sodium phosphate, sodium acetate, and HCl, and the pH of the mixtures was checked after each experiment. A single spectrum was acquired at each pH in 0.5-nm steps with a 5-s averaging time. Estimates for α-helix and β-pleated sheet content were obtained using the program, k2d, (available athttp://columba.ebi.ac.uk:8765/∼andrade/k2d.html) (51Andrade M.A. Chacón P. Merelo J.J. Morán F. Prot. Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 52Merelo J.J. Andrade M.A. Prieto A. Morán F. Neurocomputing. 1994; 6: 443-454Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were acquired at room temperature, using a Hitachi F-4010 spectrofluorimeter with excitation at 280 nm. Samples of sDM (50–1000 nm) were prepared in filtered (0.2 μm) 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7) or acetate (pH 5) buffers with or without 150 mmNaCl or 6 m guanidinium chloride and analyzed in a 1 × 1-cm path length cuvette. Emission scans were performed at ambient temperature (23 °C) at 0.5 nm/s with a 2-s averaging time and 4-nm bandwidth for both excitation and emission. Background fluorescence from buffer alone was subtracted. Denaturant titrations were done in a thermostatted cuvette (25 °C) by slowly adding increasing amounts of buffered 6 m guanidinium chloride to rapidly stirred solutions containing 250 nm sDM and 20 mmphosphate (pH 7) or acetate (pH 5) buffer. In the unfolding transition region, progress of the unfolding reaction was followed by measuring fluorescence emission at 350 nm over time, or by repetitive scanning, and spectra were recorded after completion of the reaction. Reversibility was tested by diluting fully denatured samples (2m guanidinium chloride) back to nondenaturing guanidinium chloride concentrations and following fluorescence emission at 350 nm. After correction for background and dilution effects, limiting slope corrections were applied to fluorescence intensities at 350 nm to estimate the relative amounts of native and unfolded sDM, assuming an irreversible one-step conversion from a native to an unfolded conformation. For spectroscopic characterization, recombinant-soluble HLA-DM (sDM) was purified from supernatants of transfectedDrosophila cells, using epitope tag affinity chromatography and gel filtration (Fig. 1 A). Gel filtration separated heterodimeric sDM from high molecular weight aggregates containing contaminating proteins, as shown by Coomassie Blue staining of overloaded native (data not shown) and SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 1 A). The SDS gels were overrun to resolve sDM chains as a closely spaced multiplet of bands, which were assigned as either α or β chains by Western blotting with mAbs to the C-terminal epitope tags (Fig. 1 B). Thus, all the material in sDM dimer fractions could be accounted for by sDM α and β chains. N-terminal sequencing of sDM dimers yielded two simultaneous sequences, VPEAPTPMWPDDLQ and FVAHVESTXLLDDAG, consistent with signal sequence cleavage after residue 26 of immature DM α and after residue 20 of immature DM β, respectively (counting from the initiating Met). Note that the mature β chain N terminus is two residues downstream from the beginning of the β1 domain predicted by Kellyet al. (31Kelly A.P. Monaco J.J. Cho S.G. Trowsdale J. Nature. 1991; 353: 571-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This may be due to incorrect prediction of signal sequence cleavage or limited proteolysis during or after secretion. As the N termini seemed homogeneous by sequencing and all bands resolved by SDS-PAGE contained the C-terminal epitope tags, the size heterogeneity of both chains seen by SDS-PAGE likely was a result of heterogeneous covalent modifications, such as glycosylation. By gel filtration, sDM remained an αβ heterodimer after storage at −20 °C, both at pH 7 (Fig. 1 C) and pH 5 (data not shown). In conclusion, our sDM preparations were of sufficient purity and quality for spectroscopic analysis. We have shown previously that sDM catalyzes release of CLIP"

Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Vol. 104. Springer Verlag, New York1993Google Scholar). Three major types of opioid receptors have been identified and cloned, namely the μ (MOR), δ (DOR), and κ (KOR), opioid receptors (2Kieffer B.L. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). ORs belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (3Standifer K.M. Pasternak G.W. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) modulating endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal functions. While all three ORs mediate opioid-induced analgesia, each receptor type displays a distinct pharmacological profile and a unique cell-type specific distribution pattern (4Goldstein A. Naidu A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mansour A. Khachaturian H. Lewis M.E. Akil H. Watson S.J. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 308-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Distinct molecular mechanisms probably coordinate the temporal and spatial expression of each receptor, but little is known of the regulatory elements and their associated transcription factors involved in the restricted expression of ORs. In general, the localization of the ORs coincides with the pharmacological actions of the opioids (4Goldstein A. Naidu A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of DOR, there is also a good correlation between the presence of DOR mRNA and δ-agonist binding sites (6Mansour A. Fox C.A. Burke S. Meng F. Thompson R.C. Akil H. Watson S.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 350: 412-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Although DOR is found in the peripheral nervous system and also in some immune cells, it is mainly confined to the central nervous system, in various densities at different regions of the brain (5Mansour A. Khachaturian H. Lewis M.E. Akil H. Watson S.J. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 308-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of DOR is also tightly controlled during development. DOR appears later than MOR and KOR; in fact, DOR is not detectable prior to the postnatal stages of development, and even then its emergence lags behind than that of MOR and KOR (7Zhu Y. Hsu M. Pintar J.E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2538-2549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of DOR mRNA or of δ-agonist binding sites can also be regulated by certain inducers in some cell lines. For example, DOR mRNA can be up-regulated by nerve growth factor (8Abood M.E. Tao Q. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 1566-1573PubMed Google Scholar), ethanol (9Jenab S. Inturrisi C.E. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 47: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), or retinoic acid (10Beczkowska I.W. Buck J. Inturrisi C.E. Brain Res. Bull. 1996; 39: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, a reduction of DOR mRNA was also observed in the presence of prostaglandin E1, forskolin, or cyclic AMP analogue (11Gylys K.H. Tran N. Magendzo K. Zaki P. Evans C.J. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2369-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Finally, DOR levels may be altered in certain disease states, such as inflammation (12Sharp B.M. Shahabi N. McKean D. Li M.D. McAllen K. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 78: 198-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and lung cancer (13Schreiber G. Campa M.J. Prabhakar S. O'Briant K. Bepler G. Patz Jr., E.F. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 1787-1792PubMed Google Scholar). All of these studies, together with the heterogeneity of the cell-type specific distribution, suggest that the spatial and temporal expression of DOR is under strict control, able to respond to specific physiological and pathological parameters. Therefore, to understand the molecular mechanism of the restricted expression pattern of DOR will be helpful to gain insights of its functions corresponding to different development status and physiological settings. We previously reported isolation of mouse genomic clones of DOR, from which we determined two major transcription initiation sites, the exon-intron structure and 1.3-kb 5′-flanking sequence (14Augustin L.B. Feisheim R.F. Min B.H. Fuchs S.M. Fuchs J.A. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The isolation and partial analysis of mouse genomic DNA of DOR has made it possible to study regulatory elements of the DOR gene. A 1.3-kb DNA fragment upstream from the translation start site (−1300 to +1 bp, with the translation start site designated as +1) of the DOR 5′-flanking region was sequenced and its sequence analyzed by sequence comparison with the Transcription Factors Database (15Ghosh D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3117-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This analysis indicated that the DOR gene has the features of a typical “housekeeping” gene. Thus, it lacks a classical TATA box, and there is no CCAAT box or a consensus initiator (16Gill G. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 18Javahery R. Khachk A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). However, the promoter region of the DOR gene is rich in G+C content and possesses several putative GC boxes. It has been suggested that the GC box is the binding site for members of the Sp1 transcription factor family (19Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 20Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 21Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). It is also known that Sp1 is important for both TATA and TATA-less promoters by interacting with TFIID (21Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) and involved in the transcription regulation of some cell- or tissue-specific genes (53Korner M. Rattner A. Mauxion F. Sen R. Citri Y. Neuron. 1989; 3: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 54Pecorino L.T. Darrow A.L. Strickland S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5579-5586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, to define the basal promoter of the DOR gene will be the foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanism of DOR expression. Here, we report a functional analysis of the DOR promoter region in NS20Y, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line that constitutively expresses DOR. Using in vivo functional assays and in vitro protein-DNA binding assays, we have defined a minimal DOR promoter. We also demonstrate that the functional necessity of a putative Sp1 binding site as well as an E box for the transcription activation of DOR. We show that the E box and GC box, as well as the simultaneous binding and functional synergy between their associated factors, are crucial for the promoter activity of the DOR gene. Luciferase fusion plasmids were constructed containing 1300 bp of upstream regulatory sequence (pD1300 construct; −1300 to +1 bp related to the translation start site as +1) or shorter upstream regulatory sequences of the mouse DOR gene. The pD1300 construct was created by ligating the 1300-bp fragment from the DOR promoter region with Sac I and Nco I sites into a promoterless and enhancerless luciferase vector, pGL3-basic (Promega). The 5′-deletion (pD890, pD675, pD262, pD182, and pD150) and 3′-deletion (pD1300/150, pD1300/182, pD1300/262, and pD1300/675) constructs were generated by restriction digestion, blunt-ended by fill-in reaction, and religation. The 5′-deletion construct pD210 and the 3′-deletion construct pD1300/232 were prepared by recombinant polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with all of the upstream primers bearing the Kpn I site and the downstream primers bearing theNco I site. The PCR products were subcloned intoKpn I and Nco I sites of the pGL3-basic vector, and the correct clones were confirmed by sequencing. The pD262/141 and pD141/262 constructs were prepared by PCR amplification of the DOR promoter fragment −262 to −141 with primers bearing aHin dIII site. Then the PCR products were digested withHin dIII and cloned into the Hin dIII site of the pGL3-basic vector. The correct clones of pD262/141 and pD141/262 were determined by sequencing. A Hin dIII linker mutation was introduced into the pD262 construct by PCR to generate a series of linker mutation constructs throughout the DOR promoter region (from −262 to −137). The mutated DOR promoter fragments (−262 to +1) of mutant constructs were sequenced and subcloned into pGL3-basic withNco I and Kpn I to generate linker scan mutant constructs pDm262 through pDm142. Each mutation construct in the linker scan analysis was designated by the position of the 5′-end nucleotide of its mutated sequence. Thus pDm262 represents the mutation construct containing the mutated sequence (AAGCTT) at positions −262 to −257; all other linker scan mutant constructs (pDm) contain the mutated sequence in the six nucleotides beginning with the indicated number. The double mutation construct, pD262Sp*/E*, was created using PCR to introduce a second Hin dIII linker into pDm226 and to replace the E box (CACGTG) with AAGCTT sequence. All of the mutation constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mouse neuroblastoma NS20Y cells were grown in DMEM medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 90% air at 37 °C. Schneider's Drosophila line 2 (SL2) cells were grown at 22–24 °C in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. NS20Y cells were transfected using the DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) lipofection method as described previously (22Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells at approximately 40% confluence were transfected with an equimolar amount of each test plasmid. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells grown to confluence were washed and lysed with lysis buffer (Promega). To control for differences in transfection efficiency from dish to dish, a one-fifth molar ratio of pCH110 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing the β-galactosidase gene driven by the SV40 promoter was included in each transfection and used for normalization. Drosophila SL2 cells were transfected with CellFECTINTM (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described in our previous report (23Ko J.L. Liu H.C. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each transfection, test plasmid and CellFECTIN were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, before adding to SL2 cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed and lysed. Normalization of the samples in the SL2 transient transfection followed the method described by Conn et. al. (24Conn K.J. Rich C.B.

The luciferase and β-galactosidase activities of each lysate were determined as described by the manufacturers (Promega and Tropix, respectively). Nuclear extracts were prepared from NS20Y cells using the method described by Johnson et. al (25Johnson D.R. Levant S. Bale A.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 105-192Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to confluence, harvested, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. All of the following steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in sucrose buffer (0.32m sucrose, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The lysate was microcentrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to pellet the nuclei, which were washed with sucrose buffer without Nonidet P-40. The nuclei were resuspended in low salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.02 m KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF), followed by addition of high salt buffer to extract the nuclei, with incubation for 20 min on a rotary platform. Diluent (2.5 vol. of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mmPMSF) was added and the sample was microcentrifuged at 13,690 ×g for 15 min. Aliquots of the supernatant (nuclear extract) were stored at −80 °C. EMSA was performed with 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides that were incubated with nuclear extract in EMSA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)). For oligonucleotide competition analysis, a 100-fold (or as indicated in figures) molar excess of competitor oligonucleotides was also added to the mixture. After incubation at 22 °C for 30 min, the mixture was analyzed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. For antibody supershift assays, 1 μl of monoclonal antibodies to Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, Sp4, USF1, USF2, or c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to the mixture. The reaction was then incubated on ice for 1 h. Protein-DNA complexes and free DNA were fractionated on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 1× Tris-glycine EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 380 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA) at 4 °C and were visualized by autoradiography. In order to identify the functional DOR promoter and elucidate the regulatory elements of the DOR gene, serial deletional analyses were performed with the 1.3-kb DNA fragment from upstream regulatory region of the DOR gene (Fig.1 A ). A primary reporter construct and its serial deletion constructs were prepared from this 1.3-kb DNA fragment as described under “Materials and Methods.” This primary construct, designated as pD1300, and its serial 5′-deletion constructs, designated as pD890, pD675, pD262, pD210, pD182, and pD150, are illustrated in Fig. 1 B . The pGL3-basic plasmid (designated as basic ), containing no promoter and no enhancer, was included as a negative control, while the pGL3-control plasmid (designated as control ) containing the SV40 promoter and SV40 enhancer was used as the positive control. The promoter activity of each construct was tested by transient transfection assays in NS20Y cells, a DOR-expressing neuronal cell line. As shown in Fig. 1 B , the luciferase reporter constructs with different 5′-ends from −1300 to −262 showed similar luciferase activities, with relatively minor variation. However, a dramatic decrease (more than 50%) in luciferase activity was seen with the 5′-end deletion construct pD210. Moreover, two deletion constructs with 5′-end deletion down to −182 and −150, respectively, displayed luciferase activity reduced to that of the pGL3-basic. Thus, these data indicated that the sequence from −262 to +1 is sufficient to express full promoter activity for the DOR gene. In addition to 5′-serial deletional analysis of the DOR promoter, a 3′-serial deletional analysis was also carried out to define the minimum core promoter of the DOR gene. As shown in Fig. 2, a construct containing a 3′-deletion of −150 to +1 of the DOR promoter region (designated as pD1300 /150 ) did not affect activity of the DOR promoter. However, a deletion of up to −182 (pD1300 /182 ) sharply reduced DOR promoter activity. Further 3′-end deletions of the DOR promoter region (constructs pD1300/232, pD1300/262, and pD1300/675) resulted in a still greater and ultimately total loss of DOR promoter activity (Fig. 2). Based on the combined data from the 3′- and 5′- serial deletional analyses (Figs. 1 B and 2), the DOR promoter sequence from −262 to −150 provided more than 90% of the DOR promoter activity. Thus the sequence from −262 to −150 appeared to be essential for displaying the DOR promoter activity. Accordingly, a pair of DOR promoter constructs was created with the DOR promoter sequence from −262 to −141 in either orientation. The region of −262 to −141 includes a major transcription initiation site (Fig. 1 A ) and promoter activity of this region was examined. Surprisingly, both constructs were active in NS20Y cells (Fig. 2), although the promoter activity of the construct pD262/141 (in native orientation) was about 3-fold more active than that of the construct pD141/262 (with DOR promoter sequence in reverse orientation). Taken together, these results indicated that the promoter sequence between −262 and −141 is necessary and sufficient to provide the DOR promoter activity in both orientations but of different magnitude in NS20Y cells. In order to localize the important cis elements for regulation of the DOR promoter, a series of linker scan mutations throughout the minimum DOR promoter region (−262 to −141) of the pD262 construct were performed. This construct was used because, as discussed earlier, this was the largest 5′-end deletion retaining full promoter activity. The promoter activities of these linker-mutated constructs were examined, with several mutant constructs displaying impaired promoter activities (TableI).Table ILinker scan analysis defines two crucial elements of the DOR promoterConstructsRelative activityConstructsRelative activityConstructsRelative activity%%%pD262100 ± 13pDm22058 ± 7pDm17877 ± 9pDm26298 ± 12pDm21467 ± 8pDm17285 ± 8pDm256103 ± 18pDm20876 ± 10pDm16697 ± 15pDm250114 ± 16pDm20294 ± 12pDm16090 ± 18pDm24490 ± 12pDm196128 ± 20pDm154105 ± 15pDm238120 ± 15pDm190*14 ± 4pDm14892 ± 13pDm23279 ± 12pDm184*7 ± 3pDm14291 ± 17pDm226*35 ± 5The DOR promoter region (from −262 to −137) was mutated withHin dIII linker (AAGCTT) at 6-bp intervals by using the PCR-based oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with the pD262 as DNA template.

By comparing the sequences of the mutated region from the mutant constructs exhibiting reduced promoter activities to the consensus sequences of known transcription factors, two putative binding sites of known transcription factors were identified from three mutant constructs that showed more than 60% decrease in promoter activities (Table I, pDm226, pDm190, and pDm184). One of these binding sites was a GC box (shown in Fig. 3 A ,underlined ), which is the putative binding site for transcription factors of the Sp1 family (19Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 20Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G.

Mutation of this GC box (pDm226) resulted in about 65% decrease in promoter activity of that of the wild type DOR promoter in NS20Y cells (Fig.3 A ). In order to identify the transcription factors bound to this GC box of the DOR promoter, EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts prepared from NS20Y cells. The oligonucleotide D232/215, representing the DOR promoter sequence from −232 to −215, which includes the putative binding site for the Sp1 family (Fig. 3 B ,D232/215 , underlined ), was used as the probe. Three major bands representing protein-DNA complexes were observed in the presence of the nuclear extracts (Fig. 3 C ,lane 2 , arrowheads c–e ). These three complexes were all sequence-specific, because formation of all of them could be prevented by the presence of unlabeled D232/215 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C ,lanes 3–5 ). Competition with the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 B ) also blocked the formation of the protein-DNA complexes c–e in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 C , lanes 6–8 ). However, formation of these three bands was not affected by using the Dm226 oligonucleotide, which contained the same sequence as D232/215 except the GC box was replaced by the linker sequence AAGCTT (Fig. 3 B ,Dm226 , boldface ), as the competitor (Fig.3 C , lanes 9 and 10 ). These results suggest that Sp1 or Sp1-like factors bind to the DOR GC box. At least four transcription factors, Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4, are known to belong to the Sp family (19Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 20Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 21Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). In order to identify those members binding to the DOR GC box, immunosupershift assays were carried out with Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, or Sp4 antibodies (Abs). As shown in Fig.3 C , the protein-DNA complex band c was retarded by anti-Sp1 Ab to the position of band b (Fig. 3 C , lane 11 , arrow b ). The anti-Sp3 Ab could recognize both bands d and e, shifting both bands to a higher position, band a (Fig. 3 C , lane 13 ,broken arrow a ). Furthermore, all three bands, c, d, and e, could be converted to bands a and b in the presence of both anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 Abs (Fig. 3 C ,lane 15 ). It was of interest that the amount of band b, the Sp1-D232/215 complex, recognized by anti-Sp1 Ab was more abundant than that of band a, the Sp3-D232/215 complex detected by anti-Sp3 Ab (Fig. 3 C , lanes 11 ,13 , and 15 , bands a andb ). However, none of the bands was recognized by either anti-Sp2 or anti-Sp4 Ab (Fig. 3 C , lanes 12 and 14 ). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the GC box of the DOR promoter is the binding site for the Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors. Mutation of this site resulted in eliminating the binding of both Sp1 and Sp3 to the DOR promoter and diminished the DOR promoter activity. It has been reported that the Sp1 transcription factor plays a critical role in the basal transcription of several genes with TATA-less promoters (16Gill G. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). In order to demonstrate that the Sp1 factor activates the DOR promoter via direct interaction with the DOR GC box in vivo , we performed cotransfection assays inDrosophila SL2 cells, which do not express endogenous Sp1 protein (26Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, co-transfection assays using the Sp1 expression vector and pD262 DOR promoter construct in Drosophila SL2 cells demonstrated that Sp1 can specifically activate the promoter of the pD262 construct in a dose-dependent manner. Mutation of the DOR GC box (construct pDm226) diminished this trans -activation of the DOR promoter by Sp1 (Fig. 4). Thus, we concluded that Sp1 not only binds to the GC box of the DOR promoter in vitro but also in this manner trans -activates the DOR promoter in vivo . However, mutation of the GC box did not completely eliminate DOR promoter activity in SL2 cells, which might be due to the binding of overexpressed Sp1 protein to unidentified low affinity sites within the DOR promoter region. As noted earlier, two putative binding sites of known transcription factors were identified in the DOR promoter region by linker scanning and sequence comparison. In addition to the GC box, a second binding site was an E box (Fig.5 A , underlined ), which is a putative binding site for the transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH/LZ) family (27Marco K.B. Bossone S.A. Patel A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 809-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In NS20Y cells, mutations of the E box in the DOR promoter region (pDm190, pDm184) abolished more than 80% of the promoter activity exhibited by the wild type construct pD262 (Fig. 5 A ). In contrast, a promoter construct (pDm178) retained most of the promoter activity while its E box was intact (Fig. 5 A ). Several members of the bHLH/LZ family are able to bind to the sequence (-CACGTG-) of the E box (26Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Therefore, by using EMSA, we tested several members of this family as candidates for binding to the promoter E box of DOR gene. These included c-Myc (28Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N.

In contrast, after expression of the pituitary-specific transcription factor GHF-1, thyroid hormone and retinoic acid produce a stimulation similar to that found in pituitary cells. Therefore, GHF-1 changes a ligand-dependent inhibition into a ligand-dependent activation. The essential role of GHF-1 on the rat growth hormone promoter was also demonstrated with AF-2-defective T3 receptor mutants that show a normal activation of this promoter in the presence of GHF-1. Furthermore, a truncated T3 receptor, which lacks the N-terminus and the DNA binding domain, was able to stimulate this promoter in the presence of GHF-1 and exogenous RXR receptors, suggesting the importance of protein to protein interactions in this regulation. This study shows that the final transcriptional effect depends not only on the type of regulatory promoter response elements but also on the presence of other transcriptional activators, in the case of the growth hormone promoter, the tissue-specific transcription factor GHF-1, which plays a coactivator-like role in this promoter.

Rev. 1993; 14: 670-689PubMed Google Scholar). The proximal rGH promoter contains DNA binding sequences for the pituitary-specific transcription factor GHF-1/Pit-1 at nucleotides −65 to −95 and −107 to −137 (2Bodner M. Castrillo J.L. Theill L.E.

Nature. 1989; 339: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The effects of T3 and RA are mediated by nuclear receptors (TRs and RARs) that bind to specific hormone response elements, preferentially as heterodimers with the RXRs (8Forman B.M. Casanova J.

The rGH promoter contains a positive TRE/RARE located at −167 to −190 bp upstream of the transcription start site, which appears to mediate the stimulation by T3 (11Brent G.A. Harney J.W. Chen Y. Warne R.L. Moore D.D. Larsen P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1996-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and RA (12Garcı́a-Villalba P. Au-Fleigner M. Samuels H.H. Aranda A. Biochem. Biophys.

Biol. 1996; 16: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The importance of this sequence in vivo is shown by studies with transgenic mice which have demonstrated that the two GHF-1 binding sites are necessary, but not sufficient, for efficient transcriptional activation of the rGH gene promoter. Inclusion of the sequences containing the TRE/RARE in the transgene markedly enhances somatotroph-specific rGH expression suggesting the existence of synergistic interactions between GHF-1 and this element (4Lira S.A. Kalla K.A. Glass C.K. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 694-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).

Palomino T. Güell A. Castrilló J.L. Aranda A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This cooperation involves direct protein to protein interactions between the RXR/TR and RXR/RAR heterodimers and the pituitary factor (17Palomino, T., Sanchez-Pacheco, A., Peña, P., and Aranda, A. (1998) FASEB J., in pressGoogle Scholar). In addition to the stimulation of GH promoter constructs containing the positive TRE, T3 has been described to inhibit the activity of constructs containing only the proximal rGH promoter sequences in pituitary cells (18Wight P.A. Crew M.D. Spindler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5659-5663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of T3 appears to be mediated by a negative TRE which overlaps the TATA box. (19Crone D.E. Kim H.S. Spindler S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10851-10856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation by nuclear receptors is achieved through autonomous activation functions (AFs). A constitutive N-terminal AF-1 and a ligand-dependent AF-2 located in the C-terminal region of the ligand binding domain (20Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 21Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Ligand binding induces a structural modification in helix 12 of the ligand binding domain, which contains the AF-2 (22Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Although most TREs mediate repression in the absence of T3due to receptor binding of nuclear co-repressors that are released upon ligand binding (27Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J.

Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar), depending on the cell type and the nature of the response element, binding of unliganded receptors can also lead to a constitutive activation of gene transcription (29Saatcioglou F. Deng T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Tomic-Canic M. Day D. Samuels H.H. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1416-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this respect it has been reported that transient overexpression of unliganded TR stimulates transcription from rGH promoter constructs in pituitary cell lines (31Forman B.M. Yang C. Au M. Casanova J. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1610-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 32Helmer E.B. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of GHF-1 and TR and RAR to the regulation of the rGH promoter in the present study we employed a heterologous cellular system and performed transient cotransfection assays with GHF-1 and wild type and mutant receptors to avoid the problem of endogenous expression in pituitary cell lines. Our results show both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent actions of TR and RAR on the GH promoter and demonstrate that GHF-1 has a unique regulatory potential in T3- and RA-dependent transactivation of this promoter that was not anticipated, suggesting a coactivator-like role of GHF-1 in TR- and RAR-mediated functions. GH-CAT constructs containing 5′ deletions (−530 and −145) of the rat GH promoter have been obtained from the previously described constructs (33Flug F. Copp R.P. Casanova J. Horowitz Z.D. Janocko L.

The construct −Δ39GH-CAT was generated by ligation of a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the −39/+12 bp sequence of the rat GH promoter into the polylinker region of the pUC8 vector. In the plasmids −Δ530GH-CAT, −Δ145GH-CAT, and −Δ39GH-CAT, the AP-1 site of the pUC vectors was removed by digestion with NdeI and Eco0109. This treatment deletes a 195-bp fragment from the pUC vectors. Deletions were confirmed by sequencing. Reporter constructs containing positive TRE elements, DR-4 TK-CAT and ΔMMTV-TREGH-CAT, have been described previously (13Garcia-Villalba P. Jimenez-Lara A. Aranda A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35Umesono K. Giguere V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 336: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmids CMV-LUC and −73Col-LUC (36Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar) contain the cytomegalovirus and collagenase promoters, respectively, fused to the luciferase gene. Expression vectors for RAR, RXR, and TR contain the cDNA sequences of the α form of the human retinoic acid receptor (hRARα), the human RXR α, and the α1 form of chick TR (21Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 31Forman B.M. Yang C. Au M. Casanova J. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol.

The expression vectors for the mutants chick TRα (E401Q, E401K, C1, K232I) and TR-(120–408) were previously described (21Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 31Forman B.M. Yang C. Au M. Casanova J. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1610-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The expression vector for GHF-1 contains the cDNA sequence of this transcription factor under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (38Theill L.E. Castrillo J.L. Wu D. Karin M. Nature. 1989; 342: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and plated 24 h prior to transfection into 60-mm dishes (400,000 cells/dish). The cells were then transfected with calcium phosphate with 10 μg of the reporter plasmid (plus 100 ng of a luciferase internal control plasmid). The amounts of expression vectors for the corresponding transcription factors used are shown in the legend of the corresponding figures. The total amount of DNA from each transfection was kept equal by addition of the corresponding empty expression vectors (RSV-0 and pSG5–0). Treatments with 1 μm RA and 100 nm T3 were administered in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% AG1-X8 resin-charcoal stripped newborn calf serum. After 48 h, CAT activity was determined and quantified. Each experiment was repeated at least twice with similar relative differences in regulated expression. Gel retardation assays were carried out with highly purified preparations of TR, RAR, and RXR obtained from vaccinia. As probes we used an oligonucleotide corresponding to −39/+12 bp of the rat GH promoter (5′-CTGCAGGTAGGGTATAAAAAGGGCATGCAAGGGACCAAGTCCAGCACCCCTCGAG-3′) or to the T3 and RA palindromic responsive element TREpal (5′-AGCTCTAGGTCATGACCTGA-3′). For the binding assays the purified proteins were incubated on ice for 15 min in a buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 13% glycerol) containing 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and then for 20–30 min at room temperature with approximately 70,000 cpm of double-stranded oligonucleotide end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4-polynucleotide kinase. For competition experiments the excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides indicated in the figure was added to the binding reaction. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE buffer. The gels were then dried and autoradiographed. Although expression of the GH gene is restricted to pituitary cells, a measure of promoter activity was routinely obtained in non-pituitary HeLa cells. When the plasmid −530GH-CAT was transfected along with an expression vector for TRα, a strong ligand-independent stimulation of transcription was observed (Fig. 1 A, left panel). This activation was similar to that induced by the expression of GHF-1. Unexpectedly, both in the presence and absence of GHF-1, T3 treatment strongly repressed the activity of this construct, which contains the positive TRE located at −190/−167. A constitutive activation by unliganded TR, which was reversed by T3, was also displayed by the −145GH-CAT construct (Fig. 1 B, left panel), which lacks the TRE, indicating that this element is not involved in T3-independent transactivation and that the putative binding site mediating this effect is located within the first 145 bp of the promoter. Transfection of RXR alone produced no effect in the activity of the rGH fragments tested (data not shown) and had only a slight additive effect in T3-independent activation of the −530GH-CAT construct, suggesting that endogenous RXR levels in HeLa cells are sufficient for promoter stimulation. Expression of GHF-1 produced an additive stimulatory effect on the constitutive TR-mediated transactivation, and the level of promoter activity achieved by pUC rGH constructs when GHF-1, TR, and RXR were supplied was greater than that produced by each factor alone. Since the pUC plasmids contain an AP-1-like sequence (39Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Duncan K.G. López G. Schaufele F. Uht R.M. Weeb P. West B.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 405-407PubMed Google Scholar) and liganded TR has been reported to repress AP-1 activity (40Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we tested the regulation of plasmids in which the AP-1 site has been deleted (hereafter designated with the prefix Δ). The resulting plasmids also displayed a strong ligand-independent activation by TR, but they were only weakly stimulated by GHF-1 (Fig. 1, right panels). In the absence of GHF-1, the −Δ530GH-CAT construct showed a T3-dependent repression of transcription to levels near its basal activity. A most interesting finding was that GHF-1 was able to revert this repression, because in cells cotransfected with TR and GHF-1 T3 induced a strong positive response similar to that observed in pituitary cells, where T3 stimulates GH gene transcription (Fig. 1,right panel). These observations indicate that, indeed, T3 inhibition of the −530GH-CAT construct in cells expressing GHF-1 was mediated by an element of the pUC plasmid backbone. TR requires not only the presence of GHF-1, but also binding to the positive TRE surrounding the −180 position to mediate T3-dependent stimulation of GH promoter in HeLa cells, because the activity of the shorter construct (−Δ145GH-CAT) was inhibited by T3 both in the presence and absence of cotransfected GHF-1 (Fig. 1 B, right panel). Additionally, cooperation between GHF-1 and TR in the absence of ligand was no longer observed in constructs lacking the AP-1 binding site, suggesting that this sequence contributes to the T3-independent interaction between TR and GHF-1. Fig. 2 illustrates the effect of varying the amounts of the TR (0.5–4 μg) in the presence and absence of GHF-1 on the activity of the Δ constructs. The constitutive effect of TR was dose-responsive, and the presence of GHF-1 did not increase T3-independent transactivation at any of the concentrations examined. In all cases, T3 produced a strong inhibitory effect in the absence of GHF-1. However, in the presence of GHF-1, T3 treatment caused a strong synergistic stimulation of the −Δ530GH-CAT plasmid at all TR concentrations (left panel). These results corroborate that TR-GHF-1 synergistic interaction on the activation of GH promoter is dependent on the presence of hormone. As shown in the right panel, T3 had a repressive effect on the activity of the −Δ145GH-CAT construct independently of the presence of GHF-1. Fig. 3shows that when the −530GH-CAT and −Δ530GH-CAT constructs were transfected along with an expression vector for RAR, a ligand-independent activation was also observed. Incubation with RA inhibited the activity of the −530GH-CAT plasmid both in the absence and presence of GHF-1 (left panel). As compared with TR, RAR was less potent in inducing a constitutive activation of the promoter, and the repressive effect of RA was also weaker than that elicited by T3. In the construct lacking the AP-1 site, the activation by RAR was further enhanced by RA only when GHF-1 was cotransfected. Therefore, the pituitary-specific transcription factor also appears to be required for ligand-dependent stimulation of the GH promoter by RA receptors. To identify the promoter region that mediates the ligand-independent effect of TR and RAR, we performed transient transfection experiments with a shorter rGH promoter fragment (−Δ39GH-CAT). Fig. 4 shows that the increased CAT activity of the −Δ530GH-CAT construct observed in TR- and RAR-transfected cells was again observed with this shorter construct. In addition, inhibition of reporter gene expression by the liganded receptors was also consistently observed. Fig. 4 Cdemonstrates that a construct containing a consensus TATA sequence is not affected by TR or RAR coexpression. These data suggest that ligand-independent stimulation of the rGH promoter could be mediated by the previously described negative TRE which overlaps the TATA box (19Crone D.E. Kim H.S. Spindler S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10851-10856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5 A shows in vitro binding of TR, alone or in combination with RXR, to the −39/+1 rGH promoter fragment. TR bound weakly to this sequence mostly in monomeric form, but heterodimerization with RXR significantly enhanced binding. Similarly, RXR greatly increased binding of RAR to this promoter fragment (not illustrated). Panels B and C compare affinity of TR/RXR and RAR/RXR heterodimers for the TATA-associated TRE and for the palindromic TRE (TREpal), a strong binding element for T3 receptors that also binds RA receptors. Binding of TR/RXR and RAR/RXR to both the −39/+1 rGH promoter fragment and the TREpal was more efficiently competed by an excess of unlabeled palindromic element than by the TATA-associated element, showing that the latter is a weaker binding element.Figure 5Binding of TR/RXR and RAR/RXR to the TATA-associated TRE of the rat GH promoter. A, the labeled rGH promoter fragment −39/+1 was incubated with recombinant TR, RXR, or the combination of both. The mobility of TR monomers (m), RXR dimers (d), and TR/RXR heterodimers is indicated by arrows. B, the same labeled fragment was incubated with TR/RXR or RAR/RXR alone or in the presence of an excess amount (25×) of the same oligonucleotide or the palindromic element TREpal as indicated. C, the gel retardation assay was performed as in panel B but with a labeled TREpal oligonucleotide. The sequences of both oligonucleotides are shown at the bottom of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Different mutations in helix 12 of the LBD that have been described to impair ligand-dependent activation (21Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) were used to analyze the role of the AF-2 domain in the regulation of the rGH promoter by TR. Fig. 6 A shows that a TR carrying a point mutation at position 401 (E401Q) did not mediate a substantial repressive effect of T3 on the −Δ530GH-AT plasmid in the absence of GHF-1. However, when GHF-1 was cotransfected along with this mutant TR, a normal T3-dependent transactivation was observed. This unexpected finding suggests that GHF-1 reverts the deleterious effect of this mutation in the interaction with putative coactivators and/or a coactivator-like intermediary role of GHF-1 in rGH promoter regulation. Fig. 6 A also shows that a thyroid hormone receptor (C1), carrying the same AF-2 deletion (9 amino acids) as that found in v-erbA, failed to repress −Δ530GH-CAT activity in response to T3. This mutant, as well as another point mutant TR (E401K) (data not shown) also lost the ability to activate ligand-dependent transcription in the presence of GHF-1, probably due to their greatly reduced ligand binding affinity (21Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The results obtained with the rGH promoter fragment lacking the positive TRE (−Δ145GH-CAT) are shown in Fig. 6 B. The wild-type receptor mediated a strong ligand-dependent inhibition of this reporter, and T3 had a diminished ability to repress the activation induced by the unliganded E401Q receptor. These data suggest a putative role of the AF-2 domain in T3-dependent inhibition, because mutations that affect this ligand-dependent activation function also affect T3-dependent repression of the rGH promoter in HeLa cells. Finally, results shown in Fig. 6 show that mutations in the AF-2 domain had no effect on ligand-independent activation by TR. Other T3-responsive reporters were used to characterize the functional properties of the AF-2 TR mutants in HeLa cells. TR mediated a ligand-independent repression of constructs containing positive TREs (ΔMMTV-TREGH-CAT and DR4-TK-CAT), and this repression was reversed by T3 (Fig. 7, A and B). The unliganded mutant TRs showed a strong repressive effect, but T3-mediated activation was significantly impaired in the E401Q TR and absent in the C1 mutant. Panel C shows the results obtained with the collagenase promoter, which contains an AP-1 binding site, and Panel Dshows an unanticipated regulation by TRs of a reporter gene containing sequences of the viral CMV promoter. TR caused a strong ligand-independent activation of both constructs, and T3repressed reporter gene activity essentially to basal uninduced levels. The AF-2 mutations had parallel effects in T3-dependent transcriptional activation and T3-dependent repression. The E401Q receptor conferred a decreased inhibitory response of the collagenase and CMV promoters to T3, and repression by T3 was totally lost with the C1 receptor. These results show again that the AF-2 region is involved in both responses to T3, activation and repression, but it has no effect on ligand-independent TR actions on the tested promoters. A deletion mutant of RAR, RAR-(1–390), lacking the last 72 amino acids, which contain the AF-2 region, did not activate the −Δ530GH-CAT construct either in absence of RA or in its presence. Furthermore, the truncated RAR exhibited dominant-negative inhibition of RA-dependent activation by the wild-type RAR in the presence of GHF-1 (data not shown). A conserved 20-amino acid region of TR (the τi domain) located within helix 3 of the ligand binding domain has been reported to participate in transactivation of the GH promoter in pituitary cells (32Helmer E.B. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mutation K232I was tested in its ability to transactivate the rGH promoter in HeLa cells. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 8 A. Unlike the wild-type receptor, the unliganded mutant TR K232I did not activate the −Δ530GH-CAT construct in the absence of GHF-1. Furthermore, this mutant displayed dominant-negative activity (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with v-erbA. The TR-derived oncogenic protein did not activate the promoter in the absence of T3but inhibited the hormone-independent activity of wild-type TR. Again, GHF-1 played a major role in the activity of the mutant receptor. GHF-1 restored T3-independent transcriptional activity mediated by K232I (but not by v-erbA), since in the presence of the pituitary-specific factor the mutant receptor activated the promoter in a T3-independent manner as effectively as wild-type TR. That this residue also plays an important role in ligand-dependent transactivation is shown by the finding that the response to T3 was significantly reduced in the presence of GHF-1. These results confirm our hypothesis of the putative cofactor role of GHF-1 for rGH transcriptional regulation since its presence, at least partially, repairs the loss of function observed with different TR mutants. Finally, K232I TR failed to induce a hormone-independent activation of the collagenase promoter (Fig. 8 B), confirming that this residue is essential for hormone-independent transactivation. A deletion mutant of TR, TR-(120–408), which lacks the first 120 amino acids and cannot bind to DNA, was expressed alone or with RXR to test its ability to transactivate the rGH promoter (Fig. 9). In the absence of GHF-1, the truncated receptor showed no transcriptional activity. However, when cotransfected along with GHF-1 and RXR, the truncated TR regained the ability to activate the promoter both in a T3-dependent and -independent manner. Expression of exogenous RXR was required for this response, since TR-(120–408) was inactive when transfected only with GHF-1. A constitutive transactivation, very similar in extent to that mediated by the wild-type TR, was obtained when RXR and GHF-1 were cotransfected. Besides, GHF-1 partially restored the T3-dependent activity of the deletion mutant, although this response was weaker than that showed by the wild-type receptor. These results indicate that the ligand binding domain might be a putative region for synergism with GHF-1. A hormone-independent activation of the rat GH promoter by TR and RAR in HeLa cells, which was reversed after ligand addition has been observed. These results in HeLa cells confirm previous observations showing that overexpression of TR leads to a constitutive activation of the GH and prolactin promoters in a pituitary cell line (31Forman B.M. Yang C. Au M. Casanova J. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1610-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The sequences involved in constitutive activation mapped to a negative TRE adjacent to the TATA box (19Crone D.E. Kim H.S. Spindler S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10851-10856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which we have demonstrated to bind TR/RXR and RAR/RXR heterodimers. Constitutive transactivation by TR of different promoters containing negative hormone response elements has been described previously (29Saatcioglou F. Deng T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,30Tomic-Canic M. Day D. Samuels H.H. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 540-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms by which the receptors elicit this activation are still unknown, it has been reported recently that the nuclear receptor corepressors activate rather than suppress transcription of genes negatively regulated by thyroid hormone (42Tagami T. Madison L.D. Takashi N. Jameson L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Besides the AF-2 domain, the τi region of the nuclear receptors located in helix 3 has been described as being involved in transactivation (43O′Donnell A.L. Koenig R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 4: 715-720Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our results show that the AF-2 domain of TR is dispensable for T3-independent transactivation. However, the helix 3 mutation K232I renders a TR unable to induce a ligand-independent activation of the GH promoter in HeLa cells. This is in agreement with the finding that this mutant TR was not able to activate transcription in pituitary cells (32Helmer E.B. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A mutant estrogen receptor equivalent to TR K232I lacks ligand-dependent transcriptional activity, and it has been proposed that this conserved lysine residue, together with residues in helix 12, is required to form the surface by which the receptor interacts with coactivators (44Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The finding that this residue is required not only for ligand-induced activity but also for constitutive activation suggest that T3-dependent and -independent transactivation might depend on the same interaction surfaces, although proteins and/or residues interacting might be different. Unexpectedly, in the absence of GHF-1 the activity of GH promoter constructs which contain the positive TRE/RARE surrounding position −180 (6Bedó G. Santisteban P. Aranda A. Nature. 1989; 339: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 11Brent G.A. Harney J.W. Chen Y. Warne R.L. Moore D.D. Larsen P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1996-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) was strongly repressed by T3 in TR-expressing HeLa cells and, less strongly, by RA in RAR-expressing cells. These results suggest that in the absence of GHF-1 the negative response element overlapping the TATA box governs GH promoter activity in HeLa cells. The experiments with mutant TRs show that the C-terminal AF-2 region is required for the T3-dependent repression of the GH promoter obtained under these conditions, since mutation E401Q severely impaired the repressive activity of T3 on the GH promoter. Interestingly, the ligand-dependent inhibition of the GH promoter obtained in the absence of GHF-1 was transformed into a synergistic activation when the receptors were cotransfected along with GHF-1. Therefore, the presence of this factor is essential for T3 and RA-dependent transactivation of the promoter and reconstitutes the regulation obtained in pituitary cells that express endogenously both the receptors and GHF-1. Ligand-dependent transactivation of the GH promoter in HeLa cells also requires deletion of an AP-1 element (39Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Duncan K.G. López G. Schaufele F. Uht R.M. Weeb P. West B.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 405-407PubMed Google Scholar) present in the plasmid backbone. Even in the presence of GHF-1, T3 and RA had a negative effect when the promoter reporter construct contains the AP-1 site. This is probably the reason why a ligand-dependent activation of the rat GH promoter in these cells has not been found before (32Helmer E.B. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). But even with the construct lacking the AP-1 site, TR and RAR did not mediate a ligand-dependent transactivation of the GH promoter in the absence of GHF-1, again emphasizing the important role of this factor. Previous reports have indicated that GHF-1 is required for hormone-dependent regulation of other pituitary genes. Thus, neither estrogen-mediated stimulation of the prolactin gene (45Day R.N. Koike S. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar,46Simmons D.M. Voss J.W. Ingraham H.A. Holloway J.M. Broide R.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Swanson L.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) nor RA-mediated activation of a distal enhancer in the GHF-1 gene, which contains a RARE, are obtained in the absence of this factor (47Rhodes S.J. Chen R. DiMattia G.E. Scully K.M. Kalla K.A. Lin S.C., Yu, V.C. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 913-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The results obtained in the present work are consistent with a model in which GHF-1 could have a coactivator-like role for the nuclear receptors. First, the AF-2 mutant TR (E401Q), which cannot interact with coactivators, showed a normal T3-dependent activation of the GH promoter in the presence of GHF-1. The same receptor displayed a clearly reduced repressive activity in the absence of GHF-1 and a strongly reduced T3-induced activation of promoters containing consensus TREs. This finding was similar to that obtained with an equivalent estrogen receptor mutant, which conferred ligand-dependent activation to the prolactin promoter in the presence of GHF-1 but was inactive in a consensus promoter (48Holloway J.M. Szeto D.P. Scully K.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1992-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast with the results obtained with the E401Q mutation, GHF-1 could not rescue the lack of ligand-dependent activation of a mutant TR lacking 9 amino acids in the AF-2 region or of the E401K mutant. However, the interpretation of these results is unclear because T3 binding is severely impaired by the deletion and by the Glu → Lys mutation (21Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A truncated RAR that lacks 72 C-terminal amino acids was unable to mediate transcriptional stimulation of the GH promoter, but ligand binding affinity is also strongly reduced in this receptor (49Tate B.F. Allenby G. Janocha R. Kazmer S. Speck J. Sturzenbecker L.J. Abarzœa P. Levin A.A. Grippo J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2323-2330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, GHF-1 restores the ability of the TR mutant K232I to activate the GH promoter. This receptor was totally unable to induce this activity in the absence of GHF-1. Third, GHF-1 confers ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activity to a truncated TR which contains only the ligand binding domain. This mutant receptor is not only transcriptionally inactive but displays a strong dominant-negative activity on other T3-responsive promoters in HeLa cells when transfected along with wild-type TR. 2T. Palomino and A. Aranda, unpublished observations. Since this receptor cannot bind to DNA, the protein to protein interaction with GHF-1 could be responsible for the stimulation of the GH promoter by the mutant TR. However, stimulation of the GH promoter by this truncated receptor also requires overexpression of RXR, and it is not impossible that the interaction with GHF-1 in vivo might ameliorate binding of the defective heterodimer to the DNA response element. The results obtained with the E401Q and K232I receptors imply that either the nuclear coactivators are dispensable for the ligand-dependent stimulation of the GH and prolactin promoters, or most likely that GHF-1 induces a conformational change in the mutant receptors, which creates an active interaction surface with coactivators or components of the basal transcriptional apparatus. We have recently observed a direct physical association of T3and RA receptors with GHF-1 (17Palomino, T., Sanchez-Pacheco, A., Peña, P., and Aranda, A. (1998) FASEB J., in pressGoogle Scholar) compatible with this hypothesis. Furthermore, we have recently observed that CBP/p300 cooperates with GHF-1 to stimulate GH and prolactin promoter activity.2This protein, originally identified as a coactivator for CREB, was shown to act as a general integrator of multiple signaling pathways including ligand-dependent activation by TR and RAR (50Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). CBP/p300 interacts directly not only with the receptors but also with other receptor coactivators such as SRC-1 or p/CIP. It is likely that GHF-1 could favor the formation of complexes containing CBP/p300 and other coactivators with the receptors, which may be stabilized by protein-protein interactions. This would result in the recruitment of these regulatory proteins to the transcription apparatus and in the stimulation of the GH promoter. We thank R. Evans for RAR and RXR expression vectors, M. Karin for the GHF-1 vector, and H. Samuels for the truncated TR-(120–408) and the mutant K232I receptor."

The study of histone acetylation has its origin more than 30 years ago when Allfrey (1Allfrey V.G. Li H.J. Eckhardt R.A. Chromatin and Chromosome Structure. Academic Press, New York1977: 167-191Crossref Google Scholar) established for the first time the correlation between high levels of histone acetylation and gene transcription. This was followed by the realization that histone acetylation is dynamic (2Matthews H.R. Waterborg J.H. Freedman R.B. Hawkins H.C. The Enzymology of Post-translational Modification of Proteins. 2. Academic Press, London1985: 125-285Google Scholar). In animal cells, histone acetylation has turnover half-lives of 3–30 min (3Sealy L. Chalkley R.

Thus, locally highly acetylated chromatin on or near transcriptionally active or poised genes results from a localized shift in the dynamic equilibrium between histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase activities in favor of acetylation (8Davie J.R. Hendzel M.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In some cases, likeSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the significant steady-state level of acetylation of H3 and H4 histones (9Nelson D.A. Alonso W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 741: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) is achieved under conditions of rather slow turnover with a half-life of 2 h (10Nelson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1565-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, histone H4 and H3, highly acetylated at some or all amino-terminal lysines, has been studied intensively by specific antibodies (11Turner B.M. Birley A.J. Lavender J. Cell. 1992; 69: 375-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 12Lin R. Leone J.W. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J.

This has confirmed the general relationship between high acetylation and gene transcription, although high acetylation at some sites is more clearly correlated with deposition of newly synthesized histone or even with gene or chromosome silencing (15Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2388) Google Scholar). The recognition that n-butyrate inhibited histone deacetylase in vivo and caused general and extensive hyperacetylation of chromatin led to experiments that in general supported correlation between high acetylation and gene transcription. It allowed measurements of acetylation turnover rates upon release of inhibition (5Covault J. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9110-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zhang D.E.

In recent years, many and more specific inhibitors of histone deacetylase have been discovered, including the reversible inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA)1 and irreversible inhibitor trapoxin (17Yoshida M.

Most studies of histone acetylation have been performed in animal cells, in fungi like S. cerevisiae or protists likeTetrahymena. In all these, histone H4 is the predominant target of histone acetylation, followed by histone H3, whereas acetylation of H2B and H2A core histones is lower. In higher plants, histone H3 is the predominant target of histone acetylation with rather high steady-state levels, especially of replacement variant forms which are preferentially localized in transcriptionally active chromatin domains (35Waterborg J.H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1991; 96: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Waterborg J.H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Waterborg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4912-4917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylation levels of histone H4 are lower, and levels of H2B are lower still, whereas acetylation of histone H2A is barely detectable (38Waterborg J.H. Harrington R.E. Winicov I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the unicellular green algaeChlamydomonas reinhardtii, this difference is even more pronounced, and steady-state levels of multi-acetylated H3 are remarkably high (39Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L. Borza C.M. Davie J.R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Also, histone acetylation in Chlamydomonas appeared rather fast, as detected during analysis of histone synthesis throughout the cell cycle (39Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L. Borza C.M. Davie J.R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This prompted study of the dynamics of histone acetylation. Described below is a unique quantitative analysis of the rate of turnover of acetylation with the highest rates of turnover for histone acetylation reported to date. It describes how fast and to which extent TSA induces hyperacetylation of histones, limited by histone methylation, and reports that a remarkably high fraction of the algal chromatin cannot be acetylated.

Phototrophic culture at 28 °C, exposed to continuous white light at 75 microeinsteins photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) m−2 and 3% CO2-enriched air bubbling, was inoculated directly from plates at an initial density of 105 cells/ml into HSM minimal medium in 800-ml glass cylinders (4 cm in diameter) (39Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L. Borza C.M. Davie J.R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Typically, growing cultures at a density of 2–6 × 106 cells/ml were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 7000 × g in 1-liter buckets at room temperature and were resuspended at a density of 5 × 107 cells/ml. Translation inhibitor cycloheximide was added to 10 μg/ml from fresh, non-sterile stock (2 mg/ml in 50% ethanol) 10 min prior to the addition of acetate. For labeling to steady state, 0.1 m NH4Ac was added to 0.2 mm final concentration 5 min prior to the addition of tritiated acetate. High specific activity [3H]NaAc (9 × 1013 Bq/mol, NEN Life Science Products) was added at 3.7 × 107 Bq (1 mCi) per 40 ml of concentrated culture (to 10 μm acetate), and cells were incubated at room temperature for various lengths of time. Acetate incorporation was stopped by transfer to melting ice and collection of cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 650 × g and 0 °C. The chase condition in pulse-chase experiments was created by the addition of 1 volume of ammonium acetate-containing HSM (9.34 mm acetate) 2 min after tritiated acetate was added to 20 μm. Acetate labeling at reduced specific radioactivity was performed by addition of ammonium acetate to 200 μmfollowed after 5 min by the addition of tritiated acetate to 10 μm. Trichostatin A (Wako Bioproducts) was desolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 0.5 mg/ml (1.67 mm) and was used at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml unless otherwise indicated. Isolation of nuclei and preparation of histones was essentially done as described previously (39Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L. Borza C.M. Davie J.R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, histones from 2 × 109 cells were solubilized by sonication of the nuclear pellet in 40% guanidine HCl at pH 6.8, acidified, centrifuged, neutralized, bound to and eluted from 0.25 ml of Bio-Rex 70 resin (Bio-Rad) by 40% guanidine HCl, dialyzed extensively against 2.5% (v/v) acetic acid, and lyophilized. At all steps, 2-mercaptoethanol in excess of 1 mm was present. Histones were solubilized and subjected to reversed-phase HPLC on a Zorbax Protein-Plus column (4.6 × 25 mm) as described (39Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L. Borza C.M. Davie J.R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), developed by a 90-min gradient at 1 ml/min with acetonitrile between 30 and 60% (v/v) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and monitored by absorbance at 214 nm. Radioactivity in fractions was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Fractions were made 1 mm in 2-mercaptoethanol, pooled based on absorbance and/or radioactivity, and lyophilized. Histones were electrophoresed in 30-cm long discontinuous acid-urea-Triton (AUT) gels with 8 m urea and 9 mm Triton X-100, essentially as described (39Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L.

Procedures of AUT Coomassie gel staining, densitometry, and fluorography have been described previously (39Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L. Borza C.M. Davie J.R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). SigmaPlot version 4.0 (SSPS, Chicago) was used for nonlinear regression data analysis. Post-translational modification of the histones of unicellular green alga C. reinhardtii has been studied by incorporation of tritiated acetate into growing cells, synchronized by a light-dark regimen in acetate-free minimal medium during phototrophic growth (39Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L. Borza C.M. Davie J.R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Labeled acetate is rapidly metabolized and incorporated into newly synthesized protein, which is observed as label incorporation into all histone species, separated by reversed-phase HPLC, after labeling for 60 min. Reducing the time of labeling to 5 min abolished most but not all label incorporation into non-acetylated histone forms (39Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L. Borza C.M. Davie J.R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (results not shown). Preincubation of cells with translation inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) completely abolished acetate incorporation into the co-translationally, amino-terminally acetylated linker histone H1 species and into the many low abundance proteins observed during HPLC fractionation of the crude histone preparation. Acid-urea-Triton (AUT) gel analysis and fluorography (Fig. 1) confirmed these observations and the absence of any acetate label incorporation into non-acetylated core histones, including histone H4 and H2A, histones that are typically co-translationally acetylated at the amino termini of newly synthesized polypeptides. Provided cycloheximide was added at least 5 min prior to the addition of tritiated acetate, (co)translational labeling of histones by acetate was prevented for more than 2 h. The relative levels of post-translational incorporation of acetate into core histones following a short incubation with tritiated acetate differed markedly between histone species (Table I) and correlated well with steady-state acetylation levels of each histone, determined by Coomassie staining and densitometry of AUT gels (39Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L. Borza C.M. Davie J.R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (compare lanes G and H in Fig. 1). Whereas in animal cells histone acetylation is highest in histone H4 and significant for all other core histones, in Chlamydomonas, even more than in higher plants (35Waterborg J.H. Plant Physiol.

Open table in a new tab Turnover rates of dynamic, post-translational acetylation of histones are high with reported half-lives measured by pulse-chase experiments ranging from 3 min in mammalian cells in culture for the fastest dynamic component (4Jackson V. Shires A. Chalkley R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4856-4863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to 2 h for the rather stable acetylation of H4 in S. cerevisiae (10Nelson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1565-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Less quantitative analyses provide rough estimates of half-lives of 10 or 20 min for higher plants (38Waterborg J.H. Harrington R.E. Winicov I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Chlamydomonas grown phototrophically, free of a carbon source other than CO2, appeared to be well suited to perform pulse-chase experiments. Very rapid incorporation of radioactive acetate, applied at a concentration of 10 μm, was followed by apparent rapid exhaustion of the small labeled acetyl-CoA pool, as judged by the pattern of acetate incorporation into individual histones (Fig. 2) and into acetylated forms of these histones (Fig. 1). Incorporation of acetate into cells upon addition of tritiated acetate, immediately followed by collection of cells and lysis as the start of preparing nuclei, typically gave label incorporation between 50 and 80% of the maximum value reached after incubation for 2 or 3 min. Between 2 and 20 min, apparent exponential decay of the specific radioactivity in each core histone species was observed with a half-life of 6 ± 1 min (Fig. 2). This value should be considered an upper limit for the turnover rate because no real chase, i.e. dilution of the acetate pool, was applied. The relative rate of acetyl-lysine turnover of a histone species at each level of modification can be determined from the change in specific radioactivity of each modification level by densitometry of Coomassie-stained and -fluorographed AUT gels. The pattern observed for histone H3, acetylated at 5 sites (Fig. 1 A), is clearly different from that of histone H4 (Fig. 1 B), despite the fact that H4 is also acetylated at 5 lysines. The rate of acetyl-lysine turnover is essentially identical for each level of modification of H3 (Fig. 3) yielding a pattern that is fading over time as radioactively labeled acetyl-lysines are turned into non-radioactive ones, without a change in distribution (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, it is clear from the much more rapid fading of the multi-acetylated bands in the histone H4 pattern (Fig. 1 B) that turnover is faster for penta- and tetra-acetylated forms than for di- or mono-acetylated species (Fig. 3 B). This does not imply that highly acetylated forms of H4 lose acetyl groups and are converted into less and less modified forms because the steady-state pattern of H4 acetylation, measured from the Coomassie Blue distribution in AUT gels, does not change over time. The labeled acetylation pattern of histone H2B, with most label in mono- and di-acetylated forms, showed a slight shift over time (Fig. 1 C) and a slight tendency for a higher turnover rate for higher modified forms (Fig. 3 C). A similar result was deduced for histone H2A, but the overlapping pattern of two variant protein forms (39Waterborg J.H. Robertson A.J. Tatar D.L. Borza C.M. Davie J.R. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 109: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) prevents quantitative analysis. A pulse-chase protocol was used to measure turnover rates of histone acetylation. A 450-fold excess of unlabeled acetate was added 2 min after addition of tritiated acetate to cultures, pre-treated with cycloheximide. Histones were prepared, and their specific radioactivity was determined during HPLC fractionation (results not shown) and by densitometric analysis of stained and fluorographed AUT gels (Fig. 2). The instantaneous sharp drop in labeling of all histone species clearly demonstrated that the acetyl-CoA pool in Chlamydomonas, growing phototrophically, is very small. It also showed that acetylation turnover is very fast, faster than can be measured with reasonable accuracy by the experimental method used. Although cooled quickly at the end of each incubation, cells must be collected by centrifugation before they can be lysed in the procedure to prepare nuclei and histones. During this time, acetylation incorporation and turnover will occur, as judged by loss of acetate incorporation after “0”-min chase (Fig. 2). One can measure rates of turnover from the pattern of specific radioactivity if conditions a"

The cDNA coding for the enzyme responsible for the key reaction in the biosynthesis of the branched polylactosamine backbones has been isolated (19Bierhuizen M.F.A. Mattei M.-G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether it codes for a cIGnT6 or a dIGnT6 enzyme or perhaps for an unknown branch-generating enzyme. In the present experiments, a fusion protein representing the catalytic ectodomain of the branch-forming enzyme and glutathioneS-transferase was functionally expressed in Baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified. Analysis of the substrate specificity of the purified recombinant enzyme showed that it possesses the activity of the cIGnT6 type, but not of the dIGnT6 type. The data suggest that the recombinant cIGnT6 is able to transfer multiple GlcNAc branches to long linear polylactosamines, a prerequisite for improving enzyme-assisted in vitrosynthesis of a type of multivalent sialyl Lewis x glycans (21Renkonen O.

The human PA1 cell β1,6N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that generates branches to polylactosamine backbones (IGnT6) has been cloned previously and sequenced (19Bierhuizen M.F.A. Mattei M.-G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The following materials were purchased from indicated sources: Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), oligonucleotides A and B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), T4 ligase (Promega), Escherichia coli strains JM 105 and XL-1blue (ATCC), BamHI and EcoRI (Promega), Baculovirus transfer vector pAcSecG2T, linearized BaculoGold DNA, pAcGHLT-XylE control plasmid, and transfection buffers A and B (PharMingen), Sf9 cells (Invitrogen), SF-900 medium, gentamycin, penicillin, streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.), insect cell lysis buffer, protease inhibitor cocktail, glutathione-agarose beads, phosphate-buffered saline wash buffer, GST elution buffer, glutathione powder (PharMingen), Microcon 30 concentrators (Amicon), plastic ware (Greiner), monoclonal mouse anti-GST (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in SF-900 medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml gentamycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum in either 10-cm Petri dishes, six-well platforms, or 75-cm2tissue culture flasks. Restriction endonuclease reactions, DNA ligations, bacterial transfections plasmid isolations, RNA isolations, Northern blots, Western blots, ECL reactions, and Coomassie stainings were performed by standard methods. The truncated segment coding for residues 26–400 of human IGnT6 was synthesized with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu polymerase. The IGnT6 cDNA (19Bierhuizen M.F.A. Mattei M.-G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) in pcDNAI vector was used as a template, and oligonucleotides A (5′-CAAGAAGGATCCAATTTTGGGGGAGATCCAAGC) and B (5′-GGATGAATTCCTCAAAAATACCAGCTGGGTTGTATCGC) as primers. Oligonucleotide A created a BamHI site to the 5′ end of the truncated IGnT6 DNA, and oligonucleotide B created an in-frame stop codon and an EcoRI site to its 3′ end. For expression in insect cells as GST fusion protein, the amplified IGnT6 PCR product was subcloned into the plasmid pAcSecG2T (PharMingen) downstream of ATG start site and GST coding region using the BamHI and EcoRI sites. The construct lacks the section of DNA encoding the cytoplasmic N terminus and transmembrane region of IGnT6. Transfer vector pAcSecG2T-IGnT6 (4.4 μg) and BaculoGold Baculovirus-linearized DNA (0.5 μg) were co-transfected into confluent Sf9 cells and incubated for 3 days at 27 °C. GST-IGnT6 virus progeny was isolated using plaque assay and amplified three times. The recombinant virus was stored as a stock solution (4 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml) at 4 °C in SF-900 medium containing supplements and 10% fetal calf serum. For activity assays the recombinant enzyme was stored a few days at −20 °C without loss of activity. Microscale purification was performed: 2.0 × 107 Sf9 insect cells were infected or not infected with recombinant Baculovirus (4 plaque-forming units/cell) and incubated at 27 °C for 3 days. The cells were lysed on ice for 45 min with the lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and precleared by centrifuging at 40,000 × g for 30 min to pellet the cellular debris. Precleared lysates were loaded into the glutathione bead column after which the column was washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline wash buffer. The fusion protein was eluted with the GST elution buffer containing glutathione (5 mm). Glutathione was removed by dialyzing against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) or by washing the eluates several times in Microcon 30 concentrators. The acceptor oligosaccharides (Table I) were synthesized as described: the trisaccharide GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc (23Seppo A. Penttilä L. Makkonen A. Leppänen A. Niemelä R. Jäntti J. Helin J.

The reaction mixtures were passed through a mixed bed of Dowex AG1 (AcO−) and Dowex AG50 (H+), and the eluates were lyophilized. In the IGnT6 reactions performed with the Sf9 cell lysates, the incubation mixtures contained 330 pmol of acceptor (either the trisaccharide GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc, the tetrasaccharide Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc, or the pentasaccharide Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc), 0.5 mg of UDP-GlcNAc, 2.5 μmol of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.4 μmol of NaN3, 1.0 μmol of EDTA, 25 nmol of ATP, 3 μmol of galactonolactone, 1 μmol of galactose, and 5 μmol of N-acetylglucosamine and the cell lysate (430 μg total protein) in a total volume of 50 μl. The cell lysate was prepared by incubating equal volumes of the cells and the lysis solution (1.8% NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitors). Paper chromatographic runs of desalted radiolabeled saccharides were performed on Whatman III Chr paper with the upper phase of 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (4:1:5 v/v). Radioactivity on the chromatograms was monitored using Opriscint (Wallac, Turku, Finland) as scintillant. Marker lanes of malto-oligosaccharides, lactose, and galactose on both sides of the sample lanes were stained with silver nitrate. Digestions with endo-β-galactosidase from Bacteroides fragilis (EC3.2.1.103; Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) were performed according to Ref. 16Leppänen A. Penttilä L. Niemelä R. Helin J.

IGnT6 is the β1,6-GlcNAc Transferase That Generates Branches to Poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbones in human PA1 cells (19Bierhuizen M.F.A. Mattei M.-G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The truncated IGnT6 (amino acids 26–400, Fig. 1 A), encoding for the stem and the Golgi lumenal regions of native IGnT6, was synthesized by PCR. It was inserted downstream of the very late polyhedrin promoter, gp67 signal sequence, and GST coding region of the vector pAcSecG2T, between the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites in the cloning site to form the transfer vector pAcSecG2T-IGnT6 (Fig. 1 B). Sf9 insect cells were co-transfected with the pAcSecG2T-IGnT6 transfer vector together with the linearized BaculoGold Baculovirus DNA. Northern blot analysis from the infected cells indicated that a new RNA transcript of the size of 2.3 kilobases hybridizing with the full-length IGnT6 cDNA was present (Fig. 2 A). This de novoexpressed transcript was first detected at 48 h, and its level of expression increased up to 72 h postinfection. Expression of the recombinant fusion protein GST-IGnT6 was monitored by Western blot analysis with a monoclonal anti-GST antibody. Proteins in the cell culture media and lysates from both uninfected as well as from infected cells were separated. While no immunoreactive bands were present in the samples from the culture media, two broad bands at 67 and 74 kDa were detected by anti-GST antibody in samples prepared from cell lysates at 48–96 h after infection (Fig. 2 B). The fusion protein GST-IGnT6 has five potentialN-glycosylation sites. To study them we infected Sf9 cells with recombinant virus following by treatment with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation. After tunicamycin treatment only two bands centered at 67 kDa were detected with the anti-GST antibody in the Western blot (Fig. 3). These data showed that the IGnT6 was N-glycosylated in the Sf9 cells, and the size heterogenicity was at least partially due to differences in N-glycosylation. A one-step purification of the recombinant GST-IGnT6 was achieved by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose beads. Samples of the cell lysate and the purified protein were run in SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. A major band was observed at 67 kDa in the lane of the purified protein; minor bands were visible at 58 and 76 kDa (Fig. 4). The yield of the purified fusion protein was typically 750 μg/109 infected Sf9 cells present in 1 liter of the suspension culture. The polylactosamine acceptors used in these experiments are collected in Table I. The functionality of the recombinant GST-IGnT6 was studied first by using Sf9 cell lysates. In a typical experiment, a lysate was incubated with radiolabeled trisaccharide GlcNAcβ1–3[14C]Galβ1–4GlcNAc and UDP-GlcNAc. Neither a tetrasaccharide-like product nor any other product besides the starting trisaccharide was detected by paper chromatography of the neutral oligosaccharides of the incubation mixture (Fig. 5 A). By contrast, similar experiments repeatedly converted significant amounts of the radiolabeled tetrasaccharide [3H]Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc into a product that migrated like a pentasaccharide, suggesting the presence of cIGnT6 activity (data not shown, see below). The functionality of the recombinant enzyme GST-IGnT6 was confirmed by incubating it with UDP-GlcNAc and [3H]Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc. This reaction mixture contained a radiolabeled oligosaccharide product, which co-migrated with the authentic Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAcβ1–6)Galβ1–4GlcNAc (Fig. 5 B). A partial reaction had taken place, yielding 28% of a pentasaccharide (peak 1) and leaving 72% of the tetrasaccharide acceptor (peak 2) intact. This was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, performed with a sample from another similar but more exhaustive reaction mixture; the spectrum revealed the presence of 49% of a pentasaccharide Gal2GlcNAc3 in addition to 51% of the acceptor tetrasaccharide (Fig. 6 A). To characterize the pentasaccharide product, the radiolabeled glycan was first incubated with jack bean (exo)-β-galactosidase, which released all tritium label in the form of free [3H]Gal (Fig. 7 A). This implies that the new GlcNAc of the pentasaccharide was not transferred to the distal, tritium-containing galactose residue of the tetrasaccharide acceptor, as this would not have been susceptible to (exo)-β-galactosidase. Hence, the reaction had been different from the β1,6-GlcNAc transfer to the terminal galactose described in other laboratories (12Koenderman A.H.L. Koppen P.L. van den Eijnden D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3900-3905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zdebska E. Krauze R.

Another enzymatic digestion was performed with endo-β-galactosidase, which cleaves the internal β-galactosidic linkage of the tetrasaccharide acceptor (27Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3900-3905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other linear polylactosamines, but does not hydrolyze the branched Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAcβ1–6)Galβ1–4GlcNAc synthesized by the rat serum cIGnT6 (31Leppänen A. Salminen H. Zhu Y. Maaheimo H. Helin J. Costello C.E. Renkonen O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7026-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When the pentasaccharide was incubated with endo-β-galactosidase, no breakdown product was formed (Fig. 7 B). Collectively, these data showed that the pentasaccharide product of the recombinant GST-IGnT6 behaved in several ways like the authentic Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAcβ1–6)Galβ1–4GlcNAc. However, the possibility still remained that that the new GlcNAc could have been transferred to position 2 or 4 of the internal Gal unit or to either of the two GlcNAc residues of the tetrasaccharide acceptor; in addition, the GlcNAc unit could have become bound to the acceptor with an α-linkage. To address these possibilities, the 1H NMR spectrum of the pentasaccharide product at 500 MHz was obtained (Fig. 8, Table II). The resonances of the structural reporter groups observed were identical with those of the authentic Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAc1–6)Galβ1–4GlcNAc reported in (32Maaheimo H. Räbinä J. Renkonen O. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 297: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (see Table II). The NMR data provide evidence for the presence of two β-linked GlcNAc residues in the pentasaccharide product. The similarity of the H1 resonance of the new GlcNAc unit of the pentasaccharide product with the H1 signal of the GlcNAc-5 unit of the authentic marker provides strong support for the notion that the new βGlcNAc residue was 1,6-bonded to the midchain galactose. The similarities of the H4 resonances of the Gal-2 units are also strong indications for the identity of the two pentasaccharides. Bierhuizenet al. (19Bierhuizen M.F.A. Mattei M.-G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) provided methylation data on glycoprotein glycans from appropriately transfected cells, suggesting that the IGnT6 responsible for the polylactosamine branching in PA1 cells converts 3-substituted galactoses to 3,6-disubstituted units. These combined data imply that the pentasaccharide product generated by the recombinant enzyme in the present experiments was almost certainly Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAc1–6)Galβ1–4GlcNAc.Table II1H NMR chemical shifts of structural reporter groups in the pentasaccharide Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAcβ1–6)Galβ1–4GlcNAc at 23 °CReporter groupResidue2-aFor monosaccharide denotation, see Fig. 8.Authentic pentasaccharide synthesized by cIGnT6 of rat serum (32Maaheimo H.

The nona- and decasaccharide products represented mixtures of isomers carrying one and two GlcNAc-branches on the linear octasaccharide acceptor. Hence, it appears likely that the recombinant cIGnT6 shares with the enzymes of mammalian serum (18Leppänen A. Niemelä R. Renkonen O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13729-13735Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and hog intestine (46Sakamoto Y. Taguchi T. Tano Y. Ogawa T. Leppänen A. Kinnunen M. Aitio O. Parmanne P. Renkonen O.

The recombinant GST-IGnT6 was unable to transfer GlcNAc to the pentasaccharide [3H]Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4(Fucα-3)GlcNAc, as assessed by paper chromatography, while the control reaction performed with the fucose-free tetrasaccharide [3H]Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc gave a 16% yield of the radiolabeled pentasaccharide product (data not shown). Hence, the recombinant enzyme shares with the rat serum cIGnT6-enzyme (18Leppänen A. Niemelä R. Renkonen O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13729-13735Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) in the inability to act at the inner galactose of the fucosylated pentasaccharide. Taken together, all properties of the recombinant GST-IGnT6 that were tested in the present experiments were qualitatively similar to those of the cIGnT6 activity of rat serum. The present experiments describe successful functional expression of a truncated form of a human β1,6-GlcNAc transferase as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in Baculovirus-infected insect cells and provide evidence that the purified recombinant enzyme represents a cIGnT6 that catalyzes transfer to centrally located galactose residues of linear polylactosamine chains. The cDNA expressed was originally isolated from human embryonal carcinoma cells of line PA1, where it was shown to code for the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of branched polylactosamine backbones (19Bierhuizen M.F.A. Mattei M.-G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The present data show that the cDNA does not code for an enzyme that transfers at the distally located galactose units at the nonreducing termini of the acceptor chains. The data show also that the cDNA does not code for dIGnT6, a branching enzyme that acts at peridistal galactoses of polylactosamine chains of the type GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-OR. Instead, the data imply that the cDNA codes for a branching enzyme that transfers to midchain galactoses of polylactosamines; the presence of at least one complete N-acetyllactosamine unit, bonded to position 3, appears to be necessary for the galactose residues reacting with the purified recombinant cIGnT6. Our recent observations show that PA1 cell lysates contain cIGnT6 rather than dIGnT6 activity (20Leppänen A. Zhu Y. Maaheimo H. Helin J. Lehtonen E. Renkonen O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17399-17405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Hence, the elimination of the cytoplasmic and the membrane binding segment from the recombinant cIGnT6 of the present experiments was probably not associated with major changes in the substrate specificity. Consequently, it is worth noting that the recombinant cIGnT6 shares several features with the soluble cIGnT6 enzymes present in mammalian serum (18Leppänen A. Niemelä R. Renkonen O.

The common features include (i) the ability to transfer one or several branches to midchain galactoses of long polylactosamine chains, (ii) the unability to react at peridistal galactose units in acceptors of the type GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-OR, and (iii) the inability to transfer at midchain galactoses that belong to Lewis x determinants. The present study demonstrates that cIGnT6 adds β1,6-linkedN-acetylglucosamine to a linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine as shown in Fig. 9 A. In this biosynthetic pathway, the addition of I branch does not occur at the termini of elongating poly-N-acetyllactosamine. It is expected that the addition of I branches proceeds randomly along preformed poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains in human and rabbit erythrocytes (33Fukuda M. Dell A. Oates J.E. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol.

Such arrays could result from a relatively late action of cIGnT6 on preformed i-type chains (Fig. 9 A). In contrast, dIGnT6 is expected to form branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbones in association of the chain growth, leading occasionally to the formation of branched-branch arrays of N-acetyllactosamine units in the multiply branched polylactosamines (Fig. 9 B). Such structures may be synthesized in gastrointestinal cells and Novikoff cells where dGnT6 activity has been detected (10Piller F. Cartron J.-P. Maranduba A. Veyrieres A. Leroy Y. Fournet B. J.

As shown previously, human granulocytes contain heavily fucosylated poly-N-acetyllactosamines such as R1-Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1-R2, and these side chains do not contain any I branching (36Spooncer E.

Aβ aggregates (fibrils) are believed to be responsible for neuronal damage and dysfunction, as well as microglia and astrocyte activation in disease lesions by multiple mechanisms. Since Aβ aggregates possess the multiple valencies of anFAED motif (20th to 23rd amino acid residues), which resembles the putative transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) active site motif, we hypothesize that Aβ monomers and Aβ aggregates may function as TGF-β antagonists and partial agonists, analogous to previously described monovalent and multivalent TGF-β peptide antagonists and agonists (Huang, S.

Here, we report that the Aβ monomer, Aβ-(1–40) and its fragment, containing the motif inhibit radiolabeled TGF-β binding to cell-surface TGF-β receptors in mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells).

At less than micromolar concentrations, Aβ-(1–40)-BSA but not Aβ-(1–40) monomers inhibited proliferation of Mv1Lu cells.

The deposition of Aβ aggregates (fibrils) is believed to be an early and critical event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms by which Aβ aggregates exert their detrimental effects are not well understood, but may involve effects through interactions with specific cell-surface receptors or binding proteins. Several receptors and binding proteins have been reported to interact with Aβ, but none appears to be able to discriminate Aβ monomers from Aβ aggregates (7Yan S.D. Chen X. Fu J. Chen M. Zhu H.

Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides containing this motif in the middle of the peptide exhibit TGF-β antagonist activity. Multiple conjugation of these peptides to carrier proteins not only enhances TGF-β antagonist activity but also confers partial TGF-β agonist activity (10Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since Aβ contains a motif (FAED) that is similar to the putative TGF-β active-site motif (WS X D) and since Aβ aggregates would provide multivalencies with many copies of the putative active-site motif (11Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that the Aβ monomer and Aβ aggregates may function as TGF-β antagonist and partial TGF-β agonist, analogous to previously described monovalent and multivalent TGF-β peptide antagonist/partial agonist, respectively (10Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we investigated the TGF-β antagonist/agonist activity of the Aβ-(1–40) monomer and Aβ-(1–40)-bovine serum albumin conjugate (Aβ-(1–40)-BSA) which contains ∼5–10 Aβ-(1–40) peptides per molecule of protein and mimics Aβ aggregates in multivalencies (11Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). In this communication, we demonstrate that Aβ-(1–40) monomers inhibited125I-labeled TGF-β1 binding to cell-surface TGF-β receptors in mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells). We also show that Aβ-(1–40)-BSA exhibited a potent cytotoxicity toward bovine cerebral endothelial (BCE) cells and rat post-mitotic differentiated hippocampal neuronal cells (H19-7 cells), and strongly inhibited 125I-TGF-β binding to cell-surface TGF-β receptors and TGF-β-induced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Aβ-(1–40)-BSA but not Aβ-(1–40) monomers inhibited cellular proliferation of Mv1Lu cells.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAβ and its fragments have been found to exert cytotoxic and trophic effects on cells in culture. Aβ-(25–35) mimics the cytotoxic activity of Aβ (5Yankner B. Duffy L. Kirschner D. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar), whereas Aβ-(1–28), Aβ-(25–28), and Aβ-(1–40) exhibit acetylcholine release inhibitory activity (4Auld D.S. Kar S. Quirion R. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 43-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The sequence of VFF (residues 18–20) has been implicated in mediating the amnestic activity of Aβ fragments (17Flood J.F. Morley J.E. Roberts E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3363-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These cytotoxic and trophic effects of Aβ appear to be mediated by different domains,e.g. the sequences of residues 25–35, 25–28, and 18–20 (4Auld D.S. Kar S. Quirion R. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 43-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 5Yankner B. Duffy L. Kirschner D.

A. 1991; 88: 3363-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We noted that, in addition to these domains, Aβ possesses a motif (FAED, 20th to 23rd amino acid residues), which is similar to theWS X D putative TGF-β active-site motif. Known TGF-β peptide antagonists β125-(41–65) and β225-(41–65) that contain this motif are synthetic peptides with amino acid sequences corresponding to the 41st to 65th residues of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2, respectively (Fig. 1) (10Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Replacement of the tryptophan residue in the motif by a phenylalanine residue does not affect the antagonist activity of β125-(41–65). 2S. S. Huang, F. W. Huang, and J. S. Huang, unpublished results.Thus, the FAED in the Aβ monomer may be a functional TGF-β active-site motif. To test this possibility, we determined the effects of Aβ-(1–40) monomers and Aβ fragments possessing and lacking the FAED motif on125I-TGF-β1 binding to cell-surface TGF-β receptors in Mv1Lu cells, a standard model system for investigating TGF-β receptor types and TGF-β-induced cellular responses (12Liu Q.

As shown in Fig. 2, Aβ-(1–40), and Aβ-(12–28), both of which contain the motif, exhibited125I-TGF-β1 receptor binding inhibitory activities with IC50 of ∼3 and ∼30 μm, respectively. Aβ-(25–35), Aβ-(1–20), and Aβ-(1–16), all of which lack the motif, failed to show125I-TGF-β1 binding inhibitory activity at any concentration up to 30 μm. These results indicate that Aβ-(1–40) possesses a functional TGF-β active-site motif.Figure 2Effects of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ fragments on125I-TGF-β1 binding in Mv1Lu cells.Cells were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-TGF-β1 and various concentrations of Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(12–28), Aβ-(25–35), Aβ-(1–20), and Aβ-(1–16) at 0 °C for 2.5 h.

In order to produce a multivalent stable inhibitor, we prepared Aβ-(1–40)-bovine serum albumin conjugate (Aβ-(1–40)-BSA,M r ∼90,000–100,000) containing ∼5–10 Aβ-(1–40) per molecule of BSA according to the procedure of Huang,et al.

Unlike the rather unstable Aβ-(1–40) aggregates, Aβ-(1–40)-BSA is stable (at 4 °C) for at least a few weeks and has a consistent valence due to the covalent nature of the attachment of Aβ-(1–40) to BSA. This conjugate is meant to mimic Aβ-(1–40) aggregates by possessing multiple valences of Aβ-(1–40) per molecule and cytotoxicity toward BCE cells and rat postmitotic differentiated H19-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, Aβ-(1–40)-BSA exhibited cytotoxicity toward BCE cells and H19-7 cells that was ∼670 times more potent than that of the Aβ-(1–40) monomer (Fig. 3, Aand B).

As shown in Fig. 4 A, Aβ-(1–40)-BSA inhibited 125I-TGF-β1 binding to cell-surface TGF-β receptors with an IC50 of ∼30 nm. This is 100-fold more potent than Aβ-(1–40) monomers. The BSA conjugate of Aβ-(12–28), which contains theFAED motif, showed somewhat weaker125I-TGF-β1 binding inhibitory activity (IC50 ∼ 0.3 μm). The BSA conjugates of the Aβ-(1–16) and Aβ-(25–35) fragments, which lack the motif, did not inhibit 125I-TGF-β1 binding. In control experiments, BSA subjected to conjugation conditions without peptide also had no inhibitory activity (10Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

We therefore examined the TGF-β agonist activity of Aβ-(1–40)-BSA by measuring its inhibition of DNA synthesis using Mv1Lu cells. As shown in Fig. 5 A, 0.35 μm of multivalent Aβ-(1–40)-BSA produced ∼35% inhibition of [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of Mv1Lu cells. Neither Aβ-(1–40) monomers (0.35 μm) nor BSA conjugated in the absence of peptide (at any concentration up to 10 μm) affected DNA synthesis in this system. The DNA synthesis inhibition induced by 0.35 μm Aβ-(1–40)-BSA was blocked in the presence of 10 μm β125-(41–65), a specific TGF-β peptide antagonist (data not shown). These results suggest that multiple valencies of Aβ-(1–40) confer TGF-β agonist activity,i.e. inhibit cellular proliferation as measured by DNA synthesis. To support this suggestion, we determined the effect of Aβ-(1–40)-BSA on DNA synthesis of type I TGF-β receptor-defective mutant and wild-type mink lung epithelial cells (R1B and Mv1Lu cells) (12Liu Q.

If the DNA synthesis inhibition by Aβ-(1–40)-BSA is mediated by cell surface TGF-β receptors, R1B cells, which lack expression of the functional type I TGF-β receptor (12Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S.

As shown in Table I, Aβ-(1–40)-BSA did not significantly affect DNA synthesis of R1B cells. This result is consistent with the suggestion that the Aβ-(1–40)-BSA exhibits TGF-β agonist activity in growth inhibition.Figure 5Effects of BSA conjugates of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ fragments on DNA synthesis (A) and TGF-β1-induced PAI-1 expression (B) in Mv1Lu cells. A, cells were incubated with various concentrations of Aβ-(1–40) and BSA conjugates of Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(12–28), Aβ-(25–35), and Aβ-(1–20) at 37 °C for 16 h. DNA synthesis was determined by measuring [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA. The [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporations in the presence and absence of 10 pmTGF-β1 were taken as 100 and 0% inhibition (2,242 ± 679 and 25,493 ± 1,200 cpm/well, respectively). Theerror bars are means ± S.D. of triplicate cell cultures. The data are representative of six experiments which gave comparable results. B, cells were treated with 0.5 pm TGF-β1 in the presence of various concentrations of Aβ-(1–40)-BSA at 37 °C for 2 h. PAI-1 expression was determined by Northern blot analysis.

To determine whether Aβ-(1–40)-BSA interferes with this effect, Mv1Lu cells were treated with 0.5 pm TGF-β1 plus various concentrations of Aβ-(1–40)-BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. Northern blot analysis was then performed. As shown in Fig. 5 B, Aβ-(1–40)-BSA did not stimulate the expression of PAI-1 (lane 2 versus lane 1). However, Aβ-(1–40)-BSA diminished the PAI-1 expression stimulated by 0.5 pmTGF-β in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 4–6). This suggests that Aβ-(1–40)-BSA can bind to TGF-β receptors and function as an antagonist for TGF-β as assayed by transcriptional activation.In summary, Aβ-(1–40)-BSA is a stable multivalent analogue of naturally occurring Aβ aggregates seen in Alzheimer's disease lesions and is more potent than Aβ-(1–40) as a TGF-β antagonist that blocks TGF-β binding to TGF-β receptors. The cytotoxicity of Aβ-(1–40)-BSA toward BCE cells and H19-7 cells is ∼670 times more potent than that of Aβ-(1–40). Furthermore, Aβ-(1–40)-BSA, which has multiple Aβ-(1–40) peptides per BSA molecule, possesses partial TGF-β agonist activity (growth inhibition). These results suggest that Aβ monomers and Aβ aggregates may participate in the pathogenesis of neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease patients through their TGF-β antagonist and agonist activities. TGF-β has been shown to protect neurons from cell death (28Finch C. Laping N.J. Morgan T.E. Nichols N.R. Pasinetti G.M. J. Cell.

As both glial cells and monocytes have been shown to express TGF-β (35Peress N.S. Perillo E. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

The mutations in both FAD (A692G) and Dutch-type (E693Q) patients may provide a TGF-β active-site motif with particularly robust function on the basis of studies of various motifs in synthetic TGF-β peptide antagonists2 (10Huang S.S.

If the 2nd and 3rd amino acid residues in the motif are amino acids with small side chains (Gly, Ser, Cys, and Ala residues) and noncharged amino acids, respectively, in the TGF-β peptide antagonist motif (W XX D), the potency of TGF-β antagonism is enhanced. Determining the TGF-β activities of FAD and Dutch-type Aβ mutant peptides would test the hypothesis that the TGF-β activities of these peptides are important in the mechanism of Aβ in the neuronal degeneration of Alzheimer's disease.

The deposition of Aβ aggregates (fibrils) is believed to be an early and critical event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms by which Aβ aggregates exert their detrimental effects are not well understood, but may involve effects through interactions with specific cell-surface receptors or binding proteins. Several receptors and binding proteins have been reported to interact with Aβ, but none appears to be able to discriminate Aβ monomers from Aβ aggregates (7Yan S.D. Chen X. Fu J. Chen M. Zhu H.

This uPA-dependent proteolytic cascade is regulated by a complex network of interactions between specific domains of the protease and other macromolecules, such as plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1, PAI-2 and others), a specific receptor (uPAR) and extracellullar matrix components (vitronectin) (2Vassalli J.D.

Urokinase consists of an NH2-terminal region sharing considerable homology with epidermal growth factor, a central kringle and a short proteolytically sensitive region which precedes a large carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain (8Patthy L Cell. 1983; 41: 657-663Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 9Nowak U.K. Li X.

Whether soluble or receptor-bound, prourokinase (pro-uPA) is a zymogen that undergoes extracellular activation via the cleavage of the Lys158–Ile159 bond, thereby yielding a two-chain active urokinase capable of reacting with the inhibitors (10Andreasen P.A.

Recent evidence indicates that receptor-bound pro-uPA may fulfill additional functions besides those strictly dependent on its catalytic activity. Ligation of uPAR with uPA or with its noncatalytic amino-terminal fragment ATF (amino acids 1–135) stimulates intracellular biochemical pathways leading to a cellular response, which may involve changes in gene expression, protein phosphorylation, adhesion, migration, and metabolism. In particular, ligand-dependent uPAR activation leads to increased motility or adherence of myelomonocytic cell lines (12Waltz D.A. Sailor L.Z. Chapman H.A J. Clin.

In particular, protein kinase C (PKC), which belongs to an ubiquitous family of key regulatory isoenzymes in cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, carcinogenesis, and metastasis, regulates the uPA system at multiple levels (17Nishizuka Y Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 18Dekker L.V.

It is known that PKC activation induces pro-uPA mRNA synthesis through a composite polyoma enhancer activator 3/activator protein 1 site located about 2 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site in a variety of cell types, such as macrophages, keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and neurons, suggesting a highly conserved mechanism (19Stoppelli M.P.

Taken together, these observations point to a complex network of interactions that link in vivo protein kinase C activation and regulation of urokinase function and localization. Urokinase function is also subjected to post-translational control; we found that the human proenzyme undergoes intracellular serine phosphorylation in A431 human carcinoma cells, resulting in a reduction of its sensitivity to the inhibitor PAI-1 (22Mastronicola M.R.

According to other reports, phosphorylated urinary urokinase activates plasminogen with a greater catalytic efficiency and is neither inhibited by PAI-1 nor by PAI-2 (25Takahashi K. Kwaan H.C. Ikeo K. Koh E Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1466-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Receptor-bound urokinase is phosphorylated on tyrosine and serine residues in a human metastatic carcinomatous cell line (26Takahashi K. Kwaan H.C. Koh E. Tanabe M Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Recent data from this laboratory indicate that two phosphorylation sites are located within the A and B chains of pro-uPA (Ser138/303) from A431 human carcinoma cells and that pro-uPA phosphorylation renders the protease unable to activate uPAR-dependent signaling in myeloid cells (29Franco P. Iaccarino C. Chiaradonna F. Brandazza A. Iavarone C. Mastronicola M.R. Nolli M.L. Stoppelli M.P J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the nonsignaling serine phosphorylated pro-uPA binds to uPAR with unaltered affinity, such as a naturally occurring competitive antagonist (29Franco P. Iaccarino C. Chiaradonna F.

In this work, we attempted to shed light on the generation of such a molecule by analyzing the kinase pathway that directs pro-uPA phosphorylation on Ser138/303 in vivo. First, we report that protein kinase C from rat brain is able to directly modify Ser138 and/or Ser139 in vitro. Second, we show that in vivo modulation of protein kinase C activity regulates the extent of pro-uPA phosphorylation on Ser138/303 in the A431-P1 cell line. Finally, we present evidence that PKC-dependent in vivophosphorylation of pro-uPA, as well as the replacement of Ser138 with a glutamic acid residue, markedly inhibit pro-uPA signaling ability, yet do not alter receptor binding.

Pro-uPA was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography of the A431-P1 cell conditioned medium with 5B4 monoclonal antibody, according to a previously described procedure with minor modifications (4Stoppelli M.P.

Cassani G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1986; 56: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Purification of histidine-tagged mutant pro-uPA (His-pro-uPA138E) was performed from the conditioned medium of HeLa-stable transfectants, as described previously (29Franco P. Iaccarino C. Chiaradonna F. Brandazza A. Iavarone C. Mastronicola M.R. Nolli M.L. Stoppelli M.P J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In both cases, degradation and dephosphorylation was inhibited by including in all buffers the following inhibitors: 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 mmNaF, 10 mm orthovanadate, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20. Immunoaffinity purified pro-uPA was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and analyzed by 12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by autoradiography (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C was purified from rat brain about 200-fold to a specific activity of 1,200 units/mg (32Walsh M.P. Valentine K.A. Ngai C.A. Carruthers C.A. Hollenberg M.D Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 15 μg of pro-uPA or related proteins were phosphorylated with 2 units of PKC in 50 mm Tris, 2 mm EGTA, 7 mmMgCl2, 4 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 200 ng/ml PMA, 1 μm ATP, and 200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/ml for 30 min at 37 °C (33Kikkawa U. Kishimoto A. Nishizuka Y Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The in vitro phosphorylation assay of synthetic peptides was carried out for 3 h. Protein kinase C from Promega (Madison, MO) or from Boehringer Mannheim were employed under the same conditions with similar results. 600 μg of in vitro phosphorylated recombinant 32P-pro-uPA were treated with 15 μg/ml plasminogen (containing about 10% plasmin) for 5 h at 37 °C and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid.32P-pro-uPA was resuspended at 2 mg/ml in 6 mguanidine HCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and incubated with an excess of 5 m dithiothreitol over the total number of cysteines for 4 h at 40 °C under N2 flux. Carboxymethylation was performed with 15 m iodoacetic acid for 1 h at 4 °C under N2 flux. The samples were then desalted on a C8 RP-HPLC column with a 3-cm RP-HPLC Guard Holder pre-column using a 60-min linear 0–100% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid (flow rate 1 ml/min); absorbance of the eluted fractions was monitored at 280 nm, and radioactivity was determined by measuring Cerenkov radiation. Radioactive fractions were subjected to sequencing. In vitro 32P-phosphorylated pro-uPA was recovered by centrifugation following precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and subjected to enzymatic digestion with plasmin for 30 min at 37 °C, in the presence of 1.4 μg/ml plasminogen (containing about 10% plasmin) in the buffer employed for the in vitrophosphorylation reaction. The reaction with plasmin was stopped with 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, 15% gel, under reducing conditions. Peptides DGKKPSSPPEE and KENSTDYPEWQLK were synthesized on an automatic solid phase peptide synthesizer and purified by RP-HPLC on a Nova Pack C18 column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water using a Waters 501 apparatus. Peptides were eluted using a 60-min linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and were detected by absorbance at 215 nm. In vitro phosphorylated32P-peptides were purified by RP-HPLC as described above. The radioactivity associated with each fraction was determined on a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Histidine tagged pro-uPA variant S138E (His-pro-uPA138E) was obtained, stably expressed in HeLa cells, and purified as described previously (29Franco P. Iaccarino C. Chiaradonna F. Brandazza A. Iavarone C. Mastronicola M.R. Nolli M.L. Stoppelli M.P J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing U937 cells were diluted to 0.4 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI, 10% FBS and treated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β, 50 nm dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the presence of 10% FBS for 20 h. Then, 1 × 105 cells/sample were incubated in 24-multiwell plates with 0.2 nm of the indicated effectors (unless otherwise specified) for 30 min at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells, harvested by pipetting, and adherent cells, removed with 0.05% trypsin, were counted in a hemocytometer. The number of adherent cells is expressed as percentage of the total cell number and represents an average from three different experiments performed in duplicate. The assays were performed using Boyden chambers with 5-μm pore size polycarbonate filters coated with collagen type I, according to Resnati et al. (13Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 105 U937 cells were applied to the upper compartment in serum-free RPMI. Effectors were diluted in culture medium at the indicated concentrations and added to the lower compartment; the chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Then the filters were removed, fixed, and stained. The cells on the lower side of the filter were counted and reported as a percentage of the basal random migration in the absence of chemoattractant. We have previously reported that pro-uPA undergoes in vivo phosphorylation on Ser138/303 (29Franco P. Iaccarino C. Chiaradonna F. Brandazza A. Iavarone C. Mastronicola M.R. Nolli M.L. Stoppelli M.P J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequences surrounding the mapped serines suggests that Ser138 is included in a recognition site for serine/threonine kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and casein kinase II (34Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). However, purified preparations of these kinases failed to phosphorylate in vitro pro-uPA fromE. coli, under standard reaction conditions (not shown). On the contrary, when recombinant pro-uPA was incubated with rat brain PKC in the presence of 1 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 150 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 200 ng/ml PMA, a specific phosphorylation reaction was observed. As shown in Fig. 1 A, prourokinase incorporates [32P]phosphate in the presence of PKC, whereas no phosphorylation occurs in its absence, and a dramatic reduction of the resulting specific activity was observed in the presence of H-7 or bisindolylmaleimide or a myristoylated PKC (19Stoppelli M.P.

As expected, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD-98059 did not inhibit pro-uPA phosphorylation by PKC. The Coomassie staining of the gel revealed equal amounts of recombinant pro-uPA in all samples (Fig. 1 B). In control samples, phosphorylation of histone H1 yielded a strongly labeled band of about 35 kDa, whereas bovine serum albumin was not phosphorylated (not shown). Under the same conditions, prourokinase purified from the conditioned medium of the A431-P1 cell line overexpressing human pro-uPA (23Mastronicola M.R. Franco P. De Cesare D. Massa O. Stoppelli M.P Fibrinolysis. 1992; 6: 117-120Google Scholar) is also modified by PKC (not shown). The susceptibility of A431-P1 pro-uPA to in vitro phosphorylation is not surprising, as we have previously shown that about half of the secreted molecules are not phosphorylated, neither on A nor on B chain (24Franco P. Mastronicola M.R. De Cesare D. Nolli M.L. Wun T.C. Verde P. Blasi F. Stoppelli M.P J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19369-19372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the protease domain(s) modified by PKC, in vitrophosphorylated 32P-recombinant pro-uPA was subjected to limited proteolytic degradation with plasmin, which cleaves the Lys158–Ile159 bond, thereby generating two fragments. Under these conditions, all the radioactivity previously incorporated in the intact 45-kDa protein was retained by the 18-kDa amino-terminal fragment (Fig. 2 A). Accordingly, incubation of preactivated recombinant pro-uPA with PKC results in the exclusive phosphorylation of the 18-kDa fragment (Fig. 2 A). In both cases, the stronger intensity of the 18-kDa fragments compared with the single-chain 45-kDa pro-uPA suggests that the PKC target region may undergo a conformational change following activation. To further restrict the analysis, Δ125 (35Orsini G. Brandazza A. Sarmientos P. Molinari A. Lansen J. Cauet G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and a proteolytic fragment comprising the amino acids 1–135 (ATF) were employed as substrates (depicted in Fig. 2 C). Δ125 was highly susceptible to PKC-dependent phosphorylation, whereas ATF was slightly modified either in the presence of Δ125 or in its absence (Fig. 2 B). These results, taken together, strongly suggest that the major phosphorylation site is located between amino acids 135 and 158, as this region is included in Δ125 and in the A chain of plasmin-cleaved pro-uPA but is not in the ATF. Analysis of the 135–158 region reveals three potential phosphate acceptors, two serine residues at 138 and 139 and a threonine residue at 152 (Fig. 2 C). However, amino acid analysis of in vitro phosphorylated recombinant 32P-pro-uPA exclusively showed the occurrence of 32P-phosphoserine, suggesting that PKC indeed modifies Ser138 and/or Ser139 (not shown). The latter possibility is in agreement with the results of an experiment in which recombinant pro-uPA was first phosphorylated with PKC in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, then extensively digested with plasmin, reduced, and carboxymethylated (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting peptides were fractionated by RP-HPLC, and the fractions containing radioactivity were subjected to sequencing. The most abundant radiolabeled peptide was eluted in fraction 114 (Fig. 3) and showed the amino-terminal sequence PSSPPEEL …, in agreement with Ser138/139 being the predominant phosphate acceptor. Confirmatory data were obtained with a peptide corresponding to pro-uPA residues 133–143 (DGKKPSSPPEE), which was included as a substrate in an in vitro phosphorylation reaction with PKC (see “Experimental Procedures”). In Fig. 4 A, the position of the substrate peptide within the pro-uPA molecule is depicted. In this case, the 32P-phosphorylated products were separated onto a HPLC column, and two radioactive fractions were obtained, the first eluted in the void volume of the column, corresponding to non incorporated [γ-32P]ATP and the second containing the32P-phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 4 B). Under the same conditions, peptide KENSTDYPEWQLK, which is a substrate for casein kinase II, did not exibit a second peak, indicating that it was not appreciably modified by PKC (not shown). The activity of protein kinase C can be modulatedin vivo by different effectors, which may consequently affect pro-uPA phosphorylation state. This possibility was tested in a set of experiments in which PKC activity was stimulated with 100 ng/ml PMA or down-regulated either by a prolonged treatment with 1 μg/ml PMA or with the kinase inhibitor H-7. A431-P1 cells were metabolically labeled either with [32P]orthophosphate to assess pro-uPA phosphorylation level or with [35S]methionine to ensure an internal"

Until now, the substrate specificity of the purified forms of these enzymes has not been reported. This study reports on the purification of the cIGnT6 from hog small intestine by successive column chromatographies on CM-Sepharose FF, Ni2+-chelating Sepharose FF, and UDP-hexanolamine-agarose, using pyridylaminated lacto-N-neotetraose (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc-PA) as an acceptor substrate, the product of which was Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAcβ1–6)Galβ1–4Glc-PA. By using several acceptor compounds, this purified enzyme was shown to have an absolute requirement for a complete LacNAc residue bound to position 3 of the acceptor galactose residue for its activity. Consequently, it was devoid of dIGnT6 activity. Materials were obtained from the following suppliers: UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucronic acid, UDP-hexanolamine, UDP-hexanolamine-agarose (ligand concentration: 2.4 μmol/ml), UDP, UMP, UTP, AMP, GDP, and maltohexaose from Sigma; CM-Sepharose FF, Q-Sepharose FF, chelating Sepharose FF, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, and Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden); Tris, MES, and MOPS from Nacalai tesque (Kyoto, Japan); Triton X-100, pAPMSF, glycine, DTT, and metal chlorides from Wako (Osaka, Japan); EDTA and heptylthioglucoside from Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan); lacto-N-neotetraose, lacto-N-tetraose, lacto-N-hexaose, and jack bean β-galactosidase from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan);N-acetylgalactosaminodecamer from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA); Bio-Gel P-4 from Bio-Rad. UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose 4B (ligand concentration over 8 μmol/ml) was prepared according to a previously reported method (18Hashimoto Y. Sekine M. Iwasaki K. Suzuki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25857-25864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The numbering and structures of key oligosaccharides are shown in Table I. Glycans 1, 2, and 3 were synthesized essentially as described previously (15Leppänen A. Salminen H. Zhu Y. Maaheimo H. Helin J. Costello C.E. Renkonen O.

GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc-PA was prepared by digestion of lacto-N-neotetraose-PA with jack bean β-galactosidase. GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAcβ1–6)Galβ1–4Glc-PA and Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3(GlcNAcβ1–6)Galβ1–4Glc-PA were prepared by complete or partial digestion of lacto-N-hexaose-PA with jack bean β-galactosidase.Table IStructures of the acceptor and the product oligosaccharides Open table in a new tab β1–6GnT activity was assayed according to the method of Gu et al. (13Gu J. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Gasa S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2994-2999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The standard incubation mixture contained the following components in a total volume of 10 μl; 200 mmMOPS buffer (pH 7.0), 10 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml BSA, 20 μmlacto-N-neotetraose-PA, and enzyme fraction (3 μl). After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, 40 μl of water was added, and the enzyme reaction was quenched by boiling for 1 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, 10 μl of the supernatant from the reaction mixture was applied to a TSK-gel ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 250 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). The elution was performed at 50 °C using an eluent of 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 4.0) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fluorescence was monitored with excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 400 nm, respectively. The specific activity of the enzyme was expressed as picomoles of product/hour/mg of protein. The protein concentration was determined with a BCA kit (Pierce) or a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) using BSA as the standard. The buffers used in this paper were as follows, with the pH measured at 4 °C: Buffer A, 0.25 m sucrose, 100 μm pAPMSF, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4); Buffer B, 20% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 100 μm pAPMSF, 10 mm MES (pH 6.5); Buffer C, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm MES (pH 6.0); Buffer D, 0.8 m NaCl/Buffer C; Buffer E, 0.3m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0); Buffer F, 0.2 mglycine/Buffer E; Buffer G, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0); Buffer H, 0.5m NaCl/Buffer G; Buffer I, 25 mm EDTA/Buffer H; Buffer J, 20% glycerol, 1% heptylthioglucoside, 0.5 mNaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0); Buffer K, 4 mm UDP/Buffer J; Buffer L, 20% glycerol, 1% heptylthioglucoside, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0). All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Frozen hog small intestine (127 g) was homogenized with a Waring blendor in 4 volumes of Buffer A. After centrifugation at 900 × gfor 10 min, the supernatant was pooled, and the pellet was subjected to two more extractions, after which all the supernatants were combined. After centrifugation at 78,000 × g for 2 h, the microsomal fraction was obtained as a precipitate. The microsomal fraction was suspended in 3 volumes of Buffer B, gently stirred for 2 h, and then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant fraction was collected, and the residual pellet was subjected to another extraction followed by ultracentrifugation. The first and the second Triton extracts were combined and used for further enzyme purification. Three volumes of Buffer C was added to the combined Triton X-100 extracts and then applied to the column of CM-Sepharose FF (5.0 × 14.5 cm), which had been equilibrated with Buffer C. The column was washed with Buffer C until the protein concentration was reduced to below 0.05 mg/ml. The elution was carried out with a linear gradient between 850 ml of Buffer C and 850 ml of Buffer D. The fractions containing β1–6GnT activity were combined. An equivalent volume of Buffer E was added to the pooled enzyme fraction from the CM-Sepharose FF column chromatography step and then loaded on a column of Ni2+-chelating Sepharose FF (2.5 × 8.2 cm), which had been equilibrated with Buffer E. Ni2+-chelating Sepharose resin was layered on the chelating Sepharose FF resin without metal ions (2.5 × 4.1 cm), to avoid any possible leakage of Ni2+ into the enzyme fractions. The β1–6GnT activity was completely bound to the column. After washing the column with Buffer E until the protein concentration was reduced to below 0.02 mg/ml, β1–6GnT activity was eluted with a linear gradient between 200 ml of Buffer E and 200 ml of Buffer F. The fractions that contained β1–6GnT activity were pooled, and the buffer in this fraction was replaced by Buffer G by means of an Amicon Diaflow Ultrafiltrater using a YM 30 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA) (the final volume of this concentrated fraction was 42 ml). After the above step, the column was siliconized with Sigmacote (Sigma) and siliconized tubes (Assist, Tokyo, Japan) were used for fractionation. The UDP-hexanolamine-agarose column (1.5 × 15 cm) had been equilibrated with Buffer G, and the concentrated enzyme fraction from the Ni2+-chelating Sepharose FF column chromatography was applied to the column, followed by washing with 90 ml of Buffer G, 90 ml of Buffer H, 90 ml of Buffer I, and 90 ml of Buffer J. The elution was performed using a linear gradient between 90 ml of Buffer J and 90 ml of Buffer K. The fractions containing β1–6GnT activity were pooled. This buffer in this fraction was replaced by Buffer L by means of a Centriprep-30 (Amicon) to deplete UDP and NaCl (the final volume of this concentrated fraction was 2 ml). This fraction was used for the enzyme characterization. The concentrated enzyme fraction was applied to a UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose 4B column (1.0 × 14.5 cm), which had been equilibrated with Buffer L, followed by washing with 10 ml of Buffer L and 30 ml of Buffer J. The elution was performed with a gradient of up to 20 mm UDP-GlcNAc in Buffer J. In total, 70 fractions (fraction volume 1.2 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 10% gels. Molecular weight markers (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) were used for size standards. Proteins in the gels were stained by a silver staining kit (2D silver stain II “DAIICHI”; Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). The activity of β1–6GnT was assayed in the standard assay mixture when pyridylaminated sugar substrates were used. When glycans 1, 2, and 3 (Table I) were used as the acceptor substrates, the enzyme reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 48 h in a total volume of 25 μl containing 100 nmol of acceptor oligosaccharide, 3.6 μmol of UDP-GlcNAc, 200 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 20 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm ATP, 2 mg/ml BSA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 8 mmNaN3, and the enzyme fraction (12.5 μl). The reactions were terminated by heating at 100 °C for 5 min, followed by passage through a mixed bed of Dowex AG1 (AcO−) and Dowex AG50 (H+). The products were further purified by chromatography on a column of Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column (10 × 300 mm, equilibrated with water or 50 mmNH4HCO3) with a flow rate of 0.5 or 1 ml/min or on a column of Bio-Gel P-4 (1 × 145 cm, equilibrated with water, fraction volume 1.5 ml). The progress of the elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 205 nm. Oligosaccharide samples (5 nmol) were digested with endo-β-galactosidase from Bacteroides fragilis (EC 3.2.1.103) (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) essentially as described by Leppänen et al. (17Leppänen A. Penttilä L. Niemelä R. Helin J. Seppo A. Lusa S. Renkonen O. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9287-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The digests were desalted by treatment with an ion-exchange resin and purified further by gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column by pooling together the eluate fractions corresponding to the oligosaccharide area from octasaccharide to GlcNAc. In a parallel control experiment, authentic GlcNAcβ1–3′LacNAcβ1–3′(GlcNAcβ1–6′)LacNAc was cleaved completely into GlcNAcβ1–3Gal and GlcNAcβ1–3′(GlcNAcβ1–6′)LacNAc as analyzed by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). One-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra of the oligosaccharides were recorded at 23 °C in D2O at 500 MHz on a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer as described by Leppänen et al.(15Leppänen A. Salminen H. Zhu Y. Maaheimo H. Helin J. Costello C.E. Renkonen O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7026-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF MS was performed in the positive-ion delayed extraction mode with a BIFLEXTM mass spectrometer (Bruken-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany), using a 337 nm nitrogen laser. 1 μl of aqueous sample solution (10 pmol) and 1.5 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix (10 mg/ml in water) were mixed on the target plate and dried under a gentle stream of air. Maltohexaose and N-acetylgalactosaminodecamer were used for external calibration. The activity of β1–6GnT was assayed using lacto-N-neotetraose-PA, basically according to the method of Gu et al. (13Gu J. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Gasa S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2994-2999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BSA (2 mg/ml) was found to be effective in preserving enzyme activity at 37 °C, especially for the highly purified enzyme fraction (Step 5 and Step 6). The activity of this fraction was 3.8-fold higher than that under the assay conditions in the absence of BSA, and as a result, BSA was routinely included in the standard assay mixture. Hog small intestine was chosen as an enzyme source, based on the following two criteria. First, a survey of various hog and rat tissues revealed that intestine showed the highest enzyme activity per tissue protein (13Gu J. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Gasa S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2994-2999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, hog intestine, which has levels of enzyme activity comparable with rat intestine, was more convenient in terms of cost and quantity. Like other GnTs, β1–6GnT was concentrated in the microsome fraction. However, 20% of the β1–6GnT activity in the homogenate was found in the cytosolic fraction after ultracentrifugation, suggesting the occurrence of some proteolysis. β1–6GnT from the microsome fraction was solubilized by Triton X-100 more effectively at pH 6.5 than at pH 9.0. More than half of the β1–6GnT activity failed to bind to CM-Sepharose FF (Fig. 1 A), and this flow-through fraction also failed to bind to CM-Sepharose FF (pH 6.0), Ni2+-chelating Sepharose FF, and Q-Sepharose FF (pH 9.0), none of which was found to be effective for purification. As a result, we used the NaCl eluted fraction for further experiments. The majority of proteins were separated from the β1–6GnT activity by the CM-Sepharose FF and Ni2+-chelating Sepharose FF column chromatography (Fig. 1 B). After the Ni2+-chelating Sepharose FF column chromatography (Step 4), β1–6GnT activity was more stable than in Step 2 and Step 3. Different from GnT III and GnT IV (21Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Oguri S. Minowa M.T. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), no β1–6GnT activity was detected after Cu2+-chelating column chromatography. The most effective step for purification was affinity column chromatography (Step 5, Fig. 1 C). The majority of the enzyme activity bound to the UDP-hexanolamine-agarose column and was eluted very sharply by UDP (about 1 mm) as a competitive ligand. The addition of DTT (0.5 mm) was about 3.3 times more effective on the activity of the eluted enzyme fraction in Step 5 compared with that without DTT, while it was without effect on the enzyme activity in Step 4. The eluted enzyme fraction in Step 5 showed two bands with molecular weights of 76,000 and 60,000 on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, followed by silver staining (Fig. 2 A). No activity of GnT III, IV, V, and iGnT (β1–3GnT) was detected in this fraction. All experiments for enzyme characterization described below were performed using this enzyme fraction. Table IIsummarizes the purification of β1–6GnT, which was purified by 210,000-fold by Steps 1–5. The second affinity column chromatography (Step 6) was used to determine which band was β1–6GnT, although a complete separation of these two bands was not achieved. Two fractions (fraction 57 and 63), which contained almost the same enzyme activity (24 pmol/h/ml), were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with silver (Fig. 2 B). Only the upper band (76 kDa) showed the same intensity between the two fractions, indicating that the 76 kDa band was β1–6GnT.Figure 2SDS-PAGE of β1–6GnT.

The effects of divalent cations on β1–6GnT activity were examined in a reaction mixture composed of 200 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0), 10 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml BSA, 20 μm lacto-N-neotetraose-PA, and 10 mm metal chlorides or EDTA. The activity of β1–6GnT was not dependent on metal ions. MgCl2, CaCl2, and MnCl2 had no effect on β1–6GnT activity, and NiCl2, ZnCl2, and CuCl2 inhibited enzyme activity. To investigate which portion of UDP-GlcNAc was important for enzyme activity, several UDP-GlcNAc analogues (2 mm) were added to the assay mixture containing 0.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc. These results are shown in Table III. UDP and UTP were the most potent inhibitors. The uracil moiety appeared to be essential for the enzyme activity, as evidenced by a comparison of UMP and AMP and of UDP and GDP. The comparison of UMP, UDP, and UTP suggests that the number of phosphodiesters might be important for inhibition. Sugar nucleotides having a UDP moiety also inhibited the enzyme activity, including UDP-hexanolamine which was used as an affinity ligand in Steps 5 and 6.Table IIIThe effects of donor substrate analogues on β1–6GnT activityDonor substrate analoguesActivity%No addition100UMP59UDP0UTP0UDP-glucose49UDP-galactose58UDP-hexanolamine34UDP-glucronic acid64AMP90GDP81The enzyme activity was assayed in the reaction mixture of 200 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 % Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml BSA, 20 μm lacto-N-neotetraose-PA, 0.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc, and 2 mm analogues.

Activity is expressed as percent of the activity observed in the absence of analogue. Acceptor substrate and site specificity of the β1–6GnT was examined by using a set of oligo-N-acetyllactosamines as shown in Table I. Tetrasaccharide1 (100 nmol) and UDP-GlcNAc were incubated together with the purified β1–6GnT. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the purified reaction mixture showed sodiated molecular ions of the Gal2GlcNAc3-product (58%) and the Gal2GlcNAc2-acceptor (42%) (Fig. 3 A). The pentasaccharide product was separated from the acceptor by gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column. The purity of the isolated pentasaccharide fraction was 95% as estimated by MALDI-TOF MS. Endo-β-galactosidase treatment failed to cleave the product; the reaction mixture contained only the uncleaved pentasaccharide as assessed by MALDI-TOF MS, indicating that the newly linked GlcNAc residue must be attached to the midchain galactosyl residue rather than to the terminal galactose (23Scudder P. Hanfland P. Uemura K. Feizi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6586-6592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of the pentasaccharide product (Fig. 4 A, Table IV) is identical with the spectrum previously reported for the authentic pentasaccharide 4(24Maaheimo H. Räbinä J. Renkonen O. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 297: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In particular, a doublet with the typical chemical shift and coupling constant (4.584 ppm, 8.3 Hz) of the β1,6-linked GlcNAc H1 is present in the spectrum of the pentasaccharide product, and the chemical shifts of Gal2 H1 and Gal2 H4 are characteristic to a 3,6-disubstituted Gal, while Gal4 H1 has a chemical shift typical for a terminal galactosyl residue. If the branch-forming GlcNAc had been transferred to C-2 or C-4 of Gal2 of tetrasaccharide 1, the H1 resonances of the new GlcNAc unit and the other reporter group signals of the pentasaccharide product would have been distinctly different from those of pentasaccharide 4 (25Sabesan S.

https://openalex.org/W2032382958,"The central nervous system expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) is restricted to oligodendrocytes and is developmentally regulated; these regulatory features are transcriptionally mediated. We have previously shown that the proximal 149 nucleotides of the MBP promoter were both necessary and sufficient to activate the transcription of MBP in cultured oligodendrocytes, but not in other cell types. Sequences within the distal portion of this promoter, which contains a nuclear factor 1 (NF1) binding site, repressed activation of the MBP promoter in Cos-7 cells, but not in oligodendrocytes. We now describe a sequence upstream of and partially overlapping the NF1 site that activates the MBP promoter in oligodendrocytes, but not in Cos-7 cells. A protein complex binds to this site, designated MEBA (myelinating glia-enriched DNA binding activity), and is enriched in nuclear extracts prepared from the brain, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells. The amount of MEBA parallels MBP expression and myelinogenesis in the developing brain and parallels new MBP expression as purified oligodendrocytes differentiate. Mutational analyses of binding and function distinguish MEBA, an activator, from NF1, a repressor of MBP transcription, and suggest that MEBA consists of at least two proteins. Because the binding sites of MEBA and NF1 overlap, we suggest that MEBA may either compete with or modify NF1 binding, thereby activating the MBP promoter in oligodendrocytes. The central nervous system expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) is restricted to oligodendrocytes and is developmentally regulated; these regulatory features are transcriptionally mediated. We have previously shown that the proximal 149 nucleotides of the MBP promoter were both necessary and sufficient to activate the transcription of MBP in cultured oligodendrocytes, but not in other cell types. Sequences within the distal portion of this promoter, which contains a nuclear factor 1 (NF1) binding site, repressed activation of the MBP promoter in Cos-7 cells, but not in oligodendrocytes. We now describe a sequence upstream of and partially overlapping the NF1 site that activates the MBP promoter in oligodendrocytes, but not in Cos-7 cells.

Myelin basic protein (MBP)1 is a structural protein of myelin expressed only by oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells. In the central nervous system, MBP expression by oligodendrocytes is required for normal myelinogenesis (1Roach A. Boylan K. Horvath S. Prusiner S.B. Hood L.E. Cell. 1983; 34: 799-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). MBP mRNA expression in the rodent brain rises approximately 100-fold between birth and 30 days and falls to 40% of the peak expression in the adult. Transcriptional run-on analysis suggests that these regulatory features are primarily transcriptionally mediated (2Wiktorowicz M. Roach A. Dev. Neurosci. 1991; 13: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 3Wrabetz L. Taveggia C. Feltri M. Quattrini A. Awatramani R. Scherer S. Messing A. Kamholz J. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 34: 10-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the peripheral nervous system, MBP expression by Schwann cells is not strictly required for normal myelinogenesis, although when the amount of basic intracellular domains contributed by other myelin proteins is reduced, MBP becomes essential (4Martini R. Mohajeri M.H. Kasper S. Giese K.P. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4488-4495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MBP mRNA expression also rises rapidly in the peripheral nervous system during postnatal development, suggesting that its regulation is transcriptionally mediated, although this has not been demonstrated directly by transcriptional run-on analysis. The transcriptional regulation of the MBP gene in the central nervous system has been studied extensively, both in vivo and in vitro. The 5′-flanking regions of the mouse MBP promoter ranging from 9.5 kilobases to 256 nt were sufficient to drive oligodendrocyte-specific and developmentally regulated expression of reporter genes in transgenic mice (5Miskimins R.

Several studies in vitro have sought to identify specific DNA sequences within the proximal MBP promoter that might be necessary for cell-specific expression, but most of these studies were performed using cells that do not transcribe MBP or nuclear extracts prepared from the brain, which contains a complicated mixture of cell types (9Devine-Beach K. Lashgari M.S. Khalili K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13830-13835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Aoyama A. Tamura T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We have previously shown that 750 nt of human MBP promoter were sufficient to activate oligodendrocyte-specific, developmentally regulated expression of lacZ during active myelinogenesis in transgenic mice (3Wrabetz L. Taveggia C. Feltri M. Quattrini A. Awatramani R. Scherer S. Messing A. Kamholz J. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 34: 10-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed by transient transfection analysis in primary cultures of oligodendrocytes that 750, 420, or 149 nt of human MBP promoter was sufficient to activate a 5–10-fold increase in the expression of the CAT reporter gene in oligodendrocytes, but not in other cell types (12Wrabetz L. Shumas S. Grinspan J. Feltri M.L. Bozyczko D. McMorris F.A. Pleasure D. Kamholz J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We also showed that the 149-nt region contained two subregions with opposing functional activities: (a) the proximal 102-nt region activated the expression of CAT in most cell types; and (b) the more distal region, from −149 to −102 nt, silenced the expression of CAT in them. Interestingly, the distal region did not silence the expression of CAT in oligodendrocytes. This distal region contained a consensus nuclear factor 1 (NF1) site; a deletion that removed half of the NF1 site activated the expression of CAT in oligodendrocytes. Based on these results, we hypothesized that a specific alteration of NF1 may alleviate repression and contribute to the oligodendrocyte-specific activation of MBP transcription (12Wrabetz L. Shumas S. Grinspan J. Feltri M.L. Bozyczko D. McMorris F.A. Pleasure D. Kamholz J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We now describe a DNA sequence that flanks and partially overlaps the NF1 site, which activates the MBP promoter in oligodendrocytes, but not in Cos-7 cells. This sequence is bound by a unique set of nuclear proteins enriched in the brain, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells, designated MEBA (myelinating glia-enrichedbinding activity). The appearance of MEBA parallels both myelination in the developing brain and MBP mRNA expression in differentiating oligodendrocytes. Mutations within the region of MEBA and NF1 binding distinguish MEBA from NF1 and suggest that MEBA consists of at least two proteins. Because these binding sites with opposing functions overlap, we suggest that MEBA may either compete with or alter the NF1 binding of the proximal MBP promoter and derepress the MBP promoter in oligodendrocytes. All deletions of the proximal 149-nt MBP promoter were prepared by a modification of the exonuclease III/mung bean nuclease technique (Stratagene), as described previously (12Wrabetz L. Shumas S. Grinspan J. Feltri M.L. Bozyczko D. McMorris F.A. Pleasure D. Kamholz J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Transversion mutations spanning from 149 to 110 nt of the MBP promoter were prepared by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis, as described previously (12Wrabetz L. Shumas S. Grinspan J. Feltri M.L. Bozyczko D. McMorris F.A. Pleasure D. Kamholz J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. pRSVZ (13MacGregor G. Mogg A. Burke J. Caskey C. Somatic Cell. Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. G. MacGregor (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). CG4 cells, a bipotential glial cell population derived from primary cultures of rat brain, were cultured as described previously (14Louis J. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In medium conditioned by B104 neuroblastoma cells (B+, 30% in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus N1 and biotin), these cells resemble oligodendrocyte precursors; in the absence of B104-conditioned medium (B−), these cells are induced to differentiate into oligodendrocytes. A1.20 (SV40 T-antigen-transformed oligodendrocytes), Cos-7, HeLa, C6, HJC, A7, or L cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum or cultured as described previously (12Wrabetz L.

Rat Schwann cells from the sciatic nerve were purified and cultured in the presence or absence of 4 μm of forskolin as described previously (15Shy M.E. Shi Y. Wrabetz L. Kamholz J. Scherer S.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Primary oligodendrocyte cultures were prepared as described by Grinspan et al. (16Grinspan J.B. Stern J.L. Pustilnik S.M. Pleasure D. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in 2 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor for 7 days before transfection. Cultured cells were transfected with 20 μg of supercoiled DNA (either 10 μg of pBluescript carrier DNA and 10 μg of supercoiled DNA or, for cotransfections with pRSVZ, 2.5 μg of pRSVZ, 7.5 μg of carrier DNA, and 10 μg of DNA) using the CaPO4 procedure in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum for 4 h as described previously (12Wrabetz L.

The cultures were washed twice, refed with their original medium, and harvested for CAT assays 60 h later. CAT and β-galactosidase enzymatic assays and Southern blot analysis for the transfected plasmid were performed as described previously (12Wrabetz L. Shumas S. Grinspan J. Feltri M.L. Bozyczko D.

Relative CAT activity was determined as the ratio of the percentage of 14C converted into mono- and di-acetylchloramphenicol products to either the amount of the transfected plasmid DNA or to the β-galactosidase activity. For example, the experiments shown in Fig. 1 were performed using either Southern blot analysis for the transfected plasmid or cotransfection with pRSVZ as controls for transfection efficiency. The changes in relative CAT activity for the progressive deletions were reproduced using either control. All transfections were performed in triplicate and, in most cases, were repeated several times with separate plasmid preparations. The relative CAT activities were expressed as the mean ± S.E. for n repetitions. 10 g of liver, forebrain, or brainstem (includes cerebellum, from the cervical-medullary junction to the midbrain) were harvested from Sprague-Dawley rats of various ages. After homogenization in buffer containing 2.0 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 15 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 mmspermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 80 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% w/v low-fat milk, nuclei were pelleted through a sucrose cushion containing the same buffer without low-fat milk by centrifugation in a SW-28 rotor at 24,000 rpm (75,000 × g) for 60 min at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were prepared from tissue nuclei or from 50–100 million cultured cells as described previously (12Wrabetz L. Shumas S. Grinspan J. Feltri M.L. Bozyczko D. McMorris F.A. Pleasure D. Kamholz J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), except that extraction Buffer C contained 420 mm NaCl. EMSA was performed as described in Ref. 12Wrabetz L.

Res. 1993; 36: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, with the following modifications: (a) probes were prepared from synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides containing portions of the proximal human MBP promoter (Fig. 2) by end-labeling with both [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dGTP using Klenow enzyme; (b) competitors included NF1 5′-ATTTTGGCTTGAAGCCAATATG-3′, NF1 MBP 5′-AATGGCAGGATGCCCAAA-3′, and NS (nonspecific) 5′-AGCTTGGTACTAGTACCGGTACCGCGGCCGCAGATCTCTGCA-3′ and were used at a 100-fold molar excess; (c) the binding reactions contained 100 mm KCl, 2 μg of poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid), 1–4 μg of nuclear protein in 1 μl, and 60,000 cpm of probe (approximately 0.4 ng of DNA); and (d) protein-DNA complexes were resolved on low ionic strength 8% polyacrylamide gels in 4× Tris-acetate EDTA buffer. End-labeled sense or antisense fragments from −187 to −25 nt of the proximal MBP promoter (20,000 cpm of probe corresponding to 1–2 ng of DNA) were used in binding reactions with increasing amounts (10, 20, and 40 μg) of rat adult brain and liver nuclear extracts as described previously (18Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Ferrandon D. Rosales R. Vigneron M. Macchi M. Ruffenach F. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3005-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding reactions were carried out for 45 min at 4 °C in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 80 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid) and then treated with 300 ng of DNase I for 90 s at room temperature and stopped by the addition of EDTA/SDS (20 mm and 0.7%, final concentration). In the NF1 competition assays, 40 μg of nuclear extract were incubated with either a 100-fold or a 200-fold molar excess of NF1 competitor oligonucleotides (see above) for 20 min at 4 °C before the binding reaction. The samples were phenol-extracted, precipitated, and resolved on 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Maxam-Gilbert G+A sequence ladders were generated from the same probes by the standard protocols (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from rat forebrain or brainstem by the method of Chirgwin et al. (20Chirgwin J.M. Przbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar) and from cells by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

Shy M. Pleasure D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) as a template to generate probes. All quantitation of autoradiographic signals was performed by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics 300A densitometer). We showed previously that the −149 to −102 nt segment of the MBP promoter containing a consensus NF1 site reduced the transcription of MBP in most cells, but not in oligodendrocytes (12Wrabetz L. Shumas S. Grinspan J. Feltri M.L. Bozyczko D. McMorris F.A. Pleasure D. Kamholz J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To identify other regulatory elements within this segment, we prepared a series of MBP promoter-CAT fusion constructs containing progressive deletions from −149 to −95 nt and performed transient transfection analysis in either primary cultures of oligodendrocytes, which transcribe MBP, or Cos-7, HeLa, C6, HJC, A7, or L cells, which do not (12Wrabetz L. Shumas S. Grinspan J. Feltri M.L. Bozyczko D. McMorris F.A. Pleasure D. Kamholz J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The results for oligodendrocytes and Cos-7 cells are shown in Fig. 1. Deletion to −95 nt reduced CAT levels in all cell types, confirming that the proximal segment activates the transcription of MBP. Instead, deletion to −116, which bisects the NF1 site, increased CAT levels in both oligodendrocytes and Cos-7 cells, suggesting that the NF1 sequence silences MBP transcription. Deletion from −149 to −128 nt reduced CAT levels approximately 50% in oligodendrocytes, but not in Cos-7 cells. Similar results were obtained for the five other cell lines tested. These data suggest that there is an oligodendrocyte-specific activating sequence upstream of the NF1 site. To identify a corresponding DNA binding upstream of the NF1 site, we performed the EMSA using double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the sequence from −149 to −105 (probe A) and from −149 to −118 (probe B). The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 2. EMSA of the nuclear extract prepared from CG4 oligodendrocytes, which transcribe MBP (see below), with probe A generates a complex pattern of at least six bands (lanes 10 and 11). This binding was sequence specific, because the six bands were abolished by competition with excess unlabeled A oligonucleotide (lane 12). Four of the six bands were abolished by competition with an oligonucleotide containing either the consensus NF1 sequence or the MBP NF1 sequence (lanes 13 and 14). Conversely, the two remaining bands were abolished by competition with oligonucleotide B, which contained a truncated NF1 site and the upstream sequence, whereas the first four NF1-related bands were not competed (lane 15). These results suggest that there is nuclear protein binding upstream of and distinct from NF1. EMSA of CG4 extract using oligonucleotide B as a probe directly confirmed this. Fig. 2 (lanes 2–4) shows that a doublet was generated with a mobility similar to that of the two bands remaining after NF1 competition of probe A. This binding was specific, as shown by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides B or A (lanes 5 and 8), but was only partially competed by 100× molar excess of NF1 oligonucleotide (lanes 6 and 7). Thus, nuclear proteins from CG4 oligodendrocytes, differing from NF1, bind to a sequence just upstream of the NF1 site. The partial competition of the doublet by cold NF1 oligonucleotide suggested that its binding site could contain a portion of the NF1 sequence. In keeping with this, the EMSA of CG4 nuclear extracts using probe C, which contained the sequence from −149 to −124 nt, revealed no binding, showing that the 5′ portion of the NF1 site is necessary to generate the doublet (Fig. 3). The specific sequence of the 5′ portion of the NF1 site was required for binding, because EMSA with probe D, which contained a transversion mutation of the nucleotides from −124 to −118 nt, produced a nonspecific band of a different mobility that was not competed by cold D oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, lanes 15–17). To analyze the tissue distribution of this binding activity, we performed an EMSA of nuclear extracts prepared from various tissues and cell types using probe B. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the doublet was present in the brain, in CG4 B(−) cells, and in Schwann cells, all of which transcribe MBP. On the contrary, the doublet was not present in the liver, A1.20, C6, or Cos-7 cells, which do not transcribe MBP. Therefore, we designated this binding activity MEBA. To see whether MEBA is associated with the induction of MBP expression in the developing brain, we correlated the EMSA of brain nuclear extracts with the Northern blot analysis of total RNA, each of which was prepared from the forebrain of rats of various ages. As shown in Fig. 4 B, MEBA was present 2 days after birth but then disappeared during the next week. MEBA reappeared at 10 days after birth and increased in amount over the subsequent 8 weeks. Similarly, MBP mRNA was first detected at 10 days after birth and rose to much higher levels in the 18-day-old and 10-week-old forebrain (Fig. 4 D). We then correlated the presence of MEBA and MBP mRNA in the brainstem and forebrain at 5 and 18 days after birth, because MBP mRNA appears first in the brainstem and later in the forebrain, as shown in Fig. 4 D. EMSA analysis for MEBA showed the same trend; MEBA levels were significantly higher in the brainstem than in the forebrain at 5 days after birth (see Fig. 4 C, lanes 1 and 4, in which 2 μg of nuclear extract produced an unsaturated signal), whereas the levels were more similar in the brainstem and the forebrain at 18 days after birth. Thus, MEBA appears as MBP expression is induced during myelinogenesis in the developing forebrain and brainstem, although the early postnatal appearance of MEBA does not correlate with myelination. The early postnatal appearance of MEBA in the brain could be explained by a contribution of nuclear proteins from cells other than oligodendrocytes. To directly correlate the appearance of MEBA with MBP expression in pure differentiating oligodendrocytes, we analyzed CG4 oligodendrocytes. CG4 cells model oligodendrocyte differentiation well, because they up-regulate myelin-specific gene expression when cultured in the absence of growth factors, and they form myelin when transplanted into rodent brain (24Tontsch U. Archer D.R. Dubois-Dalcq M. Duncan I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11616-11620Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The MEBA doublet appeared at much higher levels (Fig. 5 A) only in the differentiated CG4 oligodendrocytes, as measured by the up-regulation of MBP and proteolipid protein mRNA levels (Fig. 5 B). Thus, in pure oligodendrocytes, the appearance of MEBA and MBP mRNA are strictly correlated. Interestingly, at a low dosage of nuclear extract from differentiated (B104−) CG4 cells, the upper band of the MEBA doublet is present along with a lower-intensity lower band (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, at a high dosage of nuclear extract from undifferentiated (B104+) CG4 cells, a more intense lower band is seen, but the upper band is not present. This suggests that the upper band does not simply appear as a consequence of high dosage of the lower band. To locate the MEBA binding site, we performed DNase I footprint analysis of the MBP promoter using brain and liver nuclear extracts. Fig. 6 shows that both brain and liver nuclear extracts protected the sequence from −132 to −106 nt, an extension of the NF1 binding site from −124 to −111 nt. Extended footprints have been reported for purified NF1 in several other promoters (see Ref. 25Paonessa G. Gounari F. Frank R. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3115-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholarfor example). Instead, hypersensitive sites upstream of the NF1 protection at nucleotides −135 to −136, −143, and −147 to −148 appeared more prominently with brain than with liver nuclear extract, although no protection upstream of nt −132 could be detected. These results were confirmed in analysis of the opposite strand (data not shown). To better reveal MEBA binding, we performed footprint analysis in the presence of NF1 oligonucleotide competitor. As shown in Fig. 6 B, a protection from −133 to −127 nt appeared with the brain extract, but not with the liver extract, as the NF1 footprint was diminished by competition. Thus, MEBA binds upstream of the NF1 site as predicted by the EMSA analysis of oligodendrocyte nuclear extracts. In a further attempt to localize the binding of MEBA, we synthesized a series of oligonucleotides containing transversion mutations from −149 to −124 nt and investigated the resulting effects on MEBA in an EMSA of oligodendrocyte nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig. 7, mutations between −146 and −141 nt or between −132 and −125 nt abolished all sequence-specific binding, whereas a mutation between −140 and −133 nt did not. However, the mutation between −140 and −133 nt produced a sequence-specific binding that shifted with a slower mobility (Fig. 7). Thus, MEBA binds two noncontiguous sequences between −149 and −124 nt. To correlate the effects of these mutations on binding and function, we reproduced these same mutations in the wild-type pSN149 as well as a transversion of the NF1 site between −124 and −110 nt and performed a transient transfection analysis in primary cultures of oligodendrocytes. As shown in Fig. 8, the wild-type pSN149 produced a relative CAT activity 10-fold above the promoterless construct p0SNCAT. pSN149A with a mutated NF1 site produced CAT levels 400% higher than that of wild-type pSN149, confirming that NF1 acts as a repressor of MBP transcription. Instead, the mutations between −146 and −141 nt or between −132 and −125 nt reduced the relative CAT levels by 70 or 60%, respectively, as compared with that of the wild-type pSN149, whereas the mutation between −140 and −133 nt did not reduce CAT levels significantly. Thus, the same two noncontiguous sequences upstream of the NF1 site that bind MEBA are also necessary for the activation of the MBP promoter in oligodendrocytes. Silencers play an important role in determining neuron-specific (26Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G.

In this study, we show that silencing may also be an important mechanism for restricting gene expression to oligodendrocytes. We and others have previously shown that short fragments of proximal MBP promoter are sufficient to mediate oligodendrocyte-specific transcription in transgenic mice (3Wrabetz L. Taveggia C.

Shumas S. Grinspan J. Feltri M.L. Bozyczko D. McMorris F.A. Pleasure D. Kamholz J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that an NF1 site in that region silences the MBP promoter in many cell types that do not transcribe MBP. Instead, in oligodendrocytes, we identified an activating sequence upstream of and overlapping the NF1 site in the MBP promoter. A protein complex, MEBA, binds this site and is enriched in nuclear extracts from the brain, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells in which MBP is transcribed. Mutational analyses of MEBA correlate its binding and function and suggest that MEBA binds two noncontiguous sequences to activate the MBP promoter. Our results suggest that unlike many neuron-specific genes t"

In his Perspective, Bliss discusses results reported in the same issue by [ Moser et al .][1] in which the authors have revisited a classic experiment carried out 10 years ago. With strengthened experimental design, Moser et al . used implanted electrodes to saturate the long-term potentiation in rats trained to solve a maze problem. As predicted by the LTP-as-learning hypothesis, the saturated rats did poorly, being unable to learn the maze, in comparison to the control animals.

Since these cells express several of the phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, the function of each isozyme remains unclear. Previous studies demonstrated that s-EL4 cells expressed substantially more PKCη and PKCθ than did EL4 cells resistant to phorbol esters (r-EL4). To examine potential roles for PKCη and PKCθ in EL4 cells, wild type and constitutively active versions of the isozymes were transiently expressed using a Sindbis virus system. Expression of constitutively active PKCη, but not PKCθ, in s- and r-EL4 cells altered cell morphology and cytoskeletal structure in a manner similar to that of phorbol ester treatment, suggesting a role for PKCη in cytoskeletal organization. Prolonged treatment of s-EL4 cells with phorbol esters results in inhibition of cell cycling along with a decreased expression of most of the PKC isozymes, including PKCθ.

Protein kinase C (PKC),1a family of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine-specific kinases, has been implicated in numerous signaling pathways in lymphocytes and other cells (reviewed in Refs.1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4035) Google Scholar, 2Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). At least 12 isozymes are recognized as members of the PKC family, and although all of these proteins share some structural similarities and rely on phospholipids for activation, many differences exist among them (reviewed in Refs. 2Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 4Nishizuka Y. FASEB. 1995; 9: 484-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (2362) Google Scholar). The isozymes exhibit diverse tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and requirements for diacylglycerol (DAG) and Ca2+ as cofactors (reviewed in Refs. 2Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 4Nishizuka Y. FASEB. 1995; 9: 484-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (2362) Google Scholar). The conventional isozymes, PKCα, -βI, -βII, and -γ, require both Ca2+ and DAG; novel isozymes PKCδ, -ε, -η, and -θ are Ca2+-independent; atypical isozymes PKCζ and -λ are Ca2+-independent and DAG- or phorbol ester-resistant. These differences argue for distinct functions of the isozymes. Altered expression or activity of an individual PKC isozyme can lead to specific changes in biological function. In the human Jurkat T lymphocyte line, antisense constructs (5Freire-Moar J. Tsutsumi A. Barja P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 660: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), PKC down-regulation (6Isakov N. McMahon P. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2091-2097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and co-expression with AP1 and nuclear factor of activated T cell transcription element reporter constructs (7Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) implicate PKCα in interleukin 2 (IL2) production. Microinjection of isozyme-specific antibodies has implicated a PKCβ isozyme in down-regulation of elevated intracellular Ca2+ in these cells (8Haverstick D.M. Dicus M. Resnick M.S. Sando J.J. Gray L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15426-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ca2+-independent PKC isozymes also have been implicated in activation of Jurkat cells. Genot et al. (7Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) showed that PKCε, but not PKCα, could induce expression of an NFkB reporter construct as well as expression of AP1 and nuclear factor of activated T cell transcription element reporter constructs, which PKCα also induced. However, different PKC isozymes have been implicated in some of these functions in other lymphocyte systems. Reasons for conflicting results may include cell-specific differences, redundancy in isozyme function, or incomplete inhibition, down-regulation, or activation of specific isozymes with the various reagents or methods used. To investigate roles for individual PKC isozymes in various T cell functions, we have compared phorbol ester- sensitive (s) and -resistant (r) lines of EL4 mouse thymoma cells. s-EL4 cells, unlike r-EL4 cells, produce cytokines, adhere to plastic substrates, and become growth-inhibited when stimulated with phorbol esters (9Farrar J.J. Fuller-Farrar J. Simon P.L. Hilfiker M.L. Stadler B.M. Farrar W.L. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2555-2558PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sando J.J. Hilfiker M.L. Piacentini M.J. Laufer T.M. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1676-1680PubMed Google Scholar). An explanation for these differences may be a divergence in the PKC expression profile of the two cell lines. Northern and Western analysis revealed that s-EL4 and r-EL4 cell lines expressed comparable amounts of PKCα, -β, and -δ but that the r-EL4 cells produced substantially less PKCε (11Homan E.C. Jensen D.E. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5676-5681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PKCη, and PKCθ (12Resnick M.S. Luo X. Vinton E.G. Sando J.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2209-2215PubMed Google Scholar). Long term phorbol ester treatment of s-EL4 cells resulted in the down-regulation of all of the PKC isozymes examined except for PKCη, which exhibited a 5-fold increase in expression in comparison with control cells (12Resnick M.S. Luo X. Vinton E.G. Sando J.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2209-2215PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that PKCε, PKCη, and/or PKCθ may contribute to the phorbol ester-induced responses in s-EL4 cells. In support of a role for PKCθ, Baier et al. (13Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Meller N. Coggeshall K.M. Giampa L. Telford D. Isakov N. Altman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) noted that the overexpression of PKCθ in s-EL4 cells resulted in an increase in transcription of an IL2 reporter construct when cells were treated with phorbol ester. That group also showed that expression of a constitutively active PKCθ construct activated an AP1 reporter construct and that expression of a dominant negative PKCθ construct blocked it (14Baier-Bitterlich G. Uberall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H. Grunicke H. Utermann G. Altman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for this isozyme in T cell activation, Monks et al. (15Monks C.R. Kupfer H. Tamir I. Barlow A. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) observed that antigen stimulation of T cell clones led to the selective activation and translocation of PKCθ concomitant with proliferation of the T cells, and similar induction of IL2- and c-jun reporter constructs with expression of PKCθ was reported recently in Jurkat cells (16Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To elucidate further potential functions of PKCθ and the uniquely up-regulated PKCη in EL4 cell activation, a virus-based transient expression system was used to introduce these PKC isozymes into the cells. Expression of constitutively active PKCη in EL4 cells resulted in dramatic changes in the cell morphology as well as cytoskeletal organization that were similar to those observed in s-EL4 cells stimulated with phorbol ester. In contrast, expression of constitutively active PKCθ, but not PKCη, counteracted the inhibitory effects of prolonged phorbol ester treatment on cell cycle progression. Taken together, these results suggest that PKCη and PKCθ play distinct roles in cellular signaling, with PKCη involved in cytoskeletal organization and PKCθ implicated in cell cycle progression. DMEM, RPMI 1640, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsin/EDTA, and other tissue culture materials were purchased from Mediatech Inc. (Herndon, VA). Heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum was obtained from either Sigma or Summit Biotechnology (Fort Collins, CO). Penicillin/streptomycin was acquired from Life Technologies, Inc. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) was obtained from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Life Technologies, Inc., and used essentially according to manufacturers' specifications. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against the carboxyl termini of PKC isozymes were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Sindbis virus envelope glycoproteins were a generous gift from Dr. C. Rice (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) (17Rice C.M. Strauss J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 154: 325-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Murine PKCθ and PKCη cDNA were generous gifts from Dr. H. Mischak (Institute fur Klinische Molekularbiologie and Tumorgenetik, Munich, Germany). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Bio-Rad and Sigma. The enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Baby hamster kidney-21 clone 13 cells (BHK) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mmglutamine and used between passages 6 and 14 after acquisition. s- and r-EL4 cells also were obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. L929 fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin and were used between passages 8 and 17. The generation of double subgenomic Sindbis recombinants (dsSIN) capable of expressing either PKCθ or PKCη was accomplished by excising cDNAs encoding PKCθ and PKCη from plasmid vectors kindly provided by H. Mishack and then subcloning these cDNAs into the Sindbis plasmid pTE2JC1 (18Hanh C.S. Hahn Y.S. Braciale T.J. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2679-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Fidelity of cloning was examined by analysis of restriction enzyme digestion. Those pTE2JC1 plasmids with the appropriate PKCθ or PKCη inserts were amplified in Escherichia coli. pTE2JC1:CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) was described previously (18Hanh C.S. Hahn Y.S. Braciale T.J. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2679-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Purified pTE2JC1:CAT, pTE2JC1:PKCθ, and pTE2JC1:PKCη, linearized with the XhoI restriction enzyme, were employed as templates for in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase as described previously (18Hanh C.S. Hahn Y.S. Braciale T.J. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2679-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). 4 × 106 BHK cells (107/ml) were transfected with 5–10 μg of the RNA transcripts by square pulse electroporation using a BTX820 square pulse generator (BTX Inc., San Diego) at 680 V for 99 μs (5 pulses with 1-s interval between pulses). Approximately 24 h post-transfection, the medium was collected and assayed for infectious virus titer in L929 cells. The resulting recombinant viruses were called dsSIN:CAT, dsSIN:PKCη, and dsSIN:PKCθ for their ability to express CAT, PKCη, and PKCθ, respectively. The constitutively active clones of PKCη and PKCθ were made by site-directed mutagenesis of their pseudosubstrate regions. Alanine 161 in PKCη was replaced by a glutamate using oligonucleotides (5′-GCCAAAGGGAGATGCGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCGCATCTCCCTTTGGC-3′), and alanine 148 in PKCθ was replaced by glutamate using oligonucleotides (5′-GCCGAGGAGAGATCAAACA-3′ and 5′-TGTTTGATCTCTCCTCGGC-3′). The mutant clones of PKCη and PKCθ were inserted into the pTE2JC1 plasmid, and recombinant viruses capable of expressing constitutively active PKCη (dsSIN:PKCηCA) and constitutively active PKCθ (dsSIN:PKCθCA) were generated as described above. The kinase-dead PKCη mutant (dsSIN:PKCηKD) was generated by replacing lysine 384 with an alanine in the background of the A161E mutant. The oligonucleotides used for this mutation were 5′-ACGCCGTGGCCGTGCTGAAGA-3′ and 5′-TCAGCACGGCCACGGCGTAC-3′. Catalytic domains of PKCη and PKCθ were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using 5′-CATATGTCTAGAACTCTCCTAGCAG-3′ and 5′-CATATGTCTAGAATGCGCAGGACTTC-3′, respectively, as 5′ primers and the SP6 primer in the vector as the 3′ primer. Resulting DNA fragments were separated and cloned into pTE plasmid, and recombinant viruses capable of expressing the catalytic domains of PKCη (dsSIN:PKCηCD) or PKCθ (dsSIN:PKCθCD) were generated as described above. PKCηCD starts with engineered Met as an initiation codon and is followed by Asn-345 to the carboxyl terminus of the protein (residue 684). PKCθCDstarts with Met-355 as an initiation Met and continues to the end of the protein (residue 708). Appropriate protein expression was confirmed by detection of labeled polypeptides following in vitrotranscription followed by translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and in the BHK cells by immunoblotting. At least two clones were isolated from each independent plasmid construct. All experiments involving virus manipulation and handling were performed in a BL2 facility under the protocol approved by the Institutional Biosafety and Recombinant DNA Committee of the University of Virginia. Cells in monolayer or suspension culture were maintained in late logarithmic phase for infection with dsSIN recombinants. Medium was removed and viruses were added to a designated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) in PBS (with 2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mmMgCl2) or RPMI. 1 h later, the appropriate prewarmed medium was added to the cells which were then incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated. For each experiment, two controls were used as follows: 1) addition of medium alone (mock infection), and 2) infection with dsSIN:CAT. 1–2 × 106 cells were washed with cold PBS and then lysed with either 200 μl of boiling Laemmli sample buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) or RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 μmaprotinin, and 1 μm leupeptin). The RIPA buffer lysates were incubated for 15–30 min at 0 °C, centrifuged at 15,500 ×g for 2 min, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were measured using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA)-based protein assay (Pierce) (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18586) Google Scholar). Boiling Laemmli sample buffer then denatured the proteins. 1.5–5 × 105 cells or 25–100 μg of protein were separated by 8 or 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Proteins on the gels were electroblotted onto either nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) or polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA) membranes. Membranes were blocked for more than 1 h in PBS containing 2% skim milk and 0.25% Tween 20 and then immunoblotted using specific antibodies as described previously (12Resnick M.S. Luo X. Vinton E.G. Sando J.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2209-2215PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in conjunction with an enhanced chemiluminescent system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells infected with dsSIN:CAT were assayed for CAT activity after lysis in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin. The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were subjected to a CAT enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay using the protocol provided by the manufacturer (5 Prime → 3 Prime Inc., Boulder, CO) (21Gendloff E.H. Bowen B. Buchholz W.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All assays were done in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and infected with the appropriate viruses as described above. At specific times post-infection, cells were fixed by incubating them in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde for 20 min and then washed with PBS. Permeabilization was accomplished by incubating the cells for 30 min in washing solution (PBS, 1% bovine serum, 0.025% Nonidet P-40 and 0.02% sodium azide). Cells were incubated for 30 min in washing solution containing 100 nm fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). Excess fluorescein was removed by washing the cells at least twice with the washing solution. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides, and the cells were visualized by both phase contrast and fluorescent microscopy (at 515 nm) using a 40× Planarphor objective lens. Logarithmic phase s-EL4 cells were treated with 100 nm PDB or 0.01% ethanol vehicle and then incubated for 6, 12, or 18 h at 37 °C. Cells were then permeabilized in an isotonic solution, and the DNA was stained using propidium iodide (50 μg/ml in 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml boiled RNase A, and 0.1% sodium citrate). Stained cells were incubated at 4 °C for at least 30 min. DNA content of the cells was examined using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) at the FL2 channel wavelength on a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson), and results were analyzed by the CellQuest program (Becton Dickinson). To examine potential roles for PKCη and PKCθ in T cells, logarithmic phase s-EL4 and r-EL4 cells were infected with Sindbis virus capable of expressing either PKCη (dsSIN:PKCη), PKCθ (dsSIN:PKCθ), or CAT (dsSIN:CAT) as an infection control. The infection times ranged from 4 to 24 h and employed an m.o.i. of approximately 10 to 20 infectious particles per cell. A high m.o.i. was used to ensure that most of the cells were infected with multiple virus particles. Western analysis showed that both cell lines infected with dsSIN:PKCη expressed significantly more PKCη than did mock- or dsSIN:CAT-infected control cells (Fig. 1). Analysis of CAT activity after infection of s-EL4 and r-EL4 with dsSIN:CAT confirmed comparable expression in the two cell lines as did expression of viral envelope glycoproteins (17Rice C.M. Strauss J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 154: 325-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In addition to enhanced expression of an approximately 80-kDa band in the dsSIN:PKCη cells, prominent 45–50 kDa antibody-reactive bands were observed (Fig. 1). These smaller η-reactive species may represent catalytic fragments. Overexpression of a similar 80-kDa immunoreactive band was detected in s-EL4 cells infected with dsSIN:PKCθ (Fig. 2 B). When blots were overexposed, lower molecular weight bands were observed in cells overexpressing PKCθ as well. Similar results were observed in r-EL4 cells (data not shown). To eliminate the need for stimulation of the cells with phorbol ester, recombinant Sindbis viruses capable of expressing constitutively active PKCη (dsSIN:PKCηCA) and PKCθ (dsSIN:PKCθCA) were generated by introducing a point mutation in the pseudosubstrate region of each isozyme (7Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Overexpression of both PKCη and constitutively active PKCη was detected as early as 3 h post-infection in s-EL4 cells (Fig. 2 A), and the time course of expression in r-EL4 cells was nearly identical (data not shown). The degradation of constitutively active PKCη protein was much faster when compared with that of PKCη (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were observed for PKCθ (Fig. 2 B). Catalytic domain constructs of PKCη (PKCηCD) and PKCθ (PKCθCD) also were expressed from infection of EL4 cells with Sindbis virus capable of expressing those active fragments. Good expression of 43-kDa PKCηCD and 38-kDa PKCθCD was achieved within 3.5 h of infection. The slight discrepancy between the calculated molecular masses of these fragments (39 and 40 kDa, respectively) and the size estimated from mobility in SDS-PAGE are consistent with the slight discrepancy in migration of the intact isozymes. These catalytic domain fragments, especially PKCθCD, also underwent some degradation over the ensuing 7 h (Fig. 2, C and D). Similar results were obtained when these constructs were expressed in reticulocyte lysates in vitro as well as in BHK cells and in r-EL4 cells (data not shown). To address whether PKCη is involved in the regulation of cell morphology or adherence, logarithmic phase s-EL4 and r-EL4 cells were either mock-infected or infected with dsSIN:CAT, dsSIN:PKCηCA,dsSIN:PKCηCD, dsSIN:PKCθCA, or dsSIN:PKCθCD for 5 h and then fixed onto glass coverslips using a solution of 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized and stained with FITC-conjugated phalloidin that binds to F-actin. Inspection of EL4 cells by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy revealed that phorbol ester stimulation or expression of constitutively active or catalytic domain PKCη induced cytoskeletal changes. dsSIN:CAT-infected s-EL4 cells (Fig. 3, A and B), essentially identical to mock-infected cells (data not shown), were refractory indicating a rounded morphology. PDB treatment (Fig. 3,C and D) and overexpression of constitutively active PKCη (Fig. 3, E and F) resulted in a flatter morphology, as shown by a decrease in refraction and the formation of ruffles at the membrane surface. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that these new cellular structures contained a high concentration of F-actin (Fig. 3, D and F). These cytoskeletal changes were seen within 2 h of viral infection (data not shown). Infection with dsSIN:PKCηCD caused a distinct morphological change in which the cells produced one or two long processes (Fig. 3, G and H) instead of large areas of membrane ruffling. In contrast, infection with dsSIN:PKCθCD (Fig. 3, I and J), dsSIN:PKCθCA or dsSIN:PKCηKD (data not shown) caused minimal alteration in morphology from that of the CAT-expressing cells. PDB treatment of r-EL4 cells led to an increase in production of filipodia and reorganization of the cytoskeleton as demonstrated by the formation of new F-actin containing structures (Fig. 4, C and D). Infection of these cells with dsSIN:PKCηCA (Fig. 4,E and F) caused the appearance of membrane ruffling somewhat like that observed in s-EL4 cells with PDB treatment or the expression of PKCηCA. Expression of dsSIN:PKCηCD in r-EL4 (Fig. 4, G and H) caused the appearance of one or two prominent actin-containing protrusions as it did in s-EL4 cells. However, expression of these active PKCη constructs did not result in adhesion of the s- or r-EL4 cells to plastic (data not shown). Expression of constitutively active PKCθ (Fig. 4, I and J), the catalytic domain of PKCθ, or kinase dead PKCη in r-EL4 cells did not alter morphology or induce cytoskeletal reorganization (data not shown). Prolonged treatment of EL4 cells with phorbol esters inhibits cell cycle progression (10Sando J.J. Hilfiker M.L. Piacentini M.J. Laufer T.M. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1676-1680PubMed Google Scholar) with cell cycle blocks in G1 and G2/M (22Desrivieres S. Volarevic S. Mercep L. Ferrari S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2470-2476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cell cycle inhibition may be due to the down-regulation of the majority of the PKC isozymes (12Resnick M.S. Luo X. Vinton E.G. Sando J.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2209-2215PubMed Google Scholar). Antigen-stimulated T cell clones show selective activation and translocation of PKCθ concomitant with the proliferation of those T cells (15Monks C.R. Kupfer H. Tamir I. Barlow A. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of PKCθ in the regulation of cell cycle progression. A potential connection between the activity of PKCθ and cell cycle progression in s-EL4 cells was examined by analysis of DNA content. Following treatment with 100 nmPDB or 0.01% ethanol vehicle control, s-EL4 cells were collected at 6, 12, and 18 h, permeabilized, and stained with propidium iodide. DNA histograms obtained by FACS analysis revealed a dramatic decrease in cell populations corresponding to S phase (the area between the diploid (2N) and tetraploid (4N) DNA peaks) as early as 6 h after treatment (Fig. 5). The proportion of cells in S phase was only 7% of the total population at 6 h after PDB treatment in comparison with 32% of the ethanol-treated control cells. [3H]Thymidine incorporation experiments also showed greater than a 3-fold decrease in DNA synthesis after 6 h of PDB treatment and 1 h of pulse labeling (data not shown), consistent with earlier studies (10Sando J.J. Hilfiker M.L. Piacentini M.J. Laufer T.M. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1676-1680PubMed Google Scholar, 22Desrivieres S. Volarevic S. Mercep L. Ferrari S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2470-2476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Potential roles for PKCθ and PKCη in cell cycle progression were examined using a combination of prolonged PDB treatment, which down-regulates the majority of PKC isozyme activities but up-regulates PKCη (12Resnick M.S. Luo X. Vinton E.G. Sando J.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2209-2215PubMed Google Scholar), and transient expression of PKCθ, PKCη, or both. Infection of s-EL4 cells with dsSIN:PKCθ at an m.o.i. of 2 (versus an m.o.i. of 20 in Fig. 2) showed an increased expression of a PKCθ-reactive band at approximately 80 kDa (Fig. 6) and some increase in lower molecular weight PKCθ-reactive bands upon overexposure. A lower m.o.i. of 2 was used in the experiment of Fig. 6 so that the low endogenous level of PKCθ could be visualized on the same blot without overexposure of the lanes from cells overexpressing PKCθ. PDB treatment for 8 h resulted in the down-regulation of PKCθ expression in control cells, whereas expression of PKCθ in cells infected with dsSIN:PKCθ remained high, with 80 kDa and smaller PKCθ-reactive bands readily detectable (Fig. 6). To compare effects of PKCη and -θ expression, logarithmic phase s-EL4 cells were mock-infected or infected with dsSIN:CAT, dsSIN:CAT and dsSIN:PKCη, dsSIN:CAT and dsSIN:PKCθ, or dsSIN:PKCθ and dsSIN:PKCη at a combined multiplicity of 20 infectious particles per cell. Two h post-infection, cells were divided into two equal groups, and one group was treated with 100 nm PDB. After 6 h at 37 °C, cellular DNA was stained with propidium iodide and then analyzed using FACS. Fig. 7 shows that expression of PKCθ can overcome the inhibition of cell cycle progression induced by phorbol ester treatment. Cells infected with dsSIN:PKCθ or dsSIN:PKCη and dsSIN:PKCθ progressed through the cell cycle in the presence of PDB, whereas cells infected with dsSIN:CAT or dsSIN:PKCη did not. Similar results were obtained after 12 and 18 h of PDB treatment. Expression of dsSIN:PKCθCA also rescued PDB-treated cells from growth inhibition; however, expression of the catalytic domain of PKCθ in the cells did not (data not shown). Given the rapid degradation of the expressed catalytic fragment (Fig. 2), a potential function for"

Transcription of Eukaryotic Ribosomal RNA Genes by RNA Polymerase I. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1998: 67-94Google Scholar). These factors all contain a common subunit, the TATA-binding protein (TBP) (9Comai L. Tanese N. Tjian R. Cell. 1992; 68: 965-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 10Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), which is associated with a variable number of polymerase-specific subunits, the TATA-binding protein associated factors (TAFs). In human SL1, TBP is associated with three TAFs with M r = 110,000, 63,000, and 48,000 (9Comai L. Tanese N. Tjian R. Cell. 1992; 68: 965-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar); in mouse, the TAFIs haveM r = 95,000, 68,000, and 48,000 (11Eberhard D. Tora L. Egly J.-M. Grummt I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4180-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Lower eukaryotes contain a slightly modified factor. InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, a genetically identified complex called core factor or CF, made up of Rrn6p, Rrn7p, and Rrn11p, appears to function on the core promoter in a manner similar to vertebrate TIF-IB/SL1 (12Keys D.A.

Surprisingly, none of the cloned Rrn6/7 or -11 genes from the S. cerevisiae complex show any sequence similarity to the vertebrate TAFIs, and TBP is not tightly associated with the TAFIs. In Acanthamoeba castellanii, a single transcription factor, TIF-IB, is necessary and sufficient to form a complex on the promoter and recruit RNA polymerase I for multiple rounds of transcription (15Bateman E.

Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1998: 107-120Google Scholar). The ability of TIF-IB to form a stable complex on the core promoter varies considerably from species to species. At one end of the spectrum, human SL1 can bind only very weakly or not at all to the rRNA promoter by itself, based on its ability to mediate transcriptionin vitro in the presence of only RNA polymerase I (20Zomerdijk J.C.B.M. Tjian R. Paule M.R. Transcription of Eukaryotic Ribosomal RNA Genes by RNA Polymerase I. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1998: 121-134Google Scholar). Instead, an accessory factor, upstream binding factor (UBF), binds first to an upstream promoter element and apparently aids the binding of SL1 either by interacting with it (21Bell S.P. Learned R.M. Jantzen H.-M. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 241: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) or by altering the structure of the DNA in the region bound by SL1 (22Bazett-Jones D.P. Leblanc B. Herfort M. Moss T. Science. 1994; 264: 1134-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The UBF footprint persists following committed complex formation, showing it remains in the complex (21Bell S.P. Learned R.M. Jantzen H.-M. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 241: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In Xenopus laevis, Rib1 similarly cannot form a stable complex without UBF, but for a different reason; in addition to its ability to alter the DNA structure of the promoter (22Bazett-Jones D.P. Leblanc B. Herfort M. Moss T. Science. 1994; 264: 1134-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), in a DNA-independent mechanism UBF prevents the dissociation of TBP from the rather unstable Rib1 (23Bodeker M. Cairns C. McStay B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In rat and mouse, UBF can also stimulate TIF-IB binding. However, in these species UBF is not required for stable association of the TBP-containing factor with the promoter, and thus TIF-IB is sufficient for specific initiation in these systems (6Grummt I. Paule M.R. Transcription of Eukaryotic Ribosomal RNA Genes by RNA Polymerase I. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1998: 135-154Google Scholar,24Smith S.D. O'Mahony D.J. Kinsella B.T. Rothblum L.I. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 229-236PubMed Google Scholar). A. castellanii TIF-IB is at the farthest extreme of the spectrum of TBP·TAFI complexes in its ability to interact very strongly with the promoter in the absence of any other assembly or architectural proteins. Recently, a distinct transcription factor dubbed upstream activation factor (UAF) has been genetically identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Like UBF, this multiprotein complex functions when bound to the upstream promoter element, stabilizing binding of CF to the DNA (25Keys D.A. Lee B.S. Dodd J.A. Nguyen T.T. Vu L. Fantino E. Burson L.M. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, UAF can commit the template, but CF cannot. Curiously, UAF appears to act on CF via a bridging TBP molecule. The latter is reminiscent of one of the roles of Xenopus UBF, stabilizing the interaction of TBP with the TAFIs (23Bodeker M. Cairns C. McStay B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Whether UBF or UAF homologs are obligatory parts of the committed complex in A. castellanii is not clear. We have shown that the DNA in the A. castellanii committed complex is not wrapped or looped (26Gong X. Radebaugh C.A. Geiss G.K. Simon M.N. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4956-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as in a UBF complex (22Bazett-Jones D.P. Leblanc B. Herfort M. Moss T. Science. 1994; 264: 1134-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 27Putnam C.D. Copenhaver G.P. Denton M.L. Pikaard C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6476-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and we cannot identify an upstream promoter element in vitro or a UBF or UAF footprint consistent with those found in vertebrates or yeast. TBP is a stable subunit of A. castellanii TIF-IB (28Radebaugh C.A. Matthews J.L. Geiss G.K. Liu F. Wong J.-M. Bateman E. Camier S. Sentenac A. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus,A. castellanii TIF-IB appears to have some functions not found in the other factors. In this paper, we describe a procedure to obtain A. castellanii TIF-IB in a nearly homogeneous form. We show that polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 145,000, 99,000, 96,000, and 91,000 copurify with TBP and TIF-IB activity. The homogeneous TIF-IB was functionally tested. It is capable of driving specific transcription initiation in an in vitro system consisting of only TIF-IB and RNA polymerase I purified to near homogeneity. However, unlike TIF-IB from earlier stages of purification, homogeneous TIF-IB is incapable of forming as persistent a complex with the core promoter in a template commitment assay. Despite this finding, the apparent dissociation constant between TIF-IB and the promoter-DNA is identical between fractions capable and incapable of template commitment. The ability to commit the template can be restored by adding a partially purified factor, which we dub TIF-IE. 2Although there is no TIF-ID in the literature, the TBP·TAFI complex has been named factor D or TFID, so to avoid confusion “TIF-ID” is not used. The standard assay for TIF-IB was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl containing a 500 μm concentration each of ATP, CTP, and UTP; 25 μm GTP; 5 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (NEN Life Science Products; 3000 Ci/mmol); 100 mm KCl; 10 mm MgCl2; 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9); 10% (v/v) glycerol; 0.1 mm EDTA; 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; and 50 ng of linearized plasmid DNA, pEBH10/NdeI (15Bateman E. Iida C.T. Kownin P. Paule M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8004-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or pAr6/HindIII. pAr6, which contains the rRNA promoter from −683 to +219, was derived from pAr4 (29Perna P.J. Harris G.H. Iida C.T. Kownin P. Bugren S. Paule M.R. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 71-78PubMed Google Scholar) by excision of theEcoRI–DdeI fragment encompassing the transcription initiation site, filling in its ends with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and ligating it into the SmaI site of pUC8. The reactions were started by the addition of individual fractions (1–5 μl) containing TIF-IB and 30 milliunits of heparin-Sepharose-purified RNA polymerase I (30Spindler S. Duester G.L. D'Alessio J.M. Paule M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4669-4675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation was at 25 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 μl of stop buffer containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K and 1% SDS, followed by incubation at 50 °C for 60 min. Nucleic acids were precipitated by the addition of 200 μl of 3 m ammonium acetate, 0.125 mg/ml linear polyacrylamide, and 750 μl of 95% ethanol. Nucleic acids were pelleted in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 30 min at maximum speed. The pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol; dried under vacuum; suspended in 5 μl of 95% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol; and analyzed on a denaturing (7 m urea) 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel, 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (and B.23, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 18.55Google Scholar). TIF-IB activity was determined in a run-off transcription assay by carrying out a titration of each pool containing TIF-IB. The specific radioactivity of GTP in the assay and the number of nmol of incorporated GMP were determined by simultaneous exposure of phosphor storage screens to a known volume of the reaction mixture containing [α-32P]GTP and the runoff products in the dried polyacrylamide gel, followed by quantification using ImageQuant version 4.1 software. One unit of TIF-IB activity is defined as the amount mediating incorporation of 1 nmol of [32P]GMP into a 309-nucleotide run-off in the standard 30 min assay. The 309-nucleotide run-off product contains 76 G residues. The minimum amount of template required to bind all the available TIF-IB in the reaction was determined for each template and used in the following protocol. Template (pAr6 and/or pEBH10) was preincubated with TIF-IB or TIF-IB plus TIF-IE under the standard assay conditions for 10 min, except RNA polymerase I was omitted. Since some of the experiments described here were done with very pure and dilute components, bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml) was included in the preincubation mixtures to stabilize the protein components and help prevent them from binding nonspecifically to the walls of the reaction vessel. The second template or buffer was added, and preincubation continued for another 10 min. RNA polymerase I was added to start the RNA synthesis phase, which proceeded for another 30 min. Run-off RNAs were analyzed as described above. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as described (28Radebaugh C.A. Matthews J.L. Geiss G.K. Liu F. Wong J.-M. Bateman E. Camier S. Sentenac A. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), except the electrophoretic buffer was the Tris-glycine buffer used for protein gels minus the SDS (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 348Google Scholar), and electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature. An accurately known amount of promoter DNA (EcoRI/HindIII-cut pEBH10; −120 to +80) was labeled with 32P by fill-in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and its specific activity was estimated by spotting on DEAE filter paper discs (DE81, Whatman, Fairfield, NJ) and washing as for an RNA polymerase nonspecific assay (30Spindler S. Duester G.L. D'Alessio J.M. Paule M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4669-4675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fixed amount of TIF-IB was titrated with known amounts of this labeled DNA as described, except no competitor DNA was added (28Radebaugh C.A. Matthews J.L. Geiss G.K. Liu F. Wong J.-M. Bateman E. Camier S. Sentenac A. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the resulting mixture analyzed in an EMSA as described above. ImageQuant version 4.1 software was used to analyze the amount of free DNA and TIF-IB·DNA complex present at each DNA concentration, which was then plotted according to the method of Scatchard. The kinetic dissociation rate constant for the TIF-IB·DNA complex was estimated by forming the complex for 10 min, as above, and then adding a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled promoter DNA for various time periods. In the experiment shown in Fig. 7, start times for each time point were staggered so that all the incubations ended simultaneously. At the end of the incubation, the samples were rapidly chilled on ice, immediately loaded onto the EMSA gel, and electrophoresed. Data were analyzed by Phosphor Imager analysis. Proteins were precipitated with chloroform-methanol (33Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar), resuspended in 1× SDS loading buffer and electrophoresed through an SDS-10% or 7.5% polyacrylamide gel by standard methods (34Garfin D.E. Deutscher M.P. Guide to Protein Purification. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 425-441Google Scholar). Gels were stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 as described (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (and B.23, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 18.55Google Scholar) or with silver (35Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase I was purified from a whole cell extract as described by Spindler et al. (30Spindler S. Duester G.L. D'Alessio J.M. Paule M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4669-4675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TIF-IE used in the study described herein was separated from RNA polymerase I at the last step, glycerol gradient rate zonal sedimentation, but the yield is variable from successive preparations of RNA polymerase I. We have recently found a larger pool of TIF-IE in the BioRex70 fraction of TIF-IB, which can be further purified by heparine-Ultrogel A4R (IBF Biotechnics, Paris) and rate-zonal sedimentation (data not shown). In both cases, TIF-IE is not yet homogeneous. Both strands of the A. castellanii rRNA promoter from −70 to −15 were chemically synthesized incorporating five point mutations (G−53A, C−51T, G−37T, C−22T, and G−20C) which increase promoter strength, presumably by increasing the binding strength to TIF-IB (36Kownin P. Bateman E. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Four base 5′-extensions (G residues at −70 and C residues at −15) were included so that the annealed oligonucleotide could be oligomerized. The ends of the oligomerized DNA were filled using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and cloned into the HincII site of Bluescribe(−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A fragment containing four head-to-tail copies of the −70 to −15 promoter sequence were excised using EcoRI and HindIII, purified over Sephacryl S-500, and coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose CL-4B as described (37Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), except unreacted cyanogen bromide-derivatized Sepharose was inactivated with 1m Tris (pH 8). Protein concentration in early fractions was estimated using a modified Bradford microassay procedure (Bio-Rad) with bovine γ-globulin as the standard protein according to the manufacturer's directions. For the final glycerol gradient-purified fraction, the protein concentration was estimated by silver staining. All steps were carried out at 0–4 °C unless otherwise noted. A crude nuclear extract was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation; the TIF-IB-containing fraction (0.5–1.82 m(NH4)2SO4) also contained the components needed for transcription of RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes (28Radebaugh C.A. Matthews J.L. Geiss G.K. Liu F. Wong J.-M. Bateman E. Camier S. Sentenac A. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38Lofquist A.K. Li H. Imboden M.A. Paule M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3233-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), while RNA polymerase I was found in the 1.82–3.56m (NH4)2SO4 fraction (28Radebaugh C.A.

This fraction is called the “nuclear extract/pol III cut.” The TIF-IB-containing fraction from 225 g (wet weight) of A. castellanii cells containing 1700 mg of protein and 22.5 units of TIF-IB activity was dialyzed against 100 mm KCl in HEG20 (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mmEDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) to remove ammonium sulfate and convert the extract to 100 mm KCl. This was loaded onto a 50-ml DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (2.5 × 10.2-cm) equilibrated to 100 mm KCl in HEG20 at a linear flow rate of 10 cm/h (0.5 column volume/h). This low flow rate is necessary to achieve optimal binding of TIF-IB to the exchange medium. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of HEG20 containing 100 mm KCl at a linear flow rate of 25 cm/h. The column was developed with a 5-column volume linear gradient from 100 to 500 mm KCl in HEG20 at 25 cm/h. Eighty fractions were collected and assayed for TIF-IB by a run-off transcription assay. TIF-IB reproducibly elutes with a peak at 280 mm KCl. RNA polymerase III is primarily in the unbound flow-through, but a small amount elutes ahead of and overlapping with the TIF-IB. The active fractions were pooled and diluted to 150 mm KCl in HEG20. The DEAE-Sepharose fast flow pool was loaded at a linear flow rate of 10 cm/h (2 column volumes/h) onto a 25-ml BioRex 70 column (2.5 × 5.1 cm) previously equilibrated with 150 mm KCl in HEG20. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of HEG20 containing 150 mm KCl at 15 cm/h. The column was developed with a linear gradient from 150 mm to 1000 mm KCl in HEG20 at a linear flow rate of 15 cm/h. Eighty fractions were collected and assayed as above. TIF-IB elutes with a peak at 330 mm KCl. The active fractions from the BioRex 70 column were pooled and dialyzed against H20EG10 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) containing 150 mm KCl. The pool was prepared for loading onto the DNA affinity column by adding MgCl2 to 10 mm, salmon sperm DNA to 0.09 mg/mg of protein, and sufficient 2-fold concentrated H20EG10 to maintain a constant buffer concentration. This final set of conditions was found to be optimal for binding to promoter DNA by EMSA. It is the same as the optimal set of conditions for transcription, except salmon sperm DNA was added to compete nonspecific DNA-binding proteins, and the KCl concentration was increased from 100 to 150 mm. The latter is allowable because of the point mutations, which specifically increase TIF-IB binding to the promoter (see “Preparation of Promoter-DNA-Sepharose 4B”). Five ml of promoter-DNA-Sepharose 4B was mixed with the prepared BioRex 70 pool and incubated with gentle agitation at room temperature (22 °C) for 1 h. The affinity medium was then loaded at 4 °C into a 1.5 × 2.8-cm column and the supernatant recirculated through the column at a linear flow rate of 5 cm/h until it had passed over the column three times. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of H20EG10containing 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v) at 5 cm/h (1 column volume/h). The column was developed with a 5-column volume gradient from 150 to 1000 mm KCl in the same buffer at 5 cm/h. 40 fractions were collected and analyzed as above. TIF-IB eluted as a peak centered at 460 mm KCl. Promoter-DNA affinity-purified TIF-IB could be concentrated using a Microcon-10 microconcentrator according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amicon, Beverly, MA) or by diluting to 150 mm KCl with H20EG10, binding to a 1-ml (0.9 × 1.6 cm) BioRex-70 column and eluting with a step gradient of 600 mm KCl in H20EG10. 17.5–35% (v/v) glycerol gradients in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 100 mm KCl were prepared in 13 × 51-mm polyallomer centrifuge tubes. 200 μl of the concentrated promoter-DNA affinity column pool was layered on the top of each gradient and centrifuged for 15 h at 47,500 rpm in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor at 4 °C. The gradients were fractionated by pumping Fluorinert FC-40 (ISCO, Lincoln, NE) into the bottom of the tubes using an ISCO density gradient fractionator. 23 fractions were collected and assayed as above. The peak of TIF-IB is reproducibly in fractions 13 and 14, which is just above the position to which A. castellanii RNA polymerase I sediments in the same gradients (centered at fraction 15). The yield of TIF-IB is based upon the sum of the activities in the most active fractions. The amount of protein in these fractions is too low to estimate accurately using a modified Bradford assay. Instead, protein concentrations were estimated from silver staining and densitometric scanning. TIF-IB was purified from a nuclear extract using DEAE-fast flow, BioRex 70, and promoter-DNA affinity chromatography followed by rate zonal sedimentation in a glycerol gradient (Fig. 1 and Table I). Because there are inhibitors in the nuclear extract (28Radebaugh C.A. Matthews J.L. Geiss G.K. Liu F. Wong J.-M. Bateman E. Camier S. Sentenac A. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) leading to an apparent increase in activity after the first purification step, the DEAE-Sepharose fast flow fraction was assigned as 100% in Table I. The promoter-DNA affinity column alone purified TIF-IB 226-fold. The factor at this point is nearly homogeneous (Fig. 2). Even after the promoter-DNA affinity column step, the polypeptides that make up TIF-IB can be readily discerned (Fig. 2 B), along with a number of contaminating polypeptides that are present in variable amounts from preparation to preparation (cf. Fig. 2 B and Fig. 3 B, lane L). In the 7.5% gel shown in Fig. 2, the TBP is run off the bottom of the gel; however, the presence of TBP in the purified TIF-IB as well as in the promoter-DNA·TIF-IB complex has been demonstrated in previous studies (26Gong X.

We have also found that multiple rounds of promoter-DNA affinity chromatography did not significantly improve the purity of TIF-IB. The glycerol gradient-purified TIF-IB had a specific activity of 211 units/mg of protein and was purified approximately 16,000-fold from the TIF-IB-containing nuclear extract, or 55,000-fold from the whole cells (39D'Alessio J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2031212113,"Birds do it, bees do it, people do it—in fact the vast majority of organisms do it—but sexual reproduction often seems more trouble than it's worth. For organisms, sex often means spending huge amounts of energy finding and wooing desirable partners. Within the cell, male and female genomes must recombine without major mistakes. Gametes must promote compatible fusions while upholding barriers between species. And at each step, the conflicting interests of each sex must be delicately negotiated in order to benefit the species as a whole.

Asexual reproduction—a simple “copy and divide” strategy—at first glance seems both less messy and more efficient. Yet sexual reproduction is by far the dominant mode, which leads researchers to conclude that sex offers some evolutionary advantage. Biologists have been spinning theories about just what that advantage might be for quite some time, but so far there is no single clear answer.

The debate continues energetically, however, as shown in the news stories and review articles in this special section on the evolution of sex. The topic falls into two parts. First, why did sex evolve in the first place and why is it so pervasive in the natural world? And secondly, how do these amazingly complex sexual systems evolve?

The News story by [Wuethrich][1] and article by [Barton and Charlesworth][2] address the first of these questions—what makes sex so alluring from an evolutionary standpoint? Barton and Charlesworth conclude that genetic recombination seems to be the key. Indeed, as discussed in both pieces, most theories suggest that sex and recombination remove harmful mutations and allow new combinations of genes to come together, providing more opportunities for improved fitness and offering the flexibility to adapt to new environments. Biologists are finding new ways to test these theories, Wuethrich reports, but proving that they are actually operating in the natural world remains a challenge.

Once sexual reproduction is in place, what cellular and behavioral mechanisms build the system? In their article, [Marin and Baker][3] discuss the evolution of genes that dictate the differential development of the sexes. Some of these genes are stable in evolutionary terms while others, particularly the regulatory genes at the top of the developmental cascade, are changing rapidly. The process by which sperm and egg recognize compatible cognates also involves unusually rapid evolution, as discussed in [Vacquier's article][4]. The greatest variety seems to be found in the diverse chemoattractants and surface receptors that promote fusion between the right pair of gametes.

As any human knows, complex mating rituals are often a critical part of reproduction. [Ryan's article][5] explores the evolution of mating preferences and discusses the effects of receiver bias—or, how beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Both historical effects and expressed female preferences affect the evolution of characteristically male traits.

Although the sexes come together to mate, their evolutionary interests often conflict. [Partridge and Hurst's article][6] provides an overview of the often opposing forces driving the evolution of female and male and the molecular expressions of the war between the sexes.

Two News stories explore particular manifestations of this conflict. [Morell][7] takes a new look at monogamy, the one mating system where conflict would seem to be at a minimum. Yet recent research has shown that in many species, females once thought to be monogamous bear offspring with different fathers. Even when social bonds are strong, extrapair matings apparently offer evolutionary advantage. And [Pennisi][8] reports on one genetic weapon wielded in the battle of the sexes: genomic imprinting, in which genes from one parent are marked for later silencing or disposal. Mammalian researchers argue that imprinting represents a battle over the growth rate of the fetus, and have new data to bolster their case. Thus, a growing body of research demonstrates that in interactions ranging from molecular to social, sexual reproduction thrives in a metastable state, balancing conflict and resolution—and remaining the most effective reproductive strategy available.
