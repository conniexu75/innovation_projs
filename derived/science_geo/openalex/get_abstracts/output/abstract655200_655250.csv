https://openalex.org/W3037615636,"Immune-regulatory mechanisms of drug-free remission in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are unknown. We hypothesized that synovial tissue macrophages (STM), which persist in remission, contribute to joint homeostasis. We used single-cell transcriptomics to profile 32,000 STMs and identified phenotypic changes in patients with early/active RA, treatment-refractory/active RA and RA in sustained remission. Each clinical state was characterized by different frequencies of nine discrete phenotypic clusters within four distinct STM subpopulations with diverse homeostatic, regulatory and inflammatory functions. This cellular atlas, combined with deep-phenotypic, spatial and functional analyses of synovial biopsy fluorescent activated cell sorted STMs, revealed two STM subpopulations (MerTKposTREM2high and MerTKposLYVE1pos) with unique remission transcriptomic signatures enriched in negative regulators of inflammation. These STMs were potent producers of inflammation-resolving lipid mediators and induced the repair response of synovial fibroblasts in vitro. A low proportion of MerTKpos STMs in remission was associated with increased risk of disease flare after treatment cessation. Therapeutic modulation of MerTKpos STM subpopulations could therefore be a potential treatment strategy for RA."
https://openalex.org/W3037464909,"N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is the most widespread internal messenger RNA modification in humans. Despite recent progress in understanding the biological roles of m6A, the inability to install m6A site specifically in individual transcripts has hampered efforts to elucidate causal relationships between the presence of a specific m6A and phenotypic outcomes. In the present study, we demonstrate that nucleus-localized dCas13 fusions with a truncated METTL3 methyltransferase domain and cytoplasm-localized fusions with a modified METTL3:METTL14 methyltransferase complex can direct site-specific m6A incorporation in distinct cellular compartments, with the former fusion protein having particularly low off-target activity. Independent cellular assays across multiple sites confirm that this targeted RNA methylation (TRM) system mediates efficient m6A installation in endogenous RNA transcripts with high specificity. Finally, we show that TRM can induce m6A-mediated changes to transcript abundance and alternative splicing. These findings establish TRM as a tool for targeted epitranscriptome engineering that can reveal the effect of individual m6A modifications and dissect their functional roles."

https://openalex.org/W3037144929,"Targeted gene editing in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is a promising treatment for several diseases. However, the limited efficiency of homology-directed repair (HDR) in HSCs and the unknown impact of the procedure on clonal composition and dynamics of transplantation have hampered clinical translation. Here, we apply a barcoding strategy to clonal tracking of edited cells (BAR-Seq) and show that editing activates p53, which substantially shrinks the HSC clonal repertoire in hematochimeric mice, although engrafted edited clones preserve multilineage and self-renewing capacity. Transient p53 inhibition restored polyclonal graft composition. We increased HDR efficiency by forcing cell-cycle progression and upregulating components of the HDR machinery through transient expression of the adenovirus 5 E4orf6/7 protein, which recruits the cell-cycle controller E2F on its target genes. Combined E4orf6/7 expression and p53 inhibition resulted in HDR editing efficiencies of up to 50% in the long-term human graft, without perturbing repopulation and self-renewal of edited HSCs. This enhanced protocol should broaden applicability of HSC gene editing and pave its way to clinical translation. Transient p53 inhibition and induced cell-cycle progression increase clonal engraftment and homology-directed repair in hematopoietic stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W3037588075,"Genetic correlation is a central parameter for understanding shared genetic architecture between complex traits. By using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) was developed for unbiased estimation of genetic correlations. Although easy to use, LDSC only partially utilizes LD information. By fully accounting for LD across the genome, we develop a high-definition likelihood (HDL) method to improve precision in genetic correlation estimation. Compared to LDSC, HDL reduces the variance of genetic correlation estimates by about 60%, equivalent to a 2.5-fold increase in sample size. We apply HDL and LDSC to estimate 435 genetic correlations among 30 behavioral and disease-related phenotypes measured in the UK Biobank (UKBB). In addition to 154 significant genetic correlations observed for both methods, HDL identified another 57 significant genetic correlations, compared to only another 2 significant genetic correlations identified by LDSC. HDL brings more power to genomic analyses and better reveals the underlying connections across human complex traits. The HDL method improves the precision in genetic correlation estimation over LD score regression when applied to GWAS summary statistics of complex traits from the UK Biobank."
https://openalex.org/W3037791176,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays important roles in regulating messenger RNA processing. Despite rapid progress in this field, little is known about the genetic determinants of m6A modification and their role in common diseases. In this study, we mapped the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of m6A peaks in 60 Yoruba (YRI) lymphoblastoid cell lines. We found that m6A QTLs are largely independent of expression and splicing QTLs and are enriched with binding sites of RNA-binding proteins, RNA structure-changing variants and transcriptional features. Joint analysis of the QTLs of m6A and related molecular traits suggests that the downstream effects of m6A are heterogeneous and context dependent. We identified proteins that mediate m6A effects on translation. Through integration with data from genome-wide association studies, we show that m6A QTLs contribute to the heritability of various immune and blood-related traits at levels comparable to splicing QTLs and roughly half of expression QTLs. By leveraging m6A QTLs in a transcriptome-wide association study framework, we identified putative risk genes of these traits."
https://openalex.org/W3037300642,"The contrast and resolution of images obtained with optical microscopes can be improved by deconvolution and computational fusion of multiple views of the same sample, but these methods are computationally expensive for large datasets. Here we describe theoretical and practical advances in algorithm and software design that result in image processing times that are tenfold to several thousand fold faster than with previous methods. First, we show that an 'unmatched back projector' accelerates deconvolution relative to the classic Richardson-Lucy algorithm by at least tenfold. Second, three-dimensional image-based registration with a graphics processing unit enhances processing speed 10- to 100-fold over CPU processing. Third, deep learning can provide further acceleration, particularly for deconvolution with spatially varying point spread functions. We illustrate our methods from the subcellular to millimeter spatial scale on diverse samples, including single cells, embryos and cleared tissue. Finally, we show performance enhancement on recently developed microscopes that have improved spatial resolution, including dual-view cleared-tissue light-sheet microscopes and reflective lattice light-sheet microscopes."
https://openalex.org/W3037082378,"Pachytene PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which comprise >80% of small RNAs in the adult mouse testis, have been proposed to bind and regulate target RNAs like microRNAs, cleave targets like short interfering RNAs or lack biological function altogether. Although piRNA pathway protein mutants are male sterile, no biological function has been identified for any mammalian piRNA-producing locus. Here, we report that males lacking piRNAs from a conserved mouse pachytene piRNA locus on chromosome 6 (pi6) produce sperm with defects in capacitation and egg fertilization. Moreover, heterozygous embryos sired by pi6-/- fathers show reduced viability in utero. Molecular analyses suggest that pi6 piRNAs repress gene expression by cleaving messenger RNAs encoding proteins required for sperm function. pi6 also participates in a network of piRNA-piRNA precursor interactions that initiate piRNA production from a second piRNA locus on chromosome 10, as well as pi6 itself. Our data establish a direct role for pachytene piRNAs in spermiogenesis and embryo viability."
https://openalex.org/W3037530452,"A genetic etiology is identified for one-third of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), with 8% of cases attributable to coding de novo variants (DNVs). To assess the contribution of noncoding DNVs to CHD, we compared genome sequences from 749 CHD probands and their parents with those from 1,611 unaffected trios. Neural network prediction of noncoding DNV transcriptional impact identified a burden of DNVs in individuals with CHD (n = 2,238 DNVs) compared to controls (n = 4,177; P = 8.7 × 10-4). Independent analyses of enhancers showed an excess of DNVs in associated genes (27 genes versus 3.7 expected, P = 1 × 10-5). We observed significant overlap between these transcription-based approaches (odds ratio (OR) = 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-5.0, P = 5.4 × 10-3). CHD DNVs altered transcription levels in 5 of 31 enhancers assayed. Finally, we observed a DNV burden in RNA-binding-protein regulatory sites (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.1-1.2, P = 8.8 × 10-5). Our findings demonstrate an enrichment of potentially disruptive regulatory noncoding DNVs in a fraction of CHD at least as high as that observed for damaging coding DNVs."

https://openalex.org/W3038026221,"Propagation of clonal regulatory programs contributes to cancer development. It is poorly understood how epigenetic mechanisms interact with genetic drivers to shape this process. Here, we combine single-cell analysis of transcription and DNA methylation with a Luria–Delbruck experimental design to demonstrate the existence of clonally stable epigenetic memory in multiple types of cancer cells. Longitudinal transcriptional and genetic analysis of clonal colon cancer cell populations reveals a slowly drifting spectrum of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transcriptional identities that is seemingly independent of genetic variation. DNA methylation landscapes correlate with these identities but also reflect an independent clock-like methylation loss process. Methylation variation can be explained as an effect of global trans-acting factors in most cases. However, for a specific class of promoters—in particular, cancer–testis antigens—de-repression is correlated with and probably driven by loss of methylation in cis. This study indicates how genetic sub-clonal structure in cancer cells can be diversified by epigenetic memory. Longitudinal single-cell analysis of transcription and DNA methylation dynamics in cancer cell lines suggests a clonally stable epigenetic memory. Colon cancer cells show a spectrum of epithelial-to-mesenchymal identities that seems independent of genetic variation."
https://openalex.org/W3037469178,"The ESCRT-III membrane fission machinery maintains the integrity of the nuclear envelope. Although primary nuclei resealing takes minutes, micronuclear envelope ruptures seem to be irreversible. Instead, micronuclear ruptures result in catastrophic membrane collapse and are associated with chromosome fragmentation and chromothripsis, complex chromosome rearrangements thought to be a major driving force in cancer development. Here we use a combination of live microscopy and electron tomography, as well as computer simulations, to uncover the mechanism underlying micronuclear collapse. We show that, due to their small size, micronuclei inherently lack the capacity of primary nuclei to restrict the accumulation of CHMP7–LEMD2, a compartmentalization sensor that detects loss of nuclear integrity. This causes unrestrained ESCRT-III accumulation, which drives extensive membrane deformation, DNA damage and chromosome fragmentation. Thus, the nuclear-integrity surveillance machinery is a double-edged sword, as its sensitivity ensures rapid repair at primary nuclei while causing unrestrained activity at ruptured micronuclei, with catastrophic consequences for genome stability. Vietri et al. show that the micronucleus fails to restrain ESCRT-III spreading due to its small size, resulting in aberrant accumulation of ESCRT-III to drive micronuclear collapse and DNA fragmentation."
https://openalex.org/W3037659659,"Following fertilization in mammals, the gametes are reprogrammed to create a totipotent zygote, a process that involves de novo establishment of chromatin domains. A major feature occurring during preimplantation development is the dramatic remodelling of constitutive heterochromatin, although the functional relevance of this is unknown. Here, we show that heterochromatin establishment relies on the stepwise expression and regulated activity of SUV39H enzymes. Enforcing precocious acquisition of constitutive heterochromatin results in compromised development and epigenetic reprogramming, which demonstrates that heterochromatin remodelling is essential for natural reprogramming at fertilization. We find that de novo H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) in the paternal pronucleus after fertilization is catalysed by SUV39H2 and that pericentromeric RNAs inhibit SUV39H2 activity and reduce H3K9me3. De novo H3K9me3 is initially non-repressive for gene expression, but instead bookmarks promoters for compaction. Overall, we uncover the functional importance for the restricted transmission of constitutive heterochromatin during reprogramming and a non-repressive role for H3K9me3."

In large animal models, reconstruction of the uterus has been demonstrated only with xenogeneic tissue grafts. Here we use biodegradable polymer scaffolds seeded with autologous cells to restore uterine structure and function in rabbits. Rabbits underwent a subtotal uterine excision and were reconstructed with autologous cell-seeded constructs, with nonseeded scaffolds or by suturing. At 6 months postimplantation, only the cell-seeded engineered uteri developed native tissue-like structures, including organized luminal/glandular epithelium, stroma, vascularized mucosa and two-layered myometrium. Only rabbits with cell-seeded constructs had normal pregnancies (four in ten) in the reconstructed segment of the uterus and supported fetal development to term and live birth. With further development, this approach may provide a regenerative medicine solution to uterine factor infertility. The rabbit uterus is reconstructed using synthetic scaffolds seeded with cells."

https://openalex.org/W3037930947,"The conserved region of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) stalk (or stem) has gained attention as a potent target for universal influenza vaccines1-5. Although the HA stalk region is relatively well conserved, the evolutionarily dynamic nature of influenza viruses6 raises concerns about the possible emergence of viruses carrying stalk escape mutation(s) under sufficient immune pressure. Here we show that immune pressure on the HA stalk can lead to expansion of escape mutant viruses in study participants challenged with a 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus inoculum containing an A388V polymorphism in the HA stalk (45% wild type and 55% mutant). High level of stalk antibody titers was associated with the selection of the mutant virus both in humans and in vitro. Although the mutant virus showed slightly decreased replication in mice, it was not observed in cell culture, ferrets or human challenge participants. The A388V mutation conferred resistance to some of the potent HA stalk broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs). Co-culture of wild-type and mutant viruses in the presence of either a bNAb or human serum resulted in rapid expansion of the mutant. These data shed light on a potential obstacle for the success of HA-stalk-targeting universal influenza vaccines-viral escape from vaccine-induced stalk immunity."

https://openalex.org/W3039689528,"Climate change is projected to impact food production stability in many tropical countries through impacts on crop potential. However, without quantitative assessments of where, by how much and to what extent crop production is possible now and under future climatic conditions, efforts to design and implement adaptation strategies under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Action Plans (NAP) are unsystematic. In this study, we used extreme gradient boosting, a machine learning approach to model the current climatic suitability for maize, sorghum, cassava and groundnut in Ghana using yield data and agronomically important variables. We then used multi-model future climate projections for the 2050s and two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) to predict changes in the suitability range of these crops. We achieved a good model fit in determining suitability classes for all crops (AUC = 0.81–0.87). Precipitation-based factors are suggested as most important in determining crop suitability, though the importance is crop-specific. Under projected climatic conditions, optimal suitability areas will decrease for all crops except for groundnuts under RCP8.5 (no change: 0%), with greatest losses for maize (12% under RCP2.6 and 14% under RCP8.5). Under current climatic conditions, 18% of Ghana has optimal suitability for two crops, 2% for three crops with no area having optimal suitability for all the four crops. Under projected climatic conditions, areas with optimal suitability for two and three crops will decrease by 12% as areas having moderate and marginal conditions for multiple crops increase. We also found that although the distribution of multiple crop suitability is spatially distinct, cassava and groundnut will be more simultaneously suitable for the south while groundnut and sorghum will be more suitable for the northern parts of Ghana under projected climatic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3037025526,"In this study, we selected and characterized different pesticide-tolerant bacteria isolated from a biomixture of a biopurification system that had received continuous applications of a pesticides mixture. The amplicon analysis of biomixture reported that the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were predominant. Six strains grew in the presence of chlorpyrifos and iprodione. Biochemical characterization showed that all isolates were positive for esterase, acid phosphatase, among others, and they were identified as Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus and Achromobacter based on molecular and proteomic analysis. Bacterial growth decreased as both pesticide concentrations increased from 10 to 100 mg L-1 in liquid culture. The Achromobacter sp. strain C1 showed the best chlorpyrifos removal rate of 0.072–0.147 d-1 a half-life of 4.7–9.7 d and a maximum metabolite concentration of 2.10 mg L-1 at 120 h. On the other hand, Pseudomonas sp. strain C9 showed the highest iprodione removal rate of 0.100–0.193 d-1 a half-life of 4–7 d and maximum metabolite concentration of 0.95 mg L-1 at 48 h. The Achromobacter and Pseudomonas strains showed a good potential as chlorpyrifos and iprodione-degrading bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3037832215,"A burgeoning epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) threatens to derail global control efforts. Although the mechanisms remain poorly clarified, drug-resistant strains are widely believed to be less infectious than drug-susceptible strains. Consequently, we hypothesized that lower proportions of patients with drug-resistant TB would have culturable Mycobacterium tuberculosis from respirable, cough-generated aerosols compared to patients with drug-susceptible TB, and that multiple factors, including mycobacterial genomic variation, would predict culturable cough aerosol production. We enumerated the colony forming units in aerosols (≤10 µm) from 452 patients with TB (227 with drug resistance), compared clinical characteristics, and performed mycobacterial whole-genome sequencing, dormancy phenotyping and drug-susceptibility analyses on M. tuberculosis from sputum. After considering treatment duration, we found that almost half of the patients with drug-resistant TB were cough aerosol culture-positive. Surprisingly, neither mycobacterial genomic variants, lineage, nor dormancy status predicted cough aerosol culture positivity. However, mycobacterial sputum bacillary load and clinical characteristics, including a lower symptom score and stronger cough, were strongly predictive, thereby supporting targeted transmission-limiting interventions. Effective treatment largely abrogated cough aerosol culture positivity; however, this was not always rapid. These data question current paradigms, inform public health strategies and suggest the need to redirect TB transmission-associated research efforts toward host–pathogen interactions. Culturable Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be detected in cough aerosol from a high proportion of individuals infected with drug-resistant M. tuberculosis and correlate with a strong cough and low symptom score, indicating the need to focus on targeted interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3037451444,"Anthracnose (ANT) and angular leaf spot (ALS) caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum and Pseudocercospora griseola, respectively, are devastating diseases of common bean around the world. Therefore, breeders are constantly searching for new genes with broad-spectrum resistance against ANT and ALS. This study aimed to characterize the genetic resistance of California Dark Red Kidney (CDRK) to C. lindemuthianum races 73, 2047, and 3481 and P. griseola race 63–39 through inheritance, allelism testing, and molecular analyses. Genetic analysis of response to ANT and ALS in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a CDRK × Yolano cross (CY) showed that the resistance of CDRK cultivar is conferred by a single dominant loci, which we named CoPv01CDRK/PhgPv01CDRK. Allelism tests performed with race 3481showed that the resistance gene in CDRK is independent of the Co-1 and Co-AC. We conducted co-segregation analysis in genotypes of 110 CY RILs and phenotypes of the RILs in response to different races of the ANT and ALS pathogens. The results revealed that CoPv01CDRK and PhgPv01CDRK are coinherited, conferring resistance to all races. Genetic mapping of the CY population placed the CoPv01CDRK/PhgPv01CDRK loci in a 245 Kb genomic region at the end of Pv01. By genotyping 19 RILs from the CY population using three additional markers, we fine-mapped the CoPv01CDRK/PhgPv01CDRK loci to a smaller genomic region of 33 Kb. This 33 Kb region harbors five predicted genes based on the common bean reference genome. These results can be applied in breeding programs to develop bean cultivars with ANT and ALS resistance using marker-assisted selection."

Here, we report the transcriptional changes of larval plasmatocytes after clean injury or infection with the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli or the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus compared to hemocytes recovered from unchallenged larvae via RNA-Sequencing. This study reveals 676 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in hemocytes from clean injury samples compared to unchallenged samples, and 235 and 184 DEGs in E. coli and S. aureus samples respectively compared to clean injury samples. The clean injury samples showed enriched DEGs for immunity, clotting, cytoskeleton, cell migration, hemocyte differentiation, and indicated a metabolic reprogramming to aerobic glycolysis, a well-defined metabolic adaptation observed in mammalian macrophages. Microbial infections trigger significant transcription of immune genes, with significant differences between the E. coli and S. aureus samples suggesting that hemocytes have the ability to engage various programs upon infection. Collectively, our data bring new insights on Drosophila hemocyte function and open the route to post-genomic functional analysis of the cellular immune response."
https://openalex.org/W3037682979,"Threatened species recovery programs are increasingly turning to reintroductions to reverse biodiversity loss. Here we present a real-world example where tactics (techniques which influence post-release performance and persistence) and an adaptive management framework (which incorporates feedback between monitoring and future actions) improved reintroduction success. Across three successive trials we investigated the influence of tactics on the effective survival and post-release dispersal of endangered eastern quolls (Dasyurus viverrinus) reintroduced into Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary, Australian Capital Territory. Founders were monitored for 42 days post-release, and probability of survival and post-release dispersal were tested against trial, origin, sex, den sharing and presence of pouch young. We adopted an adaptive management framework, using monitoring to facilitate rapid learning and to implement interventions that improved reintroduction success. Founders released in the first trial were less likely to survive (28.6%, n = 14) than those founders released the second (76.9%, n = 13) and third trials (87.5%, n = 8). We adapted several tactics in the second and third trials, including the selection of female-only founders to avoid elevated male mortality, and post-mating releases to reduce stress. Founders that moved dens between consecutive nights were less likely to survive, suggesting that minimising post-release dispersal can increase the probability of survival. The probability of moving dens was lower in the second and third trials, for females, and when den sharing with another founder. This study demonstrates that, through iterative trials of tactics involving monitoring and learning, adaptive management can be used to significantly improve the success of reintroduction programs."
https://openalex.org/W3038245377,"Cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO) has been reported to exhibit two distinct biological functions with a nonheme iron center. It catalyzes oxidation of both cysteamine in sulfur metabolism and N-terminal cysteine-containing proteins or peptides, such as regulator of G protein signaling 5 (RGS5). It thereby preserves oxygen homeostasis in a variety of physiological processes. However, little is known about its catalytic center and how it interacts with these two types of primary substrates in addition to O2. Here, using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Mossbauer, and UV-visible spectroscopies, we explored the binding mode of cysteamine and RGS5 to human and mouse ADO proteins in their physiologically relevant ferrous form. This characterization revealed that in the presence of nitric oxide as a spin probe and oxygen surrogate, both the small molecule and the peptide substrates coordinate the iron center with their free thiols in a monodentate binding mode, in sharp contrast to binding behaviors observed in other thiol dioxygenases. We observed a substrate-bound B-type dinitrosyl iron center complex in ADO, suggesting the possibility of dioxygen binding to the iron ion in a side-on mode. Moreover, we observed substrate-mediated reduction of the iron center from ferric to the ferrous oxidation state. Subsequent MS analysis indicated corresponding disulfide formation of the substrates, suggesting that the presence of the substrate could reactivate ADO to defend against oxidative stress. The findings of this work contribute to the understanding of the substrate interaction in ADO and fill a gap in our knowledge of the substrate specificity of thiol dioxygenases."
https://openalex.org/W3037822125,"D-amino acids endow peptides with diverse, desirable properties, but the post-translational and site-specific epimerization of L-amino acids into their D-counterparts is rare and chemically challenging. Bottromycins are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides that have overcome this challenge and feature a D-aspartate (D-Asp), which was proposed to arise spontaneously during biosynthesis. We have identified the highly unusual α/β-hydrolase (ABH) fold enzyme BotH as a peptide epimerase responsible for the post-translational epimerization of L-Asp to D-Asp during bottromycin biosynthesis. The biochemical characterization of BotH combined with the structures of BotH and the BotH-substrate complex allowed us to propose a mechanism for this reaction. Bioinformatic analyses of BotH homologs show that similar ABH enzymes are found in diverse biosynthetic gene clusters.

In an effort to define a robust experimental approach for effective selection of lytic viruses for therapy, we have fully characterized the genomes of 18 Kumoniae target strains and tested them against novel lytic bacteriophages (n = 65). The genomes of K pneumoniae carrying blaNDM and blaKPC were sequenced and CG258 isolates selected for bacteriophage susceptibility testing. The local K pneumoniae CG258 population was dominated by sequence type ST258 clade 1 (86%) with variations in capsular locus (cps) and prophage content. CG258-specific bacteriophages primarily targeted the capsule, but successful infection is also likely blocked in some by immunity conferred by existing prophages. Five tailed bacteriophages against K pneumoniae ST258 clade 1 were selected for further characterization. Our findings show that effective control of K pneumoniae CG258 with bacteriophage will require mixes of diverse lytic viruses targeting relevant cps variants and allowing for variable prophage content.

https://openalex.org/W3038146146,"Background Progestin-only pills are associated with irregular bleeding pattern including amenorrhea. Desogestrel 75mcg even being a pill that inhibits ovulation shows a poor cycle control that limits a more common use. A drospirenone (DRSP)-only pill was developed to improve the bleeding profile. Methods A phase III study in healthy women aged 18 to 45 years was performed to compare the bleeding profile and safety of women taking a DRSP only pill in a regime of 24 days of 4 mg of DRSP tablets followed by 4 days of placebo versus desogestrel 0.075 mg per day continuously over 9 cycles. A total of 858 women with 6691 drospirenone and 332 women with 2487 desogestrel treatment cycles were analyzed. The primary endpoint was the proportion of women with bleeding/spotting days in each cycle from cycles 2 to 9 and cumulative in cycles 2 to 4 and cycles 7 to 9 including and excluding those with amenorrhea. Findings In each cycle, up to cycle 7, the proportion of women with unscheduled bleeding including those which did not bleed was statistically significantly lower in the DRSP group than in the DSG group (p = 0.0001, chi-square test). The mean [SD] number of unscheduled bleeding and spotting days during cycles 2–9 was statistically significantly lower in the DRSP group than in the DSG group (21.5 [22.86] days vs. 34.7 [33.73] days, p = 0.0003, Wilcoxon-rank-sum-test). Excluding amenorrhoeic women following results were obtained: In the cycles 2–6, the proportion of women with unscheduled bleeding was statistically significantly lower in the DRSP group than in the DSG group (p = 0.0001, chi-square test). The mean [SD] number of bleeding days was 8.6 [8.52] days vs. 12.9 [16.47] days, p = 0.0233. Conclusions This report describes the improvement in bleeding profile of women using the new DRSP only oral contraceptive in comparison to DSG providing a better quality of live and adherence to the contraceptive method.

Despite the efforts made to improve maternal health care service utilization, unsafe abortion yet constitutes the highest maternal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) including Ethiopia. Although abortion among reproductive-age women is a common problem in Ethiopia, there is limited evidence about the spatial distribution and determinants of abortion. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the spatial distribution and determinants of abortion among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia.A secondary data analysis was conducted using the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. A total of 12378 reproductive-age women were included in this study. The Bernoulli model was fitted using SaTScan version 9.6 statistical software to identify significant hotspot areas of abortion and ArcGIS version 10.6 statistical software was used to explore the spatial distributions of abortion. For the determinant factors, a mixed effect logistic regression model was fitted to take into account the hierarchical nature of the EDHS data. Deviance (-2LL), AIC, BIC, and ICC were used for model comparison. The AOR with a 95% CI was estimated for the potential determinants of abortion.The overall prevalence of abortion in Ethiopia was 8.9% ranging from 4.5% in Benishangul to 11.3% in Tigray regions. The spatial analysis revealed that abortion was significantly varied across the country. The SaTScan analysis identified a total of 60 significant clusters, of these 19 clusters were primary clusters. The primary clusters were located in the northern part of the Tigray region (LLR = 26.6, p<0.01; RR = 2.63). In the multivariable mixed-effect logistic regression analysis; primary education [AOR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.64], rural residence [AOR = 4.96; 95% CI: 3.42, 7.18], protestant religion follower [AOR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.75], richest wealth status [AOR = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.40], maternal age 45-49 years [AOR = 3.12; 95% CI: 1.52, 6.44], listening radio [AOR = 1.27; 1.01, 1.60], and watching television [AOR = 1.45; 1.04, 2.01] were significant determinants of abortion.The prevalence of abortion remains unacceptably high in Ethiopia. The spatial distribution of abortion has been significantly varied across regions in Ethiopia. Having primary education, being rural, having media exposure, and being from the richest household were significantly associated with higher odds of abortion whereas being protestant religious followers were associated with lower odds of abortion. Therefore, the government should design public health programs targeting the identified hotspot areas of abortion and should scale up maternal health programs in rural areas, to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3037918420,"Alterations in glycosylation are seen in many types of cancer, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Glycans, the sugar moieties of glycoconjugates, are involved in many important functions relevant to cancer and can be of value as biomarkers. In this study, we have used mass spectrometry to analyze the N-glycan profiles of 35 CRC tissue samples and 10 healthy tissue samples from non-CRC patients who underwent operations for other reasons. The tumor samples were divided into groups depending on tumor location (right or left colon) and stage (II or III), while the healthy samples were divided into right or left colon. The levels of neutral and acidic N-glycan compositions and glycan classes were analyzed in a total of ten different groups. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in glycan levels when all right- and left-sided CRC samples were compared, and few differences (such as in the abundance of the neutral N-glycan H3N5) were seen when the samples were divided according to both location and stage. Multiple significant differences were found in the levels of glycans and glycan classes when stage II and III samples were compared, and these glycans could be of value as candidates for new markers of cancer progression. In order to validate our findings, we analyzed healthy tissue samples from the right and left colon and found no significant differences in the levels of any of the glycans analyzed, confirming that our findings when comparing CRC samples from the right and left colon are not due to normal variations in the levels of glycans between the healthy right and left colon. Additionally, the levels of the acidic glycans H4N3F1P1, H5N4F1P1, and S1H5N4F1 were found to change in a cancer-specific but colon location-nonspecific manner, indicating that CRC affects glycan levels in similar ways regardless of tumor location."
https://openalex.org/W3037577984,"Estuaries are characterized by high fluctuation of their environmental conditions. Environmental parameters measured show that the seawater properties of the Quempillén estuary (i.e. temperature, salinity, pCO2, pH and ΩCaCO3) were highly fluctuating and related with season and tide. We test the effects of increasing temperature and pCO2 in the seawater on the physiological energetics of the bivalve Ostrea chilensis. Juvenile oysters were exposed to an orthogonal combination of three temperatures (10, 15, and 20°C) and two pCO2 levels (~400 and ~1000 μatm) for a period of 60 days to evaluate the temporal effect (i.e. 10, 20, 30, 60 days) on the physiological rates of the oysters. Results indicated a significant effect of temperature and time of exposure on the clearance rate, while pCO2 and the interaction between pCO2 and the other factors studied did not show significant effects. Significant effects of temperature and time of exposure were also observed on the absorption rate, but not the pCO2 nor its interaction with other factors studied. Oxygen consumption was significantly affected by pCO2, temperature and time. Scope for growth was only significantly affected by time; despite this, the highest values were observed for individuals subject to to 20°C and to ~1000 μatm pCO2. In this study, Ostrea chilensis showed high phenotypic plasticity to respond to the high levels of temperature and pCO2 experienced in its habitat as no negative physiological effects were observed. Thus, the highly variable conditions of this organism's environment could select for individuals that are more resistant to future scenarios of climate change, mainly to warming and acidification."
https://openalex.org/W3037568836,"Introduction Over 120 US jurisdictions have implemented policies mandating minimum cigar pack quantities, yet little empirical research exists on the relationship between pack quantity and use. We examined whether cigar use was associated with purchasing cigars by the box/pack or as singles, purchase quantity, and price paid per cigar. Methods Data are from Waves 1–3 (2013–2016) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, analyzed in 2019. The sample included adults who reported current use of any type of cigars (cigarillos [N = 3,051], traditional cigars [N = 2,586], and filtered cigars [N = 1,295], including with marijuana) at Wave 1. For each cigar type, a generalized estimating equation model was used to examine the population-averaged effects of purchasing behavior on cigar use. Results Cigar users of each type who purchased by the box or pack smoked more per day than users who purchased singles (cigarillos: β = 1.02, p<0.0001; traditional cigars: β = 1.40, p<0.0001; filtered cigars: β = 2.55, p<0.01). Cigar users who purchased larger quantities smoked more per day (cigarillos: β = 0.16, p<0.0001; traditional cigars: β = 0.04, p<0.0001; filtered cigars: β = 0.24, p<0.0001). Higher price per cigar was significantly associated with smoking fewer traditional cigars (β = -0.12, p<0.01) and filtered cigars (β = -0.86, p = 0.02), but not cigarillos (β = 0.08, p = 0.62). Conclusions Smaller pack quantities and higher price per cigar were associated with smoking fewer cigars per day. Given the authority of the Food and Drug Administration and local jurisdictions over cigar pack quantity, this study provides data pertinent to potential minimum and maximum package quantity regulations and policies."
https://openalex.org/W3038940252,"Introduction Modern contraceptive use provides opportunities for women and couples to achieve optimal child spacing, achieve desired family size and reduce unsafe abortions. Despite these facts, modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) in Tanzania remains as low as 32%. This study aimed to determine trends and factors associated with changes in modern contraceptive use among women of reproductive age in Tanzania from 2004–2016. Methodology This was a cross-sectional study utilizing data from Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys of 2004–2005, 2010 and 2015–2016. Data analysis was performed using Stata version 14. Analysis considered the complex survey design through application of weights, clustering and strata. Multivariable Poisson decomposition analysis was used to assess factors associated with changes in modern contraceptive use. Results were presented in the form of decomposition coefficients and percentages. Results Modern contraceptive use increased from 23.0% in 2004 to 34.3% in 2016. Differences in women’s characteristics contributed 12.5% of the increase in mCPR. These characteristics include partner’s education levels, recent sexual activity and being visited by a family planning worker. The difference in coefficients contributed 87.5% increase in mCPR. The most increase in modern contraceptive use was attributed to rural population (44.1%) and women who experienced a termination of pregnancy (7.1%). Conclusion Modern contraceptive use has steadily increased in Tanzania. Health policies and interventions need to target sexually active women, rural residents as well as less educated women and men to maintain and further accelerate the trends in mCPR. Interventions focusing on women who experienced a termination of pregnancy may also serve as an entry point to promote use of modern contraceptive methods."
https://openalex.org/W3040066964,"Obesity is a multifactorial disease and represents a global and relevant health problem. The aim of the study was to assess the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8)) and other selected proteins as well as enzymes (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM1), calprotectin, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), toll like receptor 2 (TLR2)) detectable in the saliva of women who varied in body composition. It was debated whether there are marker factors in saliva that could indicate metabolic obesity.The pilot study included 10 women with obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2) and 6 women with normal body weight (control group). The levels of TNF-α, IL-8, sICAM1, calprotectin, MMP-9, MMP-2, and TLR2 were checked by using the ELISA technique. We proved that women with metabolic obesity had significantly increased concentrations of IL-8, calprotectin, and MMP-2 in comparison with healthy subjects. Significant positive correlations of BMI with TNF-α, IL-8, and MMP-2 were observed. Similarly, the content of fat (in kg and %) in the bodies of the women correlated positively with TNF-α, IL-8, and MMP-2. Whereas, the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) correlated positively only with TNF-α and MMP-2, similarly to VAT/SAT. The WHR (waist hip ratio) was also positively correlated with TNF-α and MMP-2. Interestingly, we found that the level of insulin positively correlated with TNF- α concentration, which additionally confirmed metabolic obesity.We found that positive correlations of body mass index were observed only with salivary concentrations of TNF-α, MMP-2, and IL-8. Thus, it is worth conducting a study among a larger number of people taking into account these three salivary components."
https://openalex.org/W3039368904,"East Coast fever (ECF) and Corridor disease (CD) caused by cattle- and buffalo-derived T. parva respectively are the most economically important tick-borne diseases of cattle in the affected African countries. The p67 gene has been evaluated as a recombinant subunit vaccine against ECF, and for discrimination of T. parva parasites causing ECF and Corridor disease. The p67 allele type 1 was first identified in cattle-derived T. parva parasites from East Africa, where parasites possessing this allele type have been associated with ECF. Subsequent characterization of buffalo-derived T. parva parasites from South Africa where ECF was eradicated, revealed the presence of a similar allele type, raising concerns as to whether or not allele type 1 from parasites from the two regions is identical. A 900 bp central fragment of the gene encoding p67 was PCR amplified from T. parva DNA extracted from blood collected from cattle and buffalo in South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, followed by DNA sequence analysis. Four p67 allele types previously described were identified. A subtype of p67 allele type 1 was identified in parasites from clinical cases of CD and buffalo from southern Africa. Notably, p67 allele type 1 sequences from parasites associated with ECF in East Africa and CD in Kenya were identical. Analysis of two p67 B-cell epitopes (TpM12 and AR22.7) revealed amino acid substitutions in allele type 1 from buffalo-derived T. parva parasites from southern Africa. However, both epitopes were conserved in allele type 1 from cattle- and buffalo-derived T. parva parasites from East Africa. These findings reveal detection of a subtype of p67 allele type 1 associated with T. parva parasites transmissible from buffalo to cattle in southern Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3038462200,"To better understand the mechanism of inherent salt resistance in Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.), physiological and metabolic responses of tubers at the initiation stage of sprouting under different salt stress levels were evaluated in the present study. As a result, 28 metabolites were identified using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy. Jerusalem artichoke tubers showed minor changes in metabolic response under moderate salt stress when they had not yet sprouted, where metabolism was downregulated at the start of sprouting and then upregulated significantly after plants became autotrophic. However, mild and severe salt stress levels caused different metabolic response patterns. In addition, the accumulation of fructose and sucrose was enhanced by moderate salt stress, while glucose was highly consumed. Aspartate and asparagine showed accelerated accumulation in sprouting Jerusalem artichoke tubers that became autotrophic, suggesting the enhancement of photosynthesis by moderate salt stress."
https://openalex.org/W3038636944,"This report elaborates on adaptations of the eyes of the whale shark Rhincodon typus (Elasmobranchii, Rhincodontidae), including the discovery that they are covered with dermal denticles, which is a novel mechanism of eye protection in vertebrates. The eye denticle differs in morphology from that of the dermal denticles distributed over the rest of the body, consistent with a different function (abrasion resistance). We also demonstrate that the whale shark has a strong ability to retract the eyeball into the eye socket. The retraction distance was calculated to be approximately half the diameter of the eye, which is comparable to those of other vertebrates that are known to have highly retractable eyes. These highly protective features of the whale shark eye seem to emphasize the importance of vision for environmental perception, which contradicts the general, though poorly established, notion of low reliance on vision in this species."
https://openalex.org/W3039349167,"Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an independent risk factor for lung cancer (LC) development; however, its effect on recurrence after curative surgery remains unclear. Objectives This study aimed to determine the impact of IPF on recurrence-free survival following curative surgical resection of stage I–III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and investigate the effects of patient and surgical factors on the risk of recurrence. Methods We reviewed retrospectively collected data of patients with surgically resected stage I–III NSCLC from two tertiary care hospitals in South Korea. By propensity score matching, patients with IPF (LC with IPF) were matched to those without IPF (LC without IPF). Results In total, 3416 patients underwent surgical resection, and 96 were diagnosed with underlying IPF. In the LC with IPF group, 89.6% patients were men, and the average age was 69.7 years. Sublobar resection was performed more frequently in the LC with IPF group than in the LC without IPF group, while the rate of mediastinal lymph node dissection and dissected node number were lower in the former group. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was significantly lower in the LC with IPF group (49.2%) than in the LC without IPF group (69.1%; P<0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that IPF and postoperative stage III were independent risk factors for recurrence. Conclusions IPF may increase the risk of recurrence after curative surgical treatment for NSCLC. Close surveillance for recurrence is mandatory for patients with underlying IPF."
https://openalex.org/W3037741393,"The Dof (DNA-binding one zinc finger) transcription factor family is a representative of plant-specific classes of transcription factors. In this study, we performed a genome-wide screening and characterization of the Dof gene family within two tetraploid species Gossypium barbadense, Gossypium hirsutum, and two diploid species Gossypium arboreum, Gossypium raimondii. 115, 116, 55 and 56 Dof genes were identified respectively and all of the genes contain a sequence encoding the Dof DNA-binding domain. Those genes were unevenly distributed across 13/26 chromosomes of the cotton. Genome comparison revealed that segmental duplication may have played crucial roles in the expansion of the cotton Dof gene family, and tandem duplication also played a minor role. Analysis of RNA-Seq data indicated that cotton Dof gene expression levels varied across different tissues and in response to different abiotic stress. Overall, our results could provide valuable information for better understanding the evolution of cotton Dof genes, and lays a foundation for future investigation in cotton."
https://openalex.org/W3039811287,"Parkinson´s disease is characterized by the accumulation of proteinaceous aggregates in Lewy bodies and Lewy Neurites. The main component found in such aggregates is α-synuclein. Here, we investigate how bovine eye lens crystallin proteins influence the aggregation kinetics of α-synuclein at mildly acidic pH (5.5) where the underlying aggregation mechanism of this protein is dominated by secondary nucleation of monomers on fibril surface providing an autocatalytic amyloid amplification process. Bovine α-, βH- and γB-crystallins were found to display chaperone-like activity inhibiting α-synuclein aggregation. This effect was shown to be time-dependent, with early additions of α-crystallin capable of retarding and even inhibiting aggregation during the time frame of the experiment. The inhibitory nature of crystallins was further investigated using trap and seed kinetic experiments. We propose crystallins interact with mature α-synuclein fibrils, possibly binding along the surfaces and at fibril free ends, inhibiting both elongation and monomer-dependent secondary nucleation processes in a mechanism that may be generic to some chaperones that prevent the onset of protein misfolding related pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W3037790422,"Regulation of ribosomal transcription is under tight control from environmental stimuli, and this control involves changes in the chromatin structure. The underlying mechanism of how chromatin changes in response to nutrient and energy supply in the cell is still unclear. The chromatin-remodeling complex B-WICH is involved in activating the ribosomal transcription, and we show here that knock down of the B-WICH component WSTF results in cells that do not respond to glucose. The promoter is less accessible, and RNA pol I and its transcription factors SL1/TIF-1B and RRN3/TIF-1A, as well as the proto-oncogene c-MYC and the activating deacetylase SIRT7 do not bind upon glucose stimulation. In contrast, the repressive chromatin state that forms after glucose deprivation is reversible, and RNA pol I factors are recruited. WSTF knock down results in an accumulation of the ATPase CHD4, a component of the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex, which is responsible for establishing a repressive poised state at the promoter. The TTF-1, which binds and affect the binding of the chromatin complexes, is important to control the association of activating chromatin component UBF. We suggest that B-WICH is required to allow for a shift to an active chromatin state upon environmental stimulation, by counteracting the repressive state induced by the NuRD complex."
https://openalex.org/W3038066251,"Examining factors that may explain disparities in fitness levels among youth is a critical step in youth fitness promotion. The purpose of this study was twofold; 1) to examine the influence of school-level characteristics on fitness test performance; 2) to compare Irish adolescents' physical fitness to European norms.Adolescents (n = 1215, girls = 609) aged 13.4 years (SD .41) from a randomised sample of 20 secondary schools, stratified for gender, location and educational (dis)advantage, completed a series of field-based tests to measure the components of health-related physical fitness. Tests included: body mass index; 20 metre shuttle run test (20 m SRT); handgrip strength; standing broad jump (SBJ); 4 x 10 metre shuttle run; and back-saver sit-and-reach (BSR).Overall, boys outperformed girls in all tests, aside from the BSR (p < 0.005, t-test, Bonferroni correction). Participants in designated disadvantaged schools had significantly higher body mass index levels (p < 0.001), and significantly lower cardiorespiratory endurance (20 m SRT) (p < 0.001) and muscular strength (handgrip strength) (p = 0.018) levels compared to participants in non-disadvantaged schools. When compared to European norms, girls in this study scored significantly higher in the 20 m SRT, 4 x 10 metre shuttle run and SBJ tests, while boys scored significantly higher in the BSR test (Cohen's d 0.2 to 0.6, p < 0.001). However, European adolescents had significantly higher handgrip strength scores (Cohen's d 0.6 to 0.8, p < 0.001).Irish adolescents compared favourably to European normative values across most components of HRPF, with the exception of muscular strength. School socioeconomic status was a strong determinant of performance among Irish adolescents. The contrasting findings for different fitness components reiterate the need for multi-component testing batteries for monitoring fitness in youth."
https://openalex.org/W3039558820,"Background The optimum risk score determining perioperative mortality and morbidity in cardiac surgery remains debated. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) derived from glycaemic and oxidative stress accumulate to a comparable amount in skin and the cardiovascular system leading to a decline in organ function. We aimed to study the association between AGE accumulation measured as skin autofluorescence (sAF) and the outcome of cardiac surgery patients. Methods Between April 2008 and November 2016, data from 758 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement or a combined procedure were analyzed. Skin autofluorescence was measured using an autofluorescence reader. Beside mortality, for the combined categorical morbidity outcome of each patient failure of the cardiac-, pulmonary-, renal- and cerebral system, as well as reoperation and wound healing disorders were counted. Patients without or with only one of the outcomes were assigned zero points whereas more than one outcome failure resulted in one point. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated in multivariable logistic regression analysis with other preoperative parameters and the established cardiac surgery risk score systems EuroSCORE II and STS score. Results Skin autofluorescence as non-invasive marker of tissue glycation provided the best prognostic value in identifying patients with major morbidity risks after cardiac surgery (OR = 3.13; 95%CI 2.16–4.54). With respect to mortality prediction the STS score (OR = 1.24; 95%CI 1.03–1.5) was superior compared to the EuroSCORE II (OR = 1.17: 95%CI 0.96–1.43), but not superior when compared to sAF (OR = 6.04; 95%CI 2.44–14.95). Conclusion This finding suggests that skin autofluorescence is a good biomarker candidate to assess the perioperative risk of patients in cardiac surgery. Since the EuroSCORE does not contain a morbidity component, in our view further sAF measurement is an option."
https://openalex.org/W3038971080,"Mechanical loading on bone tissue is an important physiological stimulus that plays a key role in bone growth, fracture repair, and treatment of bone diseases. Osteocytes (bone cells embedded in bone matrix) are well accepted as the sensor cells to mechanical loading and play a critical role in regulating the bone structure in response to mechanical loading. To understand the response of osteocytes to differential mechanical stimulation in physiologically relevant arrangements, there is a need for a platform which can locally stimulate bone cells with different levels of fluid shear stress. In this study, we developed a device aiming to achieve non-contact local mechanical stimulation of osteocytes with a magnetically actuated beam that generates the fluid shear stresses encountered in vivo. The stimulating beam was made from a composite of magnetic powder and polymer, where a magnetic field was used to precisely oscillate the beam in the horizontal plane. The beam is placed above a cell-seeded surface with an estimated gap height of 5 μm. Finite element simulations were performed to quantify the shear stress values and to generate a shear stress map in the region of interest. Osteocytes were seeded on the device and were stimulated while their intracellular calcium responses were quantified and correlated with their position and local shear stress value. We observed that cells closer to the oscillating beam respond earlier compared to cells further away from the local shear stress gradient generated by the oscillating beam. We have demonstrated the capability of our device to mimic the propagation of calcium signalling to osteocytes outside of the stimulatory region. This device will allow for future studies of osteocyte network signalling with a physiologically accurate localized shear stress gradient."
https://openalex.org/W3038995309,"In this study, we were challenging to identify characteristic compounds in breast cancer cell lines. GC analysis of extracts from the culture media of breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, SK-BR-3, and YMB-1) using a solid-phase Porapak Q extraction revealed that two compounds of moderate volatility, 1-hexadecanol and 5-(Z)-dodecenoic acid, were detected with markedly higher amount than those in the medium of fibroblast cell line (KMST-6). Furthermore, LC-TOF/MS analysis of the extracts clarified that in addition to the above two fatty acids, the amounts of five unsaturated fatty acids [decenoic acid (C10:1), decadienoic acid (C10:2), 5-(Z)-dodecenoic acid (C12:1), 5-(Z)-tetradecenoic acid (C14:1), and tetradecadienoic acid (C14:2)] in MCF-7 medium were higher than those in medium of KMST-6. Interestingly, H2O2-oxidation of 5-(Z)-dodecenoic acid and 5-(Z)-tetradecenoic acid produced volatile aldehydes that were reported as specific volatiles in breath from various cancer patients, such as heptanal, octanal, nonanal, decanal, 2-(E)-nonenal, and 2-(E)-octenal. Thus, we concluded that these identified compounds over-produced in breast cancer cells in this study could serve as potential precursors producing reported cancer-specific volatiles."

We conducted an experiment to investigate the role of environmental calcium and phosphate in causing SLS in tadpoles. Our 600-tadpole experiment used a fully-factorial design, rearing Atelopus varius tadpoles in water with either high (80mg/l CaCO3), medium (50mg/l CaCO3), or low calcium hardness (20mg/l CaCO3), each was combined with high (1.74 mg/l PO4) or low (0.36 mg/l PO4) phosphate levels. We found that calcium supplementation significantly improved tadpole survival from 19% to 49% and that low calcium treatments had 60% SLS that was reduced to about 15% at the medium and high calcium treatments. Phosphate supplementation significantly reduced SLS prevalence in low calcium treatments. This experimental research clearly links SLS to the calcium: phosphate homeostatic system, but we were unable to completely eliminate the issue, suggesting an interactive role of other unidentified factors."
https://openalex.org/W3039982356,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection among women of reproductive age. Increasing evidence suggests BV may be sexually transmitted indicating a potential role for the treatment of sexual partners. If partner treatment reduces BV recurrence in women, real-world success will depend on sexual partners’ willingness to accept it. However, a lack of data exists on the acceptability of partner treatment among sexual partners, and no data exists on male partners’ experience of BV specifically. The aim of this study was to explore male partners’ views and experience of BV and their attitudes toward associated partner treatment. A social constructionist approach informed the framework of this study. Semi structured interviews were conducted with eleven men who participated in a BV partner treatment trial. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. In the absence of symptoms in themselves, BV had little impact on men beyond their concerns for their partner’s health and self-esteem. Acceptance of treatment was largely a demonstration of care and support. While all participants had accepted treatment, men surmised the primary reasons other men may reject treatment as being: if they felt BV had “nothing to do with them”, which was related to not wanting to be viewed as having a ‘problem’ and exacerbated by norms of masculinity and STI-related stigma; lack of a diagnostic test to indicate if a male “had BV”; and a casual or less established relationship. Men’s attitudes to BV and partner treatment were primarily influenced by the nature of their relationships. The ambiguous aetiology of BV appears to attenuate STI related stigma and questions of infidelity."

Phenamacril is the first member of a novel class of single-site acting cyanoacrylate fungicides which has proven highly effective against important members of the genus Fusarium. However, the recent emergence of field-resistant strains exhibiting qualitative resistance poses a major obstacle for the continued use of phenamacril. In this study, we synthesized novel cyanoacrylate compounds based on the phenamacril-scaffold to test their growth-inhibitory potential against wild-type Fusarium and phenamacril-resistant strains.

https://openalex.org/W3038123280,"This study evaluated the reproducibility of the Teller Acuity Cards (TAC) test, its correlation with the optotype test, and its usefulness for detecting amblyopia in preliterate children. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 64 children who had undergone the TAC test more than once and were later followed up with the optotype test. The mean corrected visual acuities (logMAR) of the first and last TAC tests were 0.86 (mean 19.9 months) and 0.69 (27.7 months), respectively. The first optotype acuity was 0.18 (33.7 months). The first TAC acuity result was positively correlated with the age of the child, but it was not statistically significant (r = -0.077, p > 0.05). The first and last TAC test acuities were significantly correlated (r = 0.382, p < 0.01). There was a significant but small correlation between the final TAC and the first optotype acuities (r = 0.193, p < 0.05). Interocular differences in visual acuity were significantly correlated between the last TAC and first optotype tests (r = 0.395, p < 0.05). TAC acuity might be a valid predictor of optotype acuity later on although it was underestimated compared to that in the optotype test. The TAC test can be used to detect unilateral amblyopia in preliterate children."
