Dimethylsulfide (DMS), which constitutes about 90% of this marine sulfur flux, is presumed to originate from the decomposition of dimethylsulfoniopropionate produced by marine organisms, particularly phytoplankton. The rate of DMS release by phytoplankton is greatly increased when the phytoplankton are subjected to grazing by zooplankton. DMS production associated with such grazing may be the major mechanism of DMS production in many marine settings."

This historical information suggests that sedimentary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, at least at this location, result primarily from the anthropogenic combustion of fossil fuels."

https://openalex.org/W2071964641,"Spark discharge is shown to be a cyclic process of energy dissipation, with one spark in a time-connected train influenced by its relation to predecessor sparks. Spectroscopic instruments having temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution indicate that the light emission is highly ordered with cylindrical symmetry about the current-conducting spark channel. The favored spatial coincidence is between the channel and the most highly ionized and most excited species sampled from the cathode, with less ionized and less excited species emitting farther outward. Light absorption occurs to such an extent that there are full line reversals in excited states of magnesium ions, distant from the channel. Schlieren data indicate a toroidal structure in the postdischarge environment. Charge transfer, Penning ionization, and sensitized fluorescence are thought to be the chemical mechanisms responsible for the spectroscopic topography. Experiments in spectrochemical analysis based on the topography and designed for increased sensitivity, reduced matrix effects, and simpler spectra are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2065784275,"The character of solar rotation has been examined for two periods in the early 17th century for which detailed sunspot drawings are available: A.D. 1625 through 1626 and 1642 through 1644. The first period occurred 20 years before the start of the Maunder sunspot minimum, 1645 through 1715; the second occurred just at its commencement. Solar rotation in the earlier period was much like that of today. In the later period, the equatorial velocity of the sun was faster by 3 to 5 percent and the differential rotation was enhanced by a factor of 3. The equatorial acceleration with declining solar activity is in the same sense as that found in recent Doppler data. It seems likely that the change in rotation of the solar surface between 1625 and 1645 was associated with the onset of the Maunder Minimum."

Mercury anomalies extend the greatest distance downstream in the tributaries, the finest size fraction of bottom sediment, the river-bank deposits, the suspended sediment, and water; the last two of these categories contribute the bulk of the mercury to the marine environment."

The Leon monkey-passage strain of poliomyelitis virus was successfully adapted to CFW Swiss mice by means of this technic. Since this manuscript was submitted we have isolated several strains of poliomyelitis virus from infected human feces and spinal cord in CFW Swiss mice by means of this technic."

https://openalex.org/W1966502448,The tendencies for movement of either solvent or solute in solution through a two-phased system are expressed in terms of specific (volumed) free energies. These are based on the concept of escaping tendency or free energy of a constituent component of a solution. This scheme is particularly useful to the biologist for evaluating the movement of water and solutes into cells or organs.
