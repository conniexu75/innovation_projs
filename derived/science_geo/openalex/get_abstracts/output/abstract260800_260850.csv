https://openalex.org/W2112001233,"Significant fractions of eukaryotic genomes give rise to RNA, much of which is unannotated and has reduced protein-coding potential. The genomic origins and the associations of human nuclear and cytosolic polyadenylated RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) and whole-cell RNAs less than 200 nt were investigated in this genome-wide study. Subcellular addresses for nucleotides present in detected RNAs were assigned, and their potential processing into short RNAs was investigated. Taken together, these observations suggest a novel role for some unannotated RNAs as primary transcripts for the production of short RNAs. Three potentially functional classes of RNAs have been identified, two of which are syntenically conserved and correlate with the expression state of protein-coding genes. These data support a highly interleaved organization of the human transcriptome."

The trap can be loaded by creating polaritons 50 micrometers from its center that are allowed to drift into the trap. When the density of polaritons exceeds a critical threshold, we observe a number of signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation: spectral and spatial narrowing, a peak at zero momentum in the momentum distribution, first-order coherence, and spontaneous linear polarization of the light emission. The polaritons, which are eigenstates of the light-matter system in a microcavity, remain in the strong coupling regime while going through this dynamical phase transition."

Nearly 50% of the Ae. aegypti genome consists of transposable elements. These contribute to a factor of ∼4 to 6 increase in average gene length and in sizes of intergenic regions relative to An. gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster . Nonetheless, chromosomal synteny is generally maintained among all three insects, although conservation of orthologous gene order is higher (by a factor of ∼2) between the mosquito species than between either of them and the fruit fly. An increase in genes encoding odorant binding, cytochrome P450, and cuticle domains relative to An. gambiae suggests that members of these protein families underpin some of the biological differences between the two mosquito species."

https://openalex.org/W2157121532,"Based on observed atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration and an inverse method, we estimate that the Southern Ocean sink of CO 2 has weakened between 1981 and 2004 by 0.08 petagrams of carbon per year per decade relative to the trend expected from the large increase in atmospheric CO 2 . We attribute this weakening to the observed increase in Southern Ocean winds resulting from human activities, which is projected to continue in the future. Consequences include a reduction of the efficiency of the Southern Ocean sink of CO 2 in the short term (about 25 years) and possibly a higher level of stabilization of atmospheric CO 2 on a multicentury time scale."
https://openalex.org/W2083524788,"Episodic eddy-driven upwelling may supply a significant fraction of the nutrients required to sustain primary productivity of the subtropical ocean. New observations in the northwest Atlantic reveal that, although plankton blooms occur in both cyclones and mode-water eddies, the biological responses differ. Mode-water eddies can generate extraordinary diatom biomass and primary production at depth, relative to the time series near Bermuda. These blooms are sustained by eddy/wind interactions, which amplify the eddy-induced upwelling. In contrast, eddy/wind interactions dampen eddy-induced upwelling in cyclones. Carbon export inferred from oxygen anomalies in eddy cores is one to three times as much as annual new production for the region."
https://openalex.org/W2041354504,"In theory, silicon, the semiconductor of choice for today's electronic chips and transistors, should also be suitable for spintronics applications. But despite its long spin lifetime, it has not been possible to demonstrate coherent spin transport in silicon. Now Appelbaum et al., using a system designed to avoid unwanted magnetoelectronic effects and the mismatch between ferromagnetic metal electrodes and silicon, have developed a functioning silicon-based spintronics device. It features a layer made from aluminium and iron cobalt, placed between an insulating barrier and the silicon, where it filters out electrons of a particular spin. Coherent spin transport in silicon has remained elusive despite its theoretically very long spin lifetime, which would make it an ideal material for spintronics applications. Appelbaum et al. have designed a radical device that avoids previous experimental problems by using the principle of hot-electron filtering through ferromagnetic thin films for both spin-injection and detection, and succeed in demonstrating coherent spin transport across a silicon channel of 10 micrometres across. The spin lifetime and diffusion length of electrons are transport parameters that define the scale of coherence in spintronic devices and circuits. As these parameters are many orders of magnitude larger in semiconductors than in metals1,2, semiconductors could be the most suitable for spintronics. So far, spin transport has only been measured in direct-bandgap semiconductors3,4,5,6,7,8,9 or in combination with magnetic semiconductors, excluding a wide range of non-magnetic semiconductors with indirect bandgaps. Most notable in this group is silicon, Si, which (in addition to its market entrenchment in electronics) has long been predicted a superior semiconductor for spintronics with enhanced lifetime and transport length due to low spin–orbit scattering and lattice inversion symmetry10,11,12. Despite this promise, a demonstration of coherent spin transport in Si has remained elusive, because most experiments focused on magnetoresistive devices; these methods fail because of a fundamental impedance mismatch between ferromagnetic metal and semiconductor13, and measurements are obscured by other magnetoelectronic effects14. Here we demonstrate conduction-band spin transport across 10 μm undoped Si in a device that operates by spin-dependent ballistic hot-electron filtering through ferromagnetic thin films for both spin injection and spin detection. As it is not based on magnetoresistance, the hot-electron spin injection and spin detection avoids impedance mismatch issues and prevents interference from parasitic effects. The clean collector current shows independent magnetic and electrical control of spin precession, and thus confirms spin coherent drift in the conduction band of silicon."

In response to insulin and nutrients, mTORC1, consisting of mTOR, raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR), and mLST8, is activated and phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP) and p70 S6 kinase to promote protein synthesis and cell size. Previously we found that activation of mTOR kinase in response to insulin was associated with increased 4EBP1 binding to raptor. Here we identify prolinerich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) as a binding partner for mTORC1. A putative TOR signaling motif, FVMDE, is identified in PRAS40 and shown to be required for interaction with raptor. Insulin stimulation markedly decreases the level of PRAS40 bound by mTORC1. Recombinant PRAS40 inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity in vivo and in vitro, and this inhibition depends on PRAS40 association with raptor. Furthermore, decreasing PRAS40 expression by short hairpin RNA enhances 4E-BP1 binding to raptor, and recombinant PRAS40 competes with 4E-BP1 binding to raptor. We, therefore, propose that PRAS40 regulates mTORC1 kinase activity by functioning as a direct inhibitor of substrate binding.

Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4612) Google Scholar). Extensive studies have been performed to understand the mechanisms whereby these inputs control mTOR activity. For example, regulation of the mTOR pathway by growth factors such as insulin appears to be mediated via the phosphatidylinositol-3′OH kinase-Akt pathway. The stimulation of 4EBP1 phosphorylation by insulin depends on activation of Akt, and Akt can directly phosphorylate mTOR (15Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 16Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T.

In addition Akt has been proposed to phosphorylate TSC2, a component of the tuberous sclerosis protein complex, TSC1/TSC2, and thereby affect its GTPaseactivating protein activity toward the GTP-binding protein Rheb, a activator of mTOR (18Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2363) Google Scholar). Regulation of mTORC1 by amino acids has been proposed to occur through hVPS34, a class III phosphatidylinositol-3′OH kinase, and by energy insufficiency through the AMP-activated protein kinase to tuberous sclerosis protein (19Nobukuni T. Joaquin M. Roccio M. Dann S.G. Kim S.Y. Gulati P. Byfield M.P. Backer J.M. Natt F. Bos J.L. Zwartkruis F.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2943) Google Scholar).However, the mechanism of mTOR activation remains controversial (21Dong J. Pan D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2479-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that insulin produced a stable increase of mTORC1 kinase activity, and this response was associated with a marked increase in substrate binding to raptor (14Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24293-24303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the present study we identify prolinerich Akt substrate (PRAS40, also known as AKT1S) as a novel partner of mTORC1. PRAS40 was previously isolated as a substrate of Akt whose phosphorylation resulted in its binding to 14-3-3 but whose function was unknown (22Kovacina K.S. Park G.Y. Bae S.S. Guzzetta A.W. Schaefer E. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10189-10194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have found in PRAS40 a putative TOS motif that mediates its binding to mTORC1 and shown that insulin stimulates a marked decrease of PRAS40 in mTORC1. Finally, we show that PRAS40 can block mTORC1 binding to its substrate and subsequent activity. We, therefore, propose that another mechanism whereby insulin and potentially other growth factors regulate the mTORC1 activity is via an induced release of PRAS40 from the mTORC1 substrate binding site.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Antibodies to mTOR (23Brunn G.J.

Fibroblasts were converted to adipocytes by using differentiation medium as described previously (26Lin T.A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) for 10-12 days after adding the differentiation medium. HEK293T, HEK293E, NIH-3T3, and CHO-IR cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. For experiments, the culture medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight and then incubated at 37 °C without or with insulin and/or other additions. To terminate the incubation, the cells were rinsed once with chilled phosphate-buffered saline (145 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and then homogenized (0.8 ml of buffer/10-cm-diameter dish) in a syringe with a 20-gauge needle. Homogenization buffer was composed of buffer A supplemented with 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 μm microcystin LR.

All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. 1 × 106 of HEK293T or HEK293E cells were seeded in a 6-cm dish, and 24 h later plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 1:1 ratio (w/v). The cells were harvested and analyzed at 36 h after transfection.Lentivirus-mediated shRNA Silencing—Oligonucleotides encoding the short-hairpin RNA expression cassette targeting mouse PRAS40 from base 753-773 (GI:124376717) were annealed and subcloned into pLKO.1 (#8453, Addgene).

To determine which proteins were specifically immunoprecipitated by virtue of their presence in mTORC1, mTOR or rictor levels were depressed by infecting the HEK293T cells with shRNA-expressing lentiviruses targeting the respective proteins. Raptor, mTOR, and mLST8 were detected in mTORC1 complexes in rictor knockdown cells, whereas mTOR and mLST8 recovery were substantially reduced in mTOR knockdown cells. A 40-kDa band appeared to be specifically precipitated in the mTORC1 complex by virtue of the fact that its presence was decreased in the mTOR knockdown cells in comparison to the rictor knockdown cells. Mass spectrometric analysis of the 40-kDa band revealed the identity of this protein as the proline-rich Akt substrate (PRAS40) (22Kovacina K.S. Park G.Y. Bae S.S. Guzzetta A.W. Schaefer E.

PRAS40 was co-immunoprecipitated with mTORC1 by antibodies to either mTOR or raptor (Fig. 1B). Intact mTORC2 containing mTOR, rictor, and mLST8 were recovered by immunoprecipitation of FLAG-rictor. mTORC2 complexes did not contain PRAS40. We next examined the interaction between PRAS40 and mTOR complexes by transfecting AU1-mTOR and HA-PRAS40 into HEK293T cells with either FLAG-raptor or FLAG-rictor. Antibodies specific for FLAG were used to isolate mTORC1 or mTORC2 immune complexes. PRAS40 was only immunoprecipitated with FLAG-raptor (Fig. 1C). Based on our analyses of both endogenous and recombinantly expressed proteins, we conclude that PRAS40 is associated with mTORC1 but not mTORC2.The Endogenous mTOR Complex Is Essential for PRAS40 Association, whereas Overexpressed Raptor Can Directly Interact with PRAS40—To further investigate the role of the individual components of mTORC1 in the interaction with PRAS40, we utilized lentiviral shRNA for mTOR, raptor, rictor, and mLST8 in HEK293T cells. Immunoblotting of total cell lysates demonstrated the effectiveness of the shRNA, with each of the targeted mTOR complex components exhibiting a decreased expression with their respective shRNA (Fig. 2A). In contrast, total endogenous PRAS40 levels were not decreased with any of these lentiviral shRNAs (Fig. 2A). However, either mTOR or raptor knockdown resulted in a substantial decrease of PRAS40 co-immunoprecipitation in mTORC1 isolated by either mTOR or raptor antibodies (Fig. 2A). In contrast, decreasing protein levels of either rictor or mLST8 were without effect on the amount of PRAS40 present in mTORC1. Because the total levels of mTOR remain largely unaffected by shRNA for raptor and the total levels of raptor remain largely unaffected by shRNA for mTOR, the decrease in PRAS40 in the precipitates of these two proteins indicates that the presence of either endogenous mTOR or raptor alone is insufficient to form a stable complex with endogenous PRAS40. Consistent with this model, the overexpression of mTOR alone was not sufficient to cause expressed PRAS40 to co-immunoprecipitate with this protein (Fig. 2B). However, when raptor was co-expressed with mTOR there was an association detected between mTOR and expressed PRAS40. Thus, raptor is likely necessary for mTORC1 association with PRAS40.FIGURE 2Both mTOR and raptor are required for association of endogenous mTORC1 with PRAS40, whereas overexpressed raptor directly associates with PRAS40. A, the interaction of endogenous mTORC1 and PRAS40 requires both mTOR and raptor. HEK293T cells were infected with shRNA lentiviruses targeting mTOR, raptor, rictor, mLST8, and scrambled shRNA. Endogenous mTOR complexes were immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibodies (Ab) to mTOR or raptor, and immunoblots were prepared to identify the levels of the complex components in cell lysates and co-immunoprecipitated proteins. B, overexpression of raptor is required for interaction between mTOR and PRAS40. FLAG-mTOR was co-transfected into HEK293T cells with HA-PRAS40 and either MYC-raptor, FLAG-rictor, or MYC-mLST8 as indicated. Immunoprecipitations using FLAG antibodies were conducted, and immunoblots were prepared to detect different epitope tags. C, PRAS40 interacts with overexpressed proteins of raptor but not mTOR in the presence of detergent Triton-X 100 (TX). HA-PRAS40 was co-expressed with FLAG-mTOR, Myc-raptor, FLAG-raptor, and AU1-mTOR in HEK293T cells. Extracts were prepared with 0.2% of either Tween 20 (TW) or Triton-X 100 as indicated and incubated with FLAG antibodies for immunoprecipitations. D, PRAS40 interacted with raptor multimeric complexes in the presence of Triton X-100. HA-PRAS40 with or without FLAG-raptor was transfected into HEK293T cells. Cell extracts prepared with 0.2% of Tween 20 or Triton X-100 were size-fractionated using a Superose 6 column with the same detergents as in the extracts. Each fraction was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with raptor antibody-coupled beads, and the precipitates were analyzed for mTOR, raptor, and HA-PRAS40 by immunoblotting. Elution of volumes and molecular weight standards are indicated at the top of the panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the component of mTORC1 associated with PRAS40, extracts prepared with 0.2% of Tween 20, CHAPS, Nonidet P-40, and Triton X-100 were used for the immunoprecipitations of mTOR and raptor. Consistent with previous findings (4Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K.

Endogenous PRAS40 was detected in mTOR or raptor immunoprecipitates when Tween 20 or CHAPS was present. However, endogenous PRAS40 was not detectable in mTOR or raptor immunoprecipitates when Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100 was present (supplemental Fig. S1A). Interestingly, when cells overexpressing mTOR and raptor were lysed in the presence of Triton X-100, expressed PRAS40 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-raptor but not FLAG-mTOR (Fig. 2C). In addition, purified recombinant PRAS40 coupled to glutathione beads retained only raptor when Triton X-100 was present, whereas both mTOR and raptor were retained on such beads when Tween 20 was utilized (supplemental Fig. S1B). The interaction between expressed PRAS40 and expressed raptor in the presence of Triton X-100 demonstrates that PRAS40 can associate with raptor independent of mTOR under certain conditions. To better understand the nature of the interaction between raptor and PRAS40, Tween 20 or Triton X-100 extracts prepared from cells with or without raptor overexpression were size-fractionated on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column. Raptor was immunoprecipitated from the various fractions and analyzed for mTOR, raptor, and PRAS40. As previously reported, mTORC1 exists as a large multimeric complex in cells (14Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24293-24303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Multimeric complexes of expressed raptor without associated mTOR were also detected since co-expression of two differently tagged raptor plasmids resulted in co-precipitation of both tagged molecules with antibodies to a single tag even in the presence of Triton X-100 (supplemental Fig. S1C). In the presence of Tween 20 and in cells expressing only endogenous mTORC1, most of the PRAS40 immunoprecipitated with raptor was present in a complex that contained mTOR (Fig. 2D). Overexpression of FLAG-raptor in HEK293T cells resulted in the formation of multimeric raptor complexes without associated mTOR but containing PRAS40. In the presence of Triton X-100, PRAS40 association with the raptor-raptor multimeric complex was stable, whereas PRAS40 association with mTOR-raptor complex was dissociated (Fig. 2D). Thus, overexpressed raptor forms multimeric complexes that interact with PRAS40 in the presence of Triton X-100.Insulin Promotes a Marked Decrease of PRAS40 Association with mTORC1—To investigate the role of PRAS40 on the activation of mTORC1 by insulin, PRAS40-mTORC1 interaction was examined in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin promoted a rapid decrease of PRAS40 association with mTORC1, which was essentially complete within 5 min (Fig. 3A). Concurrently insulin promoted the phosphorylation of Thr-389 in S6K (Fig. 3A). Significant effects of insulin on reducing PRAS40 and mTORC1 interaction were observed at concentrations as low as 0.6 nm, which coincided with insulin effects on the phosphorylation of S6K (Fig. 3B). The insulin-induced decrease of PRAS40 and mTORC1 association could be partially blocked by addition of the crosslinker, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), to the cells after insulin treatment (Fig. 3B). To investigate which signaling pathway contributed to the insulin effect on PRAS40 association with mTORC1, adipocytes were incubated with inhibitors of several kinases. The insulin-induced decrease of PRAS40 and mTORC1 association was abolished by treating adipocytes with wortmannin at a concentration (100 nm) sufficient to block Akt activation but too low to inhibit mTOR directly (23Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Inhibiting activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase with U0126 did not attenuate the effect of insulin. Rapamycin reduced PRAS40 association with mTORC1 in the absence of insulin signaling, but the decreased association from mTORC1 stimulated by insulin was still observed (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Effects of insulin and rapamycin on association of mTORC1 and PRAS40. To examine association of mTORC1 and PRAS40, mTORC1 immune complexes were isolated using antibodies to raptor or mTOR. The relative levels of mTOR, raptor, and PRAS40 in immunoprecipitates (IP) as well as the PRAS40 and phospho-S6K1 (T389) in cell lysates were determined by immunoblotting.

https://openalex.org/W2030019472,"In the rich and long-standing literature on the flow-induced formation of oriented precursors to polymer crystallization, it is often asserted that the longest, most extended chains are the dominant molecular species in the ""shish"" of the ""shish-kebab"" formation. We performed a critical examination of this widely held view, using deuterium labeling to distinguish different chain lengths within an overall distribution. Small-angle neutron-scattering patterns of the differently labeled materials showed that long chains are not overrepresented in the shish relative to their concentration in the material as a whole. We observed that the longest chains play a catalytic role, recruiting other chains adjacent to them into formation of the shish."

We examined a diatom bloom within a cold-core cyclonic eddy off Hawaii. Eddy primary production, community biomass, and size composition were markedly enhanced but had little effect on the carbon export ratio. Instead, the system functioned as a selective silica pump. Strong trophic coupling and inefficient organic export may be general characteristics of community perturbation responses in the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean."

https://openalex.org/W2082050214,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling is controlled by a variety of regulators that target either signaling receptors or activated Smad complexes. Among the negative regulators, Smad7 antagonizes TGF-beta signaling mainly through targeting the signaling receptors, whereas SnoN and c-Ski repress signaling at the transcriptional level through inactivation of Smad complexes. We previously found that Arkadia is a positive regulator of TGF-beta signaling that induces ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Smad7 through its C-terminal RING domain. We report here that Arkadia induces degradation of SnoN and c-Ski in addition to Smad7. Arkadia interacts with SnoN and c-Ski in their free forms as well as in the forms bound to Smad proteins, and constitutively down-regulates levels of their expression. Arkadia thus appears to effectively enhance TGF-beta signaling through simultaneous down-regulation of two distinct types of negative regulators, Smad7 and SnoN/c-Ski, and may play an important role in determining the intensity of TGF-beta family signaling in target cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055347525,"In 2005, plumes were detected near the south polar region of Enceladus, a small icy satellite of Saturn. Observations of the south pole revealed large rifts in the crust, informally called 'tiger stripes', which exhibit higher temperatures than the surrounding terrain and are probably sources of the observed eruptions. Models of the ultimate interior source for the eruptions are under consideration. Other models of an expanding plume require eruptions from discrete sources, as well as less voluminous eruptions from a more extended source, to match the observations. No physical mechanism that matches the observations has been identified to control these eruptions. Here we report a mechanism in which temporal variations in tidal stress open and close the tiger-stripe rifts, governing the timing of eruptions. During each orbit, every portion of each tiger stripe rift spends about half the time in tension, which allows the rift to open, exposing volatiles, and allowing eruptions. In a complementary process, periodic shear stress along the rifts also generates heat along their lengths, which has the capacity to enhance eruptions. Plume activity is expected to vary periodically, affecting the injection of material into Saturn's E ring and its formation, evolution and structure. Moreover, the stresses controlling eruptions imply that Enceladus' icy shell behaves as a thin elastic layer, perhaps only a few tens of kilometres thick."
https://openalex.org/W2046603670,"We have shown previously that Akt exists in a signal complex with p38 MAPK, MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2), and heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) and MK2 phosphorylates Akt on Ser-473. Additionally, dissociation of Hsp27 from Akt, prior to Akt activation, induced polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) apoptosis. However, the role of Hsp27 in regulating Akt activation was not examined. This study tested the hypothesis that Hsp27 regulates Akt activation and promotes cell survival by scaffolding MK2 to the Akt signal complex. Here we show that loss of Akt/Hsp27 interaction by anti-Hsp27 antibody treatment resulted in loss of Akt/MK2 interaction, loss of Akt-Ser-473 phosphorylation, and induced PMN apoptosis. Transfection of myristoylated Akt (AktCA) in HK-11 cells induced Akt-Ser-473 phosphorylation, activation, and Hsp27-Ser-82 phosphorylation. Cotransfection of AktCA with Hsp27 short interfering RNA, but not scrambled short interfering RNA, silenced Hsp27 expression, without altering Akt expression in HK-11 cells.

Deletion mutagenesis studies identified acidic linker region (amino acids 117–128) on Akt as an Hsp27 binding region. Deletion of amino acids 117–128 on Akt resulted in loss of its interaction with Hsp27 and MK2 but not with Hsp90 as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown studies.

Inappropriate termination of PMN activation or failure to remove apoptotic PMNs results in inflammation. This apoptotic process has been suggested to represent an in vivo mechanism limiting oxidant-induced tissue injury caused by PMNs at the sites of inflammation. Although PMNs are constitutively committed to apoptosis from the time they enter circulation, the rate of apoptosis is not fixed. We reported that interleukin-8, granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor, LTB4, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) delay constitutive PMN apoptosis through the activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt (1Klein J.B.

MK2 has been shown to bind and phosphorylate Hsp27 (29Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and MK2 is PDK2 for Akt in human PMNs (3Rane M.J. Coxon P.Y. Powell D.W. Webster R. Klein J.B. Ping P. Pierce W.

Hence we hypothesized that Hsp27 regulates Akt activation and apoptosis by scaffolding MK2 to the Akt signal complex. Akt contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a catalytic kinase domain (residues 1–116 and 148–411 respectively) linked by a highly acidic linker region (residues 117–147). The C-terminal tail region lies between residues 412 and 480. Phosphoinositides are known to bind the PH domain of Akt and recruit it to the plasma membrane for full activation by PDK1 and PDK2 (28de Graauw M. Tijdens I. Cramer R. Corless S.

In the present study we show that amino acids 117–128 within the acidic linker region of Akt are required for interaction with Hsp27. An in-frame deletion mutant of Akt (AktΔ117–128), lacking the Hsp27 binding region, interacts with Hsp90 but not with Hsp27 and MK2. Disruption of Akt/Hsp27 interaction prevents MK2 association with Akt, resulting in loss of MK2-mediated Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation, activation, and induction of apoptosis. These studies demonstrate for the first time that Hsp27 regulates Akt activation and cellular apoptosis by scaffolding MK2 to the Akt signal complex.

Gel Filtration Chromatography—The system used for the size exclusion chromatography experiments consisted of a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-300 HR prepacked chromatography column connected to an AKTA purifier 10 liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences), equipped with a Frac-900 automated fraction collector, and controlled by the UNICORN version 4.00 software (Amersham Biosciences). Prior to chromatography, the column was equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100. For the chromatographic separation of the samples, control and fMLP (0.3 μm)-stimulated PMNs were harvested and resuspended in Akt lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μm p-nitrophenol phosphate, 20 mm NaF, 5 mm PMSF, 21 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Next, 3–5 ml of total cleared cell lysate was injected onto the column with a manual injection through a 50-ml capacity superloop system (Amersham Biosciences). Isocratic elution with 2.5 column volumes of the same buffer was performed. Both a constant flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and the absorbance profiles at A230nm and A280nm were monitored during the entire chromatographic procedure. Fractions of 1.0 ml were collected, and 100 μl of every fifth fraction was used for Western blot analysis. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) Electrophoresis—PMN lysates (25 μg) were subjected to IEF electrophoresis. Proteins were separated based on their isoelectric point. Precast IEF (NOVEX) gels (Invitrogen) were run according to manufacturer's instructions. Gels were fixed in 100 ml of 20% methanol solution for 20 min. Gel was rinsed in 1× SDS-running buffer for 20 min and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using semidry transfer apparatus (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 20 V. Nitrocellulose membranes were washed with Krebs+ buffer and then immunoblotted with anti-Hsp27 and anti-Ser(P)-82Hsp27 antisera. Two-dimensional PAGE—Protein lysates (50 μg) were diluted into urea/thiourea rehydration buffer (Genomic Solutions), and proteins were separated by two-dimensional PAGE. IPG strips, pH 3–10 (Invitrogen), were rehydrated overnight with protein samples. Proteins were separated on the basis of their isoelectric point by IEF using the ZOOM IPG Runner (Invitrogen) with a maximal voltage of 2000 V and 50 μA per gel. Following IEF, IPG strips were incubated twice in equilibration buffer I (6 m urea, 130 mm dithiothreitol, 30% glycerol, 45 mm Tris base, 1.6% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue; Genomic Solutions) and once in equilibration buffer II (6 m urea, 135 mm iodoacetamide, 30% glycerol, 45 mm Tris base, 1.6% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue; Genomic Solutions) for 10 min. Equilibrated IPG strips were applied to 4–12% BisTris gradient gels (Invitrogen), and proteins were separated in the second dimension based on their molecular size using NuPAGE MES/SDS buffer (Invitrogen) at 200 V for 40 min. Following electrophoresis, gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with anti-Hsp27 antibody. GST Pulldown Assay—PMNs (2 × 107) were untreated or treated with isotype control antibody or Hsp27 antibody for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Appropriate GST beads (10 μl) were added to the lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with shaking. The beads were washed three times with Krebs buffer, and 15 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer was added to each tube. The samples were boiled for 3 min and then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. GST Pulldown Assay with Recombinant Proteins—Appropriate GST beads (10 μl) were added to 50 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2) containing 50 ng of appropriate recombinant protein. The samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with shaking. The beads were washed three times with Krebs buffer, and 15 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer was added to each tube. The samples were boiled for 3 min and then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Recombinant GST-Akt-PH domain (1–149 amino acids) was first conjugated with glutathione-Sepharose beads by incubating the two at 4 °C for 1 h with shaking. These beads were then incubated with 50 ng of recombinant Hsp27 as described above.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml) (Invitrogen). Fresh growth medium was added to cells every 3–4 days until confluent. HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml) (Invitrogen). cDNA Transfections—HK-11 or HEK-293 cells were plated on 6-well trays a day prior to performing transfections, to achieve 60% confluence. On the day of transfection appropriate cells were washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. One μg of appropriate cDNA was transfected into these cells using GenePORTER reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Gene Therapy Systems). Twenty four hours after transfection cells were lysed in 100 μl of Akt lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μm p-nitrophenol phosphate, 20 mm NaF, 5 mm PMSF, 21 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and proteins concentrations were determined.

Here we focus on Mycobacterium smegmatis PimA, an essential enzyme responsible for the initial mannosylation of phosphatidylinositol. The structure of PimA in complex with GDP-mannose shows the two-domain organization and the catalytic machinery typical of GT-B glycosyltransferases. PimA is an amphitrophic enzyme that binds mono-disperse phosphatidylinositol, but its transferase activity is stimulated by high concentrations of non-substrate anionic surfactants, indicating that the early stages of PIM biosynthesis involve lipid-water interfacial catalysis. Based on structural, calorimetric, and mutagenesis studies, we propose a model wherein PimA attaches to the membrane through its N-terminal domain, and this association leads to enzyme activation. Our results reveal a novel mode of phosphatidylinositol recognition and provide a template for the development of potential antimycobacterial compounds.

On the other hand, the mannosyltransferases PimB and PimC that transfer the second and third mannose residues, respectively, were found to be nonessential genes, suggesting the existence of alternative downstream synthetic pathways (16Kremer L.

Both α-mannosyltransferases PimA and PimB use GDP-Man as a sugar donor and co-localize to a distinct subfraction of the plasma membrane, suggesting that the initial stages of apolar PIM synthesis take place on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. In contrast, downstream enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of polar PIMs, and LM/LAM use polyprenol-phosphate-Man as a lipid-linked sugar donor (17Morita Y.S. Sena C.B. Waller R.F. Kurokawa K.

Furthermore, these enzymes co-localize with the plasma membrane and cell wall markers, indicating that the later stages of biosynthesis likely occur in the periplasmic space and/or the cell wall (20Morita Y.S.

To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that govern the early stages of PIM biosynthesis, we report here molecular and structural studies of PimA. On the basis of these data, we propose a model of interfacial catalysis wherein association of the protein with anionic membrane lipids stimulates the mannosyl transfer reaction either by facilitating substrate diffusion to the catalytic site or by inducing an allosteric change in the enzyme structure. Protein Production and Crystallization—Recombinant PimA from Mycobacterium smegmatis was produced in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and crystallized as described (21Guerin M.E. Buschiazzo A. Kordulakova J. Jackson M. Alzari P.M. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The selenomethionine-labeled protein was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen) in M9 medium containing 0.2 g/liter selenomethionine and purified using the same procedure as described for the non-labeled protein. Crystals of PimA (10 mg/ml) in complex with GDP or GDP-Man (1 mm) were obtained by co-crystallization in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm Ca(Ac)2, 14% polyethylene glycol 8000. Rod-like crystals appeared after 2 days and grew to a maximum size of 0.5 × 0.06 × 0.06 mm. Structure Determination and Refinement—A three-wavelength MAD dataset (peak, inflection point, and high remote) was collected to 3.5 Å of resolution from a single crystal of selenomethionine-labeled protein in complex with GDP on the PXI beamline at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) (Villigen, Suisse). Single-wavelength datasets of the PimA-GDP and PimA-GDP-Man complexes were collected on beamlines ID14.1 and ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). All data were processed with programs MOSFLM, SCALA, and TRUNCATE from the CCP4 program suite (22P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Eight selenium sites could be identified using the program SHELXD (23Uson I. Sheldrick G.M. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The electron density map calculated with MAD phases allowed the tracing of most of the polypeptide chain except for a few protein loops that were subsequently modeled during refinement.

Final refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The mutants PimAT9A, PimAT126W, PimAR201A, PimAE274A, and PimAR77S/K78S/K80S/K81S were generated by the two-step PCR overlap method using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and pET-PimA as DNA template. The truncated form PimAΔ59-70 was obtained by the inverted-PCR method. The proteins were expressed in E. coli cells and purified as described for wild-type PimA (21Guerin M.E. Buschiazzo A. Kordulakova J. Jackson M. Alzari P.M. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Assays—PimA activity was measured as described (18Kordulakova J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Jackson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31335-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) with minor modifications; the reaction mixture contained 0.0625 μCi of GDP-[14C]Man (specific activity, 305 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), the membrane fraction of M. smegmatis mc2155 (0.5 mg of proteins) providing a natural source of PI, 50 μg of purified PimA or mutated versions of PimA, and 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, in a final volume 250 μl. Alternatively, mycobacterial membranes were replaced by 10 μg of PI (Sigma, bovine PI) and/or 10 μg of lyso-PI (Avanti Polar Lipids) or various amounts of 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids). The effect of 500 μm non-substrate surfactants was analyzed in the reaction containing 40 μm 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol. Reactions were incubated 2 h at 37 °C and stopped with 1.5 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, by volume). The samples were left rocking 30 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min, and the bottom organic phase was analyzed by TLC as described (18Kordulakova J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G.

Spectrophotometric assays of PimA activity employed pyruvatekinase/lactate dehydrogenase enzymes. The standard PimA reaction mixture contained 50 nmol of GDP-Man (Sigma), 20 μg (23.5 nmol) of soybean PI (Sigma, added in 2 μl of 5% CHAPS), 50 μg of PimA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, in the final volume of 100 μl. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and then immediately added to the spectrophotometric cuvette containing 240 nmol of MgCl2, 240 nmol of dithiothreitol, 168 nmol of phosphoenolpyruvate (Sigma), 48 nmol NADH (Applichem), pyruvatekinase/lactate dehydrogenase (5.9 units/8.4 units in 8.4 μl of stock solution, Sigma), and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, in a final volume of 200 μl. A decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm was followed during the first 60 s after the addition of the PimA reaction mixture. Inhibition of PimA by glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol (GPI, Calbiochem) was assayed in the above-described assay in which the reaction mixture was supplemented with 23.5 nmol of GPI. GPI was tested also as the substrate of PimA by replacing PI with the same amount of GPI (23.5 nmol) in the reaction mixture. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC was performed using a VP-ITC (MicroCal Inc.). The enzyme and the different ligands were diluted into the same batch of buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 5% Me2SO and were degassed under vacuum. Titrations were performed by injecting 25-30 consecutive aliquots (10 μl) of GDP, GDP-man, PI, or GPI solutions (150 μm—1.5 mm) into the ITC cell (1.4 ml) containing wild-type PimA or point mutants (10 μm) at 25 °C. ITC data were corrected for heats of dilution of substrates and product solutions. Binding stoichiometries, enthalpy values, and equilibrium dissociation constants were determined by fitting corrected data to a bimolecular interaction model using Origin7 software (MicroCal Inc.). Docking Calculations—The program ICM was used for GPI docking calculations. These calculations were performed using a stochastic global optimization procedure combined with a pseudo-Brownian positional/torsional steps and fast local gradient minimization. During the exploration of the conformational space of GPI and its relative position in the (rigid) binding pocket, 85 putative models were obtained and ranked according to the ICM score. The few highest scored models showed only small scale variations and were further optimized by biased Monte Carlo minimization using internal coordinate mechanics. The solution with the lowest calculated binding energy is shown in Fig. 4a. The Overall Structure of PimA—The crystal structures of PimA in complex with GDP and GDP-Man were determined using multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction methods at 2.4 and 2.6 Å of resolution, respectively (Table 1). The enzyme, which belongs to the ubiquitous GT-4 family of retaining glycosyltransferases (CAZy; carbohydrate-active enzyme data base), displays the typical GT-B-fold of glycosyltransferases (28Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), consisting of two Rossmann-fold domains with a deep fissure at the interface that includes the catalytic center (Fig. 2a). The N-terminal domain comprises residues Met-1—Gly-169 and Trp-349—Ser-373, whereas the C-terminal domain includes residues Val-170—Asp-348. The core of each domain is composed of seven parallel β-strands alternating with seven connecting α-helices. Two regions of the structure have poor or no electron density, indicating conformational flexibility; the connecting loop β3-α2 (residues 59-70) within the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal extension of the protein (residues 374-386) that is missing in other mycobacterial PimA homologs (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Sequence alignments of mycobacterial PimA. Comparison of Mycobacterium bovis (Mbov, Q7TY88), Mycobacterium leprae (Mlep, O07147), M. smegmatis (Msme, MSMEG2946), and M. tuberculosis (Mtub, O06204) PimA sequences is shown. Secondary structure elements of PimA are shown above the protein sequence. Invariant residues are shown in a gray background. Wavy lines indicate disordered regions in the crystal structure.

Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) revealed a significant structural similarity of PimA with several GT-B enzymes belonging to different GT families (28Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). The closest structural neighbor is the GT-20 trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (DALI Z-score of 28.3, r.m.s.d. of 3.2 Å and 16% sequence identity) followed by the GT-4 α-1,3 glucosyltransferase WaaG (score 27.1, r.m.s.d. 3.2 Å, 16% sequence identity), the GT-72 DNA α-glucosyltransferase (score 25.4, r.m.s.d. 4.3 Å, 14% sequence identity), and the GT-5 glycogen synthase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (score 24.7, r.m.s.d. 4.7 Å, 16% sequence identity). Significant structural matches are also found with enzymes from other GT families, such as GT-28 (PDB code 1F0K, score 21.7), GT-1 (PDB code 2CLX, score 19.3), GT-63 (PDB code 1C3J, score 18.8), and GT-35 (PDB code 2C4M, score 16.6), illustrating the overall conservation of the GT-B-fold. The structure of the C-terminal domain of PimA, containing the nucleotide binding pocket, is closely similar to those of two other GT-4 glycosyltransferases for which a crystal structure is known (30Martinez-Fleites C. Proctor M. Roberts S. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), with r.m.s.d. of 1.9-2.1 Å. More important structural differences are observed for the N-terminal domain, which is usually involved in interactions with the acceptor substrate. Among the structures deposited with the PDB, the two closest structural neighbors of the PimA N-terminal domain are those of the glycosyltransferase MurG (r.m.s.d. 2.6 Å) and the E. coli UDP-N-acetylglucosamine epimerase (r.m.s.d. 2.7 Å). The electrostatic surface potential of PimA (Fig. 2b) reveals a polar protein with a positively charged N-terminal domain (theoretical pI 8.1) and a negatively charged C-terminal domain (theoretical pI 4.3). At the tip of the N-terminal domain, a cluster of basic residues (His-76, Arg-77, Lys-78, Lys-80, and Lys-81) lies on the solvent-exposed face of α-helix 2. This cluster is close to a hydrophobic surface patch and to a structurally flexible loop (residues 59-70) that is strictly conserved in mycobacterial homologs (Fig. 3), suggesting the possible involvement of this region in membrane interactions. Close to the active site cleft, the N-terminal domain displays a deep pocket or tunnel (Fig. 2b) that is primarily defined by conserved hydrophobic residues from strand β5 and helix α4. This tunnel might play some role in binding the fatty acid moieties of the acceptor substrate. The Substrate Binding Site—The sugar-donor substrate GDP-Man is clearly visible in the electron density map (Fig. 2c). The guanidyl heterocycle binds to a deep pocket defined by the connecting loop β1-α1 from the N-terminal domain (residues Val-13—Gly-16), the ends of strands β8 and β9, and the connecting loop β10-α9 from the C-terminal domain. Several protein-ligand hydrogen-bonding interactions stabilize the donor substrate into the binding pocket (Fig. 2d). In particular, the strong hydrogen bonding interactions of the guanidyl N2 nitrogen with the main-chain carbonyl group of Val-251 and the carboxylate group of Asp-253 may account for the nucleotide-sugar specificity of this family of enzymes (31Hill D.L. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 895-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ribose oxygens O2 and O3 interact with the carboxylate group of Glu-282, a conserved residue in the GT-B-fold superfamily (32Wrabl J.O. Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The distal phosphate oxygens interact with basic residues Arg-196 and Lys-202 and with the main-chain amide group of Gly-16 from the β1-α1 loop. This loop is known to undergo significant conformational changes upon sugar-nucleotide binding in other GT-B glycosyltransferases (33Buschiazzo A. Ugalde J.E. Guerin M.E. Shepard W. Ugalde R.A. Alzari P.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 34Hu Y. Chen L. Ha S. Gross B. Falcone B. Walker D. Mokhtarzadeh M. Walker S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The mannosyl moiety is also stabilized within the active site cleft through several hydrogen-bonding contacts of the sugar ring oxygens with main-chain protein atoms and the carboxylate group of Glu274 (Fig. 2d). Although we were unable to co-crystallize PimA in complex with PI or their analogs, the three-dimensional structure provides clear insights into the position of the polar head of the acceptor substrate within the active site. Docking calculations put the inositol moiety of PI making stacking interactions with the phenol ring of Tyr-9, with its O2 atom favorably positioned to receive the mannosyl residue from GDP-Man (Fig. 4a). The model predicts an important role of Arg-201 in substrate binding, since its guanidinium group is well located to interact with the PI phosphate oxygens and/or the glycerol carbonyl groups. It also suggests that the hydrophobic tunnel observed in the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2b) could be favorably positioned to accommodate, at least in part, the substrate acyl chains. These model predictions were assessed by site-directed mutagenesis. The functional role of Tyr-9 and Arg-201 in substrate binding was confirmed, since their substitution by alanine resulted in complete enzyme inactivation (Fig. 4b, lanes 3 and 5). In contrast, a point mutant in which Thr-126 was replaced by a bulkier tryptophan side chain (designed to sterically block the hydrophobic tunnel near its entry point) retained the ability to produce PIM1 (Fig. 4b, lane 4). Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of this mutant using PI as substrate was similar to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 4c). Two conserved amino acid residues thought to be important for catalysis in homologous GT-B glycosyltransferases are Glu-274 and His-118. The glutamate is part of a signature motif of the GPGTF (glycogen phosphorylase GT) superfamily (32Wrabl J.O. Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and makes hydrogen-bonding interactions with the OH-4 from the mannosyl moiety (Fig. 2d). His-118 is another largely conserved residue in the superfamily. Its main-chain carbonyl is located close to the C1 sugar position and is involved in catalysis (35Mitchell E.P. Withers S.G. Emmert P. Vasella A.T. Garman E.F. Oikonomakaos N.G. Johnson L.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7341-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As seen in other GT-B enzymes, these two residues also fulfill a critical role in PimA catalysis because their substitution by alanine completely abolished the catalytic activity (data not shown). The initial mannosylation of PI in mycobacteria is known to occur at the axial O2 oxygen of the inositol ring (31Hill D.L. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 895-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Takayama K. Goldman D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 176: 196-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The enzyme-substrate model described above accounts for this regio-specificity because steric clashes of the substituent ring oxygens would preclude stacking interactions of Tyr-9 with the opposite face of inositol. Furthermore, it suggests that the glycosyltransferases involved in the subsequent mannosylation of PIM (Fig. 1) should display a different architecture of their substrate binding cleft to mannosylate the equatorial ring oxygens of the α(1,2)-mannosyl-myo-inositol moiety. This seems to be the case for PimB, which catalyzes the transfer of the second mannosyl residue at position 6 of the inositol ring of PIM1 (15Schaeffer M.L. Khoo K.H. Besra G.S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. Belisle J.T. Inamine J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31625-31631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although PimA and PimB belong to the same GT4 family, they share less than 30% amino acid identity, and some of the key residues in PI binding are different between the two proteins. In particular PimB lacks Tyr-9 in the connecting loop β1-α1 as well as equivalent basic residues in the segment containing the RKG motif, just before α8, which includes Arg-201 in PimA. The above results suggest a plausible binding site for the polar head of the acceptor substrate. However, neither water-soluble glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol (GPI, the fully deacylated form of PI) nor lyso-PI (a PI analog containing only one acyl chain) served as a substrate for PimA, although the latter was a competitive inhibitor of the natural substrate (Fig. 4d). Binding studies using isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 5) are consistent with these observations. GDP-Man and GDP were seen to bind PimA in enthalpy-driven reactions with dissociation constants Kd of 0.23 μm (ΔH =-15.6 kcal·mol-1) and 0.03 μm (ΔH =-14.0 kcal·mol-1), respectively. On the other hand, the acceptor substrate PI interacted with the enzyme in entropy-driven reactions and showed stronger binding to the PimA-GDP complex (Kd = 0.31 μm, ΔH =+13.6 kcal·mol-1) than to ligand-free PimA (Kd = 2.27 μm, ΔH = -1.3 kcal·mol-1). However, no binding of GPI could be detected either to PimA (Kd > 100 μm) or to the PimA"

https://openalex.org/W2071444261,"DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) present a formidable obstacle to cellular processes because they are “superbulky” compared with the majority of chemical adducts. Elimination of DPCs is critical for cell survival because their persistence can lead to cell death or halt cell cycle progression by impeding DNA and RNA synthesis. To study DPC repair, we have used DNA methyltransferases to generate unique DPC adducts in oligodeoxyribonucleotides or plasmids to monitor both in vitro excision and in vivo repair. We show that HhaI DNA methyltransferase covalently bound to an oligodeoxyribonucleotide is not efficiently excised by using mammalian cell-free extracts, but protease digestion of the full-length HhaI DNA methyltransferase-DPC yields a substrate that is efficiently removed by a process similar to nucleotide excision repair (NER). To examine the repair of that unique DPC, we have developed two plasmid-based in vivo assays for DPC repair. One assay shows that in nontranscribed regions, DPC repair is greater than 60% in 6 h. The other assay based on host cell reactivation using a green fluorescent protein demonstrates that DPCs in transcribed genes are also repaired. Using Xpg-deficient cells (NER-defective) with the in vivo host cell reactivation assay and a unique DPC indicates that NER has a role in the repair of this adduct. We also demonstrate a role for the 26 S proteasome in DPC repair. These data are consistent with a model for repair in which the polypeptide chain of a DPC is first reduced by proteolysis prior to NER.

Some investigations suggest that DPCs kill cells based on the arrest of DNA and RNA synthesis at these “superbulky” adducts (8Erickson L.C. Ramonas L.M. Zaharko D.S. Kohn K.W.

Much research on DPCs has targeted their formation using proteomic techniques following exposure to chemical- or radiation-induced damage (20Costa M. Zhitkovich A. Harris M. Paustenbach D. Gargas M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 33826-33838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although the treatment of cells with chemicals or radiation induces damage that is not limited to DNA, the formation of specific DPCs is generally less than 1–3% of the total damage (25Barker S. Weinfeld M. Zheng J. Li L. Murray D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33826-33838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Barker S. Weinfeld M. Murray D. Mutat. Res. 2005; 589: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, the dilution of DPC effects in the milieu of other cellular damage creates a difficult system in which to elucidate answers concerning repair. An additional aspect of the difficulty in the study of DPCs formed by damaging agents is that there is not a unique adduct for this class of damage. DPCs can occur on a single DNA strand, on both strands, and/or with single or multiple attachment sites. Variations in attachment of the protein to DNA could mean that multiple repair mechanisms are employed to eradicate the damage. This further complication, although not impossible to overcome, adds to the predicament of examining DNA damage and repair when only a small amount of damage exists. One method to examine DPC repair without the presence of other DNA damage is by making unique DPCs. DNA glycosylases with associated lyase activity are trapped on DNA at an abasic site following chemical reduction of a Schiff base intermediate using sodium borohydride (27Gilboa R. Zharkov D.O.

Such substrates have afforded a first examination of in vitro DPC repair in bacterial systems. One example of this is the trapping of the T4 UV endonuclease DNA glycosylase (T4pdg) at an abasic site, covalently linking that 16-kDa protein to DNA. Using an incision assay, the Escherichia coli UvrABC excision nuclease cleaves the DPC at a 2-fold lower rate than that for benz[a]-pyrene adducts (36Minko I.G. Zou Y. Lloyd R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1905-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Another thermally stable bacterial nucleotide excision repair (NER) system also incises the T4pdg-DPC and some related polypeptides (37Minko I.G. Kurtz A.J. Croteau D.L. Van Houten B. Harris T.M. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3000-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This leads to the speculation that one pathway to repair DPCs in mammalian cells could be NER, and some initial in vitro work using that DPC supports that claim (38Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4056-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, DPCs are a significant obstacle to cellular defense mechanisms. The elimination of these superbulky adducts is a task that must be completed by cells to ensure the performance of normal biological functions, most notably replication and transcription. Although there is in vitro evidence for DPC removal by NER in bacterial systems, the role of mammalian NER in DPC repair remains a mystery. Resolution of formaldehyde-induced DPCs does not depend on xeroderma pigmentosum groups A and F, two NER components, in contrast to the other evidence (10Gantt R. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 75-87PubMed Google Scholar, 20Costa M. Zhitkovich A. Harris M. Paustenbach D. Gargas M. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1997; 50: 433-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 39Quievryn G. Zhitkovich A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1573-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Speit G. Schutz P. Merk O. Mutagenesis. 2000; 15: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, mammalian cellular repair pathways must be carefully evaluated for the capacity to eliminate DPCs. The use of specific damage substrates is a method that can clarify some of the discrepancies in this field. To simplify the interpretation of data, we focused on the repair of a single well defined DNA methyltransferase-DPC that is formed under mild conditions and has relevance for understanding in vivo repair of such adducts. Many human DNMTs are inhibited by azacytosine, zebularine, and fluorodeoxycytosine (FdC) (19Gowher H. Jeltsch A. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although azacytosine may directly inhibit human DNMTs (41Ghoshal K. Datta J. Majumder S. Bai S. Kutay H. Motiwala T. Jacob S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4727-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), the enzymatic inhibition by FdC requires incorporation of the modified base into the DNA followed by formation of a covalent DNA-protein cross-link (42Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 43Kumar S. Cheng X. Pflugrath J.W. Roberts R.J.

A. 1992; 89: 4744-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The inhibition of DNMT activity is believed to sequester DNMTs in cells by the formation of a DPC. If left unrepaired, the DPC can result in cell death by obstructing DNA or RNA synthesis; therefore, it must be eliminated. To mimic these DPCs, we have used the bacterial HDnmt-DPC whose structure is known (47Cheng X. Kumar S. Klimasauskas S. Roberts R.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 48Cheng X. Kumar S. Posfai J. Pflugrath J.W. Roberts R.J.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11018-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although the GCGC recognition sequence is different from that of mammalian DNMTs, HDnmt methylates the 5-position of cytosine in the central CpG sequence, and the DPC link is formed between the 6-position of cytosine linked to Cys-81, identical to the mechanism of mammalian DNMTs (Fig. 1a). The mild reaction conditions allow the study of DPC repair without introducing collateral damage to other moieties on either DNA or protein components. The construction of such a well defined substrate should facilitate the study of DPC repair pathways. We have exploited this defined substrate to explore the elimination of DPCs using both in vitro and in vivo experiments.

XPG Purification—XPG cDNA was amplified using forward (5′-TGCTCTAGAATGGGGGTCCAGGGGCTC-3′) and reverse (5′-CGGGGTACCTTAGGTTTTCCTTTTTCTTCC-3′) primers using PCR and cloned into pFastBac HT B (Invitrogen). Positive clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant virus was transformed into E. coli DH10Bac. Recombinant clones of 6030 bp were obtained and verified by PCR. Recombinant virus was obtained by transfecting Sf9 cells and generating subsequent concentrated viral stocks. 500 ml of Sf9 culture was infected using the baculovirus harboring the XPG cDNA, and incubation was continued for 5 days post-infection. The protein was partially purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. XPG Endonuclease Assay—The assay was performed similar to a described method (61Hohl M. Thorel F. Clarkson S.G. Scharer O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19500-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 91-nt ODN (5′-CCAGTGATCACATACGCTTTGCTATTCCGGTGATGTCAAGCAGTCCTAACTGGAAATCTAGCCGTGCCACGTTGTATGCCCACGTTGACCG-3′) was 5′-end-labeled and annealed with a second unlabeled ODN (5′-CGGTCAACGTGGGCATACAACGTGGCACGGTAATCTAAAGAAGCCGACGGTAGTCAACGTGCCGGAATAGCAAAGCGTATGTGATCACTGG-3′) to form a 30-nt bubble structure. The assay was performed using 2.5 nm of 5′-32P-end-labeled DNA substrate incubated with 1.25–5 nm XPG in nuclease buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 mm KCl) in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 in a reaction volume of 20 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer (90% (w/v) formamide, 0.5× TBE, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol FF) and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The samples were loaded onto a 15% (cross-linking ratio 19:1) denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TBE and 7 m urea and electrophoresed for 1–2 h at 2000 V. Cell Culture—Telomerase-immortalized human skin fibroblasts (HTERTG) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum in 5% carbon dioxide at 37 °C (62Bates S.E. Zhou N.Y. Federico L.E. Xia L. O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 or uv135 (Xpg-deficient) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (80%) and bronchial epithelial growth medium (10%) (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) with 10% fetal calf serum in 5% carbon dioxide at 37 °C. Preparation of Substrates for in Vitro NER and DPC Repair—The ODNs (50 pmol), 12 nts with unique damage sites, were 5′-phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP (75 pmol, 6000 Ci/pmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (20 U) in a total volume of 25 μl of buffer as recommended by the manufacturer for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation at 77 °C for 5 min to inactivate the enzyme. In a single reaction, the ODNs needed for ligation (100 pmol each, excluding the two 5′-end ODNs; see Fig. 1b) were 5′-phosphorylated with 10 mm ATP, T4 polynucleotide kinase (25 U) with reaction conditions identical to those of the damage-containing ODNs (PP (6-4) and 8-oxoG). Phosphorylated ODNs were combined with the 32P-labeled ODN, and the two 5′-phosphorylated ODNs, ethanol-precipitated using 25 μg of glycogen as a carrier, were washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 7.5 μl of 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (Buffer 1). ODNs were annealed by heating at 77 °C for 5 min and were allowed to gradually cool to 25 °C over 3 h after which they were held on ice for at least 10 min. Ligation of the ODNs was performed using T4 DNA ligase (2.5 Weiss units), 3.5 μl of 5 × ligation buffer in a 25-μl final volume. The ligation reactions were incubated at room temperature for 45 min followed by 16 °C overnight. The ligated ODNs were loaded onto a 6% denaturing sequencing PAGE. Full-length ODNs were isolated and electroeluted using a commercial apparatus (Bio-Rad Electroeluter model 422). The full-length ODNs were ethanol-precipitated using glycogen carrier, dried, and resuspended in Buffer 1. The ODNs were reannealed using the same protocol prior to ligation. The duplex ODNs were then purified using 5% native PAGE, electroeluted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 21 μl of Buffer 1. Formation of HDnmt-DPC Substrates—A covalent DPC substrate was formed between the duplex FdC ODN and the HDnmt in the presence of AdoMet. The reaction was performed in a buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 μg/ml poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT), 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 80 μm AdoMet, 200 fmol of duplex ODN substrate, 50 U of HhaI methyltransferase (∼100 U/μg) in 25 μl) at 37 °C for 2 h. All substrate concentrations for whole cell extract assays were determined by calculation from the disintegrations/min and the radioactive half-life. Protease Treatment of DPCs—The HDnmt covalently attached to DNA in the DPC substrate described above was reduced in size using either chymotrypsin or proteinase K. The HDnmt-DPC substrate (7 μl, 63 fmol) was incubated with 3.5 μl of chymotrypsin (1.25 μg/μl, freshly suspended in 1 mm HCl) and buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 10 mm CaCl2) and was allowed to proceed at 25 °C overnight. A 1-μl aliquot was analyzed using 4–15% SDS-PAGE. The remainder was ethanol-precipitated with glycogen, dried, and resuspended in Buffer 1. For the proteinase K treatment, the DPC substrate (7 μl, 63 fmol) was incubated with proteinase K (1 μl, 20 μg/μl) at 37 °C for 20 min. Following the reaction, the volume was adjusted to 15 μl using 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, anda1-μl aliquot analyzed as for the chymotrypsin-treated substrate. T7 RNA Polymerase Assay for DPCs—A duplex ODN substrate (2.0 pmol) with a unique FdC was cross-linked to HDnmt using the method described above. An aliquot (0.5pmol) was subjected to proteinase K treatment at 37 °C for 30 min followed by incubation at 65 °C for 25 min to inactivate the protease. The sample was ethanol-precipitated, dried, and resuspended in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. The transcription reactions were conducted as recommended by the manufacturer in buffer with 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 U of RNasin, 0.5 mm NTPs, 20 U of T7 RNA polymerase, 0.5 mol of duplex HDnmt-DPC or HDnmt-DPC proteinase K-treated substrate in a total volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for 4 h. At the end of the reaction, 25-μl aliquots were mixed with an equal volume of formamide loading dye and analyzed on an 8% denaturing gel. The products in the gel were stained using 20 μl of SybrGreen II in 200 ml of electrophoresis running buffer for 20–30 min in the dark, and the fluorescence was imaged using UV transillumination and a digital video camera. Excision Assay Using CHO-K1 Extracts—The excision reactions, 25-μl total volume, were conducted in 18 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 24 mm KCl, 1.92 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 35 ng of pBR322, 20–80-fmol duplex ODN substrate, 50 μg of CFE. Reactions were preincubated at 30 °C for 10 min and incubated for an additional 45 min after the addition of the duplex ODN substrate. At the end of the reaction, the mixtures were treated with 20 μg of proteinase K for 15 min at 37 °C and extracted once with phenol and then phenol/chloroform to reduce the size of any polypeptide still bound to DNA fragments. The reaction products were ethanol-precipitated with 20 μg of glycogen and analyzed using 10% DNA sequencing PAGE. Gels were enclosed in plastic wrap, exposed to a phosphor storage screen, and scanned using a Typhoon 9410 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). pUC19DB10 Plasmid Construct—A modified pUC19 plasmid, pUC19EN3 (2332 bp), was obtained from Weiguo Cao (Clemson University) containing a single N.BstNBI site. A second N.BstNBI site and an HhaI site (5′-GCGC-3′) were added upstream of the original N.BstNBI site. Complementary oligomers (i), 5′-AATTCGAGTCATCGATTAGCGCTG-3′ and (ii) 5′-GATCCAGCGCTAATCGATGACTCG-3′ were ligated into the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites in the polylinker region, selected for ampicillin resistance, and sequenced following growth of small scale cultures. This plasmid was designated pUC19DB10. pTGFPHha10 Plasmid Construct—The pTurboGFPN plasmid (EvroGen, San Diego) was used to generate a plasmid with a green fluorescent protein-coding sequence that has a sequence with two N.BstNB I sites located on the transcribed strand downstream from the cytomegalovirus promoter. An ODN with the sequence 5′-AGATCTCGAGCTCAAGCTTTGCGCAAGCGACTCCGAATTC-3′ was inserted into the BglII and EcoRI site of the pTurboGFPN plasmid to generate a second N.BstNB I site within 30 nt on the transcribed strand of the pTurboGFPN plasmid (the N.BstNB I site is on the transcribed strand as indicated by the underlined sequence). To prepare the pTGFPN plasmid for the introduction of a unique damage site, 6 of the 7 N.BstNB I sites were eliminated using the Stratagene QuikChange kit for site-directed mutagenesis. In coding regions, the sites were mutated without changing the amino acid sequence in the proteins. Preparation and Purification of pUC19DB10 or pTGF-PHha10 Plasmid DNA with a Unique FdC Site—The preparation of a unique damage site was essentially as described by Wang and Hays (63Wang H. Hays J.B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but certain modifications were required to ensure that the cross-linked base was tritium-labeled. pUC19DB10 (467 μg) was nicked to completion with N.BstNBI nicking endonuclease (375 U) to produce a 30-nt single-stranded ODN using 1× NEBuffer 3 in a final volume of 1.5 ml and incubating at 55 °C for 2 h. An aliquot analyzed on a 1% agarose gel confirmed that all the plasmid was converted from supercoiled to nicked form, indicating that all molecules had been nicked at least once. An additional 375 U of N.BstNBI were added, along with buffer, and the react"

We present evidence from interferometric synthetic aperture radar data for secular inflation of a dike-like magma body at intermediate depth in the southwest rift zone during 2002 to 2005. Magma accumulation occurred in a section of the rift zone that was unclamped by previous dikes and earthquakes, suggesting that stress transfer plays an important role in controlling subsurface magma accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2016690079,"We recently found that deletion of the gulonolactone oxidase gene, which is involved in the synthesis of ascorbic acid (AA), was responsible for the fracture phenotype in spontaneous fracture mice. To explore the molecular mechanisms by which AA regulates osteoblast differentiation, we examined the effect of AA on osterix expression via Nrf1 (NF-E2-related factor-1) binding to antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) in bone marrow stromal (BMS) cells. AA treatment caused a 6-fold increase in osterix expression in mutant BMS cells at 24 h, which was unaffected by pretreatment with protein synthesis inhibitor. Sequence analyses of mouse osterix promoter revealed a putative ARE located at -1762 to -1733 upstream of the transcription start site to which Nrf potentially binds. A gel mobility shift assay revealed that nuclear proteins from AA-treated BMS cells bound to radiolabeled ARE much more strongly than nuclear extracts from AA-untreated cells. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with Nrf1 antibody confirmed the interaction of Nrf1 with the mouse osterix promoter. A reporter assay demonstrated that the promoter activity of mouse osterix containing an ARE was stimulated 4-fold by a 48-h treatment with AA in spontaneous fracture BMS cells. Treatment of mutant BMS cells with AA resulted in a 3.9-fold increase in the nuclear accumulation of Nrf1. Transfection of mutant BMS cells with Nrf1 small interfering RNA decreased Nrf1 protein by 4.5-fold, blocked AA induction of osterix expression, and impaired BMS cell differentiation. Our data provided the first experimental evidence that AA modulated osterix expression via a novel mechanism involving Nrf1 nuclear translocation and Nrf1 binding to ARE to activate genes critical for cell differentiation.

Osteoporosis, affecting both women and men, is a common disease characterized by a loss of bone mass and strength and a microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue with a consequent increase in the risk of developing fragility fractures with even minor trauma (1Raisz L.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). In order to identify candidate genes that may be important in the development of osteoporotic fractures, we previously studied a mutant mouse that develops spontaneous fracture (sfx) 2The abbreviations used are: sfx, spontaneous fracture; AA, ascorbic acid; BMS, bone marrow stromal; siRNA, small interfering RNA; βGP, β-glycerophosphate; AA-2P, ascorbic acid 2-phosphate; RT, reverse transcription; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; mOsx, mouse Osx; ALP, alkaline phosphatase.2The abbreviations used are: sfx, spontaneous fracture; AA, ascorbic acid; BMS, bone marrow stromal; siRNA, small interfering RNA; βGP, β-glycerophosphate; AA-2P, ascorbic acid 2-phosphate; RT, reverse transcription; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; mOsx, mouse Osx; ALP, alkaline phosphatase. at the very early age of 5-7 weeks (2Mohan S.

We and others found that deletion of the gulonolactone oxidase gene, which is involved in the synthesis of ascorbic acid (AA), was responsible for AA deficiency and impairment of differentiated functions of osteoblast, bone fracture, and premature death in sfx mice (2Mohan S. Kapoor A. Singgih A. Zhang Z. Taylor T. Yu H. Chadwick R.B. Chung Y.S. Donahue L.R. Rosen C. Crawford G.C. Wergedal J. Baylink D.J. J. Bone Miner.

Genome. 2005; 16: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Treatment of sfx mice with AA in drinking water completely rescued the bone phenotypes in vivo and prevented them from premature death (2Mohan S. Kapoor A. Singgih A. Zhang Z. Taylor T. Yu H. Chadwick R.B. Chung Y.S. Donahue L.R. Rosen C. Crawford G.C. Wergedal J. Baylink D.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1597-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consistent with our findings, a point mutation from G to A at nucleotide 182 in the l-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase gene in rats, which alters an amino acid residue from cysteine to tyrosine, has also been reported to reduce AA synthesis and impair bone formation (5Kawai T. Nishikimi M. Ozawa T. Yagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21973-21976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several epidemiological studies have shown that a lower level of blood AA, also known as vitamin C, may substantially increase the risk of hip fracture in smokers and elderly patients, whereas supplementation of antioxidant vitamins greatly reduces the frequency of osteoporotic fractures (6Melhus H. Michaelsson K. Holmberg L. Wolk A. Ljunghall S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Maggio D. Barabani M. Pierandrei M. Polidori M.C. Catani M.

Corcoran C.D. Am J. Epidemiol. 2006; 163: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These genetic studies together with clinical observations have reinforced the critical role of antioxidant vitamins in maintaining bone health (2Mohan S. Kapoor A. Singgih A. Zhang Z. Taylor T. Yu H. Chadwick R.B. Chung Y.S. Donahue L.R. Rosen C. Crawford G.C. Wergedal J. Baylink D.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1597-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although it is well known that AA is required for osteoblast differentiation, the molecular mechanisms by which AA regulates bone formation and mineralization remain to be elucidated. AA, a key antioxidant vitamin, is a cofactor of prolylhydroxylase shown to be required for hydroxylation and secretion of procollagen to form stable triple-helical collagen both in the growing and in the mature connective tissue (9Peterkofsky B. Am J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 1135S-1140SCrossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Deficiency of AA is responsible for scurvy syndrome, which has characteristics of the defective synthesis of collagen (10Bentley J.P. Jackson D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 107: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that AA induces embryonic and mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts (11Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 12Wang Y. Singh A. Xu P. Pindrus M.A. Blasioli D.J. Kaplan D.L. Biomaterials. 2006; 27: 3265-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The potential mechanisms by which AA directs the multipotent progenitor cell commitments are believed to be mediated through collagen matrix synthesis, cell-matrix interaction, and activation of integrin signaling (11Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 13Green J. Schotland S. Stauber D.J. Kleeman C.R. Clemens T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1090-C1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of type I collagen and α2β1 integrin activates mitogen-activated protein kinase, which then phosphorylates and activates the osteoblast-specific transcription factor Cbfa1 to induce cell differentiation (14Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 15Xiao G. Gopalakrishnan R. Jiang D. Reith E. Benson M.D. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). However, recent in vitro studies have provided convincing evidence that AA also influences differentiation of other cell type lineages, such as neuronal cells, that produce little or no matrix (16Shin D.M. Ahn J.I. Lee K.H. Lee Y.S. Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 1959-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the gulonolactone oxidase knock-out mice have normal levels of proline hydroxylation and collagen production in the tail, mammary gland, and tumors, whereas these mice show widespread abnormalities in multiple organs besides the bone (2Mohan S. Kapoor A. Singgih A. Zhang Z. Taylor T. Yu H. Chadwick R.B. Chung Y.S. Donahue L.R. Rosen C. Crawford G.C. Wergedal J. Baylink D.J. J. Bone Miner.

Physiol. 2006; 290: E1131-E1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that AA can stimulate the expression of a number of osteogenic marker genes in the presence of collagen synthesis inhibitors and can induce chondrocyte hypertrophy independent of production of a collagen-rich matrix (18Sullivan T.A. Uschmann B. Hough R. Leboy P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22500-22506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies strongly suggest that additional mechanisms besides collagen-mediated signaling may be involved in mediating AA effects in a variety of the target cells. We previously carried out a microarray analysis and found that expression levels of a number of genes related to energy and drug metabolism were down-regulated in the bones of sfx mice compared with control mice (2Mohan S. Kapoor A. Singgih A. Zhang Z. Taylor T. Yu H. Chadwick R.B. Chung Y.S. Donahue L.R. Rosen C. Crawford G.C. Wergedal J. Baylink D.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1597-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many of these genes contain putative antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) in their proximal promoter regions to which Nrf (nuclear factor-E2-related factor) can potentially bind. In this study, we focused on AA regulation of transcription factors known to be critical for osteoblast differentiation (19Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar, 20Cheng S.L. Shao J.S. Charlton-Kachigian N. Loewy A.P. Towler D.A. J.

We found that AA induced acute osterix expression during bone marrow stromal (BMS) cell differentiation via stimulating interaction of Nrf1 with ARE in the promoter region. Our studies have provided the first experimental evidence for a novel mechanism by which antioxidant vitamins directly stimulate the expression of ARE-containing genes, leading to osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. The sfx mutant mice in a BALB/cBy genetic background were discovered and characterized as described previously (2Mohan S. Kapoor A. Singgih A. Zhang Z. Taylor T. Yu H. Chadwick R.B. Chung Y.S.

Pettis Memorial Veterans Affairs Medical Center Animal Research Facility (Loma Linda, CA) under standard approved laboratory conditions with controlled illumination (14 h light, 10 h dark) and temperature (22 °C) and unrestricted food and water. The animals were fed with either a Harlan Tekland S-2335 mouse breeder diet-7004 or with a Harlan Teklad 4% mouse/rat diet 7001 (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) (2Mohan S. Kapoor A. Singgih A. Zhang Z.

Both of the diets are free of AA. All of the animal procedures were performed with the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee of the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Affairs Medical Center. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) mixtures for Nrf1 and osterix were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The sense sequences of the Nrf1 siRNA mixture were 5′-CUCUGACUCUGGCAUUUCA, 5′-CGUGAAUCCCAAUGUGAAA, and 5′-CCUUGUAUCUUGAAGUCUU. The sense sequences of the osterix siRNA mixture were GGAAAGGAGGCACAAAGAATT, CCUUGCUCGUAGAUUUCUATT, and CUAGAAGCCACGAGAAAGATT. Fluorescein-labeled mock siRNA with a sense sequence of UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT was ordered from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Antibodies against Nrf1 and β-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Sigma, respectively. Antibody specific to mouse osterix was ordered from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Antibody against RNA polymerase II was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Culture—BMS cells were isolated from the femurs and the tibias of sfx mice (2Mohan S. Kapoor A. Singgih A. Zhang Z. Taylor T. Yu H. Chadwick R.B. Chung Y.S. Donahue L.R. Rosen C. Crawford G.C. Wergedal J. Baylink D.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1597-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/120-mm dish and 3 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate and grown to 80% confluence (normally 1 week) in AA-free α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cells were treated with mineralization media containing β-glycerophosphate (βGP) and ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AA-2P) (experimental) or βGP without AA-2P (control) for the indicated period of time. Real Time RT-PCR—The total RNA was extracted from BMS cells using Trizol (Invitrogen). An aliquot of RNA (500 ng) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA by oligo(dT)12-18 primer. Real time PCR contained 100 ng of template cDNA, 1× SYBR GREEN master mix (Qiagen), and 100 nm specific forward and reverse primers in a 25-μl volume of reaction. Primers for peptidyl prolyl isomerase A were used to normalize the expression data of test genes. Sequences of the primers were as follows: osterix, forward (5′-tggcgtcctctctgcttga) and reverse (5′-TCAGTGAGGGAAGGGTGGGT); Nrf1, forward (5′-TGAGCTGCTGTCCAAATACC) and reverse (5′-ACCTTCTGCTTCATCTGTCG); alkaline phosphatase (ALP), forward (5′-ATGGTAACGGGCCTGGCTACA) and reverse (5′-AGTTCTGCTCATGGACGCCGT); peptidyl prolyl isomerase A, forward (5′-CCATGGCAAATGCTGGACCA) and reverse (5′-TCCTGGACCCAAAACGCTCC). Transient Transfection—Nucleoporation was carried out as reported previously (21Xing W. Baylink D. Kapoor A. Mohan S. Mol. Biotechnol. 2006; 34: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Our transfection efficiency in BMS cells is more than 80%, as observed using fluorescein-labeled mock siRNA. Briefly, BMS cells isolated from sfx mutant mice were cultured in 120-mm dishes and grown to 80% confluence before they were removed by trypsin digestion for transfection. Undifferentiated BMS cells (1.5 × 106) were resuspended in 100 μl of fibroblast nucleofector buffer (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 5 μg of plasmid or 1.25 μg of siRNA. The cells were then transferred into a 2-mm gap width electroporation cuvette and electroporated at 135 V for 15 ms, using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). After electroporation, the cells were plated at high density (150,000 cells/cm2) in prewarmed, AA-free α-minimal essential medium growth medium in a 6-well plate and cultured in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 until further treatment. Nodule and ALP Activity Assays—The nodule assay was carried out as described previously (2Mohan S. Kapoor A. Singgih A. Zhang Z. Taylor T. Yu H. Chadwick R.B. Chung Y.S. Donahue L.R. Rosen C. Crawford G.C. Wergedal J. Baylink D.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1597-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). BMS cells transfected with siRNA were plated at a density of 150,000 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates and cultured in a mineralization media supplemented with 300 μg/ml AA-2P and 10 mm βGP. The medium was changed every 3 days. After 24 days, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in cold 70% ethanol, and stained with 40 mm alizarin red (pH 4.2). The mineralized area was measured with the OsteoMeasure system equipped with a digitizing tablet and a color video camera (Osteometrics Inc., Atlanta, GA). Two parallel plates were used for ALP staining and activity assay, respectively, 7 days after transfection (22Xing W. Baylink D. Kesavan C. Mohan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Amaar Y.G. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1430-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extracts—Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (24Xing W. Sairam M.R. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, BMS cells were lysed on ice for 5 min in buffer E (0.3% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× phosphatase inhibitor, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclei were pelleted by spinning for 5 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was saved as the cytoplasmic extract. Glycerol was added to cytoplasmic extracts to a final concentration of 20%. The pellet was washed in buffer E lacking Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 1× phosphatase inhibitor, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.4 m, and the nuclei were gently shaken for 20 min at 4 °C. Nuclear extract was obtained after a 10-min spin at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. Western Blot—An aliquot of 30 μg of protein was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was incubated at 4 °C overnight in a buffer containing 5% dry skim milk, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.05% Tween 20. Immunoblotting was performed in the same buffer containing 0.2 μg/ml anti-Nrf1 or anti-osterix at room temperature for 1 h. Nrf1 and osterix proteins were detected using appropriate secondary antibody and a Western blotting detection system. After exposure to chemiluminescence film, the same membrane was stripped, and reprobed with anti-β-actin. The intensity of signals was quantitated by ImageQuant (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled as described previously (25Xing W. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1310-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (4 μg) from BMS cells were incubated in a binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 20 fmol of labeled DNA probe. Excess unlabeled DNA competitors were added into the reaction 5 min before the addition of radiolabeled probe. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and analyzed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE buffer (50 mm Tris borate-EDTA, pH 8.0). Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed using commercial ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, 2 × 106 BMS cells derived from sfx mice were treated with 300 μg/ml AA-2P and 10 mm βGP for 24 h. The cells were then cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and lysed in SDS lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 10 min on ice. The lysate was sonicated and precleared with protein A agarose/salmon sperm DNA prior to immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of anti-Nrf1 or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Following wash and elution steps, cross-links were reversed at 65 °C for 4 h. The DNA in the immunoprecipitated samples was purified by proteinase K digestion followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. An aliquot of purified DNA was amplified by PCR with specific primers to the mouse osterix gene and analyzed on 4% agarose gel. Reporter Constructs and Luciferase Assay—An osterix promoter from -2965 to +80 relative to the transcription start site was generated by PCR from C57BL/6J mouse DNA and inserted into the KpnI and XhoI sites of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). DNA sequences of primers are listed below: forward, 5′-CATGGAGATCTGCCTGCTTC; reverse, 5′-GTCCCAAGGAGTCAGGCAGAT. A synthetic 3× ARE repeat from -1762 to -1733 of the mouse osterix promoter was inserted into pTAL-Luc vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The luciferase assay was carried out as described previously (25Xing W. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1310-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, BMS cells were transfected with 5 μg of reporter plasmid. After electroporation, the cell suspension was split into 24-well plates with 0.5 ml each and cultured in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 in a growth medium. After a 24-h incubation, the transfected cells were treated with 10 mm βGP alone or 300 μg/ml AA-2P and 10 mm βGP. The cells were cultured for another 48 h and then lysed in 120 μl of 10mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. An aliquot of 100 μl of cell extract was used for luciferase assay, and 5 μl of cell extract was taken for protein measurement. The light units from the luciferase constructs were normalized to protein concentration. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.D. and analyzed by Student's t test or analysis of variance as appropriate. One- and two-way analysis of variance tests were performed using STATISTICA software (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK). Expression of Osterix Is Differential Stage- and AA-dependent—In order to determine if the impairment in BMS cell differentiation observed in our previous studies in sfx mice is attributable to decreased expression of osteoblast-specific transcription factors, we examined the effect of AA-2P on the expression levels of the osterix gene. We cultured the BMS cells from both wild-type and mutant mice in a mineralization medium supplemented with βGP alone or βGP and AA and evaluated the expression levels of osterix by real time RT-PCR at days 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 (Fig. 1, A and B). We set day 0 as the basal expression level of undifferentiated BMS cells without AA-2P treatment. We found that osterix expression was not changed appreciably during the 24-day culture when BMS cells derived from sfx mice were exposed to a medium containing 10 mm βGP alone (-AA) (Fig. 1A). However, there was a steady increase in the expression of osterix during the BMS cell differentiation when BMS cells were treated with 10 mm βGP and 300 μg/ml AA-2P (+AA). A 12-fold and a 22-fold increase in osterix expression were seen at days 6 and 12, respectively, compared with undifferentiated BMS cells at day 0. The maximal induction of 40-fold in osterix mRNA levels was reached at day 18. By day 24, a 27-fold AA stimulation of osterix expression was detected in the mature osteoblast cells. A similar AA-dependent expression of osterix was also seen in BMS cells isolated from wild-type mice with an ∼20-fold increase at day 24 (Fig. 1B). The lower induction of osterix expression in wild type BMS cells compared with sfx BMS cells could be due to higher basal level of expression in wild-type BMS cells in the absence of AA at day 0 (4.7 ± 0.62-fold; p < 0.01). The stimulation of osterix expression by AA was further confirmed by Western blot with antibody specific to mouse osterix (Fig. 1C). We observed an ∼4-fold induction at protein level after a 72-h AA stimulation in the mutant BMS cells (Fig. 1D). To determine if the effect of AA on osterix mRNA levels is acute, we measured expression levels at 4 and 24 h after treatment of BMS cells derived from sfx mice with the combination of βGP and AA-2P or βGP alone (Fig. 2A). We found that the expression of osterix was increased by 2.2- and 6-fold at 4 and 24 h, respectively, after the AA and βGP treatment compared with βGP alone. In a separate experiment, we compared the effect of 300 μg/ml AA-2P versus AA on osterix expression and found that both AA-2P and AA increased osterix expression similarly at 24 h (6.12 ± 1.0 versus 6.72 ± 0.26; n = 3). To further examine whether the AA induction of osterix expression is direct and occurs in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, we pretreated BMS cells with cycloheximide at a concentration of 1 μm that inhibited >80% protein synthesis and then evaluated the effect of AA on the osterix expression after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 2B). We found that pretreatment of BMS cells with cycloheximide did not affect AA induction in osterix expression. Approximately 6-fold AA induction of osterix expression was observed in the presence of cycloheximide. To determine whether AA increased osterix by stabilization of mRNA, BMS cells were stimulated with βGP and AA-2P for 24 h and then treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin. Total RNA was harvested at subsequent time intervals of 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. The half-life of the osterix mRNA was then measured by real time RT-PCR. Our experiments found that AA treatment did not significantly affect osterix mRNA stability in BMS cells (Fig. 2C). The calculated half-lives of osterix mRNA were 3.5 and 3.7 h in the AA-untreated BMS cells and AA-treated cells, respectively (p > 0.05). AA Stimulates Transcription of Osterix via Nrf1 Binding to ARE—To examine if AA, like other antioxidants, regulates the transcription of osterix via a mechanism involving protein/DNA interaction in the regulatory region (26Sankaranarayanan K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50810-50817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Kwak M.K. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 135-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we carried out a computer-based analyses to search for ARE in the osterix promoter. We found that one putative ARE was present at -1762 to -1733 upstream of the transcription start site of the mouse osterix gene (Fig. 3). Similar putative AREs were also found in the promoters of the rat and human osterix genes as well as the human NADPH quinine oxidoreductase I, a gene known to be regulated by antioxidants via ARE (26Sankaranarayanan K. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50810-50817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 28Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jain A.K. Bloom D.A. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16891-16900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Like the known ARE, the putative AREs in the promoters of the osterix gene contain two directed or inverted AP-1-like repeats with 2-8-bp spacing, followed by a GC box, to which a number of transcription factors, including Nrf and small Maf, can bind. The core binding site of the putative ARE in mouse osterix promoter is completely matched to the ARE core sequence (29Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Pickett C.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). To determine which family member(s) of Nrf play an important role in mediating AA induction of osterix expression via ARE, we compared expression levels of Nrf1, Nrf2, and Nrf3 in BMS cells using real time RT-PCR. We found that the expression level of Nrf1 was 50-fold higher than that of Nrf2 and 500-fold higher than that of Nrf3 in BMS cells. The expression levels of other Nrf family members and their binding partners, such as Keap-1 and Maf, were not s"

https://openalex.org/W2102681875,"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a matricellular glycoprotein that has key roles in interactions between human cells and components of the extracellular matrix. Here we report a novel role for the lectin TSP1 in pathogen-host interactions. Binding assays and flow cytometric analysis demonstrate that Streptococcus pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens including S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes interact specifically with human TSP1. We also show for the first time that host cell-bound TSP1 promotes adherence of gram-positive pathogens to human epithelial and endothelial cell lines. Pretreatment of bacteria with sodium periodate but not Pronase E substantially reduced TSP1-mediated bacterial adherence to host cells, suggesting that a glycoconjugate on the bacterial cell surface functions as the receptor for TSP1. Lipoteichoic acids did not affect TSP1-mediated adherence of S. pneumoniae to host cells. In contrast, attachment of S. pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens to host cells via TSP1 was blocked by soluble peptidoglycan, indicating recognition of bacterial peptidoglycan by TSP1. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that recognition of gram-positive pathogens by TSP1 promotes bacterial colonization of host tissue cells. In this scenario, peptidoglycan functions as adhesin and TSP1 acts as a molecular bridge linking gram-positive bacteria with receptors on the host cell."
https://openalex.org/W1997576768,"DNA strand breaks arise continuously as the result of intracellular metabolism and in response to a multitude of genotoxic agents. To overcome such challenges to genomic stability, cells have evolved genome surveillance pathways that detect and repair damaged DNA in a coordinated fashion. Here we identify the previously uncharacterized human protein Xip1 (C2orf13) as a novel component of the checkpoint response to DNA strand breaks. Green fluorescent protein-tagged Xip1 was rapidly recruited to sites of DNA breaks, and this accumulation was dependent on a novel type of zinc finger motif located in the C terminus of Xip1. The initial recruitment kinetics of Xip1 closely paralleled that of XRCC1, a central organizer of single strand break (SSB) repair, and its accumulation was both delayed and sustained when the detection of SSBs was abrogated by inhibition of PARP-1. Xip1 and XRCC1 stably interacted through recognition of CK2 phosphorylation sites in XRCC1 by the Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain of Xip1, and XRCC1 was required to maintain steady-state levels of Xip1. Moreover, Xip1 was phosphorylated on Ser-116 by ataxia telangiectasia-mutated in response to ionizing radiation, further underscoring the potential importance of Xip1 in the DNA damage response. Finally, depletion of Xip1 significantly decreased the clonogenic survival of cells exposed to DNA SSB- or double strand break-inducing agents. Collectively, these findings implicate Xip1 as a new regulator of genome maintenance pathways, which may function to organize DNA strand break repair complexes at sites of DNA damage.

Collectively, these findings implicate Xip1 as a new regulator of genome maintenance pathways, which may function to organize DNA strand break repair complexes at sites of DNA damage. The DNA damage response is a complex and multifunctional network of pathways collectively acting to maintain genomic stability of all living organisms. This machinery is activated in response to a multitude of genotoxic insults, impacting on and coordinating a diverse range of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, DNA repair, DNA replication, and gene transcription (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). Several repair pathways exist to deal with the different types of DNA damage that can arise (2Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3164) Google Scholar). One of these is the DNA SSB 2The abbreviations used are: SSB, single strand break; DSB, double strand break; ZnF, zinc finger; IR, ionizing radiation; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM and Rad3-related; pol, polymerase; PNK, polynucleotide kinase; APTX, aprataxin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; WT, wild type; Gy, gray; FHA, forkhead associated. repair pathway, which deals with genuine DNA SSBs (the most frequent type of lesion in DNA) as well as the various base modifications that can be converted into SSBs by base excision repair enzymes. The initial sensor of SSBs appears to be poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), which is rapidly recruited to and activated by SSBs (3Ame J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 4Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). The activity of PARP-1, in turn, is thought to modify and locally relax chromatin, allowing efficient access of DNA repair enzymes to SSBs. A number of DNA end-processing enzymes can act on crude lesions to convert the DNA ends into a common intermediate in order for gap filling and religation to occur. These enzymes include PNK, APE1, DNA pol β (5Almeida K.H. Sobol R.W. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and the recently identified disease-associated enzymes TDP1 and aprataxin (APTX) (6Caldecott K.W. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The processed DNA ends are then rejoined by short-patch repair (for a single missing nucleotide) or long-patch repair (several nucleotides) (2Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3164) Google Scholar, 5Almeida K.H. Sobol R.W. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The protein XRCC1 is intimately involved in the repair of SSBs but is distinguishable from other SSB repair proteins by its lack of an enzymatic activity. Instead, it appears to act as a scaffold protein, interacting with (and in some cases activating) a range of SSB repair proteins (7Caldecott K.W. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 955-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In this way, XRCC1 may organize SSB repair enzymes into a larger holocomplex with multifunctional roles in the repair of SSBs and oxidative DNA lesions. XRCC1 contains two BRCA1 C-terminal domains and has been shown to interact with PARP-1, pol β, and DNA ligase 3 among others (5Almeida K.H. Sobol R.W. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 8Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Johnson P. Shall S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In addition, the linker region between the BRCA1 C-terminal domains in XRCC1 contains eight CK2 phosphorylation sites, which together constitute a binding platform for the FHA domains of PNK (10Loizou J.I.

El-Khamisy S.F. Zlatanou A. Moore D.J. Chan D.W. Qin J. Sarno S. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Caldecott K.W. Cell. 2004; 117: 17-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe a potential involvement in DNA repair pathways of the previously uncharacterized human open reading frame C2orf13, which accumulates at sites of DNA damage via tandem zinc finger (ZnF) motifs and associates with XRCC1 by a mechanism analogous to those of PNK and APTX. Based on these and other findings, we denote this protein Xip1 (XRCC1-interacting protein 1) and propose that it is a novel regulator of DNA strand break repair. Plasmids—An IMAGE clone containing the full open reading frame of human Xip1 was obtained from RZPD, Berlin, Germany. To generate expression vectors for GFP- and Myc-tagged Xip1, this cDNA was amplified by PCR and inserted into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing an N-terminal Myc tag, respectively. The *FHA (R27A), *ZnF-1 (C387A), *ZnF-2 (C427A), and candidate ATM phosphorylation site mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (* denotes loss-of-function mutations). An expression plasmid for GFP-XRCC1 was generated by amplification of XRCC1 cDNA (a gift from Dr. K. Caldecott) by PCR and inserting it into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). All plasmid transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). RNA Interference—siRNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon) were synthesized to the following sequences (sense strand): Xip1 (5′-UUUCCGCAUUCUCUCUAUA-3′), XRCC1 (5′-GACCAUCUCUGUGGUCCUA-3′), and GL2 (control (13Mailand N. Bekker-Jensen S. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar)). ATM siRNA has been described previously (14Bartkova J. Rezaei N. Liontos M. Karakaidos P. Kletsas D. Issaeva N. Vassiliou L.V. Kolettas E. Niforou K. Zoumpourlis V.C. Takaoka M. Nakagawa H. Tort F. Fugger K. Johansson F. Sehested M. Andersen C.L. Dyrskjot L.

All siRNA transfections were performed with 100 nm siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Cell Culture—Human U-2-OS osteosarcoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). U-2-OS cell lines stably expressing Xip1-GFP and GFP-XRCC1 were generated and maintained as described (15Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To produce U-2-OS sublines stably expressing Myc-Xip1 (wild type (WT) and S116A), pcDNA3-Myc-Xip1 constructs were co-transfected with a puromycin resistance plasmid, and puromycin-resistant colonies were isolated and screened for homogenous expression of the transgenes. IR was delivered by an x-ray generator (Pantak HF160, 150 kV, 15 mA, dose rate 2.18 Gy/min). PARP-1 inhibitor (PJ34, Calbiochem) was used at a final concentration of 1 μm. Immunochemical Methods—Immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence assays were described (13Mailand N. Bekker-Jensen S. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Mouse antibody to Xip1 was raised against purified full-length, GST-tagged human Xip1. Other antibodies used in this study were mouse monoclonals to XRCC1 (Ab-1, NeoMarkers), ATM (MAT3, gift of Dr. Y. Shiloh), and Myc tag (sc-40, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit polyclonals to XRCC1 (Ab-9147) and SMC1 (Ab-9262), both from AbCam. Microscopy and Laser Micro-irradiation—Confocal images were acquired on LSM-510 (Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc.) mounted on Zeiss-Axiovert 100 m equipped with Plan-Neofluar ×40/1.3 oil immersion objective. Laser micro-irradiation to generate DNA strand breaks in defined nuclear volumes, and conditions for time-lapse microscopy were as described (16Lukas C. Melander F. Stucki M. Falck J. Bekker-Jensen S. Goldberg M. Lerenthal Y. Jackson S.P. Bartek J. Lukas J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 17Lukas C. Falck J. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration—Total cell extracts were prepared as described (13Mailand N. Bekker-Jensen S. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), separated on the ÁKTA Explorer gel filtration system (Amersham Biosciences) using Superose 6 columns (Amersham Biosciences), and collected in 0.3-ml fractions. Proteins were precipitated by incubation with acetone at -20 °C for 12 h and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on SDS-PAGE. Clonogenic Survival Assays—U-2-OS cells were transfected with control or Xip1 siRNAs. Three days after transfection, cells were replated and left to adhere for 12 h and then subjected to IR or treated with camptothecin for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated for an additional 14 days and stained with crystal violet. Colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted. Xip1 Rapidly Accumulates at Sites of DNA Damage—We screened a panel of uncharacterized human proteins harboring domains commonly found in known regulators of the DNA damage response for their possible involvement in this response. One of these proteins, C2orf13, appeared as an attractive candidate as it contains an N-terminal FHA domain (found in a range of proteins involved in the response to DNA damage (18Durocher D. Jackson S.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar)) as well as potential ZnF and coiled coil motifs in the C terminus (Fig. 1A). For reasons described below, we named this uncharacterized protein Xip1 (XRCC1-interacting protein 1). To assess whether Xip1 was indeed involved in the response to DNA damage, we generated a U-2-OS cell line stably expressing GFP-tagged Xip1 and assayed its behavior following exposure to genotoxic stimuli. Xip1-GFP localized to the nucleus throughout interphase in undamaged cells and accumulated both at IR-induced nuclear foci and in micro-laser-generated tracks (Fig. 1B). Notably, the recruitment of Xip1-GFP was exceedingly rapid, reaching a peak immediately after the infliction of DNA damage (Fig. 1, C (upper panels) and D). This accumulation was transient, too, as the bulk of recruited Xip1-GFP was lost from the sites of damage within 10 min (Fig. 1, C and D). This behavior sets Xip1 apart from proximal DNA double strand break (DSB) regulators, which accumulate at DSBs in a more gradual fashion and remain bound for an extended period at the irradiation doses used in this study (15Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 16Lukas C. Melander F. Stucki M. Falck J. Bekker-Jensen S. Goldberg M. Lerenthal Y. Jackson S.P. Bartek J. Lukas J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the rapid kinetics of Xip1-GFP recruitment to sites of DNA damage closely paralleled that of GFP-tagged XRCC1 (Fig. 1, C (lower panels) and D), suggesting that Xip1 might be a novel component of the response to DNA SSBs. Like Xip1, XRCC1 accumulated only transiently at DNA lesions but was retained somewhat longer than Xip1 (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that XRCC1 performs a broader role at the sites of DNA repair, whereas Xip1 is primarily important for the immediate response to the DNA insult. Interestingly, the recruitment of Xip1-GFP to DNA lesions was significantly delayed and sustained in the presence of an inhibitor of PARP-1 (Fig. 1E), the key initiator protein of SSB repair, further underscoring a potential role of Xip1 in this process. Xip1 Is Recruited to Sites of DNA Damage through a Novel, Tandem ZnF Motif—Having shown that Xip1 rapidly accumulates at sites of damaged DNA, we next sought to identify the structural motif(s) in Xip1 mediating this interaction. A deletion analysis pinpointed the potential tandem ZnFs in Xip1 as the domain responsible for its recruitment (data not shown). This motif strongly resembles a novel type of C2H2 zinc finger motif (with a CX5CX6HX5H configuration), and a BLAST analysis revealed that this motif is present in a number of proteins through evolution, all of which appear to have roles in DNA binding or DNA metabolism. Only in Xip1, however, is this motif present in tandem, and it is highly conserved in putative Xip1 orthologues across eukaryotes (supplemental Fig. S1). To clarify whether the tandem ZnF motifs were responsible for recruiting Xip1 to sites of damaged DNA, we substituted the second conserved cysteine in either or both of the CX5CX6HX5H clusters with alanines and tested the ability of such mutants to accumulate at micro-laser-generated DNA damage tracks. Although mutation in either of the ZnF motifs partially compromised Xip1 recruitment, the simultaneous alanine substitution in both clusters completely abrogated Xip1 binding to sites of DNA damage (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that the tandem ZnF motifs are indeed responsible for targeting Xip1 to DNA breaks. Xip1 Interacts with XRCC1—To gain insight into the function of Xip1 in the DNA damage response, we set out to identify Xip1-interacting proteins. The rapid and comparable recruitment kinetics of Xip1 and XRCC1 in response to micro-laser irradiation prompted us to assess whether the two proteins formed a complex. To test this idea, we used a mouse antibody raised against human Xip1 to immunoprecipitate endogenous Xip1 protein from total cell extracts. As shown in Fig. 2B, XRCC1 was specifically detected in Xip1 immunocomplexes but not in immunoprecipitates of a preimmune serum, suggesting that Xip1 and XRCC1 are indeed found in a common complex. This association was not significantly affected by DNA-damaging agents (data not shown). We next asked whether the Xip1-XRCC1 interaction was mediated by the FHA domain of Xip1. Wild-type Myc-tagged Xip1 or a point mutation abolishing the functionality of its FHA domain (Fig. 1A, *FHA) was transfected into U-2-OS cells and assessed for its ability to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous XRCC1. In agreement with the results in Fig. 2B, we observed a robust interaction between WT Myc-Xip1 and XRCC1 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, introduction of the FHA mutation into Xip1 fully abrogated this interaction, demonstrating that Xip1 recognizes XRCC1 through its FHA domain. Since FHA domains bind target proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (19Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol.

To this end, we tested the ability of WT or a CK2 phosphorylation-deficient mutant of XRCC1 (XRCC1-CKM (10Loizou J.I. El-Khamisy S.F. Zlatanou A. Moore D.J. Chan D.W. Qin J. Sarno S. Meggio F.

This analysis clearly showed that XRCC1-CKM was completely unable to bind Xip1 (Fig. 2D), demonstrating that Xip1 binding to XRCC1 involves its FHA domain-dependent recognition of CK2 phosphorylation sites in XRCC1. Thus, the association of XRCC1 with Xip1, PNK, and APTX appears to be mediated by similar mechanisms. To further probe the nature of the interaction between Xip1 and XRCC1, we depleted either protein by siRNAs and tested the impact of such treatment on its binding partner. Strikingly, although depletion of Xip1 did not have a significant impact on XRCC1 expression, the knockdown of XRCC1 led to a strong reduction in the protein level of Xip1 (Fig. 2E). Thus, the interaction between XRCC1 and Xip1 appears to be required to maintain the steady-state level of endogenous Xip1; a similar increase in stability was previously observed for DNA ligase 3 upon binding to XRCC1 (21Brem R. Hall J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2512-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Moreover, gel filtration analysis showed that the distribution patterns of Xip1 and XRCC1 in the eluted fractions were strikingly similar (Fig. 2F), suggesting that the majority of Xip1 protein is associated with XRCC1. This is in good agreement with the notion that the binding of Xip1 to XRCC1 is dependent on phosphorylation of XRCC1 by the constitutively active CK2 kinase(s) and that the stability of Xip1 is dependent on the presence of XRCC1. We wished to determine whether Xip1 was required for the recruitment of XRCC1 to sites of DNA repair and vice versa. For this purpose, we monitored the propensity of GFP-tagged Xip1 or XRCC1 to accumulate at damaged DNA after siRNA-mediated depletion of the other component. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2, neither the recruitment of Xip1-GFP nor the recruitment of GFP-XRCC1 was markedly impaired by the loss of the other component, indicating that despite their avid interaction, Xip1 and XRCC1 can be targeted to DNA lesions independently of each other. Xip1 Is Phosphorylated by ATM on Serine 116 in Response to IR—To further establish Xip1 as a component of the DNA damage response, we tested whether it was modified by ATM/ATR-mediated phosphorylation in response to DNA damage. Cells were subjected to various DNA-damaging stimuli and probed for the electrophoretic mobility of Xip1 on SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3A, endogenous Xip1 underwent a prominent mobility shift in response to IR but was not detectably modified following exposure to UV or hydroxyurea, suggesting that Xip1 is phosphorylated by ATM in response to DSBs, whereas it does not appear to be a target for ATR. Treatment with a phosphatase completely prevented the IR-induced mobility shift of Xip1 (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that it was indeed due to phosphorylation. To confirm that the phosphorylation of Xip1 was dependent on ATM, we evaluated the IR-dependent mobility shift of Xip1 in cells depleted of ATM by siRNAs. Such treatment largely prevented the IR-induced modification of Xip1, indicating that Xip1 is phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner in response to IR (Fig. 3C). We attempted to identify the major ATM phosphorylation site(s) in Xip1 and embarked on an alanine substitution strategy, mutating individual SQ/TQ-sites (seven of which are present in human Xip1) and probing such mutants for their IR-dependent mobility shift. Interestingly, a single S116A substitution rendered Myc-Xip1 less susceptible to ATM-mediated phosphorylation as judged by the virtually complete lack of mobility shift of this mutant (Fig. 3D), whereas mutation of none of the other potential ATM phosphorylation sites significantly affected the ability of Myc-Xip1 to shift on SDS-PAGE in response to IR (data not shown). Thus, S116, which is highly conserved among mammalian species, appears to be the major ATM phosphorylation site in Xip1, further demonstrating that Xip1 is phosphorylated by ATM in response to DNA strand breaks. Depletion of Xip1 Sensitizes Cells to DNA-damaging Agents—The emerging role of Xip1 in the DNA damage response led us to assess its relative importance in this process. Cells transfected with control or Xip1 siRNAs were exposed to various DNA-damaging agents, and their sensitivity to the genotoxic insult was evaluated by conventional clonogenic survival assays. Consistent with a function in SSB repair, the depletion of Xip1 significantly reduced survival in response to camptothecin, a known inducer of SSBs (Fig. 3E). Notably, however, the survival rates of Xip1-depleted cells were comparably decreased in cells exposed to low doses of IR or methyl methanesulfonate (Fig. 3E and data not shown), indicating that Xip1 is required for the efficient repair of a broad range of DNA lesions. In this study, we have identified the previously uncharacterized human protein Xip1 as a novel component of the DNA damage response. Mammalian Xip1 orthologues are highly conserved within their defined N- and C-terminal domains, and BLAST searches suggest that Xip1-like proteins are also present in a wider range of eukaryotes from flies to man, indicating that Xip1 plays an important, evolutionarily conserved role in the response to DNA damage. A prominent feature of Xip1 presented here is its ability to rapidly and transiently accumulate at sites of damaged DNA, a behavior yielding important clues to its function in the DNA damage response. Although the kinetics of its recruitment did not parallel those of established DSB regulators, it closely resembled that of XRCC1, a central organizer of the SSB repair response, and was markedly modulated in response to inhibition of PARP-1, a key proximal detector of DNA SSBs. Together with the notion that Xip1 appears to form a stable complex with XRCC1, these data strongly support the idea that Xip1 is intimately involved in some aspect of SSB repair, consistent with the rapid nature of this process. We could demonstrate that Xip1 is recruited to damaged DNA through a novel tandem ZnF motif located in the C terminus of the protein. This likely reflects the direct recognition of damaged DNA by Xip1 since its accumulation at these sites does not appear to depend on XRCC1. Interestingly, a number of SSB repair proteins (including PARP-1 and DNA ligase 3) contain ZnF motifs that contribute to their recruitment to damaged DNA structures (5Almeida K.H. Sobol R.W. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and the data presented in this study indicate that Xip1 may accumulate at sites of chromosomal breakage in a similar fashion. The unusual (tandem) CX5CX6HX5H configuration of the Xip1 ZnF might function to recognize a unique, as yet unknown, structure in DNA, brought about by exposure to DNA-damaging agents. The observation that Xip1 is only transiently maintained at sites of damaged DNA suggests that the particular type of lesion to which Xip1 binds is rapidly repaired, causing the subsequent dissociation of Xip1 from DNA. This idea is supported by our finding that Xip1-GFP exhibits prolonged retention at sites of DNA damage in response to PARP-1 inhibition, presumably because the structures recognized by the ZnFs of Xip1 are not repaired in a timely fashion. Xip1 contains an N-terminal FHA domain, a motif frequently found in components of the DNA damage response (18Durocher D. Jackson S.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and we have shown that a key function of this domain is to mediate the interaction of Xip1 with XRCC1. This binding depends on the prior phosphorylation of the latter protein by CK2 kinases, which are constitutively active, agreeing well with the finding that Xip1 and XRCC1 form a complex even in undamaged cells. The CK2 requirement for Xip1 binding to XRCC1 is not unexpected as the FHA domain of Xip1 aligns well with those of PNK and APTX (data not shown), providing an explanatory basis for their common preference for CK2-phosphorylated XRCC1. As we have shown, an important aspect of the FHA domain-dependent binding of Xip1 to XRCC1 may be to support the stability of the former protein. However, it is clearly possible that Xip1 might also employ its FHA domain to interact with additional proteins. It remains to be seen whether Xip1, PNK, and APTX compete for XRCC1 binding or recognize non-overlapping CK2 sites in XRCC1. What is the precise function of Xip1 in DNA repair? The lack of any obvious catalytic domains suggests that like XRCC1, Xip1 functions predominantly in the organization of repair complexes at the sites of damaged DNA, in agreement with its rapid and transient accumulation in this compartment. The observed FHA domain-dependent binding to XRCC1 suggests that one important function of Xip1 may be to recruit XRCC1 to DNA lesions. However, cells depleted for Xip1 were not markedly impaired in XRCC1 accumulation at sites of chromosomal breakage, which might reflect the possibility that XRCC1 recruitment is complex and may also involve its direct targeting to the lesions or might occur via its interactions with other SSB repair components including PNK, APTX, pol β, and DNA ligase 3. It is possible that Xip1 serves to recruit XRCC1 to a particular subset of DNA lesions, which might be uniquely recognized by its tandem ZnF motifs. This scenario would be consistent with the fact that IR and micro-laser irradiation generate a multitude of lesions in DNA, only a subset of which might require Xip1-dependent recruitment of XRCC1, for which reason they might not be easily appreciable by the light microscopy approaches employed here. Alternatively, Xip1 might recruit one or more additional factor(s) to XRCC1-containing complexes at sites of DNA repair. Further studies should be aimed at addressing these complex issues. Although the behavior of Xip1 described in this study would be primarily consistent with a role in SSB repair, the function of Xip1 in DNA repair may not necessarily be restricted to this process. In particular, a potential role of Xip1 in the repair of DSBs is suggested by our finding that depletion of Xip1 negatively affects the survival of cells exposed to both SSB-inducing and DSB-inducing agents. Moreover, we have identified several proteins in addition to XRCC1 to which Xip1 binds, including the Ku70-Ku86 complex, 3S. Bekker-Jensen, I. Gromova, J. Lukas, and N. Mailand, unpublished data. which plays an essential role in the repair of DSBs. Such a broader role in DNA repair is also warranted by the observation that Xip1 is phosphorylated by ATM, a modification that is not required for Xip1 recruitment to sites of DNA damage (data not shown) and that persists far beyond the time at which Xip1 is released from this compartment. In addition, none of the established SSB repair proteins have been described to be ATM targets, further indicating that Xip1 may have additional functions in the DNA damage response. In conclusion, our data uncover an emerging role of Xip1 in the orchestration of DNA strand break repair. A more detailed insight into its precise function in this process should contribute to understanding the molecular aspects of cellular defense mechanisms against genomic instability.

However, the identity, subcellular distribution, and physiological roles of FALDH are unclear because several variants produced by alternative splicing are present in varying amounts at different subcellular locations. Subcellular fractionation experiments do not provide a clear-cut conclusion because of the incomplete separation of organelles. We established human cell lines heterologously expressing mouse FALDH from each cDNA without tagging under the control of an inducible promoter and detected the variant FALDH proteins using a mouse FALDH-specific antibody. One variant, FALDH-V, was exclusively detected in peroxisomal membranes. Human FALDH-V with an amino-terminal Myc sequence also localized to peroxisomes. The most dominant form, FALDH-N, and other variants examined, however, were distributed in the endoplasmic reticulum. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based analysis of metabolites in FALDH-expressing cells incubated with phytol or phytanic acid showed that FALDH-V, not FALDH-N, is the key aldehyde dehydrogenase in the degradation pathway and that it protects peroxisomes from oxidative stress. In contrast, both FALDHs had a protective effect against oxidative stress induced by a model aldehyde for lipid peroxidation, dodecanal. These results suggest that FALDH variants are produced by alternative splicing and share an important role in protecting against oxidative stress in an organelle-specific manner.

Plants produce a variety of secondary metabolites, and some of these are potentially toxic to animals (1Fowler M.E. J. Wildl. Dis. 1983; 19: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Herbivora have developed behavioral and physiological strategies to avoid specific plants and to detoxify any toxins ingested. Detoxification can occur in the mouth and the gut rumen with or without the help of microbes (2Owens J.B. J. Agric. Sci. (Camb.). 1992; 119: 151-155Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The absorbed toxins must be detoxified in the intestine and liver, but studies on these mechanisms are limited because to date most animal experiments have been carried out using laboratory diets. Recently we found that a nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), 2The abbreviations used are: PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α; FALDH, fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; HEK, human embryonic kidney. is involved in the detoxification by using plant seeds as a diet for mice (3Motojima M. Hirai T. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PPARα is activated by fatty acid ligands and is an important regulator of lipid metabolism in animals (4Barbier O. Villeneuve L. Bocher V. Fontaine C. Torra I.P. Duhem C. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Guillemette C. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13975-13983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Despite the claimed essential role of this receptor in the liver, the PPARα-null mouse shows little phenotypic change when fed a normal laboratory diet (5Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J.

Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). We have examined its extrahepatic roles and found that PPARα induces the expression of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 11 in the intestine (7Motojima K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4141-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the substrates of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 11 showed that they include not only glucocorticoids and sex steroids but also bile acids, fatty acids, and branched amino acids (8Mindnich R. Moller G. Adamski J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 218: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 9Chai Z. Brereton P. Suzuki T. Sasano H. Obeyesekere V. Escher G. Saffery R. Fuller P. Enriquez C. Krozowski Z. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). So we examined the possibility that PPARα plays a vital role in inducing enzymes for metabolizing secondary metabolites of plants in normal and PPARα knock-out mice fed various plant seeds and found that sesame often killed PPARα knock-out mice but not normal mice (3Motojima M. Hirai T. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A DNA microarray analysis revealed that sesame induces the expression of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 11 and also various detoxifying enzymes in the intestine and liver in a PPARα-dependent and -independent manner (3Motojima M. Hirai T. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As the enzyme most significantly induced in a PPARα-dependent manner, we identified a fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, FALDH or ALDH, encoded by the mouse Aldh3A2 gene (this study). 3B. Ashibe and K. Motojima, unpublished data. ALDHs comprise a superfamily of NAD(P)+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes (10Vasiliou V. Pappa A. Pharmacology. 2000; 61: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The ALDH3 subfamily enzymes efficiently oxidize middle and long chain aldehydes (10Vasiliou V. Pappa A. Pharmacology. 2000; 61: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and one member of this subfamily, FALDH encoded by ALDH3A2, has a distinct role from the dehydrogenase encoded by ALDH3A1 (11Miyauchi K. Masaki R. Taketani S. Yamamoto A. Akayama M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19536-19542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kelson T.L. McVoy Jr., S. Rizzo W.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1335: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). FALDH is essential for the complete breakdown of phytanic acid, a branched fatty acid derived from the chlorophyll molecule (13Verhoeven N.M. Jakobs C. Carney G. Somers M.P. Wanders R.J. Rizzo W.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and loss of its activity has been proved to be the cause of Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (14De Laurenzi V. Rogers G.R. Hamrock D.J. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. Compton J.G. Markova N. Rizzo W.B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that FALDH protects cells against oxidative stress associated with lipid peroxidation and plays an important role in insulin action (15Demozay D. Rocchi S. Mas J.C. Grillo S. Pirola L. Chavey C. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6261-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because of these potential roles in protection against oxidative stress and PPARα-regulated expression (16Gloerich J. van den Brink D.M. Ruiter J.P. van Vlies N. Vaz F.M. Wanders R.J. Ferdinandusse S. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we speculate that PPARα-dependent induction of FALDH expression plays an important role in the detoxification of the toxic compound(s) directly or indirectly derived from sesame seeds. However, FALDH has not been sufficiently characterized at the protein level. Phytanic acid, a metabolite of phytol, has a methyl group at the carbon 3 position and must first undergo α-oxidation and then β-oxidation (17van den Brink D.M. van Miert J.N. Dacremont G.

Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1752-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is well established that α-oxidation occurs exclusively in peroxisomes (18van den Brink D.M. Wanders R.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1752-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Wanders R.J.A. Waterham H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 295-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). However, opinions differ on the identity and subcellular localization of the key enzyme converting pristanal to a β-oxidizable pristanic acid. Human genetic analyses using FALDH-deficient fibroblasts have shown that the product of the ALDH3A2 gene is responsible for most, if not all, of the activity behind the conversion (13Verhoeven N.M. Jakobs C. Carney G. Somers M.P. Wanders R.J. Rizzo W.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, van den Brink and Wanders (18van den Brink D.M. Wanders R.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1752-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and Jansen et al. (20Jansen G.A. van den Brink D.M. Ofman R. Draghici O. Dacremont G. Wanders R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) claimed the possibility of the existence of one or more additional aldehyde dehydrogenases reacting with pristanal in peroxisomes, and Masaki et al. (21Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) reported that FALDH expressed from cDNA in COS-1 cells is exclusively detected in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The organization of the mouse and human ALDH3A2 genes is well conserved, and similar alternative splicing patterns of transcripts have been reported (22Lin Z. Carney G. Rizzo W.B. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 496-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Rizzo W.B. Lin Z. Carney G. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 2001; 130-132: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The insertion of an additional exon produces a minor variant of FALDH with a distinct carboxyl-terminal domain of unknown function (22Lin Z. Carney G. Rizzo W.B. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 496-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The existence of alternative splicing and variants present in different amounts at various subcellular locations have made it difficult to characterize FALDH at the protein level. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular distribution and function of the major and various variant forms of mouse FALDH using a mouse FALDH-specific antibody after overexpressing each cDNA in human HEK293 cells under the control of an inducible promoter, thus avoiding problems originating from the extremely similar structures and incomplete separation by subcellular fractionation of various forms of FALDH with large differences in expression levels. Our data suggest that only one specific variant of FALDH is expressed exclusively in peroxisomes and plays an essential role in the efficient degradation of branched chain fatty acids in the peroxisomal α-oxidation system and that it protects cells from the damage induced by lipid peroxidation. Animals and Treatments—All procedures involving animals were approved by the Meiji Pharmaceutical University Committee for Ethics of Experimentation and Animal Care. Male C57/BL6J and PPARα-null mice (around 6 weeks old) were maintained under a 12-h light-dark cycle with free access to food and water. After being fed a diet containing the PPARα agonist Wy14,643 ([4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio]acetic acid) (Tokyo-Kasei, Tokyo, Japan) at 0.05% (w/w) or a normal laboratory diet, the mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and portions of the intestine and liver were removed for homogenization. Subcellular Fractionation of Mouse Liver Homogenate—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (24Ghosh M.K. Hajra A.K. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A homogenate was prepared by one stroke with a Teflon-glass homogenizer at 1000 rpm in 3 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). A postnuclear supernatant fraction was prepared by centrifugation of the homogenate for 5 min at 1200 × g (3Motojima M. Hirai T. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Homogenization buffer was added to the supernatant at up to 10 volumes of the original tissue and recentrifuged for 5 min at 6600 × g. The pellet was suspended in 2 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer (mitochondrial fraction). The supernatant was recentrifuged for 20 min at 12,500 × g to obtain the supernatant (microsomal and cytosolic fraction). The pellet was suspended in 2 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer (lysosomal fraction). For isolation of the peroxisome-enriched fraction, 1 ml of the lysosomal fraction was layered onto 7.5 ml of Nycodenz (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (30% Nycodenz in 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3) and centrifuged for 1 h at 131,000 × g. The pellet obtained was suspended in 200 μl of Nycodenz solution and used as the peroxisome-enriched fraction. To disassemble peroxisomes, the peroxisome-enriched fraction was diluted with 4 volumes of 12.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 9.0 or with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.1% as described previously (25Alexson S.E.H. Fujiki Y. Shio H. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 294-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and centrifuged for 1 h at 131,000 × g. Preparation of an Antibody against Mouse FALDH and Western Blot Analysis—A rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse FALDH was prepared using the peptide corresponding to Cys425-Arg439 as the antigen. This sequence is unique to mouse FALDH and common to all FADLH variants (22Lin Z. Carney G. Rizzo W.B. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 496-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The antibody used for immunofluorescence microscopy was purified by affinity purification using a peptide-coupled Sepharose 4B column (EAH-Sepharose 4B, GE Healthcare). The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method using the synthesized peptide and then by Western blotting (3Motojima M. Hirai T. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Protein Assay Rapid Kit wako (Wako, Tokyo, Japan), and the same amounts of protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore), and FALDH was detected by the antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (MP Biochemicals) with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). The antibody against the ER membrane protein α-calnexin was purchased from StressGen, and that against the rat peroxisomal membrane protein PMP22 was a gift from Dr. T. Imanaka (Toyama University, Toyama, Japan). Isolation of RNA and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from mouse tissue was prepared by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method as described previously (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar, 27Motojima K. Passilly P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol.

Total RNA from the cultured cells was obtained using Quick-Gene (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and QuickGene RNA cultured cell kit S (Fujifilm). Reverse transcription was performed using an ExScript RT reagent kit (Takara Bio, Kyoto, Japan). Real time PCR was performed with a LightCycler 1.5 instrument (Roche Diagnostics) and SYBR ExScript RT-PCR kit (Takara Bio) as directed by the manufacturer. The primers for real time PCR were as follows: 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA and 5′-GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT for 18 S rRNA, 5′-TGACCTTGATTTATTTTGCATACC and 5′-CGAGCAAGACGTTCAGTCCT for human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, 5′-GTCAGCTGGGCCAAGTTCTTC and 5′-TCATTACAGCTGATCCTTGACAATC for FALDH-N, 5′-GTCAGCTGGGCCAAGTTCTTC and 5′-GAAGCCAACAGGGCTTTTCC for FALDH-V, 5′-CAGCTGTGATTGTCAAGTTTGT and 5′-TCCGTATCACCAGGACGACTTC for FALDH-V2, 5′-CTCTGCCCTTTGGAGGTGTG and 5′-AGGGTCAGAAGGACTGGTTTGTC for FALDH-V3 (22Lin Z. Carney G. Rizzo W.B. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 496-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), 5′-TGCACTTCACGCTCAACTCT and 5′-GATAAGCTCCCATCCCACTG for human FALDH-N, and 5′-ATTGTAGCCGCTGTGCTT and 5′-TGAACTACCAGAAAAATCAACAGG for human FALDH-V (23Rizzo W.B. Lin Z. Carney G. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 2001; 130-132: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Isolation of Splice Variants and DNA Sequencing—The PCR primers used for the isolation of splice variants of mouse FALDH were the exon 8 primer 5′-CTCTGCCTTTGGAGGTGTG and exon 9′ primer 5′-GAAGCCAACAGGGCTTTTCC. Purified RT-PCR products were ligated into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The cycle sequencing was performed with T7 and SP6 primers in both directions, and the sequences were analyzed using the LIC-4200L-2G sequencer (LI-COR). To annotate each sequence, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Blast (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) was used. To confirm that the variants obtained are not splicing intermediates, RT-PCR was performed using primers annealing to 5′-untranslated region (5′-AAGTGGCAGTGAGCTGTGGCATC) and to each variant-specific region (5′-TCCGTATCACCAGGACGACTTC or 5′-AGGGTCAGAAGGACTGGTTTGTC). cDNA Cloning and Construction of Tetracycline-inducible T-REx On Expression Plasmids—A full-length cDNA clone of the major mouse FALDH was obtained from a fetal mouse cDNA library using the vector pCMV6-XL3 (Origen) by colony hybridization with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe obtained by PCR using the mouse FALDH primers (5′-GCTCCTTGGCCATTCATTTTCCTC and 5′-CATCATGTTGCCTAGGCTGGCTTC). cDNA clones of other variants were constructed by swapping the cDNA fragments obtained by PCR of cDNA synthesized from mouse liver total RNA using primers (5′-CATCAGCGCCCCTGCTTGTTAAA and 5′-TGCTCTCAATTGCGGAGATTTGG for FALDH-V and 5′-CTCTGCCTTTGGAGGTGTG and 5′-GAAGCCAACAGGGCTTTTCC for FALDH-V2 and -V3) with restriction sites for KpnI (for V, V2, and V3) and HpaI (for V), BstXI (blunted after PCR) (for V2), or PstI (blunted after PCR) (for V3) into KpnI and HpaI restriction sites of the FALDH full-length plasmid. To construct expression plasmids under tetracycline control (T-REx system, Invitrogen), the FALDH cDNA inserts in pCMV6-XL3 were excised with NotI and SmaI and cloned into the NotI and blunted ApaI sites of pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen). A full-length cDNA clone for human ALDH3A2 isoform 1 (human FALDH-V) (GenBank™ accession number NM_001031806) was obtained by RT-PCR of cDNA synthesized from total RNA isolated from human HEK293 cells using primers 5′-CGGACCGTGCAGTTCTCTG and 5′-AGACAGGGCTGGGTTTTGAA followed by cloning into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). After verification by sequencing, the cDNA insert was cloned into pCMV-tag3A (Stratagene) to construct an expression plasmid for amino-terminally Myc-tagged human FALDH-V. A human FALDH-N (GenBank accession number NM_00382) expression vector was constructed by swapping the RT-PCR fragment obtained by using primers 5′-TTCTCACCATTCAGCCACTG and 5′-CAACCCCGCAGTTTGTATTT after digestion with HindIII in the cDNA fragment and ApaI in the vector region of the FALDH-V expression plasmid above. Generation of Tetracycline-inducible Flp-In T-REx HEK293 Cells—Human HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of air, 5% CO2. To cause Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells to express FALDH-N, -V, -V2, or -V3 under the control of tetracycline, the cells were transfected with a mixture of DNA of one of the pcDNA5/FRT/TO plasmids and pOG44 (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h of transfection, the medium was supplemented with hygromycin B (50 μg/ml) to initiate selection for stably transfected cells. The selected cells were cloned and cultured in medium supplemented with hygromycin B (50 μg/ml) and blasticidin (5 μg/ml). For expression of FALDH, tetracycline (1 μg/ml) was added 24 h before the treatment of the cells with phytol, dodecanal, or phytanic acid. Immunofluorescence Localization—Stably or transiently transfected HEK293 cells cultured on polylysine-coated cover-slips were washed with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C. After being washed with PBS, cells were permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 10 min at 4 °C or with a mixture of acetone and methanol (1:1) for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells preincubated with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature to block nonspecific binding were then incubated with the antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. To detect the Myc-tagged proteins, an anti-c-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was used. After a rinse with wash buffer (0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS), the cells were incubated with secondary goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgGs conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (MP Biochemicals) or with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). After being washed with wash buffer and rinsed with PBS, the cells were fixed in Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich), and the specimens were subjected to confocal fluorescence microscopy with a Fluoview FV500 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). DsRed containing peroxisome-targeting signal-1 (DsRed-SKL) (28Vizeacoumar F.J. Vreden W.N. Aitchison J.D. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol.

GC-MS Analysis—GC-MS was performed according to a published method (30Komen J.C. Duran M. Wanders R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1341-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with modifications on an Agilent GC6890 gas chromatographer coupled to a JMS-AM150 mass spectrometer (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan). A 30-m HP-5 column (0.32-mm inner diameter with 0.25-μm filter, Agilent) was used with helium as the carrier gas. Samples (2 μl) were injected in the splitless mode. The gas chromatographer oven temperature was programmed as follows: 2 min at 70 °C followed by a rise to 120 °C at 5 °C/min, a rise to 260 °C at 7 °C/min, a pause at 260 °C for 3.5 min, a rise to 300 °C at 15 °C/min, and then 10 min at 300 °C. The identities of pristanic acid and stearic acid were determined by comparing their retention times and mass spectra with those of the tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives of purchased materials (stearic acid from Wako and pristanic acid from Sigma-Aldrich) as standards. The single ion monitoring mode was used for the detection of the (M - 57)+ ions for both pristanic acid and stearic acid. The amount of pristanic acid and stearic acid was quantified by integration of the respective peaks. Pristanic Acid Assay—The cells were cultured with 750 μm phytol with or without tetracycline for 24 h. Pristanic acid was extracted from the cells according to a procedure described previously (30Komen J.C. Duran M. Wanders R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1341-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. After being washed with PBS, the cells were homogenized with a Multi-beads shocker (Yasui Kikai, Osaka, Japan) in PBS. Then 0.1 volumes of 12 m HCl was added and mixed by vortexing. Six volumes of ether was added, and the mixture was stored at 4 °C for 48 h after mixing. The organic layer was collected, and the solvents were evaporated to 2 ml at 40 °C and dried with MgSO4. The solution was transferred to reaction vials, and the solvent was evaporated completely. The extracted compounds were converted to their corresponding tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives using 10 μl of N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (Pierce) and 10 μl of pyridine at 80 °C for 1 h. After the derivatization, the solution was directly used as a sample for GC-MS. Cell Viability Assay—The viability of the HEK293 cells was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-F (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). The assay is based on the activity of living cells to hydrolyze calcein-AM to produce fluorescent calcein (31Mount A.S. Wheeler A.P. Paradkar R.P. Snider D. Science. 2004; 304: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths of calcein are 485 and 535 nm, respectively, and the intensity of fluorescence is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. The fluorescence was quantified with a Typhoon 9410 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare). ER Stress Response Assay—ER stress was quantified by measuring the amount of variant XBP1 mRNA as described previously (32Hirota M. Kitagaki M. Itagaki H. Aiba S. J. Toxicol. Sci. 2006; 31: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly total RNA was extracted from the test cells with Quick-Gene 810 (Fujifilm). The mRNA of the XBP1 variant was quantified by real time PCR using specific primers (5′-GCTGAGTCCGCAGCAGGT and 5′-TTGTCCAGAATGCCCAACAG). For an internal standard, the amount of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was measured using the primers 5′-AGCCACATCGCTCAGACAC and 5′-GCCCAATACGACCAAATCC. Statistical Analysis—Data are means ± S.D. Significance was examined by the unpaired t test. FALDH Was Induced in the Liver of Normal Mice Fed Sesame but Was Far Less Abundant in PPARα-null Mice—Our preliminary analysis to detect the PPARα-dependently induced mRNAs in the liver of normal mice fed with sesame showed that FALDH, in addition to several P450s, was induced severalfold. 3B. Ashibe and K. Motojima, unpublished data. To confirm this, we prepared a mouse FALDH-specific anti-body (see Fig. 4A) and analyzed the changes in the amount of FALDH in the liver of wild-type or PPARα-null mice fed a normal laboratory diet or sesame seeds by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1, sesame induced FALDH expression by severalfold in the liver of wild-type mice. In the liver of PPARα-null mice, the basal expression levels of FALDH were low, about a fifth to a tenth of that in the corresponding tissue of wild-type mice, and a small but significant induction by sesame was observed. These results indicated that the induction of FALDH expression by sesame is dependent on the expression of PPARα, which is consistent with a recent publication (16Gloerich J. van den Brink D.M. Ruiter J.P. van Vlies N. Vaz F.M. Wanders R.J. Ferdinandusse S. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sesame seeds may contain a natural ligand for PPARα (3Motojima M. Hirai T. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Identification of this ligand and elucidation of the mechanism for PPARα-independent induction of FALDH expression by sesame are important issues needing to be solved. However, we are first interested in the physiological significance of the induction of FALDH expression and started the characterization of FALDH at the protein level.FIGURE 1FALDH expression was induced in the liver of normal mice fed sesame but was far less expressed in PPARα-null mice. The proteins (20 μg) in post nuclear fractions of the liver of male C57/BL6J (+/+) or PPARα-null (-/-) mice fed a normal laboratory diet (-), sesame seeds (S), or a diet containing Wy14,643 (Wy) for 3 days were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the expression levels of FALDH were compared by Western blotting using anti-mouse FALDH antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mouse FALDH mRNA Has Several Variants Generated by Alternative Splicing—FALDH is known to have variant forms produced by alternative splicing of the primary transcript (22Lin"

https://openalex.org/W1997317410,"Two cDNAs with sequence similarity to fatty acid desaturase genes were isolated from the phytopathogenic fungus, Claviceps purpurea. The predicted amino acid sequences of the corresponding genes, named CpDes12 and CpDesX, share 87% identity. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that CpDes12 and CpDesX arose by gene duplication of an ancestral Δ12-desaturase gene after the divergence of Nectriaceae and Clavicipitaceae. Functional expression of CpDes12 and CpDesX in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) indicated that CpDes12 is primarily a “Δ12”-desaturase, whereas CpDesX is a novel desaturase catalyzing “Δ12,” “Δ15,” and “ω3” types of desaturation with ω3 activity predominating. CpDesX sequentially desaturates both 16:1–9c and 18:1–9c to give 16:3–9c,12c,15c and 18:3–9c,12c,15c, respectively. In addition, it could also act as an ω3-desaturase converting ω6-polyunsaturates 18:3–6c,9c,12c, 20:3–8c,11c,14c, and 20:4–5c,8c,11c,14c to their ω3 counterparts 18:4–6c,9c,12c,15c, 20:4–8c,11c,14c,17c, and 20:5–5c,8c,11c,14c,17c, respectively. By using reciprocal site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that two residues (isoleucine at 152 and alanine at 206) are critical in defining the catalytic specificity of these enzymes and the C-terminal amino acid sequence (residues 302–477) was also found to be important. These data provide insights into the nature of regioselectivity in membrane-bound fatty acid desaturases and the relevant structural determinants. The authors suggest that the regios-electivity of such enzymes may be best understood by considering the relative importance of more than one regioselective preference. In this view, CpDesX is designated as aν + 3(ω3) desaturase, which primarily references an existing double bond (ν + 3 regioselectivity) and secondarily shows preference for ω3 desaturation.

Membrane-bound fatty acid desaturases are involved in the non-heme di-ironand oxygen-dependent dehydrogenation of fatty acyl chains. The membrane desaturases have a wide range of substrate specificity and regioselectivity (1Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 2Sperling P. Ternes P. Zank T.K. Heinz E. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent.

Acta. 1998; 1394: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). These enzymes are typically labeled according to their apparent regioselectivity. For instance, Δx-desaturases introduce a double bond at position x referenced from the carboxyl end; ωy-desaturases introduce a double bond at position y referenced from the methyl end. Less commonly, desaturases are classified as ν + z, indicating the introduction of an additional double bond at carbon z as referenced from a pre-existing double bond (ν) (4Yadav N.S. Wierzbicki A. Aegerter M. Caster C.S. Perez-Grau L. Kinney A.J. Hitz W.D. Booth Jr., J.R. Schweiger B. Stecca K.L. Allen S.M. Blackwell M. Reiter R.S. Carlson T.J. Russell S.H. Feldmann K.A. Pierce J. Browse J.

Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). An example of a Δx-desaturase is the Saccharomyces cerevisiae acyl-CoA Δ9-desaturase introducing a Δ9 double bond into palmitoyl and stearoyl thioesters (6Fujimori K. Anamnart S. Nakagawa Y. Sugioka S. Ohta D. Oshima Y. Yamada Y. Harashima S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has an ω3-desaturase involved in producing long-chain polyunsaturates (7Meesapyodsuk D. Reed D.W. Savile C.K. Buist P.H. Ambrose S.J. Covello P.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11948-11954Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although the plant extraplastidial oleate desaturase is often called Δ12-desaturase, strictly speaking it is a ν + 3 enzyme with a preference for introducing double bonds at or near the Δ12 position (8Reed D.W. Schafer U.A. Covello P.S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound desaturases are remarkable for their structural similarity and functional diversity. They all contain three conserved histidine motifs, which are believed to be responsible for di-iron binding at the catalytic center, and share similar hydrophobicity profiles that predict a common membrane topology (9Avelange-Macherel M.H. Macherel D. Wada H. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Diaz A.R. Mansilla M.C. Vila A.J. de Mendoza D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48099-48106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This structural resemblance has provided the basis for the study of structure-function relationships in these enzymes. By using site-directed mutagenesis, Shanklin, Somerville, and colleagues showed that the eight histidine residues in three conserved histidine-rich boxes are essential for the functionality of a rat stearoyl-CoA Δ9-desaturase (11Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and amino acid residues flanking the conserved boxes are critical for the catalytic properties of plant FAD2 desaturases and related enzymes (12Broun P. Shanklin J. Whittle E. Somerville C. Science. 1998; 282: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 13Broadwater J.A. Whittle E. Shanklin J. J. Biol.

Using domain swapping, Napier and colleagues showed that the regions of first two membrane-spanning helices and C terminus of borage front-end desaturases are important for the substrate specificity and/or regioselectivity (14Libisch B. Michaelson L.V. Lewis M.J. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Despite the above work, our understanding of the structure, function, and evolution of membrane-bound fatty acid desaturases remains fragmentary. In the course of studying desaturases of the fungus Claviceps purpurea (15Mey G. Oeser B. Lebrun M.H. Tudzynski P. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we have uncovered two desaturases with very similar structure but differing function, which help to elucidate some of the structure-function-evolution relationships in this class of enzymes. Organisms and Culture Conditions—C. purpurea kindly provided by Dr. Yu Chen, Dept. of Plant Science, University of Manitoba was grown at 25 °C for 14 days in medium C (16Mantle P.G. Nisbet L.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 93: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae strain INVSc1 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2 trp1–289 ura3–52 MATα his3Δ1 leu2 trp1–289 ura3–52, Invitrogen) was used as a heterologous host to study the expression of CpDes12 and CpDesX desaturases. The S. cerevisiae strain MKP-0 (MATa canl-100 ade2-1 lys2-1 ura3–52 leu2–3, 112 his3-Δ200 trpl-Δ901), kindly provided by Prof. Wei Xiao, University of Saskatchewan, Canada, was used as a host strain for a Δ9-desaturase gene (ole1) knock-out. The ole1-Δ::TRP1 disruption was made by cloning the EcoRI and NheI fragments of YDp-W (17Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) containing TRP1 marker into the SalI and KpnI sites of OLE1 and then introducing the linear recombinant plasmid into the host. The knock-out mutant was selected on the selective medium. The mutant strain named ole1Δ-MKP-0 was used as a heterologous host to study substrate specificity of CpDesX desaturase. Yeast cells were grown at 28 °C either in complex medium (YPD) or synthetic minimal medium (SD). Cloning of CpDes12 and CpDesX cDNAs from C. purpurea— The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to clone CpDes12 and CpDesX. The single-stranded cDNA was synthesized by Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using total RNA from mycelia of C. purpurea. The cDNA was then used as the template for the PCR reaction with two degenerate oligonucleotide primers, DM34 (forward primer) and DM36 (reverse primer) (see Table 1). These primers were designed based on the conserved amino acid regions of Δ12-desaturases and Δ12-desaturase-like enzymes from other fungal species such as Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa. The forward primer resides in the first conserved histidine box and reverse primer resides outside the histidine boxes corresponding to the amino acid sequences AHECGH(G/Q) AF (DM34) and WV(N/H) HWLVAITY (DM36), respectively. The PCR reaction was carried out for 35 cycles with a program (95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 90 s) and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min using denatured first-strand cDNA from C. purpurea as templates. PCR products with the expected size (∼600 bp) were separated by electrophoresis (1.2% agarose gel) and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The products were ligated into a pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced.TABLE 1Primers used in this studyPrimer nameSequence (5′ to 3′)DM34GCICAYGARTGYGGICAYSRIGCITTDM36TAIGTDATIGCIACIARCCARTGRTKIACCCADM37CCCAGCCGAACCGGTTGCCGAGGDM38AGCCCAGCCGAAACGGTTGCCAAGATACDM39CACAGTGCTCATCACAAGGCCACCGGACDM40CCACAGTGCGCATCACAAAGGAACTGGAAACDM41TGTCGGGCTTCGAAAATAGGGCTGCGADM42TGTTTGTCATCGAAAATAGGGCTGCGGDM43GGAATCGAAGCTTTTCTTCCAACDM44GGAACCAACGCCGTTGTCGDM45GCGGATCCAGGATGGCTGCTGCTACCTCTGDM46GCGAATTCCTAATTCTTCATCGAAATGGGCDM47GCCTGGAATCGAAGCTACGTATCCDM48GACCGTCTTTAGCTACTTCGAGACAGDM49GCGAATTCAGGATGGCTGCTACCACTTCTGCDM50GCGAATTCCTACTGAGTTCTCATCGAAATGGDM73CTCTCTGACATCGGCCTGGGTCTTDM74AAGACCCAGGCCGATGTCAGAGAGDM75CCGGACTTTGGATTATTGCCCACGADM76TCGTGGGCAATAATCCAAAGTCCGGDM77AGCGCGACATGGCTTTTCTTCCCCGDM78CGGGGAAGAAAAGCCATGTCGCGCTDM87CTGGACTCTGGGTCATTGCCCACGADM88TCGTGGGCAATGACCCAGAGTCCAGDM89AGCGCGACATGGTTTTCCTTCCCCGDM90CGGGGAAGGAAAACCATGTCGCGCT Open table in a new tab To obtain the entire sequences of CpDes12 and CpDesX cDNAs, the 5′ and 3′ regions were amplified separately using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences, Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers DM39 and DM40 were used to amplify the 3′ regions of CpDes12 and CpDesX, respectively. For amplification of the 5′ region, primers DM37 and DM41 were used for CpDes12 and DM38 and DM42 were used for CpDesX. The complete sequences, including untranslated and coding regions, were then amplified using specific primers DM43 and DM44 for CpDes12, and DM47 and DM48 for CpDesX, by Pfx50 DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The resulting PCR products were gelpurified and ligated into a pCR4-TOPO-TA cloning vector to give plasmids pDM11 and pDM12 for CpDes12 and CpDesX, respectively.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3997) Google Scholar) using default parameters, including the Gonnet scoring matrix, a gap penalty of 10, and a gap extension penalty of 0.2. The resulting alignment was used to generate a distance-based unrooted phylogram using the neighbor-joining method performed using PROTDIST and NEIGHBOR in the PHYLIP software suite, version 3.6 (19Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) as hosted by the Institute Pasteur, Paris, France. Parameters for PROTDIST included the use of the Dayhoff PAM matrix and George/Hunt/Barker amino acid categories. The tree was visualized using TREEVIEW (20Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis was repeated with bootstrap analysis using 100 iterations and an extended majority rule tree was constructed using CONSENSE. Functional Expression and Site-directed Mutagenesis of the CpDes12 and CpDesX Desaturases—The primers DM45 and DM46 for CpDes12 and DM49 and DM50 for CpDesX, respectively, were used to amplify coding regions using Pfx50 DNA polymerase. Fragments were then ligated into the vector pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) to yield plasmids pDM13 for CpDes12 and pDM14 for CpDesX. The sequence of the inserts was confirmed to be identical to the original cDNA and in the sense orientation relative to the GAL1 promoter. For mutagenesis, oligonucleotide primers were used to introduce nucleotide substitutions into CpDes12 and CpDesX through the use of the overlap extension PCR technique (21Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). For the first step, two overlapping fragments were synthesized in separate PCR reactions with Pfx50 DNA polymerase using mutagenic primer pairs as shown in Table 1. The pDM13 was used as a template to generate CpDes12 mutants (CpDes12[V152I] and CpDes12[V206A]), and the pDM14 was used to generate CpDesX mutants (CpDesX[I152V] and CpDesX[A206V]). The appropriate gel-purified products were combined and then used as templates for the second step PCR using primers DM45 and DM46 for CpDes12 mutants and DM49 and DM50 for CpDesX mutants for full-length amplification. For chimera construction (CpDes12[AcB]), 175 amino acids at the C terminus domain of CpDes12 were substituted by 176 amino acids of equivalent position of CpDesX. The double mutants CpDes12[V152I,V206A] and CpDesX[I152V,A206V] were generated using constructs CpDes12[V206A] and CpDesX[A206V] as templates, respectively. All variant fragments were gel-purified and ligated into pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO. The sequences of all mutant constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Yeast Transformation and Growth Conditions—S. cerevisiae strain INVSc1 or ole1Δ/MKP-0 was transformed with each construct using the S. C. EasyComp transformation kit (Invitrogen) with selection on uracil-deficient medium and supplemented with 17:1–10c in the case of ole1Δ-MKP-0. For assessment of desaturase activity, recombinant yeast cells were grown to saturation in 10-ml cultures for 2 days at 28 °C on minimal medium (synthetic dropout) lacking uracil. Yeast cells were then washed and used to inoculate 10 ml of induction medium containing 2% galactose supplemented with or without 0.1 mm substrate fatty acids (Nu-Chek) in the presence of 0.1% Tergitol (Nonidet P-40, Sigma). Cultures were incubated at 20 °C for 2 days. INVSc1 or ole1Δ-MKP-0 yeast containing the empty plasmid vector pYES2.1 was used as a negative control. The conversion efficiency (%) was calculated as (product(s)/(substrate + product(s)) × 100), where the one or more products include those derived from further desaturation. Fatty Acid Analysis—For fatty acid analysis, yeast cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with 1% Tergitol, and washed once with water, and FAMEs 2The abbreviations used are: FAME, fatty acid methyl ester; 16:2–9c,12t, a fatty acid containing 16 carbons with 2 double bonds at position 9 and 12, counted from the C terminus with cis configuration at position 9 and trans configuration at position 12; 18C, fatty acid(s) containing 18 carbons; DMOX, 4,4-dimethyloxazoline; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. were prepared as previously described (8Reed D.W. Schafer U.A. Covello P.S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The FAME samples were analyzed on an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a DB-23 column (30-m × 0.25-mm) with 0.25-μm film thickness (J&W Scientific). The column temperature was maintained at 160 °C for 1 min, then raised to 240 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min. The position of newly introduced double bonds in desaturated products was determined by the analysis of the 4,4-dimethyloxazoline (DMOX) and/or the fatty acyl diethylamide derivatives as described previously (7Meesapyodsuk D. Reed D.W. Savile C.K. Buist P.H. Ambrose S.J. Covello P.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11948-11954Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Luthria D.L. Sprecher H. Lipids. 1993; 28: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). GC-MS analysis was accomplished using an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector coupled to an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph using the same column and conditions described above. The mass selective detector was run under standard electron impact conditions (70 eV), scanning an effective m/z range of 40–700 at 2.26 scans/s. Purification of 16:2–9c,12c from isolated yeast FAMEs was accomplished by high-performance liquid chromatography fractionation using an Agilent 1100 Series high-performance liquid chromatography with the fraction collector connected to 2 × 12.5 cm Whatman Partisphere C18 columns connected in series. A linear solvent elution gradient was used starting at 90% acetonitrile, 10% water with increasing acetone from 0 to 30% in 20 ml. Collected eluate fractions containing pure 16:2–9c,12c (>98% by GC) were pooled and saponified to the free fatty acid (8Reed D.W. Schafer U.A. Covello P.S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) for use in yeast medium supplementation experiments. Topology Prediction—The topology of C. purpurea desaturases were predicted using the combination software of TOPPRED (23Claros M.G. von H.G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar), TMHMM (24Krogh A. Larsson B. von H.G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8747) Google Scholar), HMMTOP (25Tusnady G.E. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), and ConPred II (26Arai M. Mitsuke H. Ikeda M. Xia J.X. Kikuchi T. Satake M. Shimizu T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W390-W393Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Isolation of Two C. purpurea cDNAs Encoding Δ12 Desaturase-like Enzymes (CpDes12 and CpDesX)—By using degenerate oligonucleotide primers targeted to conserved histidine motifs of known Δ12-desaturases, and total RNA isolated from mycelia of C. purpurea as the template for reverse transcription-PCR, two cDNA fragments of ∼600 bp showing sequence similarity to fungal Δ12-desaturases were amplified. Subsequently, full-length cDNAs corresponding to the genes, given the names CpDesX and CpDes12, were obtained by 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Sequence analysis indicated that CpDesX encodes a polypeptide with 477 amino acids, whereas CpDes12 codes for a protein with one amino acid shorter than the CpDesX polypeptide. CpDesX and CpDes12 share 87% amino acid identity and 86% nucleotide identity. Both CpDes12 and CpDesX possess three histidine motifs, which are believed to be involved in di-iron binding at the active site of membrane-bound fatty acid desaturases (11Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). BLAST searches showed that CpDesX and CpDes12 have high amino acid sequence identity to Δ12-desaturases from Fusarium moniliforme (69% for CpDesX and 73% for CpDes12), Aspergillus nidulans (64% for CpDesX and 65% for CpDes12), Neurospora crassa (64% for CpDesX and 68% for CpDes12), and Arabidopsis thaliana (38% for CpDesX and 39% for CpDes12), as well as to recently identified “bifunctional Δ12/Δ15” desaturases from F. moniliforme and Magnaporthe grisea (45–46%). As might be expected from inspection of the above sequence similarities, phylogenetic analysis supports the recent divergence of CpDes12 and CpDesX (Fig. 1). Both sequences cluster together with fungal Δ12-desaturases from F. graminearum, F. moniliforme, M. grisea, N. crassa, and A. nidulans, which form a group that has been classified as subfamily 2 by Damude and coworkers (27Damude H.G. Zhang H. Farrall L. Ripp K.G. Tomb J.F. Hollerbach D. Yadav N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9446-9451Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A separate group includes the fungal bifunctional desaturases from F. graminearum, F. moniliforme, M. grisea, and N. crassa (27Damude H.G. Zhang H. Farrall L. Ripp K.G. Tomb J.F. Hollerbach D. Yadav N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9446-9451Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, both CpDes12 and CpDesX appear to have evolved from an ancestral subfamily 2 type gene (probably a Δ12-desaturase) (27Damude H.G. Zhang H. Farrall L. Ripp K.G. Tomb J.F. Hollerbach D. Yadav N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9446-9451Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) after the divergence of the Clavicipitaceae (including Claviceps) and Nectriaceae (including Fusarium). Functional Characterization of CpDes12 in S. cerevisiae—To determine the function of CpDes12 and CpDesX, the coding regions of two cDNAs were cloned into the yeast expression vector pYES2.1 under control of GAL1 promoter, and the recombinant plasmids were then introduced into S. cerevisiae INVSc1. The empty vector (pYES2.1) and the vector containing Arabidopsis AtFAD2 (28Covello P.S. Reed D.W. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were used as the negative and positive controls, respectively. The analysis of total FAMEs showed that, compared with the yeast negative control (pYES2.1/INVSc1), the yeast strain AtFAD2/INVSc1 expressing Arabidopsis FAD2 produced significant quantities of two additional fatty acids as previously described and identified as 16:2–9c,12c and 18:2–9c,12c (28Covello P.S. Reed D.W. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The yeast strain CpDes12/INVSc1 expressing CpDes12 also produced two new fatty acids with the same retention time as 16:2–9c,12c and 18:2–9c,12c standards (Fig. 2A, chromatogram 1). Their identities were confirmed by GC/MS analysis of the FAMEs (see supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, CpDes12 could also use 19:1–10c and 18:2–9c,12c as substrates, albeit to a much lesser extent, producing 19:2–10c,13c (see supplemental Fig. S2) and 18:3–9c,12c,15c (see below), respectively. When supplied with 19:1–10c substrate, the yeast strain CpDes12/INVSc1 expressing CpDes12 produced 19:2–10c,13c at a level of 0.4% of total fatty acids. These results indicated CpDes12 is primarily a Δ12-desaturase with ν + 3 regioselectivity. We propose the common name ν + 3 (Δ12) fatty acid desaturase for this enzyme (see “Discussion”). Functional Characterization of CpDesX in S. cerevisiae—The yeast strain CpDesX/INVSc1 expressing CpDesX produced five new peaks compared with the negative control (pYES2.1/ INVSc1) (Fig. 2A, chromatogram 2). The two FAMEs with longer retention times were identified as 18:2–9c,12c and 18:3–9c,12c,15c (Fig. 2A, chromatogram 2) based on their retention times and mass spectra being identical to that of authentic standards. The mass spectra of two FAMEs with lower retention times were consistent with 16:2 isomers (molecular ion m/z = 266), whereas the mass spectrum of a third peak with an intermediate retention time was consistent with 16:3 (molecular ion m/z = 264). The exact position of the double bonds of three novel 16C fatty acids was provided by GC-MS analysis of their DMOX (Fig. 3) and diethylamide derivatives (see supplemental Fig. S3). Fig. 3 (A and B) show the mass spectra of the DMOX derivatives of two 16C dienoic acids. Comparison of the mass spectra of the derivatives indicates that they have identical molecular ion and fragmentation patterns. The diagnostic fragment pairs of DMOX derivatives at m/z 196 and 208, and 236 and 248, with gaps of 12 atomic mass units indicate that both fatty acids are 16C dienes with double bonds at the Δ9 and Δ12 positions. The mass spectra of diethylamide derivatives confirmed the result of DMOX derivatives (see supplemental Fig. S3). One of the 16C dienoic acids was eluted at the same retention time as authentic 16:2–9c,12c standard and was thus identified as 16:2–9c,12c. The earlier eluting 16C diene, as found in a similar study by Cahoon and colleagues (29Cahoon E.B. Kinney A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12495-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was identified as 16:2–9c,12t. Chemically speaking, the data are also consistent with 16:2–9t,12c and 16:2–9t,12t isomers, but, given the likelihood that the isomer is derived from 16:1–9c (see below), we consider those possible structures improbable. Under the growth conditions used, 16:2–9c,12t isomer was not detected in C. purpurea. Fig. 3C shows the mass spectrum of the DMOX derivative of the 16C trienoic acid. The derivative has a molecular ion at m/z 303 and diagnostic fragments at m/z 182, 196, 208, 222, 236, 248, 274, and 288, identical to the pattern of 16:3–9c,12c,15c, a product of a recently identified “bifunctional” desaturase from Acanthamoeba castellanii (30Sayanova O. Haslam R. Guschina I. Lloyd D. Christie W.W. Harwood J.L. Napier J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36533-36541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To verify the substrates of CpDesX for the biosynthesis of the 16C and 18C polyunsaturates, a Δ9-desaturase knock-out mutant (ole1Δ) of the yeast strain MKP-0 was generated using the one-step gene disruption approach (31Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). When CpDesX was expressed in the mutant strain (ole1Δ-MKP-0) in the presence of 16:1–9t, no new fatty acid was detected. On the other hand, supply of 16:1–9c to CpDesX/ole1Δ-MKP-0 yielded two new fatty acids, 16:2–9c,12t and 16:2–9c,12c. Supply of 16:2–9c,12c to the strain produced 16:3–9c,12c,15c (see supplemental Fig. S4). These results provided further evidence that the 16C diene with the lower retention time described above is 16:2–9c,12t and that CpDesX catalyzes desaturation of 16C fatty acids at both Δ12 and Δ15 positions. The Δ12 desaturation of 16:1–9c produced two 16C dienes, 16:2–9c,12c and 16:2–9c,12t. The ratio of the two isomers was ∼2.6:1, with 16:2–9c,12c predominating. In addition, CpDesX also has Δ12- and Δ15-desaturase activities on 18:1–9c for the sequential synthesis of Δ12- and Δ15-polyunsaturates (18:2–9c,12c and 18:3–9c,12c,15c) in yeast. It was noted, however, that the Δ12 activity of CpDesX on 18C monoene was much lower compared with its Δ15 activity on the 18C diene (see Table 2).TABLE 2Effects of the mutagenesis on Δ12 and Δ15 desaturation of 18C fatty acids by CpDes12 and CpDesXEnzymeAccumulationConversionΔ15/Δ12 ratio relative to wild type18:1-9c18:2-9c,12c18:3-9c,12c,15cΔ12Δ15Δ15/Δ12%TFAa%TFA, weight percent of the total fatty acids.%RatioCpDes12 wild type10.4 ± 0.5516.4 ± 0.970.06 ± 0.061.3 ± 0.40.37 ± 0.020.006 ± 0.01.0CpDes12[V152I]10.8 ± 0.1815.6 ± 0.250.40 ± 0.0259.7 ± 0.72.52 ± 0.110.042 ± 0.0027.0CpDes12[V206A]9.5 ± 0.2315.0 ± 0.151.97 ± 0.1364.1 ± 0.911.57 ± 0.590.180 ± 0.00729.9CpDes12[V152I,V206A]11.6 ± 0.9010.8 ± 0.953.15 ± 0.5454.6 ± 4.222.4 ± 1.90.411 ± 0.00268.2CpDes12[AcB]19.1 ± 0.328.3 ± 0.710.12 ± 0.0130.5 ± 1.51.42 ± 0.050.047 ± 0.0027.7CpDesX wild type24.8 ± 0.290.11 ± 0.010.23 ± 0.011.35 ± 0.0667.5 ± 1.850.0 ± 2.11.0CpDesX[I152V]24.5 ± 0.650.84 ± 0.061.46 ± 0.058.54 ± 0.2163.5 ± 1.07.4 ± 0.20.149CpDesX[A206V]27.0 ± 0.820.73 ± 0.020.47 ± 0.024.28 ± 0.0839.3 ± 0.99.2 ± 0.30.184CpDesX[1152V,A206V]23.6 ± 1.61.8 ± 0.230.21 ± 0.027.78 ± 0.5010.7 ± 0.41.4 ± 0.10.028a %TFA, weight percent of the total fatty acids.

https://openalex.org/W2061810783,"In Ralstonia eutropha H16, two genes, norA and norB, form a dicistronic operon that is controlled by the NO-responsive transcriptional regulator NorR. NorB has been identified as a membrane-bound NO reductase, but the physiological function of NorA is unknown. We found that, in a NorA deletion mutant, the promoter activity of the norAB operon was increased 3-fold, indicating that NorA attenuates activation of NorR. NorA shows limited sequence similarity to the oxygen carrier hemerythrin, which contains a di-iron center. Indeed, optical and EPR spectroscopy of purified NorA revealed the presence of a di-iron center, which binds oxygen in a similar way as hemerythrin. Diferrous NorA binds two molecules of NO maximally. Unexpectedly, binding of NO to the diferrous NorA required an external reductant. Two different NorA-NO species could be resolved. A minor species (up to 20%) showed an S = ½ EPR signal with g⊥ = 2.041, and g∥ = 2.018, typical of a paramagnetic dinitrosyl iron complex.

This species is proposed to represent a novel dinitrosyl iron complex of the form Fe2+-[NO]22-, i.e. NO is bound as NO–.

In the denitrifier Ralstonia eutropha H16, formation of the NO reductase NorB is controlled by NorR, an NO-binding transcriptional activator (3Klink A. Elsner B. Strube K. Cramm R. J.

The norB gene is cotranscribed with norA that encodes a protein of unknown function. Orthologs of NorA are present in many genomes of proteobacteria and firmicutes (5Rodionov D.A. Dubchak I.L.

The expression of DnrN, ScdA, and YtfE has been shown to be up-regulated by NO or nitrosating agents (6Bodenmiller D.M. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Kim C.C. Monack D. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Richardson A.R.

The non-denitrifiers S. aureus, E. coli, and S. enterica, however, do not possess the norB gene, which demonstrates that norA-like genes do not necessarily co-occur with norB. The NO-dependent expression of norA and its coexpression with norB in R. eutropha suggest a function for NorA in NO metabolism. However, it was shown previously that a nonpolar in-frame deletion of the norA gene did not affect denitrification of R. eutropha cells in terms of growth, accumulation of nitrite or nitrous oxide, or formation of dinitrogen (4Pohlmann A. Cramm R. Schmelz K. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study we report the purification and characterization of NorA from R. eutropha. We show that NorA is an NO-binding di-iron protein that modulates the NO-responsive expression of the norAB operon in denitrifying cells of R. eutropha. Strains and Plasmids—Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. E. coli JM109 was used for propagation of plasmids. E. coli S17-1 served as the donor in conjugative transfers. E. coli BL21(DE3) was used for overproduction of NorA-hexahistidine fusion protein. Mutant strains of R. eutropha were constructed by a gene replacement strategy (15Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the suicide vector pLO1, and were verified by Southern blot analysis. The NorR, NorA, and NorB proteins referred to in this study are encoded by the norR1, norA1, and norB1 genes located on megaplasmid pHG1 of R. eutropha. A chromosomally encoded paralog nor gene cluster termed norR2A2B2 has not been extensively studied, but mutational analyses indicate that either of the two nor clusters is sufficient for denitrification (4Pohlmann A.

In mutant strains HF640, HF635, HF636, HF637, and HF658, the chromosomal norR2A2B2 region was replaced by a fragment containing a translational fusion of the norA1B1 promoter with the lacZ gene for β-galactosidase from E. coli. These strains were constructed by homologous recombination with pCH1018. HF637 contains an additional in-frame deletion of norA1 that was established using plasmid pCH698. HF658 contains an additional in-frame deletion of norR1 that was established using plasmid pCH699. Plasmids were constructed as follows. The upstream region of norA was amplified by PCR using pCH510 as the template. The oligonucleotide primers used were 5′-CGGGATCCGCCACCGGCCGCAGGTG-3′ and 5′-TAAAGCTTGTCATGATGTTTCTCCGTCTG-3′, containing BamHI and HindIII sites (underlined), respectively. The amplified 320-bp fragment was cloned BamHI-HindIII into pPHU236 to give plasmid pGE570. pGE570 was digested with BamHI and SalI, and the resulting 3.5-kb fragment was treated with Klenow polymerase and cloned into the StuI site of pCH696 to give pCH1128. Following digestion of pCH1128 with KpnI and SpeI and treatment of the 5.9-kb fragment with Klenow polymerase, the fragment was cloned into the PmeI digested vector pLO1, yielding plasmid pCH1018. For heterologous overproduction of a hexahistidine-tagged NorA, a 700-bp fragment was PCR-amplified from pCH510 as the template, using the primers 5′-TCATGCATGCGTAACTTCAGACGGAGAAACATATGACCCTGCAA-3′ and 5′-CGAGCTCCAAGCTTTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGGTCGTTTGCCTGCGTGGCGGGCAGGCCCGGCTCG-3′ containing NdeI and SacI sites (underlined), respectively. Insertion of the NdeI-SacI fragment into the NdeI-SacI-digested pET22b(+) yielded plasmid pCH1095. To construct a plasmid for homologous overproduction of NorA-His6, the promoter region of the fhp gene from R. eutropha was PCR-amplified from pGE28 with primers 5′-GCTCTAGACAAGCTTTCGAGCTGTCAGTCCGGCGCCGAGAG-3′ and 5′-GGGTCAGCATATGTCGGTCTCCATGGCGCG-3′ containing XbaI, HindIII, and NdeI sites (underlined), respectively. The 632-bp PCR fragment was cloned NdeI-XbaI in pET22b(+) to gain an additional HindIII site, and subsequently inserted into the HindIII site of pBBR1MCS-2. This construct was completed by a 700-bp NdeI-HindIII fragment from pCH1095 that contains a promoterless norA gene, yielding pGE569. Media and Growth Conditions—E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37 °C. Aerobic starter cultures of R. eutropha strains were grown overnight at 30 °C in mineral salts medium with 0.4% (w/v) fructose as the carbon source (FN medium), as described previously (4Pohlmann A. Cramm R. Schmelz K. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Denitrifying cultures of R. eutropha strains were grown without shaking at 30 °C in 150-ml septum-sealed flasks containing 100 ml of fn medium supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) potassium nitrate. The flasks were purged with helium prior to inoculation. Antibiotics were added as follows: for R. eutropha, tetracycline (15 μg/ml) and kanamycin (350 μg/ml); for E. coli, tetracycline (10 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Culture growth of E. coli and R. eutropha was monitored by following the optical density at 600 nm (A600) and 436 nm (A436), respectively. Overproduction of NorA and NO Treatment on Cells—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the NorA-His6 expression plasmid pCH1095 were grown from overnight cultures in 500 ml of LB medium at 37 °C with aeration (120 rpm). At A600 = 0.6, expression of norA was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The incubation was continued for another 4 h at 30 °C, and the cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min. For NO treatment on E. coli BL21(DE3) with plasmid pCH1095, cells were grown as described above. At A600 ∼ 0.6, 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added. After 1.5 h of incubation at 30 °C with shaking (120 rpm), the cells were spun down at 5000 × g and resuspended in 140 ml of prewarmed LB medium. The culture was transferred into a 150-ml sealed flask and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C without aeration to achieve anaerobic conditions. Nitric oxide-saturated solution was then added to the E. coli culture to a final concentration of ∼5 μm. After further incubation of the sealed cultures for 5 min at 30 °C without aeration, cells were harvested at 5000 × g for 15 min. A saturated solution of NO (2 mm) was prepared by bubbling of NO gas through a sealed flask with water that was previously purged with helium. NO gas was purified by passage through a 5 m NaOH solution and spectroscopically monitored for contaminating nitrite at 354 nm. Protein Purification—E. coli cells were chilled and harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min. Samples were kept at 4 °C. The cell pellet was washed once with 200 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl). For purification under aerobic conditions, the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole) and passed twice through a French pressure cell at 900 p.s.i. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant containing the His-tagged NorA was loaded onto a nickel-charged HiTrap column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer B (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole) and eluted with 4 volumes of buffer C (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 150 mm imidazole). The presence of NorA in the eluate fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Fractions containing purified NorA-His6 were combined and concentrated using Centricon concentrators (cut-off, 10,000 Da). For purification under anaerobic conditions, the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A2 (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole). Cells were disrupted by sonication, transferred into an anaerobic chamber, and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min. NorA was purified from the supernatant by chelating chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The cell extract was applied to the columns, which were then washed with buffer B2 (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole). The NorA protein was eluted with buffer C2 (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). For spectroscopic measurements, NorA samples were transferred to sealed cuvettes in the anaerobic chamber. The homogeneity of protein preparations was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To yield reduced NorA, 100 μm purified NorA protein was incubated with 10 mm ascorbate and 10 μm phenazine methosulfate (PMS) for 15 min in an anaerobic chamber. The reductant was removed by using a PD10 column (GE Healthcare), with buffer A2 as elution buffer. Eluted fractions with detectable 280 nm absorbance were combined, concentrated, and transferred into sealed cuvette. For the preparation of apoNorA, 0.5 ml of 0.3 mm aerobically purified NorA was transferred into an anaerobic chamber and 10 mm ascorbate and 10 μm PMS were added. Upon addition of 0.1 ml of 20 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl stock solution, the solution immediately developed a reddish pink color. This solution was incubated for 1 h at 6 °C and then loaded onto a PD10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. The eluting colorless fractions with detectable 280 nm absorbance were combined and constituted the apoNorA solution. Analytical Procedures—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Titration with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobezoic acid) was carried out in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.4 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobezoic acid) using an absorption coefficient for 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate of 14,150 m–1 cm–1 at 412 nm (20Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). The iron content of purified proteins was determined by the method of Fish (21Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase was assayed as described previously (22Zimmer D. Schwartz E. Tran-Betcke A. Gewinner P. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2373-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the activity was calculated according to Miller (23Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972: 352-355Google Scholar) except that the cell density was measured at 436 nm. NO consumption was assayed as described previously (16Cramm R. Siddiqui R.A. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6769-6777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a Clark electrode. Nitrite was quantified using a colorimetric Griess assay (24Lowe R.H. Evans H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 85: 377-389PubMed Google Scholar). A modified Griess assay was used to determine NO bound to NorA and apoNorA. Proteins were incubated with three equivalents of NO and an excess of ascorbate/PMS in a sealed cuvette without headspace in an anaerobic chamber for 15 min. The solutions were transferred to a sealed Centricon concentrator (10-kDa cut-off) using a gas-tight syringe. The proteins were then separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation for 1 min. Samples from both the concentrate and the flowthrough were injected with a gas-tight syringe into rubber-sealed reaction tubes containing Griess reagent and oxygen. After an incubation period of 5 h with shaking, NO was quantified by measuring the absorption at 550 nm. The concentration of protein-bound NO was calculated by subtracting NO in the flowthrough. Controls with nitrite and NO-saturated buffer (2 mm) showed that both compounds gave identical absorption values, thus proving the reliability of this method. Spectroscopy—UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Cary 300 SCAN UV-visible spectrophotometer or a Hewlett Packard (HP8453) photodiode array spectrophotometer. EPR spectroscopy was performed as in a previous study (25von Wachenfeldt C. de Vries S. van der Oost J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Genomic Comparison—An alignment of selected NorA orthologs (Fig. 1) shows that these proteins have a bipartite structure. The N-terminal part harbors a domain of unknown function DUF542 (26Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is characterized by a conserved motif CCXG. The C-terminal part contains a histidine-rich region that resembles a hemerythrin domain. Hemerythrin (Hr), an oxygen carrier protein found in several marine invertebrates, contains a di-iron center (27Stenkamp R.E. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 715-726Crossref Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The two iron atoms in Hr are coordinated by five histidine residues and the carboxylates of a glutamate and an aspartate. Five histidine residues and two glutamate residues are strictly conserved within all NorA orthologs (His-86, His-107, His-131, Glu-135, His-162, His-206, and Glu-210 in R. eutropha NorA). Of these, His-86, His-131, His-162, and His-206 and both glutamates align with ligands coordinating the di-iron site in Hr. However, one histidine ligand that is conserved in all known Hr proteins (see Fig. 1) is not strictly conserved within NorA orthologs, whereas His-107 of NorA is not conserved in Hr. Hence the comparative analysis suggests that NorA, albeit not a typical hemerythrin, contains a di-iron center that is mainly coordinated by histidine ligands. Purification and Spectroscopic Characterization of NorA—NorA was overproduced in E. coli as a His-tagged protein and purified under aerobic conditions from the cytoplasmic fraction. SDS-PAGE of isolated NorA under non-reducing conditions showed a band with an apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa (Fig. 2) and an additional band with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa. Both bands were identified as NorA by mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; not shown); the 60-kDa band disappeared upon incubation with excess dithiothreitol, indicating that NorA homodimers are formed due to oxidation of cysteine residues and subsequent disulfide bridging between monomers. Chemical iron determination of various NorA preparations yielded 1.5–2.2 mol of iron per mol of NorA. The optical spectrum of as-isolated NorA shows a maximum at 353 nm (∊ ∼ 4500 m–1 cm–1) and a shoulder at 430 nm (Fig. 3, trace 1). Similar spectral features have been observed in other di-iron proteins and were attributed to absorbance of the (μ-oxo)-bridged diferric center (28Garbett K. Darnall D.W. Klotz I.M. Williams R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 135: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 29Gupta N. Bonomi F. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Ravi N. Wang D.L. Huynh B.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3310-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Xiong J. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Ai J. Sanders-Loehr J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5117-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the EPR spectrum of as-isolated NorA displayed a single signal with gz = 1.9665, gy = 1.9230, and gx = 1.8732 (Fig. 4A), typical of the S = ½ state of a mixed-valent antiferromagnetically coupled dinuclear iron site (31Andersson K.K. Graeslund A. Adv. Inorg Biochem. 1995; 43: 359-408Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32Persson B.O. Karlsson M. Climent I. Ling J. Sanders-Loehr J. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B-M. J. Biol. Inorg Chem. 1996; 1: 247-256Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Quantification of the signal revealed that the fraction of mixed-valence NorA was low (<7%) and varied from preparation to preparation thus confirming that the majority of aerobic isolated NorA contained a diferric rather than a diferrous or a mixed-valence di-iron center.FIGURE 4X-band EPR and UV-visible spectra of isolated NorA. A, aerobically purified NorA as isolated showing the mixed-valence EPR signal. B, EPR spectra and C, the corresponding room temperature UV-visible spectra of NorA treated in the following three ways: trace 1, fully reduced NorA. Fully reduced NorA was obtained by anaerobic reduction with ascorbate/PMS (10 mm/10 μm for 10 min) followed by removal of the reductant by anaerobic gel filtration; trace 2, addition of 250 μm NO to fully reduced NorA; and trace 3, further addition of ascorbate/PMS (10 mm/10 μm) to NO-treated NorA. The [NorA] was 100 μm in all experiments. EPR signals of DNIC and free NO (maximum at ∼3500 G) are indicated. The signal intensity of 250 μm NO in the absence of NorA (not shown) is ∼10% higher than that in trace 2, panel B. The amount of free NO in trace 3 is ∼20% of the NO added initially, consistent with the binding of 2 NO/NorA. The signal indicated by the asterisk is from a cavity impurity. EPR conditions: frequency, 9.25 GHz; modulation amplitude, 1.0 millitesla; microwave power, 20 microwatts; and temperature, 13 K. The gain in panel B is the same for all traces. The gain in panel A is 1.6 times that in panel B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the in vivo oxidation state of NorA, the protein was purified under anaerobic conditions. SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions yielded only monomeric NorA, indicating that a disulfide bridge is not formed in the cytoplasm of E. coli cells. Titration of NorA with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobezoic acid) under non-denaturing conditions yielded a ratio of 3.9 free thiols per NorA monomer, showing that all four cysteines of NorA are solvent-accessible. Iron determination of anaerobically purified NorA yielded 1.6–2.0 mol of iron per mol of NorA. The EPR spectrum of anaerobically purified NorA did not show the mixed-valence signal, indicating that this form of NorA is not present in the intracellular environment. In the optical spectrum, weak absorbances at 316 nm and ∼370 nm were observed (Fig. 3, trace 2). The low intensity of these absorbances is consistent with the presence of mainly diferrous di-iron centers, lacking absorption between 300 and 1000 nm (28Garbett K. Darnall D.W. Klotz I.M. Williams R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 135: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 33Fox B.G. Shanklin J. Somerville C. Munck E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2486-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 34Han J-Y. Swartz J.C. Sykes A.G. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 35: 4629-4634Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Complete reduction of NorA with ascorbate and PMS led to bleaching of the optical spectrum (Fig. 4C, see also Fig. 5, trace 2). Admission of air to the anaerobic sample resulted in an increase of absorbance at 316 and 370 nm, and the appearance of a new signal at 520 nm (∊ = 1153 m–1 cm–1) (Fig. 3, trace 3) within 10 min. This pattern of spectral features is reminiscent of that of the oxygenated form of Hr. Upon oxygenation, the diferrous center in the deoxygenated form of Hr is oxidized to the diferric form in oxygenated Hr, and the bound dioxygen is reduced to the peroxide oxidation state, giving rise to absorbance bands at 330, 360, and 500 nm (28Garbett K. Darnall D.W. Klotz I.M. Williams R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 135: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although the bands between 300 and 400 nm are attributed to absorption of the (μ-oxo)di-iron(III) center (35Shiemke A.K. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 4951-4956Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the band at 500 nm is due to the hydroperoxo-Fe(III) ligand-metal charge transfer transition (36Reem R.C. McCormick J.M. Richardson D.E. Devlin F.J. Stephens P.J. Musselman R.L. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 4688-4704Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The presence of the 520 nm band in the optical spectrum of NorA thus indicates formation of a stable O2 adduct. The low wavelength of this band suggests the presence of a hydroperoxo ligand, as observed in Hr, rather than a peroxo ligand, because generally (μ-1,2-peroxo)di-iron units give rise to bands at or above 600 nm (37Mizoguchi T.J. Kuzelka J. Spingler B. DuBois J.L. Davydov R.M. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Lippard S.J. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 40: 4662-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Upon prolonged (16 h) aerobic incubation of the protein on ice, the resulting spectrum was identical to that of aerobically purified NorA, indicating that a (μ-oxo)Fe(III) diiron center was formed by a process analogous to the auto-oxidative conversion of oxygenated Hr to diferric Hr by loss of the pero"

https://openalex.org/W2024503639,"The breast cancer regulatory protein-1 (BRCA1)-associated RING domain 1 (BARD1) gene is mutated in a subset of breast/ovarian cancers. BARD1 functions as a heterodimer with BRCA1 in nuclear DNA repair. BARD1 also has a BRCA1-independent apoptotic activity. Here we investigated the link between cytoplasmic localization and apoptotic function of BARD1. We used immunofluorescence microscopy and deconvolution analysis to resolve BARD1 cytoplasmic staining patterns and detected endogenous BARD1 at mitochondria. BARD1 was also detected in mitochondrial cell fractions by immunoblotting. The targeting of BARD1 to mitochondria was modestly stimulated by DNA damage and did not require BRCA1 as indicated by RNA interference and peptide-competition experiments. Transiently expressed yellow fluorescence protein-BARD1 localized to mitochondria, and the targeting sequences were mapped to both the N and C terminus of BARD1. Ectopic yellow fluorescence protein-BARD1 induced apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in MCF-7 breast tumor cells. BARD1 apoptotic function was associated with stimulation of Bax oligomerization at mitochondria. This distinguishes it from BRCA1, which is pro-apoptotic but did not induce Bax oligomerization. The cancer-associated BARD1 splice-variant ΔRIN (lacks the BRCA1 binding domain and ankyrin repeats) was recruited to mitochondria but did not stimulate apoptosis or alter membrane permeability. We propose that BARD1 has two main sites of action in its cellular response to DNA damage, the nucleus, where it promotes cell survival through DNA repair, and the mitochondria, where BARD1 regulates apoptosis.

The targeting of BARD1 to mitochondria was modestly stimulated by DNA damage and did not require BRCA1 as indicated by RNA interference and peptide-competition experiments. Transiently expressed yellow fluorescence protein-BARD1 localized to mitochondria, and the targeting sequences were mapped to both the N and C terminus of BARD1. Ectopic yellow fluorescence protein-BARD1 induced apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in MCF-7 breast tumor cells. BARD1 apoptotic function was associated with stimulation of Bax oligomerization at mitochondria. This distinguishes it from BRCA1, which is pro-apoptotic but did not induce Bax oligomerization. The cancer-associated BARD1 splice-variant ΔRIN (lacks the BRCA1 binding domain and ankyrin repeats) was recruited to mitochondria but did not stimulate apoptosis or alter membrane permeability. We propose that BARD1 has two main sites of action in its cellular response to DNA damage, the nucleus, where it promotes cell survival through DNA repair, and the mitochondria, where BARD1 regulates apoptosis.

BARD1 is a putative tumor suppressor, and its gene is mutated in a subset of breast and ovarian cancer patients (2Thai T.H. Du F. Tsan J.T. Jin Y. Phung A. Spillman M.A. Massa H.F. Muller C.Y.

Cancer. 2006; 6: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and several lines of evidence indicate that the BARD1-BRCA1 heterodimer is the physiologically relevant form of BRCA1. The two proteins are coordinately expressed in different tissues and cell types in both Xenopus laevis and human cells, and they stabilize one another (5Joukov V. Chen J. Fox E.A. Green J.B.

The BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer is important for cell viability, and loss of either or both proteins in mice results in accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities and early embryonic death due to severe cell proliferation defects (9McCarthy E.E.

BARD1 and BRCA1 are predominantly found in the cell nucleus where they co-localize in dots during S-phase of the cell cycle (11Jin Y. Xu X.L. Yang M.C. Wei F. Ayi T.C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Consistent with their role in the DNA damage checkpoint, genotoxic stress induces BARD1 and BRCA1 to redistribute in the nucleus into discrete foci that co-stain with DNA repair factors such as BRCA2 and Rad51 (12Scully R.

Human BARD1 (777 amino acids) is smaller than BRCA1 (1843 amino acids), but both proteins share a similar domain structure, comprising an N-terminal RING finger and two C-terminal BRCT domains (1Baer R. Ludwig T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 19Ayi T-C. Tsan J.T. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2143-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). BARD1 differs from BRCA1 in that it also contains an ankyrin repeat domain known to mediate protein-protein interactions; the role of this domain in BARD1 is still under investigation. BRCA1 and BARD1 interact via their N-terminal RING domains (20Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). We previously discovered nuclear export sequences within the dimerization domain of both proteins and showed that heterodimerization caused inactivation of their nuclear export resulting in a strong nuclear accumulation of the dimer (21Fabbro M.

The ubiquitination of H2AX links BRCA1·BARD1 ubiquitin ligase activity with chromosome rearrangement and formation of DNA damage-induced nuclear repair sites, as suggested also by the BRCA1·BARD1-dependent appearance of conjugated ubiquitin at damage-induced foci (25Morris J.R. Solomon E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The ubiquitination of γ-tubulin (26Starita L.M. Machida Y. Sankaran S. Elias J.E. Griffin K. Schlegel B.P.

Other functional roles may depend on the subcellular localization patterns of BRCA1·BARD1. The pro-apoptotic activity of BARD1 is the only known function that does not require its interaction with BRCA1 (27Irminger-Finger I. Leung W.C. Li J. Dubois-Dauphin M. Harb J. Feki A. Jefford C.E.

Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8855-8861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) sequences and used RNA interference to demonstrate that endogenous BRCA1 can regulate accumulation of BARD1 in the nucleus (28Schüchner S. Tembe V. Rodriguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8855-8861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The apoptotic function of BARD1 is at least partly dependent on p53 (27Irminger-Finger I. Leung W.C. Li J. Dubois-Dauphin M. Harb J. Feki A. Jefford C.E. Soriano J.V. Montesano R. Krause K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and is stimulated by the export of BARD1 from nucleus to cytoplasm (22Rodriguez J.A. Schüchner S. Au W.W.Y. Fabbro M. Henderson B.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Jefford et al. (29Jefford C.E. Feki A. Harb J. Krause K.H. Irminger-Finger I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3509-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) also observed a correlation between cytoplasmic staining of BARD1 and apoptosis. The co-expression of BRCA1 inhibited BARD1 nuclear export and apoptotic activity (22Rodriguez J.A. Schüchner S. Au W.W.Y. Fabbro M. Henderson B.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Fabbro M. Schüchner S. Au W.W.Y. Henderson B.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), consistent with the premise that BARD1 alone translocates to a specific cytoplasmic location to elicit an apoptotic response. In preliminary cell staining experiments we observed a granular cytoplasmic distribution of BARD1 reminiscent of mitochondrial staining. In this study we demonstrate that BARD1 does indeed locate at mitochondria and that this can occur independent of BRCA1. The mitochondrial targeting of BARD1 correlates with induction of apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial outer membrane potential. Further analysis revealed that BARD1 induces oligomerization of the pro-apoptotic factor Bax at mitochondria. Cell Culture and Transfections—The following human cell lines were grown under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum: U2OS osteosarcoma cells, HEK293T epithelial cells, HCT 116 and SW480 colon cancer cells, and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. HCC1937 breast cancer cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The immortalized but non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12K containing 5% horse serum, insulin, epidermal growth factor, cholera toxin, and hydrocortisone. All cell lines were mycoplasma-negative. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 24 h after seeding, the cells were transfected at 50% confluence with 2 μg of DNA (per well in a 6-well plate) or 4 μg of DNA (T25 flask for Western blots or flow cytometry). At 6 h post-transfection, the transfection mix was removed and replaced with the appropriate medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were fixed and processed 24 h post-transfection for fluorescence microscopy and at 40 h post-transfection for flow cytometry analyses. For DNA damage experiments, at 45 h post-transfection cells were either left untreated or were treated with 15 gray ionizing radiation from a cesium-137 source with a 3-h recovery as described (13Au W.W.Y. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6993-7001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—The YFP-BARD1 wild-type (wt) and nuclear export signal (NES) mutant expression plasmids were described previously (22Rodriguez J.A. Schüchner S. Au W.W.Y. Fabbro M. Henderson B.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The YFP-tagged BARD1 NLS mutant was described in Schüchner et al. (28Schüchner S. Tembe V. Rodriguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8855-8861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The plasmids pFLAG-BARD1 (1-188; Ref. 22Rodriguez J.A. Schüchner S. Au W.W.Y. Fabbro M. Henderson B.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and pFLAG-BARD1 (171-461, 171-375; Ref. 28Schüchner S. Tembe V. Rodriguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8855-8861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were previously described as indicated, and YFP fusions of these constructs were obtained by amplifying the YFP gene from the pEYFP-C1 vector (Invitrogen) by PCR and inserting into the NotI site of the respective pFLAG-BARD1 plasmids. YFP-BARD1 (1-141 and 551-777) was kindly supplied by Wendy Au (Sydney). A YFP-tagged form of pBARD1(ΔRIN) was constructed by PCR-amplifying the BARD1(ΔRIN) cDNA (31Tsuzuki M. Wu W. Nishikawa H. Hayami R. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Fukuda M. Ohta T. Cancer Lett. 2006; 233: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and inserting it into the XhoI/XmaI sites of pEYFP-C1. The forward primer (with XhoI site) was 5′-ATAATACTCGAGAAATGCCGGATAATCGGCAG-3, and the reverse primer (with XmaI site) was 5′-GACATCCCGGGTCAGCTGTCAAGAGGAAG-3′. Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Primary Antibodies—Cells were grown on coverslips at 60% density and fixed in 3.7% formalin (tissue culture grade (Sigma), phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 24 h post-transfection and incubated with various antibodies as previously described (22Rodriguez J.A. Schüchner S. Au W.W.Y. Fabbro M. Henderson B.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Live cells were incubated with 100 nm Mito-Tracker CMX-Ros (Molecular Probes) in culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C, then washed and fixed in ice-cold acetone: methanol (1:1) for 3 min at room temperature. Cells were then blocked using 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h followed by the addition of primary antibodies as follows: rabbit polyclonal anti-BARD1 59L antibody (1:500, a kind gift from Prof. Richard Baer), Bethyl (Exon 4) rabbit polyclonal Ab against BARD1 (BL518) Exon4 (1:500, Bethyl Laboratories); Novus rabbit polyclonal antibody against BARD1 Exon 4 (NB100-319) (1:500, Novus Biologicals), mouse monoclonal anti-BRCA1 antibodies Ab-1, Ab-4 (1:200, Oncogene Research); mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c (1:200, BD Bioscience); mouse monoclonal anti-prohibitin (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, UK); mouse anti-p53 (DO-1) monoclonal antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal antibody to apoptosis-inducing factor (1:200, BD Bioscience); anti-Bax polyclonal antibody 2772 against the N terminus (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology). Bound antibodies were detected with either AlexaFluor 488-conjugated (1: 500; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) or biotin-conjugated (1:500; DAKO) secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies. Biotinylated secondary antibodies were subsequently incubated with avidin D-Texas Red (Vector Laboratories, 1:1000 dilution) or AlexaFluor 594 diluted 1:1000 tertiary stains. Mitochondria were also detected by staining with the dye Nonylacridine orange (200 nm; Molecular Probes). Nuclei were counterstained with the DNA dye Hoechst 33285 (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted with Vectorshield aqueous mountant (Vector Laboratories) and observed and photographed using an Olympus BL51 fluorescence microscope at ×400 magnification. A SPOT32 camera was used for general image capture. Cell images for deconvolution were taken using the Axiovert 200M Cell Observer System (Zeiss) at 63× magnification, and z-stacks of ∼21 incremental slices (0.3-μm step size) were captured for each cell. The AxioVision 4.5 software was used for image deconvolution and three-dimensional view reconstruction. Isolation of Mitochondrial Extracts—Cells were lysed by mechanical homogenization using a small pestle, and mitochondrial extraction was performed using different mitochondrial extraction kits (Alexis Biochemicals and Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Qiagen kit benefits from an additional density gradient purification step. In brief, using the Qproteome mitochondria isolation kit (Qiagen), cells were suspended in lysis buffer to disrupt the plasma membrane without solubilizing it and to aid in the isolation of cytosolic proteins. Plasma membranes and compartmentalized organelles, such as nuclei, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum, remained intact and were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in disruption buffer, repeatedly passed through a narrow-gauge needle (26 or 21 gauge), and re-centrifuged to pellet nuclei, cell debris, and unbroken cells at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant, which contains mitochondria, was re-centrifuged to pellet mitochondria at 6000 × g for 10 min. After removal of the supernatant, mitochondria were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed on ice, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as outlined below. Immunoblotting—The mitochondrial or cytosolic fractions or total extracts were denatured in sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% SDS) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. 60-80 μg of protein extracts were loaded per lane and resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membranes were blocked using 5% skim milk powder in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature followed by primary antibody incubation for 2 h at room temperature using antibodies against BARD1 (1:1000 from Bethyl and Novus), PCNA (1:5000), β-tubulin (1:3000, Sigma), prohibitin (1:200, Abcam), cytochrome c (1:300, BD Biosciences), heat shock protein 70 (1:300, Affinity Bioreagents), and p53 (1:500, Santa Cruz). Incubation with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1:10,000; Sigma) for 1 h was followed by detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). For detection of ectopic YFP-BARD1 proteins, T150 flasks (5 × 107 cells) were transfected with YFP-BARD1 constructs (12 μg of DNA and 12 μg of Lipofectamine), and cells were lysed and processed for mitochondrial extraction 24 h post-transfection. Analysis of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry, Release of CMX-Ros Dye, and Bax Oligomerization—At 40 h post-transfection, cells were detached with trypsin and resuspended in complete medium. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min and washed in PBS and then centrifuged again at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 400 μl of PBS and then fixed in 4.5 ml of ice-cold 85% ethanol at 4 °C for at least 1 h. Next, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 600 μl of PBS containing RNase A (1 mg/ml) and propidium iodide (2 mg/ml). YFP-expressing cells were gated, and the cell cycle/apoptosis profiles were determined using a BD Biosciences FACScalibur flow cytometer. The percentage of apoptosis in each sample was determined by quantifying the sub-G1 DNA content using CellQuest software. Cellular loss of mitochondria membrane potential was quantified using a single cell assay by scoring for loss of mitochondrial staining of the CMX-Ros MitoTracker dye in transfected cells, as described in Ref. 32Reef S. Zalckvar E. Shifman O. Bialik S. Oren M. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 463-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar. For detection of Bax oligomerization at mitochondria, MCF-7 cells were fixed in methanol-acetone at 24 h post-transfection and stained with the Bax monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), then scored for the appearance of intense clustering of Bax as previously described (33Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were also scored for appearance of abnormal nuclei by Hoechst staining of chromatin, indicative of apoptosis. BARD1 Apoptotic Activity Requires Cytoplasmic Localization but Is Not Dependent on Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Shuttling—We previously described the identification of a NES at the N terminus of BARD1 and showed that mutagenesis of this sequence blocked BARD1 nuclear export and inhibited its apoptotic function by 50% (22Rodriguez J.A. Schüchner S. Au W.W.Y. Fabbro M. Henderson B.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1809-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine whether the translocation of BARD1 from nucleus to cytoplasm contributed to its apoptotic activity, we compared the impact of both NES and NLS mutations. As shown in Fig. 1, transfection of MCF-7 breast tumor cells with wild-type YFP-BARD1 induced apoptosis as measured by flow cytometry, and this activity was reduced by the NES mutation L107A. We compared the effect of mutations in the primary NLS (NLS3) of human BARD1, which we previously showed reduced nuclear import (28Schüchner S. Tembe V. Rodriguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8855-8861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). When expressed in MCF-7 cells, the NLS mutation had no effect on apoptosis (Fig. 1). These data indicate that it is the accumulation of BARD1 in the cytoplasm rather than its ability to shuttle from nucleus to cytoplasm that is important for its apoptotic activity. Detection of BARD1 at Mitochondria by Fluorescence Microscopy—We next examined in detail the cytoplasmic staining patterns of BARD1 using fluorescence microscopy and observed a granular/tubular staining pattern reminiscent of mitochondria. To test whether BARD1 localizes to mitochondria, we stained U2OS cells with different anti-BARD1 antibodies and antibody to the mitochondrial marker protein, cytochrome c, then fixed cells with acetone-methanol and analyzed them by fluorescence microscopy. The endogenous BARD1 pattern overlapped with the cytochrome c-positive-stained mitochondria in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 2A). Each of three different BARD1 polyclonal anti-sera showed the same result by immunostaining, and only low background staining was visible in the absence of primary antibody (data not shown). To confirm that the actual overlapping staining patterns reflected true co-localization at mitochondria, we acquired a z-stack series of images using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope and used deconvolution software to resolve trans-sections of the cell. The deconvolved images revealed very clear localization of endogenous BARD1 at mitochondria (see Fig. 2B). Further control experiments were then performed, and these showed that endogenous BARD1 co-stained with the two mitochondria-specific dyes Nonylacridine orange and the Mito-Tracker dye CMX-Ros (Molecular Probes) and also with the mitochondrial protein, prohibitin (see Ref. 34Mishra S. Murphy L.C. Nyomba G. Murphy L.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 192-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) as illustrated in supplemental Fig. S1. A deconvolution analysis of U2OS cells showed co-localization of BARD1 with prohibitin at mitochondria (supplemental Fig. S2). Moreover, we compared the mitochondrial localization pattern using a range of cell lines and different fixation methods. We observed co-localization of BARD1 with cytochrome c after both formalin and methanolacetone fixation, although the latter gave the clearest results (supplemental Fig. S3). Mitochondrial localization of BARD1 was observed in both human tumor cell lines (U2OS osteosarcoma, HCT116 colon cancer, and MCF-7 breast cancer) and non-tumorigenic MCF10a immortalized breast epithelial cells (supplemental Fig. S3). The overall pattern of BARD1 subcellular localization differed from cell to cell in randomly growing populations of cell lines, typical of mitochondria assembly and fission during the cell cycle. BARD1 Is Detected in Mitochondrial Cell Fractions—To confirm our microscopic analysis using a biochemical approach, we examined the localization of BARD1 cellular fractions highly enriched in mitochondria. Endogenous full-length BARD1 was strongly detected as a 97-kDa band in both mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, as shown for U2OS osteosarcoma cells in Fig. 3A. Two different antibodies each detected wild-type BARD1 in mitochondria in addition to a higher molecular weight band which is yet to be fully characterized but which did not disappear after rigorous phosphatase treatments (data not shown). Integrity of the mitochondrial fractionation was validated by staining with antibody to α-tubulin, a cytoskeletal protein that does not locate at mitochondria, and this antibody detected tubulin in the cytosolic but not mitochondrial fractions as expected (Fig. 3A). Moreover, staining with antibody to the nuclear DNA replication protein PCNA showed no obvious nuclear contamination of the mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 3C and data not shown). Staining for the mitochondria-localized proteins prohibitin and cytochrome c was positive for the mitochondrial fraction, as was p53, which was previously detected in mitochondria (35Marchenko N.D. Ziaka A. Moll U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). BARD1 was also detected in mitochondrial fractions isolated from other cell lines (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, BARD1 located more strongly at mitochondria (relative to cytoplasm) in the colon cancer cell lines SW480 and HCT116 than in the cell lines MCF-7 (breast cancer), MCF-10A (immortalized breast), and HEK293T (immortalized kidney epithelia). We note that a smaller BARD1 peptide of ∼70 kDa was frequently observed in mitochondrial preparations, corre"
https://openalex.org/W2048599310,"Mutation of human SOS1 is responsible for hereditary gingival fibromatosis type 1, a benign overgrowth condition of the gingiva. Here, we investigated molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased rate of cell proliferation in gingival fibroblasts caused by mutant SOS1 in vitro. Using ectopic expression of wild-type and mutant SOS1 constructs, we found that truncated SOS1 could localize to the plasma membrane, without growth factor stimuli, leading to sustained activation of Ras/MAPK signaling. Additionally, we observed an increase in the magnitude and duration of ERK signaling in hereditary gingival fibromatosis gingival fibroblasts that was associated with phosphorylation of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein and the up-regulation of cell cycle regulators, including cyclins C, D, and E and the E2F/DP transcription factors. These factors promote cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, and their up-regulation may underlie the increased gingival fibroblast proliferation observed. Selective depletion of wild-type and mutant SOS1 through small interfering RNA demonstrates the link between mutation of SOS1, ERK signaling, cell proliferation rate, and the expression levels of Egr-1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. These findings elucidate the mechanisms for gingival overgrowth mediated by SOS1 gene mutation in humans.

An SOS1 g.126,142–126,143insC insertion mutation causes a frameshift and early termination of the protein, yielding a chimeric 1,105-amino acid protein that consists of 1,083 SOS1 N-terminal amino acids followed by 22 novel amino acids. This truncation abolishes four C-terminal proline-rich motifs, which are required for Grb2 binding. The form of HGF due to SOS1 mutation is designated HGF1. SOS1 functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that couples receptor tyrosine kinases to the Ras signaling pathway and controls cell proliferation, differentiation, vesicle trafficking, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (5Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Under the control of two classes of regulatory proteins, GEF and GTPase-activating proteins, Ras functions as a molecular switch between GDP/GTP cycling (6Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 348: 125-132Crossref Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). Three Ras-GEFs; SOS, guanine nucleotide-releasing factor, and guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein, have been characterized in controlling Ras activation by catalyzing GDP release and association with GTP (7Bar-Sagi D.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Two regulatory regions govern the GEF activity of SOS1: a catalytic site that interacts with nucleotide-free Ras and an allosteric site that enhances exchange activity with the binding of nucleotide-Ras (12Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 13Margarit S.M. Sondermann H. Hall B.E. Nagar B. Hoelz A. Pirruccello M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Upon activation of receptor tyrosine kinase, Grb2-SOS1 complexes are recruited to the plasma membrane leading to the exchange of GDP for GTP and Ras activation (14Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. Van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Although the Grb2-SOS1 complex functions exclusively as an Ras activator, SOS1 can also function as a GEF that is specific to the GTPase Rac1. These two distinct catalytic functions of SOS1 are mutually exclusive and reciprocally related (7Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The activation of Ras signal stimulates downstream signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, a ubiquitous signal transduction pathway (15Schlessinger J.

Differences in the duration, intensity, spatial distribution, and temporal qualities of ERK signaling govern distinct biological responses (17Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat.

Translocation of activated ERK from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is necessary for activation and stabilization of Elk1, c-Jun, c-Myc, and c-Fos. These transcription factors then regulate the expression of genes, such as cyclin D1 and p21WAF1/CIP1, which are critical for the progression from G1 to S phase (26Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 27Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Increased cell proliferation has been reported for HGF1 gingival fibroblasts in both monolayer and three-dimensional matrix cultures (28Lee E.J. Jang S.I. Pallos D. Kather J. Hart T.C. J. Dent. Res. 2006; 85: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we report that mutant SOS1 contributes an increased and sustained activation of ERK signaling in HGF1 fibroblasts under serum-starved conditions. Sustained ERK signaling leads to increased expression of cell cycle regulators and transcription factors. RNA interference-mediated SOS1 depletion was used to confirm the association between SOS1 mutation, ERK activation, and gingival fibroblast proliferation. These findings document a gain-of-function SOS1 mutation and provide a molecular mechanism for gingival overgrowth in HGF1. Isolation of Fibroblasts and Cell Cultures—Human gingival tissues were obtained with informed consent from three normal subjects (control) and three patients (HGF1). All patients were heterozygous carriers of the SOS1 g.126,142–126,143insC mutation. Three sets of gingival fibroblasts from HGF1 patients and age-matched normal controls (ages 20–24 years) were isolated and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution (growth medium) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator and maintained up to 10 passages (28Lee E.J. Jang S.I. Pallos D. Kather J. Hart T.C. J. Dent. Res. 2006; 85: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Plasmid Construction, Transfection, and Subcellular Fractionation—The full-length human SOS1 expression plasmid (pCGN-HASOS1) was a gift from D. Bar-Sagi (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). The vector control plasmid was generated by HindIII digestion to release the HA-SOS1 insert and self-ligated. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used with oligonucleotide (5′AGCATCTGCACCAAATTCTTCCcAAGAACACCGTTAACACCTCC-3′, GenBank™ accession number L13857) to generate the mutated pCGN-HASOS1 construct that carried the HGF1 mutation (small case and cytosine insertion). The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For transient transfection, 15 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates a day before experiments. Expression constructs (2 μg) were transfected into primary gingival fibroblasts using JetPEI reagent (ISC Bioexperss, Kaysville, UT) or into HeLa cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfection was terminated 48–72 h post-transfection, and total cellular lysates were obtained (29Jang S.I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42268-42279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To study the subcellular distribution of SOS1, 100 × 104 HeLa cells were plated in 10-cm dishes 24 h before transfection. Eight micrograms of indicated expression constructs were used, and transfected cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. Cellular fractions were isolated using the ProteoExtract Subcellular Proteome Extraction kit (EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA). Cell Proliferation and Ras Activation Assays—For proliferation assays, 1 × 104 cells/well of primary gingival fibroblasts were seeded in 48-well plates. After 24 h the growth medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES (starving medium) for overnight. The medium was then replaced with growth medium and maintained for 9 days. Cells from triplicate wells were trypsinized at each time point, and the total cell number was determined by using a Coulter Counter (Beckman Z series). To monitor Ras activation, cells were seeded in 150-mm culture dishes, grown to 85% confluence, and serum-starved for 16 h. After treatment with EGF (25 ng/ml) for 0.5–6.0 h at 37 °C, cellular extracts were collected in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 2.0 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm Na3VO4, 10 μm NaF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin plus protease inhibitor tablet (Complete tablet, Roche Applied Science). Ras activity was measured using a Ras Activation kit (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA). For each reaction, 600 μg of whole cell lysate was incubated with Raf-1 Ras binding domain-agarose (15 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C. The complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 μm NaF, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Protein complexes were released with SDS sample buffer, separated by 4–12% NuPAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Proteins were detected by mouse anti-Ras antibody (0.05 μg/ml) and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (BioRad, 1:5000). Culture Treatment, Western Blot Analyses, and Indirect Immunofluorescence Staining—To monitor the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2, the cultures were either maintained in growth medium or switched to starving medium for 16 h before addition of EGF (Upstate) with indicated concentrations and incubation times. In some experiments, cultures were treated with AG1478 (EGFR inhibitor, 10 μm, EMD Biosciences) or PD98059 (MEK inhibitor, 10 μm, EMD Biosciences) 30 min prior to the addition of EGF as indicated (Fig. 2, legend). At each time point, cultures were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and whole cellular extracts were prepared by adding lysis buffer directly into monolayer cultures. Isolation of nuclear extracts and Western blotting were conducted as previously described (29Jang S.I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42268-42279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20, the primary antibodies were detected with a polyclonal goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG coupled with horseradish peroxidase. Primary antibodies included mouse anti-HA (16B12, 1:1500, Covance, Berkeley, CA), mouse anti-β-actin (1:800, Sigma), mouse anti-SOS1(N) (1:250, epitope at N-terminal, BD Bioscience Pharmingen), rabbit anti-SOS1(C) (1:500, epitope at C-terminal), rabbit anti-Egr-1 (1:300), rabbit anti-EGFR (1:300), rabbit anti-phospho-retinoblastoma (pRb, Ser-780), rabbit anti-retinoblastoma (Rb), and mouse anti-PCNA (1:500) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, rabbit anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2, 1:2000), and rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1:2000) from Upstate. Signals were detected by using ECL Western blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray film (XAR, Kodak). All experiments were conducted at least three times and quantitated using a FluorChem digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) and National Institutes of Health Image 1.63 software. Results were adjusted for loading controls. Immunofluorescent staining was conducted as previously described (30Jang S.I. Kalinin A. Takahashi K. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 781-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After transfection, gingival fibroblasts were maintained in either growth or starving medium for 16 h and fixed with paraformaldehyde (3.7%) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with anti-HA (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse conjugated with TRITC IgG antibody for 30 min. After washing, the cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature and washed three additional times. Slides were examined with fluorescence microcopy (Olympus, IX71), and images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS. Real-time PCR—Total RNA from equivalent cell densities of control and HGF1 fibroblast cultures maintained either in starving medium for 16 h or switched to growth medium for 1 day were prepared by TRIzol solution (Invitrogen) and the “RNeasy Mini kit” (Qiagen). RNA quality and quantity were determined using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100, Wilmington, DE). Reverse transcription-PCR experiments were conducted as described previously (32Liu W. Akhand A.A. Kato M. Yokoyama I. Miyata T. Kurokawa K. Uchida K. Nakashima I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modification. TaqMan probes and PCR primers were purchased from ABI Biosystems (Foster City, CA). These included SOS1 (Hs00362308_m1), E2F1 (Hs00153451_m1), E2F2 (Hs00 231667_m1), transcription factor DP1 (TFDP1, Hs00955488_m1), transcription factor DP2 (TFDP2, Hs00232366_m1), cyclin E1 (CCNE1, Hs00233356_m1), and cyclin E2 (CCNE2, Hs00180319_m1). The RNase P or TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) was used as endogenous control for normalization. QPCR Human Reference Total RNA (Stratagene) was used as a calibrator in all quantitative reverse transcription-PCR experiments. Relative levels of the indicated transcripts in each sample were calculated as 2–ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt = [target gene's Ct – TBP Ct]sample – [target gene's Ct – TBP Ct]calibrator. Experiments were performed at least three times with triplicate samples. RNA Interference Knock-down and Focus Oligoarray Analysis—Duplex RNA of SOS1 target sequences flanking the cytosine insertion were synthesized with the Silencer siRNA Construction Kit (Ambion). Transient transfection experiments were conducted as previously described (30Jang S.I. Kalinin A. Takahashi K. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 781-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, 18 × 104 cells/well of gingival fibroblasts were plated in 6-well plates 24 h before transfection. Double-stranded siRNA alone or together with SOS1 expression constructs (1 μg/35-mm) was introduced into HeLa cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The siRNA for Luciferase (5′-CTTACGCTGAGTACTTCGA) (31Lewis D.L. Hagstrom J Loomis A. G.E. Wolff J.A. Herweijer H. Nat. Gene. 2002; 32: 107-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) was used as a control. Total cellular lysates were collected after 48-h transfection and subjected to Western blot analyses. To monitor the effects of knock-down on proliferation, fibroblasts were seeded at 8000/well into 48-well plates. Cultures were transfected with indicated siRNA (50 nm) overnight and replaced with fresh growth medium (day 0). At each time point, the total number of cells was determined as described above. Experiments were performed at least three times with triplicate samples. To monitor gene expression in response to EGF treatment, normal (control), and HGF1 fibroblast cultures were serum-starved for 16 h and treated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for 24 h. Total RNA from EGF-treated and untreated cultures was prepared as described above. The complementary RNA probe was synthesized (TrueLabeling-Am kit, SuperArray Bioscience, Frederick, MD) together with biotin-16-UTP labeling. The complementary RNA probes were incubated with cell cycle microarray membranes, and the expression levels of each gene were detected with chemiluminescence using a copalyl diphosphate-star substrate (SuperArray Bioscience). Membranes were exposed to x-ray film (Kodak, XAR film) and signal analyzed by the GEArray Expression Analysis Suite (SuperArray Bioscience) with subtraction of background and normalization with housekeeping genes of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin. Statistical Analyses—For comparisons of proliferation assays, real-time PCR experiments and quantification of phospho-ERK levels, the Student's t test was used to compare the mean values between HGF1 and controls. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Expression of Mutant SOS1 in Gingival Fibroblasts—The insertion mutation of SOS1 in HGF1 results in an early termination as illustrated in Fig. 1A. To verify the presence of truncated SOS1 in HGF1 fibroblasts, antibody with the epitope against the N-terminal region of SOS1 (SOS1(N)), detected one band (∼170 kDa) in controls and two bands (170 and 130 kDa) in HGF1 patients (Fig. 1B, upper panel). The 170-kDa band corresponds to the full-length SOS1 and the smaller ∼130-kDa band approximates the calculated molecular weight of the truncated mutant SOS1. To confirm this, expression constructs of wild-type and mutant SOS1 were transfected into primary gingival fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 1B (lower panel), the expressed wild type (arrow a, lanes 2 and 5) and mutant (arrow b, lanes 3 and 6) bands were detected at the same positions as the endogenous full-length (lanes 1 and 3) and truncated SOS1 (lanes 4 and 5). Western blotting results revealed the intensity of the mutant (lower) band was 40% less than the full-length (upper) band in HGF1 samples (Fig. 1B). The lower amount of mutant SOS1 could result from the instability of either its transcript or its protein product. Real-time PCR experiments were conducted to monitor the total levels, of both wild-type and mutant SOS1 transcript in HGF1 fibroblasts. Overall levels of SOS1 transcript were 40% lower in HGF1 fibroblasts than in control fibroblasts (Fig. 1C). The TBP transcript served as an internal control. The lower levels of mutant SOS1 protein in HGF1 fibroblasts likely reflect a less stable mutant SOS1 transcript. Because all three sets of controls and HGF1 patients showed similar results, only results from one set of control and HGF1 fibroblasts are presented. Sustained Activation of MAPK in HGF1 Gingival Fibroblasts—Because SOS1 plays a critical role in the Ras/MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (22Nguyen T.T. Scimeca J.C. Filloux C. Peraldi P. Carpentier J.L. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9803-9810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of the SOS1 mutation on Ras signaling was evaluated. Although Ras activity was low in serum-starved control fibroblasts, it increased rapidly after EGF treatment and subsequently deceased, approaching basal levels by 30 min (Fig. 2A). In contrast, Ras activity was 5-fold higher in HGF1. Upon EGF stimulation, Ras activity in HGF1 fibroblasts showed higher levels than control in all respective time intervals suggesting mutant SOS1 remained active even under serum-starved conditions, leading to higher Ras activity in response to growth factor stimuli. We next studied how the SOS1 mutation altered signal transduction through the MAPK/ERK pathway. As shown in Fig. 2B, panel a (lanes 2–5), transient activation of ERK1/2 with increasing concentrations of EGF resulted in a dose-related increase in both control and HGF1 fibroblasts. The magnitude of ERK1/2 activation was at least 30% greater in HGF1 than in control fibroblasts at each respective dosage of EGF treatment (Fig. 2B, panel b). In untreated cells, whereas the ERK1 signal was weak but detectable only in HGF1 samples, the ERK2 signal alone showed ∼3-fold greater intensity in HGF1 than in control fibroblasts (Fig. 2B, panel a, lane 1). These data suggest Ras remains active and leads to a sustained activation of ERK1/2 signal in serum-starved HGF1 fibroblasts. Activation of ERK1/2 by EGF was evaluated in the presence of the selective pharmacological inhibitors AG1478 and PD98059 (32Liu W. Akhand A.A. Kato M. Yokoyama I. Miyata T. Kurokawa K. Uchida K. Nakashima I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The presence of PD98059 or AG1478 resulted in a similar degree of reduction on phospho-ERK signal in both cell types (Fig. 2C, panel a, lanes 1–4). The overall phospho-ERK1/2 level remained higher in HGF1 than in control fibroblasts (Fig. 2C, panel b). The duration of ERK activation was studied through the continued induction of EGF. In the presence of EGF, the phospho-ERK signal increased and peaked at the 1-h time point in both cell types (Fig. 2D). The signal gradually returned to basal levels after 6 h (Fig. 2D, panel a). Although the pattern of phospho-ERK response to EGF induction was similar in both cell types, the level was 50% higher in HGF1 than in control fibroblasts (Fig. 2D, panel b). The effect of PD98059 on the duration of EGF-induced ERK signaling is shown in Fig. 2E. Activation of ERK signaling was reduced in the presence of MEK inhibitor in both cell types (Fig. 2E, panel a). However, the pattern of reduction was different in HGF1 compared with control cells (Fig. 2E, panel b). After 20-min incubation with inhibitor, 30% of phospho-ERK remained in control fibroblasts, whereas >80% of phospho-ERK remained in HGF1 fibroblasts. The phospho-ERK signal was sustained up to 2 h in HGF1 but not in control fibroblasts. At 4 h, phospho-ERK decreased to basal levels in controls, however, significant levels of active ERK signal remained in HGF1 fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that, in the absence of growth factors, Ras together with its downstream ERK1/2 signaling remained active and sustained in HGF1 fibroblasts. Transient induction by EGF elicited a stronger response, both in magnitude and duration, indicating the functional consequence of the SOS1 mutation in HGF1 fibroblasts. Subcellular Localization of Mutant SOS1 in Gingival Fibroblasts—Because binding of growth factors to their receptors triggers the recruitment of the SOS1-Grb2 complex from the cytoplasm to plasma membrane (34Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), we examined the distribution of SOS1 in subcellular fractions. In HGF1 fibroblasts, the endogenous full-length SOS1 was found in both cytosol and membrane fractions, with only trace amounts of mutant SOS1 detected in the membrane fraction (data not shown). This is due to the low expression level of the endogenous mutant SOS1 in HGF1 fibroblasts (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the HA-tagged full-length and truncated SOS1 constructs were expressed in HeLa cells, which have higher transfection efficiency than primary gingival fibroblasts (data not shown). Under starving conditions, <40% of full-length SOS1 was distributed in the membrane/organelle fraction (Fig. 3A, lane 4), whereas >60% of truncated SOS1 was found in membrane/organelle fraction (lane 6). The SOS1(C) antibody, which only detects full-length SOS1, detected <30% of endogenous full-length SOS1 was distributed in the membrane/organelle fraction (compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 5 and 6). The identity of the additional (upper) band found in the membrane/organelle fraction (lanes 2 and 6) remains unknown. These results demonstrate the relative ratio of distribution is higher for truncated SOS1 in the membrane/organelle fraction. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that, under growth conditions, both wild-type and mutant SOS1 localized in the cytoplasm and cellular membrane (Fig. 3B, panels a and b, arrows). However, in serum-starved fibroblasts, whereas wild-type SOS1 restricted in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B, panel c), mutant SOS1 localized in both the cytoplasm and plasma membrane (Fig. 3B, panel d, arrows). These observations were supported by the immunostaining on the distribution of endogenous SOS1 in serum-starved fibroblasts (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that, in the absence of growth factors, truncated SOS1 localized in the plasma membrane even though it lacks the carboxyl-proline-rich domains.

We used the new technology of adaptive optics at the Keck II telescope to observe NGC 6240, a merger between two disk galaxies. Our high-resolution near-infrared images, combined with radio and x-ray positions, revealed the location and environment of two central supermassive black holes. Each is at the center of a rotating stellar disk, surrounded by a cloud of young star clusters. The brightest of these young clusters lie in the plane of each disk, but surprisingly are seen only on the disks' receding side."

Our results show that, among the eight phosphoryl groups experimentally detected, four are located at the flexible N terminus, and the rest are found at the tail domain, flanking the nuclear localization signal. Phosphorylation-mimicking mutations render a recombinant protein as active in chromatin decondensation as hyperphosphorylated NP isolated from Xenopus laevis eggs. Comparison of mutants in which the core and tail domains of the protein were independently or simultaneously “activated” indicates that activation or phosphorylation of both protein domains is required for NP to efficiently extract linker-type histones from chromatin.

The eukaryotic cell genome is packed as a fibrous superstructure known as chromatin. The dynamic structure of chromatin is reflected in the continuous modification of its three-dimensional structure, promoted by the activity of histone chaperones that induce the ordered deposition, removal, or exchange of histones (1Haushalter K.A.

BioEssays. 2007; 29: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). NP is a pentameric protein, built of identical 200 amino acid subunits each organized in two domains. The core domain, corresponding to the 120 N-terminal amino acids, is responsible for oligomerization and confers the protein an extreme thermal stability (9Hierro A. Arizmendi J.M. Bañuelos S. Prado A. Muga A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6408-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Its crystallographic structure has been solved (10Dutta S. Akey I.V. Dingwall C. Hartman K.L. Lane T.

The tail domain, which comprises the remaining 80 residues, harbors a segment rich in negatively charged residues (“poly-glu”) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and it is thought to adopt a natively disordered conformation (13Hierro A. Arizmendi J.M. De las Rivas J. Urbaneja M.A. Prado A. Muga A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1739-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NP has been proposed to, among other functions, assist the assembly of nucleosomes by modulating the interaction between histones and DNA (7Philpott A. Krude T. Laskey R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Frehlick L.J. Eirin-Lopez J.M. Ausio J. BioEssays. 2007; 29: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Laskey R.A.

It is the most abundant protein in Xenopus laevis eggs, where it binds histones H2A and H2B as a chaperone. The Xenopus sperm chromatin consists of a complex mixture of basic proteins known as sp1/2, sp3, sp4, sp5, and sp6, plus histones H3 and H4, whereas it is deficient in H2A and H2B. The NP chaperone activity would provide the H2A and H2B complement to the male pronucleus replacing the sperm nuclear basic protein immediately after fertilization (16Philpott A. Leno G.H. Cell. 1992; 69: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Prado A. Ramos I. Frehlick L.J. Muga A. Ausió J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Additionally, NP-mediated chromatin decondensation would be required for replication licensing of quiescent nuclei (19Gillespie P.J. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that this nuclear chaperone would also regulate chromatin condensation during apoptosis (20Lu Z. Zhang C. Zhai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2778-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and play a role in epigenetic processes (21Tamada H. Van Thuan N.V. Reed P. Nelson D. Katoku Kikyo N. Wudel J. Wakayama T. Kikyo N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 26: 1259-1271Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). NP activity is modulated through phosphorylation at multiple residues, both in the core and tail domains (15Dingwall C. Dilworth S.M. Black S.J. Kearsey S.E. Cox L.S. Laskey R.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The degree of phosphorylation increases during egg maturation, e.g. the average number of phosphate groups per monomer has been estimated to be three and seven to ten in the protein isolated from Xenopus oocytes and eggs, respectively (13Hierro A. Arizmendi J.M. De las Rivas J. Urbaneja M.A. Prado A. Muga A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1739-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The increased phosphorylation correlates with a higher decondensation activity: egg NP (eNP) decondenses sperm chromatin with a higher efficiency than oocyte NP (oNP) in vitro (13Hierro A. Arizmendi J.M. De las Rivas J. Urbaneja M.A. Prado A. Muga A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1739-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Leno G.H. Mills A.D. Philpott A. Laskey R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7253-7256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), so that the protein would exhibit its maximal activity at the time of fertilization. The ability of NP to bind and extract basic proteins from chromatin has previously been ascribed to the polyglutamic acidic tract of the tail domain (15Dingwall C. Dilworth S.M. Black S.J. Kearsey S.E. Cox L.S. Laskey R.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We have recently observed, however, that the phosphorylated core domain isolated from X. laevis eggs is able to bind sperm basic proteins and decondense chromatin (23Bañuelos S. Hierro A. Arizmendi J.M. Montoya G. Prado A. Muga A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) although less efficiently than full-length eNP. This finding suggests that the presence of both protein domains and/or their phosphorylation may be required for efficient decondensation. The relative contribution of these factors is so far unknown. Two parallel approaches have been used herein to address this question. On one hand, phosphorylation of eNP has been analyzed by phosphopeptide TiO2 enrichment in combination with mass spectrometry (MS). The information obtained by MS together with prediction software has been used in the second approach to generate artificially activated mutants of the protein in which putative phosphorylated residues have been replaced by aspartic acid. Because attempts to phosphorylate recombinant NP in vitro have not been successful so far, this approach provides a useful way to understand how phosphorylation activates the protein chromatin decondensation activity. Our results show that both the core and tail domains of eNP are phosphorylated and that phosphorylation-mimicking mutations at both protein domains render a mutant as active as eNP in chromatin decondensation, affinity, and specificity toward basic proteins, in contrast to the wild-type, non-phosphorylated recombinant protein. The choice of sites to be mutated in NP was guided by experimental data (see below and Refs. 13Hierro A. Arizmendi J.M. De las Rivas J. Urbaneja M.A. Prado A. Muga A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1739-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar and 23Bañuelos S. Hierro A. Arizmendi J.M. Montoya G. Prado A. Muga A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and prediction software (24Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). Mutations were made via PCR on a non-fusion clone of wild-type NP in the plasmid pET11b (13Hierro A. Arizmendi J.M. De las Rivas J. Urbaneja M.A. Prado A. Muga A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1739-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and checked by DNA sequencing. Mutant NP forms as well as recombinant wild-type NP were expressed for 15-20 h at 18 °C in BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were resuspended in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (β-glycerophosphate, molybdate, and vanadate) and protease inhibitors, and sonicated (13Hierro A. Arizmendi J.M. De las Rivas J. Urbaneja M.A. Prado A. Muga A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1739-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Purification involved a 20-min heating step, ultracentrifugation, and a sequence of chromatographic steps with hydroxyapatite, Mono Q, and Superdex 200 columns. Because mutations compromise NP thermal stability, heating took place at different temperatures: 80, 65, 60, and 50 °C for wild-type, NP5D, NP8D, and NP13D, respectively. Mutant NPs were more prone to be degraded as well, thus some preparations contained degradation products (always <10% of the total protein, as estimated by SDS-PAGE and densitometric analysis of the purified samples). Natural NP from X. laevis eggs was obtained as described previously (13Hierro A. Arizmendi J.M. De las Rivas J. Urbaneja M.A. Prado A. Muga A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1739-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In-gel Digestion—eNP was visualized in SDS-PAGE by Coomassie Blue staining and in-gel-digested using trypsin. Excised protein bands were cut out and in-gel-digested using trypsin as previously described (25Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7735) Google Scholar). In-solution Digestion in 2 m Urea—eNP was dissolved in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, 4 m urea. Reduction was performed by addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 5 mm and incubation at 25 °C for 1 h. Subsequent alkylation by 15 mm iodoacetamide was performed for 1 h in the dark. The solution was diluted to 2 m urea using NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, and, after trypsin addition (enzyme:protein, 1:80, w/w), the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. In-solution Digestion in 0.2% Rapigest—eNP was dissolved in 50 mm NH4HCO3 containing 0.2% Rapigest™ (Waters), followed by reduction, alkylation, and subsequent digestion with trypsin or chymotrypsin (enzyme:protein, 1:80, w/w) at 37 °C for 18 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of HCl (final concentration, 50 mm, pH ≤ 2), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and finally centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The digest was stored at -20 °C. TiO2 microcolumns were prepared and used as previously described (25Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7735) Google Scholar). TiO2 was packed in a gel loader tip containing C8 resin to retain the TiO2 beads, to a column length of ≈3 mm. NP digest was loaded onto the TiO2 column in 100 mg/ml dihydroxybenzoic (DHB) acid, 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was washed with 10 μl of DHB solution and 20 μl of 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Bound peptides were eluted using 2.5 μl of NH4OH, pH 10.5. The eluate was acidified by addition of 5% trifluoroacetic acid, and 0.5 μl was spotted onto the MALDI target following addition of 0.5 μl of 20 mg/ml DHB matrix in 70% acetonitrile, 1% phosphoric acid. Inclusion of 1% phosphoric acid in the MALDI matrix solution increases the relative abundance of multiphosphorylated peptides (26Larsen M.R. Thingholm T.E. Jensen O.N. Roepstorff P. Jørgensen T.J.D. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). The eluate was acidified with 5 μl of 10% acetic acid for the LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Peptides eluted from the TiO2 microcolumns were diluted in 10 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 and incubated with previously washed and equilibrated alkaline phosphatase magnetic beads at 37 °C for 45 min. The beads were then separated from the supernatant using a magnetic rack. The recovered supernatant was acidified by addition of 5% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto an R2 POROS microcolumn. The sample was eluted with 0.5 μl of DHB matrix solution (20 mg/ml DHB in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The eluate was spotted directly onto the MALDI target. MALDI-TOF MS was performed using a Voyager Elite DE STR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). All spectra were acquired in positive ion reflector mode. Ions were generated by irradiation of analyte-matrix deposits with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) and analyzed with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Analyte-matrix samples were prepared by the dried-droplet method using DHB matrix solution. Phosphoric acid (1%) was included in the matrix solution for analysis of phosphorylated peptides (27Kjellstrom S. Jensen O.N. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 5109-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Mass spectra were externally calibrated in the m/z range of 700-4000 using peptides generated by tryptic digestion of bovine β-lactoglobulin. MALDI tandem mass spectra were recorded on a MALDI-QTOF tandem mass spectrometer (Ultima HT, Waters//Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) experiments were performed using argon as the collision gas and applying a collision energy in the range of 50-120 eV to fragment singly protonated peptide ions. Polyethylene glycol was used for external calibration (m/z 400-4000). Data analysis was carried out using either the MoverZ software (Proteometrics) or the software MassLynx 3.5. Sequence analysis and peptide assignment were accomplished with GPMAW software. Nano-LC-ESI-MS analysis was performed in a QTOF Ultima mass spectrometer (Waters/Micromass UK Ltd., Manchester, UK) using automated data-dependent acquisition. A nanoflow high-performance liquid chromatography system (Ultimate, Switchos2, Famos, LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was used for chromatographic separation of the peptide mixture prior to MS detection. The peptides were concentrated and desalted on a precolumn (75-μm inner diameter, 360-μm outer diameter, Zorbax® SB-C18 3.5 μm, Agilent, Wilmington, DE) and eluted at 200 nl/min by an acetonitrile gradient (2%/min) onto an analytical column (50-μm inner diameter, 360-μm outer diameter, Zorbax® SB-C18 3.5 μm, Agilent). An MS-TOF survey spectrum was recorded for 1 s. The three most abundant ions present in the survey spectrum were automatically mass-selected and fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (4 s per MS/MS spectrum). The MS/MS data were converted to a pkl file format using the MassLynx 3.5 proteinLynx software, and the resulting pkl file was searched against the NP sequence using an in-house Mascot server (version 1.8, Matrix Sciences, London, UK). Demembranated sperm nuclei from X. laevis were prepared as described previously (28Lohka M.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 367-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear decondensation assay was performed as reported (29Ramos I. Prado A. Finn R.M. Muga A. Ausió J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8274-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 × 105 sperm nuclei (1.4 μg) were incubated in a 33-μl final volume containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, in the presence of different NP concentrations. Aliquots were taken at 3 and 17 min and diluted with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to stain the DNA, and the unfixed samples were immediately photographed in an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Eclipse TS100, Nikon), using a 10× objective and a charge-coupled device camera (CoolSNAPcf, Roper Scientific). To analyze the chromatin proteins solubilized by NP, sperm or chicken erythrocyte nuclei (7 μg) were incubated with 32 μm NP in the above buffer, final volume 50 μl. Upon incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the samples were centrifuged (14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), washed with 50 μl of buffer, and centrifuged once more. The resulting supernatants, containing NP and associated basic proteins, were precipitated with 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Proteins were extracted from the pellets with 0.4 n HCl and treated as the supernatants. Both fractions were analyzed by acetic acid/urea/Triton X-100 PAGE as previously described (23Bañuelos S. Hierro A. Arizmendi J.M. Montoya G. Prado A. Muga A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When necessary NP13D was denatured in 5 m urea (overnight, 4 °C), and the assay was performed as with native NP at a final urea concentration of 4.3 m. Titrations with different concentrations of NP were performed using this method, and the amount of extracted H5 was quantitated by densitometry of the gel bands with a gel scanner G-800 and the Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. Each data point is an average of at least two experiments. Mass Spectrometry—Hyperphosphorylation of NP affects both protein domains. Proteolytic digestion of eNP following standard in-gel protocols gives poor results (Fig. 1A) most likely due to the high stability and compact structure of the protein that may hinder protease performance. To overcome this problem, NP was digested in the presence of either 2 m urea (Fig. 1B), or Rapigest™ (Waters), a reagent that solubilizes proteins to make them more susceptible to enzymatic proteolysis (Fig. 1C). The results show that more peptides with higher intensities are detected by MALDI-MS when Rapigest™ is used as denaturing agent. Phosphorylated peptide enrichment was achieved by loading the in-solution Rapigest™-treated tryptic peptide mixture onto a TiO2 microcolumn. Analysis of the retained peptides by MALDI-TOF MS allowed the initial identification by peptide mass fingerprint of 10 phosphopeptide candidates by their 79.96-Da mass increments per phosphate moiety relative to the unmodified peptides (Fig. 2A). Several doubly and triply phosphorylated peptides were detected, all of them being assigned to variants of the sequence between residues 168 and 188 (168KKLDKEDESSEEDSPTKKGKG188) as a consequence of cleavage sites missed by trypsin (Table 1). The missed cleavage observed at Lys172, occurring in all identified phosphopeptides, could be due to the presence of either acidic residues at both sides of this residue or to adjacent lysines (Lys166-Lys167 and Lys168-Lys169) that could hinder the proteolytic activity of trypsin at those sites.FIGURE 2MALDI-TOF-MS spectra of the TiO2-enriched fraction of tryptic digest of eNP (A) and the TiO2-enriched fraction of eNP digested with chymotrypsin (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Phosphopeptides recovered by TiO2 enrichment from the tryptic digest of eNP and detected by MALDI-TOF analysism/zSequenceNumber of phosphorylated (PO4) sites1948.6170LDKEDESSEEDSPTK18431996.7170LDKEDESSEEDSPTKK185/169KLDKEDESSEEDSPTK18422059.6170LDKEDESSEEDSPTKK185/169KLDKEDESSEEDSPTK184 (-H2O)32076.6170LDKEDESSEEDSPTKK185/169KLDKEDESSEEDSPTK18432124.8169KLDKEDESSEEDSPTKK185/168KKLDKEDESSEEDSPTK18422133.7170LDKEDESSEEDSPTKKG18632204.8169KLDKEDESSEEDSPTKK185/168KKLDKEDESSEEDSPTK18432261.8170LDKEDESSEEDSPTKKGK187/169KLDKEDESSEEDSPTKKG18632332.9168KKLDKEDESSEEDSPTKK18532389.9169KLDKEDESSEEDSPTKKGK18732446.9169KLDKEDESSEEDSPTKKGKG1883 Open table in a new tab Although the 168KKLDKEDESSEEDSPTKKGKG188 sequence contains four putative phosphorylation sites (Ser176, Ser177, Ser181, and Thr183), only doubly and triply phosphorylated peptides were detected, indicating that distinct populations with different levels of phosphorylation coexist in the purified NP solution. Moreover, it cannot be ruled out that peptides with four phosphoryl groups could also be present but not detected by MS, because they could be suppressed in the ionization process. Due to the low fragmentation efficiency observed in the MALDI-QTOF-MS/MS analysis, the TiO2-enriched fraction was also analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Six phosphopeptides derived (due to missed cleavages) from the sequence 168KKLDKEDESSEEDSPTKKGK187, and 3 from the sequence 141EEEEDQESPPKAVK154, not detected by MALDI-TOF analysis, were observed. Fragmentation of peptide 169KLDKEDESSEEDSPTK184 allowed the assignment of the phosphorylation sites Ser176 and Ser177. The third phosphorylation site was most plausibly assigned to Ser181, although it was not possible to exclude alternative phosphorylation at Thr183 (data not shown). In addition, fragmentation of the singly phosphorylated peptide 141EEEEDQESPPKAVK154, detected by LC-ESI-MS/MS, revealed phosphorylation at Ser148 (data not shown). In an attempt to find additional phosphorylation sites, NP was digested with chymotrypsin, and the derived peptides were analyzed as described above (Fig. 2B). Peptide mass mapping allowed initial identification of six candidate phosphopeptides, two doubly phosphorylated, two triply phosphorylated, and two with four phosphoryl groups (Table 2). Furthermore, a mass increase of 42 Da was observed for these phosphorylated peptides, suggesting N-acetylation. Treatment with phosphatase alkaline, which induces a mass decrease of 79.96 Da per phosphate moiety, yielded two peptides, respectively at m/z 1660.9 and at m/z 1702.9, separated by a mass shift of 42 Da (Fig. 3). These two peptides were sequenced by MALDI-Q-TOF MS/MS, confirming the sequences 1ASTVSNTSKLEKPVSL16 and acetyl-1ASTVSNTSKLEKPVSL16 (Fig. 3). A missed cleavage in Leu10 suggests that the presence of a glutamic acid in position 11 next to the cleavage site could affect performance of chymotrypsin on Leu10. Peptides at m/z 1339.3 and m/z 1396.3 are observed in the TiO2 eluate and the phosphatase alkaline treated fraction, indicating that these peptides are not phosphorylated. The assignment of the four phosphorylations in the sequence 1ASTVSNTSKLEKPVSL16 where six potential phosphorylated sites are present, could not be confirmed either by MALDI-QTOF-MS/MS analysis or by LC-ESI-MS/MS, because the fragmentation of the peptide was very poor. Only the four neutral losses corresponding to four phosphoryl groups present in the sequence were clearly detectable.TABLE 2Phosphopeptides recovered by TiO2 enrichment from the chymotryptic digest of eNP and detected by MALDI-TOF analysism/zSequenceNumber of phosphorylated (PO4) sites1820.41ASTVSNTSKLEKPVSL1621862.81Acetyl-ASTVSNTSKLEKPVSL1621900.81ASTVSNTSKLEKPVSL1631942.81Acetyl-ASTVSNTSKLEKPVSL1631980.71ASTVSNTSKLEKPVSL1642022.81Acetyl-ASTVSNTSKLEKPVSL1642200.01ASTVSNTSKLEKPVSLIW1832279.91ASTVSNTSKLEKPVSLIW184 Open table in a new tab Design of the Activated Mutants—Sequence coverage of the MS analysis using chymotrypsin and trypsin is 71 and 51%, respectively (Fig. 4). This means that 19 putative phosphorylation sites out of the theoretically 26 phosphorylatable residues could be detected. The fact that only 8 phosphorylated sites (9 if we consider phosphorylation of Thr183) are experimentally detected does not rule out the existence of more phosphorylation sites. For instance, residue Tyr123, whose dephosphorylation has been recently associated with apoptosis (20Lu Z. Zhang C. Zhai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2778-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; Tyr124 according to their sequence numbering), is located within a non-covered sequence, and other phosphorylated residues within the covered regions might not be detected considering the highly heterogeneous phosphorylation degree of eNP. Therefore, mutants have been designed based on MS data, prediction software (23Bañuelos S. Hierro A. Arizmendi J.M. Montoya G. Prado A. Muga A. J. Mol.

Previous chemical and MS analyses showing that eNP contains an average of 7-10 phosphoryl groups (13Hierro A. Arizmendi J.M. De las Rivas J. Urbaneja M.A. Prado A. Muga A. Eur. J.

Rapid decay of trp leader RNA, which is required to release the TRAP complex and maintain a sufficient supply of free TRAP, is mediated by polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). Using purified B. subtilis PNPase, we showed that, when TRAP was present, PNPase binding to the 3′ end of trp leader RNA and PNPase digestion of trp leader RNA from the 3′ end were inefficient. These results suggested that initiation of trp leader RNA may begin with an endonuclease cleavage upstream of the transcription terminator structure. Such cleavage was observed in vivo. Mutagenesis of nucleotides at the cleavage site abolished processing and resulted in a 4-fold increase in trp leader RNA half-life. This is the first mapping of a decay-initiating endonuclease cleavage site on a native B. subtilis RNA.

Mutagenesis of nucleotides at the cleavage site abolished processing and resulted in a 4-fold increase in trp leader RNA half-life. This is the first mapping of a decay-initiating endonuclease cleavage site on a native B. subtilis RNA. We have identified four 3′-to-5′ exoribonucleases of Bacillus subtilis that can be involved in the decay of mRNA (1Oussenko I.A. Abe T. Ujiie H. Muto A. Bechhofer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One of these, PNPase, 2The abbreviations used are: PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase; nt, nucleotide(s); TRAP, trp RNA-binding attenuation protein. a processive enzyme that degrades RNA phosphorolytically, was shown earlier to be the major exonucleolytic activity in B. subtilis extracts (2Deutscher M.P. Reuven N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3277-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and we have shown more recently that PNPase is the main enzyme responsible for mRNA turnover in vivo (1Oussenko I.A. Abe T. Ujiie H. Muto A. Bechhofer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3Wang W. Bechhofer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2375-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A strain with a disruption of the pnpA gene, encoding PNPase, is viable but has a number of phenotypic defects including an inability to regulate transcription of the trp operon (4Deikus G. Babitzke P. Bechhofer D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2747-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In a wild-type strain, the B. subtilis trp operon is regulated at the level of transcription termination (5Babitzke P. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5795-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6Henkin T.M. Yanofsky C. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 700-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). When the supply of intracellular tryptophan is low, the trp operon genes are transcribed from a constitutive promoter, and more tryptophan is made. In the presence of ample tryptophan, transcription from this promoter terminates after transcribing the 139-nucleotide (nt) trp leader RNA. Termination is mediated by the trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP) complex. TRAP is activated by tryptophan itself and binds with high affinity as an 11-mer to 11 trinucleotide repeats located between nt 36 and 91 of the trp leader sequence (Fig. 1B). Binding of the TRAP complex allows a stem-loop transcription terminator structure to form, which consists of nt 108–133 of the trp leader sequence. In the absence of TRAP binding (i.e. when TRAP is not bound by excess tryptophan), an antiterminator structure forms that precludes formation of the terminator structure, and transcription proceeds into the trp structural genes (Fig. 1A). For the trp system to be regulated by TRAP, sufficient free TRAP complex needs to be present to bind to newly made trp leader RNA, which is constitutively transcribed from the trp promoter. We found recently that the TRAP complex is released from trp leader RNA by rapid degradation of trp leader RNA (4Deikus G. Babitzke P. Bechhofer D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2747-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This degradation is accomplished by PNPase, whereas other 3′-to-5′ exoribonucleases cannot digest RNA that is TRAP-bound, resulting in accumulation in a pnpA strain of an RNA fragment that contains trp leader nt 1–95. Thus, in a pnpA mutant, release of the TRAP complex from trp leader RNA is inefficient, leading to an insufficient amount of free TRAP to regulate trp transcription and an overexpression of trp operon structural genes. The small size of trp leader RNA makes it an ideal model to study RNA turnover. (In this report, “trp leader RNA” refers to the 139-nt RNA that is the result of transcription termination in the trp leader sequence.) trp leader RNA is rapidly degraded in a wild-type strain with a half-life of about 1 min, significantly shorter than the average half-life of B. subtilis mRNAs (7Hambraeus G. von Wachtfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 269: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The presence of stem-loop structures at the 5′ and 3′ ends of trp leader RNA (Fig. 1B), as well as the binding of a large portion of the internal sequence by the TRAP complex, makes it particularly suitable as an object of study, as one would predict that there are few available internal sites in this molecule at which decay could initiate. Because it was known from our previous study that PNPase is responsible for trp leader RNA degradation, we studied PNPase activity on trp leader RNA in vitro. These experiments led to a hypothesis concerning initiation of trp leader RNA turnover in vivo, which was confirmed by analysis of decay of mutant trp leader RNA. Bacterial Strains—The B. subtilis strain designated BG1, which is trpC2 thr-5, was the source of genomic DNA for cloning the PNPase coding sequence and the trp leader region. BG1 was also the host for experiments in vivo. A deletion strain that was missing the trp leader region was constructed by transformation of BG1 with plasmid pGD12 (see below) and integration at the trp locus with selection for spectinomycin resistance (200 μg/ml). E. coli strain DH5α (8Grant S.G. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Hanahan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4645-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) was the host for construction of pGD5. XL1-Blue cells (9Bullock W.O. Fernandex J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-379Google Scholar) were used for construction of pNP21 and pGD7. BL21(DE3)plysS (Invitrogen) carrying pNP21, designated EG763, was used for overexpression of His-tagged PNPase. A control strain, EG764, carried the pET15b vector alone. The host for construction of pGD12 was the StrataClone SoloPack strain (Stratagene). Plasmids—For overexpression of B. subtilis PNPase, the pnpA coding sequence was amplified using PCR primers that contained NdeI and BamHI sites. The PCR fragment was cloned into pET15b (Novagen), giving plasmid pNP21. For cloning of the trp leader, a 340-base pair fragment, starting from codon 84 of the aroH coding sequence until 53 bp downstream of the trp leader transcription terminator sequence, was amplified using PCR primers that contained SphI and EcoRI sites, and the PCR fragment was cloned into pSI45 (10Gollnick P. Ishino S. Kuroda M.I. Henner D.J. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8726-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) yielding pGD5. Plasmid pGD5 also contained the mtrAB operon (mtrB encodes TRAP). To mutagenize the trp leader RNA endonuclease cleavage site, two PCR fragments were generated. One fragment, which included the last 120 bp of the aroH coding sequence, was amplified with PCR primers containing an SphI site and a NotI site (the NotI site constituted the changed nucleotides at the trp leader RNA cleavage site). The second fragment, which included the first 80 bp of the trpE coding sequence, was amplified with PCR primers containing an EcoRI site and a NotI site. These fragments were annealed and amplified using the SphI- and EcoRI-containing primers, and the resulting PCR fragment was used to replace the wild-type trp leader DNA fragment of pGD5, giving pGD7. For experiments in which mutant trp leader RNA was analyzed in vivo, the wild-type trp leader region of the host was deleted. For this, plasmid pGD12 was constructed. Three PCR fragments were prepared. The first PCR fragment contained the final 460 bp of the aroB coding sequence and extended 190 bp into the aroH coding sequence. The downstream primer included 52 nucleotides that were complementary to the 5′ end of the second PCR fragment. The second PCR fragment contained the spectinomycin-resistance gene that is carried on plasmid pJL62 (11LeDeaux J.R. Grossman A.D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The third PCR fragment contained bp 120–816 of the trpE coding sequence and included 29 nucleotides that were complementary to the 3′ end of the second PCR fragment. These three fragments were annealed, amplified, and the resulting 2.7-kbp fragment was cloned into the pSC-A vector (Stratagene) giving plasmid pGD12. (It should be noted that this cloning could only be achieved when transformed cells were grown at 30 °C rather than 37 °C. This region of the chromosome seems to be detrimental to E. coli when present in high copy.) pGD12 DNA was linearized with BstBI and used to transform BG1. The resulting strain, which had a substitution of a spectinomycin-resistance gene for the trp leader region, was used in the experiments shown in Fig. 6. Purification of PNPase—E. coli strains EG763 and EG764 were grown overnight at 37 °C in 2× YT medium (1% yeast extract, 2% tryptone, 1% NaCl) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. 10 ml of the overnight culture was added to 1 liter of 2× YT medium, and the culture was grown to an A600 of 0.6. PNPase expression was induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm followed by 30 min further incubation. His-tagged protein was isolated as described (12Kagedal L. Janson J.-C. Rydén L. Protein Purification. Wiley-VCH, New York1998: 311-343Google Scholar) using a HisTrap HP column (Amersham Biosciences). The His tag was removed from 1 mg of protein by thrombin cleavage followed by removal of thrombin and thrombin cleavage product according to standard protocols (Novagen). Protein was applied to a HisTrap HP column a second time, and flow-through fractions were collected, concentrated, and assayed for purity and phosphorolytic activity. Purified PNPase was stored at –20 °C as a 1 mg/ml stock in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol. To confirm that the His tag had been completely removed, aliquots of purified PNPase were probed by Western blotting using an anti-His6 antibody. The pET15b-containing strain EG764 was treated in parallel, and no PNPase activity was detectable. Assay of PNPase Activities—Uniformly labeled trp leader RNA was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase transcription (Ambion T7 MAXIscript kit) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP of a PCR fragment that contained the trp leader sequence, with a T7 promoter included in the upstream primer. The transcription product was purified from a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described (13Alberta J.A. Rundell K. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4532-4538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a diffusion buffer that contained 1 m ammonium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% SDS. Degradation of uniformly labeled RNA substrates to dinucleotides was assayed by thin-layer chromatography developed in 1 m LiCl. Degradation reactions contained 0.5 nm labeled RNA substrate and 2.5 nm purified PNPase and were done in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5% glycerol, with or without 1 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm sodium phosphate. Incubation was for 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 5 mm. For PNPase binding and degradation assays, 5′-end-labeled trp leader RNA was prepared. Unlabeled (∼10 μg) trp leader RNA was synthesized using the Ambion T7 MEGAscript kit and was purified from a gel as described above. The 5′ end of the RNA was dephosphorylated using calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and then labeled using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP. Labeled RNA product was gel-purified. In binding reactions, 0.45 nm unlabeled trp leader RNA and 0.05 nm labeled trp leader RNA were incubated at 37 °C with different PNPase concentrations in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm tryptophan. In PNPase binding experiments with TRAP present, trp leader RNA was preincubated for 15 min at room temperature with 37.5 nm TRAP. To visualize migration of samples on native 10% polyacrylamide gels as described (14Yakhnin A.V. Trimble J.J. Chiaro C.R. Babitzke P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4519-4524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), 0.001% xylene cyanol was included during the reaction; this did not interfere with binding. Xylene cyanol was also present in the degradation assays (see below). For PNPase degradation reactions, binding was allowed to occur as described above, and the phosphorolysis reaction was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to 1 mm and sodium phosphate to 2 mm. The degradation reactions (200 μl) contained 0.45 nm unlabeled trp leader RNA, 0.05 nm 5′-end-labeled trp leader RNA, and 2.5 nm PNPase. 20-μl aliquots were removed at different time points, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to 5 mm. Samples were put immediately on dry ice. An equal volume of Ambion gel loading buffer was added, and samples were loaded on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Quantitation of band shifts and decay products was done with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager instrument (GE Healthcare). For band shifts, the fraction of RNA bound was measured by the disappearance of unbound RNA (where TRAP was not present) or of RNA-TRAP complex (where TRAP was present). To determine the apparent dissociation constant, Kapp, theoretical curves were generated according to the formula: RNAbound = (R + P + Kapp)/(2 × R) – ([R + P + Kapp]2 – 4 × P × R)0.5/(2 × R) (where P = PNPase concentration, R = RNA concentration). The Kapp value was determined from the best fit of the theoretical curve to the experimental data. Fitting was done using the Solver feature of Microsoft Excel. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was isolated from B. subtilis strains as described (4Deikus G. Babitzke P. Bechhofer D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2747-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Measurement of trp leader RNA half-life after the addition of rifampicin to 150 μg/ml was as described (4Deikus G. Babitzke P. Bechhofer D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2747-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To control for RNA loading in Northern blot analyses, membranes were stripped and probed for 5 S rRNA as described (15Sharp J.S. Bechhofer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5372-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The size markers were end-labeled fragments of TaqI-digested plasmid pSE420 (16Brosius J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotides were used as probes. Quantitation of mRNA half-life was determined by a linear regression analysis of percent RNA remaining versus time. The B. subtilis pnpA coding sequence was cloned in the pET15b vector for overexpression in E. coli, yielding PNPase protein containing an N-terminal His tag and thrombin cleavage site (see “Experimental Procedures”). The tag was cleaved, and purified B. subtilis PNPase was judged >95% pure by Coomassie R staining (Fig. 2A). To test for phosphate-dependent activity of the purified enzyme, uniformly labeled trp leader RNA was incubated with PNPase with or without Mg2+ and inorganic phosphate. The products were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and are shown in Fig. 2B. Degradation of the substrate to diphosphate nucleosides was dependent on the presence of Mg2+ and Pi. A slight amount of product was observed in the presence of Mg2+ without added Pi, which was likely due to trace amounts of Pi in the reaction buffer components. This small amount of activity, however, was less than 4% of the activity with Pi present and thus did not interfere with subsequent analyses. A binding assay was developed in which the binding of PNPase to trp leader RNA could be assessed quantitatively. The wild-type trp leader RNA for these experiments consisted of the 139 nt of the trp leader sequence, with an additional three G residues at the 5′ end to enhance in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. This RNA was called “trp RNA.” (The additional three G residues are not shown in Fig. 1, to maintain the conventional trp leader numbering.) trp RNA was labeled at the 5′ end and tested for binding by PNPase with increasing concentrations of the enzyme (Fig. 2C). The binding assay was done in the absence of Mg2+ and Pi to prevent degradation of the substrate. With increasing concentrations of PNPase, increasing amounts of the trp RNA shifted to slower migrating species, indicating PNPase binding (Fig. 2C). The multiple bands that were observed upon PNPase binding were due to the mixture of PNPase forms that were present in the purified preparation, as seen in a nondenaturing protein gel (data not shown). Although the active form of PNPase in the cell is a trimer (17Littauer U.Z. Soreq H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1980: 517-553Google Scholar), monomer, dimer, and trimer forms could be observed in vitro. For the apparent dissociation constant (Kapp) calculations, we assumed that each of these forms bind RNA with approximately the same affinity. A Kapp for PNPase binding was determined by measuring the disappearance of the trp RNA band, which was 1.0 ± 0.2 nm (Fig. 3A). The addition of TRAP to the PNPase binding assay resulted in the appearance of a TRAP-bound species in addition to higher forms containing TRAP and PNPase (Fig. 2D). For the binding experiments that included TRAP, a concentration of TRAP was used (37.5 nm) that was determined to be saturating for binding under our assay conditions. In repeated experiments (not shown), the migration of the bound RNA was slightly slower when PNPase and TRAP were present than when PNPase alone was present. This indicates that both PNPase and TRAP can bind to the same trp leader RNA molecule. A Kapp for PNPase binding when TRAP was prebound was determined by measuring the disappearance of the TRAP-trp RNA complex. The calculated Kapp in this case was 9.7 ± 0.1 nm (Fig. 3A). This large difference in Kapp with and without TRAP present was likely because of the 3′-proximal terminator structure that formed when TRAP was bound, which would inhibit binding of PNPase at the 3′ end because there would be only 6 unpaired nt at the 3′ end. To confirm this hypothesis, a mutant form of trp RNA was synthesized in which the three G residues near the 3′ end (nt 133–135 in Fig. 1B) were changed to C residues, giving “trp CCC RNA.” This change was predicted to drastically reduce the free energy of the 3′-terminal structure (including 3 nt on either side of the predicted stem-loop) from a ΔG0 of –13.0 kcal mol–1 for wild-type trp leader RNA to a ΔG0 of –2.2 kcal mol–1 for trp CCC RNA. Indeed, the Kapp for PNPase binding to trp CCC RNA was similar in the presence or absence of TRAP (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrated that the effect of TRAP on PNPase binding was not due to the presence of TRAP per se but was an indirect effect caused by formation of the terminator structure. In addition to binding assays, degradation assays were performed. In these assays, the RNA-protein complex (RNA + PNPase or RNA + TRAP + PNPase) was allowed to form followed by the addition of Mg2+ and Pi to activate PNPase exonuclease activity. The data in Fig. 4A show that, in the absence of TRAP, degradation of trp RNA proceeded rapidly, with over 90% of the full-length RNA degraded in less than 5 min. In the presence of TRAP, however, decay was much slower. About 70% of the full-length RNA was still present even after 15 min incubation. The results of the degradation assay on trp RNA in the presence of TRAP reflected those of the binding assay. When TRAP was present, only about 60% of trp RNA was bound by PNPase even after extended incubation times (Fig. 3A). Thus, the capacity of PNPase to degrade trp RNA when it was bound by TRAP appeared to reflect the capacity to bind substrate, which was affected by the presence of the terminator structure. This was confirmed by a degradation assay of the trp CCC RNA, which could not form a stable terminator structure. PNPase could fully and rapidly degrade the trp CCC RNA even in the presence of TRAP (Fig. 4B). The results thus far suggested that PNPase, acting alone, was incapable of rapidly degrading trp leader RNA. We considered the possibility that rapid decay of trp leader RNA in vivo was made possible by the addition of a poly(A) tail. A substrate that had 17 A residues at the 3′ end, termed “trp (A)17 RNA,” was prepared and tested for binding and decay by PNPase. Unlike the case of trp RNA, binding of PNPase to trp (A)17 RNA was unaffected by the presence of TRAP (Fig. 3C). The Kapp for PNPase binding was calculated to be 0.6 ± 0.2 nm in the absence of TRAP and 0.7 ± 0.1 nm in the presence of TRAP. Clearly, relocation of the 3′ end distal to the transcription terminator structure allowed efficient PNPase binding. On the other hand, the degradation assay (Fig. 4C) showed that although PNPase could bind trp (A)17 RNA well, it could not degrade this substrate past the terminator structure that was formed when TRAP was present. A processing product of ∼142 nt appeared shortly after initiation of the decay reaction, and this product represented a large fraction (60%) of the total full-length RNA. This product was consistent with a block to PNPase at the base of the terminator structure. When the substrate with the (A)17 tail was provided with the GGG → CCC change in the terminator structure, to give “trp CCC (A)17 RNA,” no processing product was observed (Fig. 4D). These results demonstrated that PNPase was incapable of completely degrading a substrate that had a strong terminator structure, even if a poly(A) tail was provided. The indication was that rapid decay of trp leader RNA in vivo could not be effected by attack from the native 3′ end. A likely explanation for the ability of PNPase to rapidly degrade trp leader RNA in vivo was that exonucleolytic decay was preceded by endonuclease cleavage upstream of the terminator structure. If so, it should be possible to detect the products of such cleavage. We hypothesized that a reasonable location for such endonucleolytic cleavage would be in the region between the TRAP binding site and the terminator structure (Fig. 5A). Cleavage in this region would generate an upstream fragment of about 100 nt, which would be degraded by PNPase, and a downstream fragment of about 40 nt. Northern blot analysis of trp leader RNA in a wild-type strain, grown in the presence of tryptophan, hinted at such an endonucleolytic cleavage (data not shown), but the level of trp leader RNA in this strain was too low to reliably detect decay intermediates. Therefore, a high-copy plasmid, pGD5, was constructed that contained the trp promoter and leader region sequence, as well as the TRAP-encoding gene to provide sufficient TRAP complex (see “Experimental Procedures”). Total RNA was isolated from the pGD5-containing strain that had been grown in the presence of tryptophan. Northern blot analysis of this RNA was performed using an “upstream probe” that was complementary to nt 74–99 of the trp leader RNA and a “downstream probe” that was complementary to nt 99–125 (Fig. 5A). A strong full-length RNA band (139 nt) was detected by both probes (Fig. 5, B and C). The upstream probe detected, in addition, a band that was ∼100 nt; the downstream probe detected a group of bands centered at ∼40 nt. The sizes of these bands were confirmed by Northern blot analysis of these samples run on a high-resolution (sequencing) gel (data not shown). The fact that the sum of the sizes of the different bands detected by the two probes added up to the size of the full-length trp leader RNA suggested strongly that endonucleolytic cleavage was occurring in the region between the TRAP binding site and the terminator structure. The single-stranded region between the TRAP binding site and the terminator stem-loop structure (i.e. nt 93–107) is AU-rich, containing the sequence: CAUUAUGUUUAUUCU (nt 100 is underlined). To test whether the AU-rich sequence of this region was at least partly responsible for recognition by the putative endonuclease, a mutant version of pGD5 was constructed that had this sequence changed to eliminate many of the A and U residues around nt 100 as follows: CAUGCGGCCGCUUCU (changed nucleotides are underlined; the changed sequence constitutes a NotI restriction endonuclease site). This gave plasmid pGD7. Northern blot analysis of this RNA (Fig. 6A) showed that the wild-type ∼100-nt band detected by the upstream probe and the wild-type ∼40-nt group of bands detected by the downstream probe were no longer observed for the mutant trp leader RNA. (The band running below full-length trp leader RNA and detected by the upstream probe was also present, to a lesser degree, in the strain carrying pGD5. This may represent an alternative endonuclease cleavage site that is not affected by the change in sequence.) This experiment provided strong evidence that an endonuclease recognizes this AU-rich sequence, perhaps in the context of the neighboring structural elements. If our hypothesis that trp leader RNA decay initiates with endonuclease cleavage at around nt 100 was correct, then we predicted that mutagenesis of the endonuclease target site would result in increased trp leader RNA half-life. To test this, Northern blot analysis of decay of wild-type and mutant trp leader RNA encoded by pGD5 and pGD7, respectively, was performed using the upstream oligonucleotide probe. The results (Fig. 6, B and C) showed clearly that, indeed, elimination of the endonuclease recognition site had resulted in a dramatic increase in mRNA half-life. Quantitation of the results (average of three experiments) showed that the wild-type trp leader RNA half-life was 2.7 ± 0.3 min and the mutant trp leader RNA half-life was 10.2 ± 1.6 min. The results presented here are the first binding studies of a purified intracellular exoribonuclease from B. subtilis. Rather than focusing on the biochemical properties of B. subtilis PNPase, which, given the high sequence conservation of PNPases, are likely to be similar to others that have been studied in detail (17Littauer U.Z. Soreq H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1980: 517-553Google Scholar), the goal here was to determine the mechanism for rapid degradation of trp leader RNA, inasmuch as such rapid decay is a requirement of trp operon regulation. Mackie and colleagues (18Stickney L.M. Hankins J.S. Miao X. Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7214-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) determined that the Kapp for binding of E. coli PNPase to an unstructured 3′ end was 1.4 nm. Similarly, we determined a Kapp for binding of B. subtilis PNPase to trp leader RNA, in the absence of TRAP, to be 1.0 nm (Fig. 3A). The Kapp value for PNPase binding to trp leader RNA increased almost 10-fold when TRAP was present, and we demonstrated that this was due to formation of the 3′ terminator structure. We believe this is the first time that the quantitative effect of 3′-terminal secondary structure on PNPase binding has been determined. Although the addition of a poly(A) tail to E. coli RNAs has been shown to increase lability in vivo (19Cohen S.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 829-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we observed in vitro that addition of a poly(A) tail resulted only in an increase in binding but did not aid in the turnover of upstream trp leader RNA, which was TRAP-bound (Fig. 4C). This result suggests that provision of a poly(A) tail does not simply provide a “toehold” for PNPase to bind, after which PNPase can digest through strong secondary structure. Rather, as has been suggested (20Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1061-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), it is likely that an iterative process of repeated poly(A) addition and processive exonuclease activity is required to turn over RNAs that have a 3′-proximal structure, such as a Rho-independent transcription terminator. We note that the gene encoding poly(A) polymerase of B. subtilis has not yet been identified. Experiments that can determine the effect of poly(A) addition on RNA turnover in B. subtilis await the identification of the poly(A) polymerase gene and construction of mutant strains lacking such an activity. E. coli PNPase can be found in the degradosome, which also includes RNase E and RhlB, an RNA helicase. Association with an RNA helicase activity could render 3′-terminal stem structures sensitive to PNPase digestion. For B. subtilis, however, only one of the putative four helicases, encoded by the deaD gene, is known to have RNA-helicase activity, and this is specifically activated by 23 S rRNA (21Kossen K. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 19: 3811-3820Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Also, there is no evidence as yet for a degradosome-like complex in B. subtilis (22Condon C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 157-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of trp leader RNA at the endonuclease cleavage site resulted in a 4-fold increase in RNA half-life. Previously, we had determined the half-life of trp leader RNA to be 1.3 min (4Deikus G. Babitzke P. Bechhofer D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2747-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The observed half-life of wild-type trp leader RNA here was about twice as long (2.7 min). This difference may be attributed to the fact that here we were not measuring decay of native trp leader RNA encoded on the chromosome but, rather, decay of trp leader RNA encoded on the high-copy plasmid pGD5. Although the plasmid also contained the mtrB gene, encoding TRAP, it is possible that the ratio of the TRAP complex to trp leader RNA in the strain carrying pGD5 is different from the ratio in the native situation, such that the half-life of trp leader RNA is affected. In any event, stabilization of trp leader RNA by mutation of a single site is a noteworthy result. This showed directly that the short, single-stranded region between the TRAP binding site and the transcription terminator structure is a target for decay-initiating endonuclease cleavage. The small size of the trp leader RNA, the presence of 5′ and 3′ double-stranded structure, and the presence of TRAP bound to a major internal portion of the RNA likely render this RNA susceptible to endonuclease cleavage at only a single site. This is the first time that such a site has been mapped in B. subtilis. In similar experiments with small RNAs in E. coli, it was shown that mutagenesis of a single RNase E or RNase III cleavage site can have profound effects on mRNA decay (23Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1991; 65: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 24Bouvet P. Belasco J.G. Nature. 1992; 360: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 25Marujo P.E.

Microbiol. 1996; 22: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The endonuclease required for rapid trp leader RNA turnover may be the 5′-binding endonuclease, which is suggested by genetic experiments to be responsible generally for initiation of mRNA decay in B. subtilis (22Condon C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 157-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is anticipated that use of the trp leader RNA as a substrate in vivo and in vitro will be useful in identifying this endonuclease. We thank Paul Babitzke for purified TRAP."
https://openalex.org/W2072229990,"CD45 is a major membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) expressed in T cells where it regulates the activity of Lck, a Src family kinase important for T cell receptor-mediated activation. PTPα is a more widely expressed transmembrane PTP that has been shown to regulate the Src family kinases, Src and Fyn, and is also present in T cells. Here, PTPα was phosphorylated at Tyr-789 in CD45– T cells but not in CD45+ T cells suggesting that CD45 could regulate the phosphorylation of PTPα at this site. Furthermore, CD45 could directly dephosphorylate PTPα in vitro. Expression of PTPα and PTPα-Y789F in T cells revealed that the mutant had a reduced ability to decrease Fyn and Cbp phosphorylation, to regulate the kinase activity of Fyn, and to restore T cell receptor-induced signaling events when compared with PTPα. Conversely, this mutant had an increased ability to prevent Pyk2 phosphorylation and CD44-mediated cell spreading when compared with PTPα. These data demonstrate distinct activities of PTPα and PTPα-Y789F in T cells and identify CD45 as a regulator of PTPα phosphorylation at tyrosine 789 in T cells.

In general, basal tyrosine phosphorylation levels in unstimulated cells are relatively low, suggesting that protein tyrosine phosphatase activity prevails over tyrosine kinase activities under resting conditions. Stimulation of cells via a variety of receptors linked to tyrosine kinases can induce tyrosine phosphorylation cascades that lead to cell activation or modulation of cellular function. In T lymphocytes, CD45 is a major protein tyrosine phosphatase expressed at the T cell membrane where it is thought to contribute over 90% of the membrane-associated PTP activity (1Mustelin T. Coggeshall K.M. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6302-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Recognition of antigen by the T cell receptor (TCR) results in induction of a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade leading to T cell activation and is driven primarily by the activity of the Src family kinase (SFK), Lck (2Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Counter-intuitively, CD45 is required for the efficient progression of this TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation signal, as it is required to dephosphorylate the negative regulatory site (Tyr-505) of Lck (reviewed in Refs. 3Johnson P. Felberg J. Mod. Asp. Immunobiol. 2000; 1: 156-159Google Scholar, 4Alexander D.R. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Hermiston M.L. Xu Z. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). This relieves inhibitory constraints on Lck and primes it for subsequent autophosphorylation at tyrosine 394 and activation. This activating function of CD45 and its requirement for efficient TCR signaling are well established. However, evidence from CD45–/– thymocytes and certain CD45– T cell lines indicates that the absence of CD45 can result in enhanced Lck phosphorylation at both the negative regulatory and autophosphorylation sites, suggesting a role for CD45 in both the activation and inactivation of Lck (4Alexander D.R. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6D'Oro U. Ashwell J.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1879-1883PubMed Google Scholar, and reviewed in Ref. 7Ashwell J.D. D'Oro U. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 412-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus the function of CD45 may be to keep Lck under control, allowing activation, but preventing sustained activation or inactivation. It has been difficult to examine the role of CD45 in inactivating Lck and down-regulating TCR signaling because CD45 is also needed for activation. However, antibody cross-linking of CD4 and CD44 can result in Lck activation independently of CD45, thereby allowing observation of the inactivating role of CD45 and its dephosphorylation of Tyr-394 on Lck (8Deans J.P. Kanner S.B. Torres R.M. Ledbetter J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Li R.H. Wong N. Jabali M.D. Johnson P. J. Biol.

Med. 1990; 172: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). CD45 has also been reported to affect the phosphorylation state of Fyn in T cells (11Mustelin T. Pessa-Morikawa T. Autero M. Gassmann M. Andersson L.C. Gahmberg C.G. Burn P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar); although this effect has always been less pronounced than for Lck. Likewise, although Fyn has been implicated in TCR signaling events, its effect on TCR signaling events is less dramatic than that of Lck (12Palacios E.H. Weiss A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7990-8000Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). SFKs are widely expressed, whereas CD45 expression is restricted to leukocytes, indicating that other PTPs must regulate these enzymes in other cell types. PTPα has been shown to dephosphorylate the negative regulatory site of Src and Fyn in other cell types, whereas cytosolic PTPs such as SHP-1, -2, PEP, and PTP1B have been implicated in dephosphorylation at the autophosphorylation site (13Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 14Pallen C.J. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 821-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Some of these PTPs are also present in T cells where they have been shown to modulate SFK phosphorylation, indicating that regulation of SFKs can be controlled by multiple phosphatases. Although expression of PTPα in a CD45– T cell line did not substantially affect Lck or Fyn phosphorylation, it did partially restore CD3-mediated TCR signaling events, suggesting that it can partially substitute for some CD45 activities (15Ng D.H.W. Jabali M.D. Maiti A. Borodchak P. Harder K. Brocker T. Malissen B. Jirik F.R. Johnson P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A comparison of CD45 and PTPα activities revealed that PTPα was a much less active PTP under the in vitro conditions tested. Furthermore, analysis of thymocyte development and T cell activation in PTPα–/– mice revealed a role for PTPα in the dephosphorylation and regulation of lipid raft-associated Fyn and its substrate, Cbp (16Maksumova L. Le H.T. Muratkhodjaev F. Davidson D. Veillette A. Pallen C.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that both CD45 and PTPα contribute to the regulation of SFKs in T cells, and this study was performed to evaluate the contributions of each phosphatase. Surprisingly, we found that CD45 regulates the phosphorylation of PTPα at Tyr-789, a regulatory site that influences the ability of PTPα to dephosphorylate SFK (17Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D.

Blots were developed using ECL or ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to BioMax Film from Eastman Kodak Co. In Vitro Dephosphorylation Assay—PTPα and Lck were immunoprecipitated from CD45– T cells transfected with PTPα as described above. Immune complexes bound to beads were washed three times with cold PTP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) and then incubated with 400 ng (20 μl) of purified recombinant His6-CD45 or His6-CD45C817S proteins at 30 °C from 0 to 10 min. The reactions were stopped by immersion in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and addition of 10 μl of 3X reducing sample buffer. Samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF. The amount of phosphorylated PTPα or Lck remaining was detected by 4G10 (1:5000) and goat anti-mouse-HRP or protein A-HRP.

Kinase Assay—Fyn was immunoprecipitated from 300 to 400 μg of protein lysate.

Cell Spreading Assay—Untransfected and PTPα transfected CD45– T cells were immobilized on anti-CD44 mAb, essentially as described (9Li R.H. Wong N. Jabali M.D. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28767-28773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and the cell length measured. The two-tailed t test was used to determine statistical significance. PTPα Is Tyrosine Phosphorylated in T Cells Lacking CD45—Transfection of PTPα into CD45+ and CD45– BW5147 T lymphoma cells (hereafter referred to as CD45+ and CD45– T cells, respectively) and selection of PTPα positive clones revealed that PTPα was tyrosine phosphorylated in CD45– T cells, but not in CD45+ T cells (Fig. 1A). Because PTPα is constitutively phosphorylated at tyrosine 789 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (25den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), PTPα-Y789F was expressed in CD45+ and CD45– T cells. This mutated form of PTPα was not tyrosine phosphorylated in CD45– T cells (Fig. 1A), inferring that PTPα was phosphorylated at tyrosine 789 in CD45– T cells. It also suggested that the presence of CD45 facilitated dephosphorylation of PTPα at Tyr-789. To determine whether CD45 was able to regulate the phosphorylation state of endogenous PTPα in T cells, the phosphorylation state of PTPα was examined in thymocytes and splenocytes from CD45 positive (CD45+/+, C57Bl/6), and CD45 null (CD45–/–) mice (19Kishihara K. Penninger J. Wallace V.A. Kundig T.M. Kawai K. Wakeham A. Timms E. Pfeffer K. Ohashi P.S. Thomas M.L. Furlonger C. Paige C.J. Mak T.W. Cell. 1993; 74: 143-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that the phosphorylation of endogenous PTPα in both thymocytes and splenocytes isolated from CD45–/– mice was significantly higher than from CD45+/+ cells. These data strongly suggest an unexpected role for CD45 in regulating PTPα phosphorylation in T cells. CD45 Can Directly Dephosphorylate Tyrosine 789 of PTPα in Vitro—To determine whether CD45 was able to directly dephosphorylate PTPα at tyrosine 789, dephosphorylation of phosphorylated PTPα was examined in vitro. Purified active recombinant CD45 cytoplasmic domain (aCD45) or mutated inactive rCD45cytC817S (iCD45; 20Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were used to dephosphorylate PTPα immunoprecipitated from CD45– T cells. This was compared with immunoprecipitated Lck, a well established substrate of CD45 in T cells. Active, recombinant CD45 (a CD45) dephosphorylated PTPα at a rate similar to that of Lck (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, no significant dephosphorylation was observed in the presence of inactive CD45, indicating that PTPα itself was not making a substantial contribution to its own dephosphorylation. This is also consistent with the inability of PTPα to dephosphorylate itself in CD45– T cells. These in vitro data indicate that CD45 can efficiently and directly dephosphorylate PTPα and raise the possibility that CD45 may directly dephosphorylate PTPα at tyrosine 789 in T cells. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PTPα Is Significantly Reduced by the SFK Inhibitor, PP2—Src has been implicated in the phosphorylation of tyrosine 789 of PTPα (25den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26Chen M. Chen S.C. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11972-11980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As CD45 can both up- and down-regulate SFK activity in T cells (7Ashwell J.D. D'Oro U. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 412-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 406-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), it is possible that CD45 could also regulate PTPα phosphorylation indirectly by negatively regulating SFK activity. To determine whether SFK activity can regulate tyrosine 789 phosphorylation of PTPα, transfected CD45+ and CD45– T cells were treated with 10 μm PP2, a SFK inhibitor (28Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation state of PTPα examined. Fig. 2C indicates that the tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPα in CD45– T cells was significantly reduced after 30 min of treatment with PP2 but not with the inactive PP2 analogue, PP3. These results implicate SFK activity in the phosphorylation of tyrosine 789. Differential Effect of PTPα and PTPα-Y789F on the Phosphorylation State of Fyn and Cbp in CD45– T Cells—Having established that the presence of CD45 affects the phosphorylation state of tyrosine 789 in PTPα, we investigated whether the Y789F mutation, which prevents phosphorylation at this site, affected the function of PTPα. To do this, we examined the effect of PTPα and PTPα-Y789F in CD45+ and CD45– T cells. As PTPα has been shown to regulate the SFK Fyn and phosphorylation of Cbp in thymocytes (16Maksumova L. Le H.T. Muratkhodjaev F. Davidson D. Veillette A. Pallen C.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we first examined these in the transfected CD45+ and CD45– T cells sorted for high expression of VSVG-tagged PTPα. Fyn was immunoprecipitated from parental PTPα and PTPα-Y789F transfected cells and its tyrosine phosphorylation state compared with that of Lck, the other SFK expressed in T cells. Both Fyn and Lck were hyperphosphorylated in the CD45– T cells compared with CD45+ T cells, consistent with a role for CD45 in dephosphorylating these SFKs, as has been described previously (29Hurley T.R. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 30Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PTPα reduced the total phosphotyrosine level of Fyn and more specifically, the level of the negative regulatory phosphotyrosine 529 of Fyn in CD45– T cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting a positive role for PTPα in Fyn activation. However, analysis of Fyn activity in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3B, top panel) revealed that the presence of PTPα reduced Fyn activity, suggesting that PTPα can also negatively regulate Fyn activity. Overexpression of PTPα in the CD45+ T cells also reduced Fyn phosphorylation, indicating that both CD45 and PTPα can affect the phosphorylation state of Fyn. Interestingly, expression of PTPα-Y789F had a lesser effect on Fyn phosphorylation and Fyn activity compared with PTPα (Fig. 3A), even though expression levels of the two PTPs were similar (Fig. 3B, bottom panels). This demonstrates that PTPα and PTPα-Y789F differentially affect the phosphorylation state of Fyn in CD45+ and CD45– T cells and indicates that PTPα is more efficient at dephosphorylating Fyn than is PTPα-Y789F. In contrast, analysis of Lck immunoprecipitates from PTPα and PTPα-Y789F transfected cells did not reveal a major effect of either phosphatase on Lck phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), suggesting that Lck is not a major substrate for PTPα. Together, this suggests that PTPα acts primarily on Fyn in T cells. Fyn has been implicated as a Cbp kinase (30Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), and we examined whether the altered in vitro activities of Fyn were consistent with the in vivo phosphorylation of this potential substrate. Indeed, immunoprecipitated Cbp from CD45– T cells exhibited enhanced phosphorylation and phosphorylation-dependent association with Csk, compared with Cbp from CD45+ T cells, and the overexpression of PTPα reduced these increases (Fig. 3B, middle panels). Compared with PTPα, overexpressed mutant PTPα-Y789F was less effective in reducing Cbp phosphorylation and the extent of Cbp-Csk association in the CD45– T cells. These findings demonstrate that PTPα more potently promotes Fyn and Cbp dephosphorylation than does PTPα-Y789F. PTPα-Y789F Is Less Efficient than PTPα in Restoring CD3-induced Phosphorylation in CD45– T Cells—Transfection of PTPα into CD45– T cells has previously been shown to partially restore TCR/CD3 proximal signaling events (15Ng D.H.W. Jabali M.D. Maiti A. Borodchak P. Harder K. Brocker T. Malissen B. Jirik F.R. Johnson P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here we compared the abilities of PTPα and PTPα-Y789F to restore TCR/CD3 signaling events by examining protein tyrosine phosphorylation after stimulation of the cells with anti-CD3 ɛ antibody for 1 and 10 min (Fig. 4). The rapid induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of Zap-70 and specific proteins of about 38 and 120 kDa was observed in the CD45+ T cells. No significant induction of phosphorylation was observed in CD45– T cells. Overexpression of PTPα in CD45– T cells partially restored all these signaling events, whereas PTPα-Y789F had only a very minor effect (Fig. 4). These data indicate that PTPα-Y789F is less efficient than PTPα in restoring TCR/CD3-mediated signaling events. Together, the data suggest that PTPα-Y789F is less efficient than PTPα in the dephosphorylation of Fyn, Cbp, and in restoring TCR/CD3 signaling events in CD45– T cells. PTPα-Y789F Is More Efficient than PTPα in Reducing CD44-mediated Pyk2 Phosphorylation—The data thus far are consistent with the possibility that PTPα-Y789F is a less efficient phosphatase than PTPα. To further investigate this, CD44-mediated Pyk2 phosphorylation and T cell spreading were examined in the PTPα- and PTPα-Y789F-transfected T cells. Pyk2 is a member of the focal adhesion kinase family expressed in T cells and has been implicated in cell adhesion and migration processes (31Ostergaard H.L. Lysechko T.L. Immunol. Res. 2005; 31: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CD44-mediated Pyk2 phosphorylation is dependent on SFK activity, yet is negatively regulated by CD45 (9Li R.H. Wong N. Jabali M.D. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28767-28773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This is opposite to the role of CD45 in TCR/CD3 signaling where it has a positive regulatory action on Lck and is required for efficient stimulation (reviewed in Refs. 3Johnson P. Felberg J. Mod. Asp. Immunobiol. 2000; 1: 156-159Google Scholar, 4Alexander D.R. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Hermiston M.L. Xu Z. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Here, PTPα- and PTPα-Y789F-transfected CD45– T cells were immobilized on CD44 antibody and cell spreading and Pyk2 phosphorylation compared with that of parental CD45– T cells. PTPα-transfected cells showed reduced cell spreading compared with the CD45– T cells, and spreading was even more strongly reduced in PTPα-Y789F-expressing CD45– T cells (Fig. 5A). Pyk2 phosphorylation was strongly induced in CD45– T cells after 2 h but was reduced in PTPα-expressing cells and almost abolished in PTPα-Y789F-expressing cells (Fig. 5B), indicating a direct correlation between the extent of Pyk2 phosphorylation and cell spreading. Notably, PTPα-Y789F-transfected cells showed lower induced levels of Pyk2 phosphorylation than PTPα-transfected cells. This is opposite to the effect of PTPα and PTPα-Y789F on the phosphorylation state of Fyn and Cbp where lower phosphorylation of these proteins was observed in PTPα-transfected cells. This suggests that phosphorylation of PTPα at tyrosine 789 can differentially influence the dephosphorylation of specific substrates and raises the possibility that phosphorylation at tyrosine 789 may regulate the substrate specificity of PTPα. To further explore the possible mechanism for reduced Pyk2 phosphorylation in PTPα-Y789F transfected cells, immunoprecipitated Pyk2 was re-probed for associated PTPα. Surprisingly, PTPα but not PTPα-Y789F was found in the complex with Pyk2 both before and after CD44 stimulation (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of PTPα and PTPα-Y789F at 0 and 2 h after CD44 stimulation revealed an association between Grb2 and PTPα, but not with PTPα-Y789F (Fig. 5C). Conversely, both PTPα and PTPα-Y789F associated with immunoprecipitated Fyn isolated from either CD45– or CD45+ T cells (Fig. 5D). This highlights two differences between PTPα and PTPα-Y789F, one in the ability of PTPα to co-immunoprecipitate Grb2 and the second in the ability to associate with Pyk2 in CD45– T cells. Collectively, these data identify tyrosine 789 in PTPα as a site of phosphorylation in T cells and demonstrate that phosphorylation at this site is negatively regulated by CD45. CD45 can directly dephosphorylate PTPα at tyrosine 789 in vitro, raising the possibility that PTPα might be a substrate for CD45 in T cells. PTPα-Y789F-transfected CD45– T cells showed a reduced ability to dephosphorylate Fyn and restore TCR/CD3 signaling events, compared with PTPα-transfected CD45– T cells, suggesting that phosphorylation of PTPα at tyrosine 789 may facilitate the dephosphorylation of Fyn. Conversely, PTPα-Y789F had the greatest effect on reducing Pyk2 phosphorylation and reducing T cell spreading in CD45– T cells, suggesting that in this situation, PTPα-Y789F was the more efficient phosphatase. Together, these data demonstrate distinct activities of PTPα and PTPα-Y789F in T cells and identify CD45 as a regulator of PTPα phosphorylation at tyrosine 789 in T cells. Although the role of CD45 in regulating Src family tyrosine kinases by regulating their phosphorylation is well established, its role in regulating protein tyrosine phosphatases by a similar mechanism has not previously been described. Here we provide evidence that PTPα is a target for CD45 in T cells. We establish that PTPα is phosphorylated at Tyr-789 in T cells and show that phosphorylation at this site is likely regulated by the balance of SFK and CD45 activities. In the absence of CD45, enhanced phosphorylation of PTPα is observed. This may be because of the dysregulation and enhanced activation of SFKs in the absence of CD45, as has been found in CD45-negative thymocytes (6D'Oro U. Ashwell J.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1879-1883PubMed Google Scholar, 32Stone J.D. Conroy L.A. Byth K.F. Hederer R.A. Howlett S. Takemoto Y. Holmes N. Alexander D.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5773-5782PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this, PTPα phosphorylation was significantly reduced by the SFK inhibitor PP2 in the CD45– T cells, suggesting an indirect effect of CD45 on PTPα phosphorylation via its action on SFKs. However, PTPα phosphorylation was abolished in the presence of PP2 in the CD45+ T cells, suggesting a direct, SFK-independent mechanism for CD45 in regulating PTPα phosphorylation. The possibility that CD45 can directly dephosphorylate PTPα is supported by the in vitro data. Thus it is likely that CD45 regulates PTPα phosphorylation by both a major, indirect mechanism and a minor, direct mechanism, the latter providing a novel example of the regulation of one receptor PTP by another. In non-hematopoietic cells (that lack CD45), about 20% of PTPα is constitutively phosphorylated at Tyr-789 (25den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and PTPα Tyr-789 phosphorylation has been reported to play a role in PTPα-mediated mitotic activation of Src in fibroblasts (17Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 33Zheng X.M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Integrin stimulation in fibroblasts induces further phosphorylation of PTPα at Tyr-789, however this PTPα Tyr-789 phosphorylation is not required for integrin-induced PTPα-mediated SFK activation, although it is required for optimal cytoskeletal rearrangement and focal adhesion formation that determine cell migration (26Chen M. Chen S.C. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11972-11980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These contrasting results indicate that the phosphorylation of PTPα within its C-terminal tail can modulate PTPα function but that it may do so in a manner dependent upon signaling context. Here, the function of PTPα and the non-phosphorylated mutant PTPα-Y789F was compared in different signaling settings in T cells and revealed striking differences in their ability to affect the phosphorylation state of various potential PTPα substrates. PTPα is expressed in various cell types and like CD45, is a well established regulator of SFKs (14Pallen C.J. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 821-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, examination of thymocytes from PTPα-null mice revealed that Fyn and the potential Fyn substrate Cbp were hyperphosphorylated (16Maksumova L. Le H.T. Muratkhodjaev F. Davidson D. Veillette A. Pallen C.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fyn was hyperphosphorylated at both the negative and positive regulatory sites in PTPα–/– thymocytes and was more active than Fyn from wild-type mouse thymocytes in an in vitro assay (16Maksumova L. Le H.T. Muratkhodjaev F. Davidson D. Veillette A. Pallen C.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, in the present study we observe that the overexpression of PTPα in CD45– T cells induces the dephosphorylation of Fyn and its substrate, Cbp. Fyn was dephosphorylated at the negative regulatory site yet its activity was decreased in an in vitro kinase activity. Interestingly, the mutant PTPα-Y789F was less effective than PTPα in causing Fyn and Cbp dephosphorylation and in reducing the in vitro kinase activity of Fyn, implicating a role for Tyr-789 phosphorylation in the regulation of Fyn by PTPα in T cells. In contrast to its effect on Fyn, PTPα did not significantly affect the phosphorylation state of Lck, in accordance with the finding that Fyn but not Lck activity is altered in PTPα-null thymocytes (16Maksumova L. Le H.T. Muratkhodjaev F. Davidson D. Veillette A. Pallen C.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This may reflect a difference in location rather than a difference in substrate specificity as PTPα has been shown to specifically affect the activity of Fyn in lipid rafts (16Maksumova L. Le H.T. Muratkhodjaev F. Davidson D. Veillette A. Pallen C.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In that and in the present study, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer was used to solubilize Fyn from lipid rafts. This may explain why no major difference in Fyn phosphorylation was observed previously in PTPα-transfected CD45– T cells where Triton X-100 was used as the solubilizing agent (15Ng D.H.W. Jabali M.D. Maiti A. Borodchak P. Harder K. Brocker T. Malissen B. Jirik F.R. Johnson P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that CD45 dramatically affects the phosphorylation state of Lck but not Fyn, whereas PTPα has the opposite effect. Given that CD45 may regulate PTPα activity, it is possible that CD45 may act indirectly on Fyn, or Fyn may be regulated by both the PTPs. The location of these PTPs and SFKs is likely to play a role in their regulation and substrate specificity as CD45 and Lck are thought to reside primarily outside lipid rafts prior to T cell activation, whereas Fyn is enriched in lipid rafts along with the lipid raft resident protein, Cbp, and appears to be specifically regulated in rafts by a small population of raft-residing PTPα. However, these locations are not mutually exclusive as most of PTPα co-localizes with the majority of CD45 in the non-raft fraction (16Maksumova L. Le H.T. Muratkhodjaev F. Davidson D. Veillette A. Pallen C.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and only a minor population of CD45 can be detected in rafts (34Edmonds S.D. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5036-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), where it has been implicated in regulating Cbp phosphorylation (24Davidson D. Bakinowski M. Thomas M.L. Horejsi V. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2017-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cbp phosphorylation recruits Csk, a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates the negative regulatory site of SFKs to counteract the activities of PTPα and CD45. Thus there appears to be an interacting network of self-regulating mechanisms designed to regulate SFK phosphorylation and prevent kinase overactivation. Examination of TCR/CD3 signaling in PTPα-transfected CD45– T cells also revealed a stronger ability of PTPα to restore TCR signaling compared with PTPα-Y789F. This correlates with the increased ability of wild-type PTPα to reduce Fyn and Cbp phosphorylation. Analysis of mice deficient in Lck, Fyn, or both SFKs has determined that Lck is the predominant SFK required to initiate TCR signaling in thymocytes and mature T cells. However, current models of TCR activation put Fyn downstream of Lck activation, with Lck translocating to lipid rafts upon TCR stimulation to activate raft-associated Fyn (35Filipp D. Leung B.L. Zhang J. Veillette A. Julius M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4266-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Filipp D. Zhang J. Leung B.L. Shaw A. Levin S.D. Veillette A. Julius M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) by an as yet undetermined mechanism. An intriguing possibility is that PTPα is a target of Lck, thus promoting PTPα function as a Lck effector and a Lck/Fyn signaling intermediate. Strikingly, PTPα and PTPα-Y789F exhibited reversed efficacies in modulating events in another signaling pathway, that of CD44-induced cell spreading. Pyk2 has been identified as a Fyn substrate in T cells (37Qian D.P. Lev S. Vanoers N.S.C. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and previous studies have shown that CD44-mediated Pyk2 phosphorylation is dependent upon SFK activity, is negatively regulated by CD45, and correlates well with T cell spreading (9Li R.H. Wong N. Jabali M.D. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28767-28773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The expression of PTPα in CD45– T cells demonstrated that like CD45, PTPα negatively affected CD44-mediated Pyk2 phosphorylation and cell spreading. However, in the CD44-stimulated T cells, PTPα-Y789F was more effective than PTPα in preventing Pyk2 phosphorylation and cell spreading. This suggests that either Pyk2 is a preferred substrate for PTPα-Y789F or that mutation at this site promotes access of the phosphatase to Pyk2. Alternatively, PTPα may be affecting Pyk2 phosphorylation indirectly, via its effect on Fyn. Either PTPα is more efficient at activating Fyn or PTPα-Y789F is more efficient at inactivating Fyn, by dephosphorylation at the autophosphorylation site. Given the fact that Fyn is able to phosphorylate Pyk2 in the absence of exogenous PTPα, we favor the explanation that PTPα-Y789F leads to the dephosphorylation of Pyk2, either directly or indirectly. Interestingly, a clear difference in the abilities of PTPα and PTPα-Y789F to associate with Pyk2 and Grb2 was apparent both before and after CD44 stimulation. Mutation of Tyr-789 abolished the constitutive association observed between PTPα and Pyk2 and between PTPα and Grb2. The latter observation is in accordance with phospho-Tyr-789 being a Grb2-SH2 binding site (25den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 38Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this is the first demonstration that PTPα can associate with Pyk2, although we do not know whether this interaction is direct or indirect. Grb2 has been shown to bind to Pyk2, although this was via Grb2 SH2 domain and phospho-Pyk2 (39Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14893-14901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The complex of PTPα and Grb2 does not favor Pyk2 dephosphorylation implying that either Grb2 protects Pyk2 against dephosphorylation or that Grb2 hinders PTPα activity, as has been suggested (25den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 38Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although further studies will be required to identify the precise mechanism, this clearly demonstrates that the mutant PTPα-Y789F can function differently to PTPα, which can be phosphorylated at this site. In addition, the modulatory effect of Tyr-789 is dependent on the signaling context in T cells. Overall, these studies demonstrate the novel regulation of one PTP by another PTP. The data suggest that CD45 can both directly and indirectly affect the phosphorylation state of PTPα at Tyr-789 in T cells. We provide evidence that mutation at this site negatively affects the ability of PTPα to reduce the phosphorylation of Cbp and Fyn, to regulate the kinase activity of Fyn, and to restore TCR signaling events. Conversely, we find that mutation at this site enhanced the ability of PTPα to reduce Pyk2 phosphorylation and CD44-mediated cell spreading. This study provides the first evidence in T cells that mutation of this phosphorylation site can differentially modulate the function of PTPα in T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2040023760,"Formation of the strand-separated, open complex between RNA polymerase and a promoter involves several intermediates, the first being the closed complex in which the DNA is fully base-paired. This normally short lived complex has been difficult to study. We have used a mutant Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, deficient in promoter DNA melting, and variants of the PR promoter of bacteriophage λ to model the closed complex intermediate at physiologically relevant temperatures. Our results indicate that in the closed complex, RNA polymerase recognizes base pairs as double-stranded DNA even in the region that becomes single-stranded in the open complex. Additionally, a particular base pair in the -35 region engages in an important interaction with the RNA polymerase, and a DNase I-hypersensitive site, pronounced in the promoter DNA of the open complex, was not present. The effect of temperature on closed complex formation was found to be small over the temperature range from 15 to 37 °C. This suggests that low temperature complexes of wild type RNA polymerase and promoter DNA may adequately model the closed complex. Formation of the strand-separated, open complex between RNA polymerase and a promoter involves several intermediates, the first being the closed complex in which the DNA is fully base-paired. This normally short lived complex has been difficult to study. We have used a mutant Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, deficient in promoter DNA melting, and variants of the PR promoter of bacteriophage λ to model the closed complex intermediate at physiologically relevant temperatures. Our results indicate that in the closed complex, RNA polymerase recognizes base pairs as double-stranded DNA even in the region that becomes single-stranded in the open complex.

The effect of temperature on closed complex formation was found to be small over the temperature range from 15 to 37 °C. This suggests that low temperature complexes of wild type RNA polymerase and promoter DNA may adequately model the closed complex. Bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, holo-RNA polymerase (if not further specified, the σ factor is WT σ70); FYWW RNAP, RNA polymerase containing σ70 with four substitutions (F427A, Y430A, W433A, and W434A); WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CRP, cyclic AMP receptor protein. that is able to engage in formation of a functionally competent complex at a promoter consists of the multisubunit core enzyme and the σ70 initiation factor, which imparts on the enzyme the ability to both recognize specific DNA sequence and to melt promoter DNA (1Gross C.

The latter two complexes have a long half-life, rendering them resistant to heparin, a competitor with promoter DNA for RNAP binding. The rate-limiting step is the I1 to I2 conversion (6Saecker R.M.

To fully understand the reaction pathway, it is important to know in detail the properties of the intermediate complexes. Record and co-workers (6Saecker R.M. Tsodikov O.V. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.E.

Thus they were able to determine that for the unstable I1 complex, RNAP covers the DNA in the downstream direction up to about +19 (9Craig M.L. Suh W-C. Record M.T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15624-15632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In I2, the RNAP covers the DNA over a similarly long stretch as in I1. It has been proposed, although not yet experimentally verified, that in I2 the nucleation of the strand separation process has occurred (6Saecker R.M. Tsodikov O.V. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.E. Capp M.W.

Biol. 1998; 283: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The closed complex is very short lived at most promoters. Attempts to arrest the reaction pathway (see Scheme 1) at RPc have involved resorting to low temperature incubation (10Kovacic R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13654-13661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Roy S. Semsey S. Liu M. Gussin G. Adhya S. J. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 258: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and covalently linking the two strands of the DNA so that strand separation is physically blocked (14Niedziela-Majka A. Heyduk T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38219-38227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These studies found that the region of DNase I protection does not extend beyond the start site of transcription for the closed complex. In subsequent complexes the region of protection reaches to about +19 (10Kovacic R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13654-13661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li X.-Y. McClure W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Most of the above studies were dependent on particular temperatures or promoter sequences, precluding determinations of effects of promoter sequence at physiological temperature, or of a range of temperatures, on closed complex formation. The studies reported here have employed an RNA polymerase where four amino acid residues (Phe-427, Tyr-430, Trp-433, and Trp-434) in the DNA melting region of the initiation factor σ70 have been substituted by alanine. The resultant “FYWW” variant has been unable to form open complexes with any promoter DNA tested under any condition investigated so far, including at 25 or 37 °C (15Sun L. Dove S. Panaghie G. deHaseth P.L. Hochschild A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). 3L. Tsujikawa and P. L. deHaseth, unpublished data. To determine the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of the interaction, we have used DNase I footprinting to monitor the extent of complex formation between FYWW RNAP and promoter DNA as a function of increasing concentration of the RNAP. Our results demonstrate that the closed complex is differently sensitive to particular substitutions in the promoter sequence and that it is not very temperature-dependent. Enhancement of DNase I cutting by WT but not FYWW RNAP is observed in the spacer DNA of a promoter with an 18 bp spacer DNA separating the -10 and -35 regions. Promoter DNA and RNAP—The QuikChange kit (Stratagene) was used to carry out site-directed mutagenesis to introduce substitutions into the PR promoter DNA, contained in the vector pKK232-8. The FYWW σ70 was described previously (15Sun L. Dove S. Panaghie G. deHaseth P.L. Hochschild A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Overexpression was driven by an inducible T7 promoter on a pET11a derivative in BL21(DE3) cells. FYWW σ70 purification followed a published procedure (16Zhi H. Jin D.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with some modifications, the most prominent being induction of expression at a growth temperature of 20 °C, the use of a higher concentration of imidazole than the recommended 50 mm for elution of the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (although 1 m was used, it is likely a lower concentration would have sufficed), and omission of the ion-exchange chromatography. The purified FYWW σ70 (greater than 90% pure) was dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 350 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol). Following concentration by centrifugation through an Amicon ultrafiltration device, the glycerol concentration was adjusted to 50%. The ratio of σ70 to core (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies) needed for optimal binding activity was determined by titrating varying amounts of FYWW σ70 with core. The optimal ratio of FYWW σ70 to core RNAP was determined to be 10:1. Quantitative DNase I Footprinting—End labeling of promoter DNA was accomplished by PCR amplification with a template-sequence primer that had been 5′-end-labeled with 33P and unlabeled nontemplate primer. Binding reactions were routinely carried out at 37 °C in transcription buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm dithiothreitol). For determination of the Kd value at other temperatures, the pH was separately adjusted to 7.3 for each temperature. Labeled promoter DNA fragment (2–4 nm) and RNAP at the desired concentration were incubated for 10 min, and DNase I was then added to an amount determined to be optimal at each temperature investigated (15 °C, 0.04 unit/μl; 25 °C, 0.01 unit/μl; 37 °C, 0.005 unit/μl; and 45 °C, 0.0015 unit/μl). The DNA cleavage reaction was stopped after 30 s by addition of 2 volumes of NH4Ac, followed by addition of glycogen to 150 μg/ml and ethanol precipitation. The pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, taken up in loading solution, boiled for 3 min, and loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gels containing 25% formamide. The gels were run for 2.5–3 h at 1000 V, fixed with 5% acetic acid, 20% methanol, and dried. After a 2–5-day exposure of a PhosphorImaging screen to the dried gel, the image was scanned on a Storm 820 (Amersham Biosciences). Assignments of bands resulting from cuts at -60, -48, -38, +1, and +19 were as in (Ref. 9Craig M.L. Suh W-C. Record M.T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15624-15632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and represent a correction to our previous assignments (17Panaghie G. Aiyar S.E. Bobb K.L. Hayward R.S. deHaseth P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The positions of cuts leading to other bands in the figures were deduced by interpolation of plots of log fragment length versus distance migrated. Band intensities were obtained by analysis with ImageQuant 5.2. The intensities of bands protected by the RNAP and used to monitor RNAP binding (the group of bands designated as Q in Fig. 2A) were normalized to reference bands outside the footprint (the group of bands designated as N in Fig. 2A), and the degree of saturation (Yapp) was calculated from Equation 1 (18Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 132-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), Yapp=1−[bands inside footprint (complex)bands outside footprint (complex)÷bands inside footprint (free DNA)bands outside footprint (free DNA)]2 Yapp was plotted against [RNAP], and the curve was fit in SigmaPlot2001 to the hyperbolic equation Yapp = y0 + [RNAP]/(Kd + [RNAP]), where y0 equals the Yapp in the absence of added RNAP, and to obtain Kd, the equilibrium dissociation constant for closed complex formation Kd = [P]/[RPc]. Graphic representation of the intensities of the bands in DNase I footprinting gels mapped onto the promoter sequence were obtained with ImageQuant 5.2. Background corrections were carried out by subtraction of the position-dependent intensity in the lane containing undigested DNA. The traces for different lanes were normalized using the first (i.e. most upstream) of the four bands that were used for normalization in the quantitative DNase I footprinting, as indicated above. KmnO4 Probing—Complexes of RNAP and end-labeled promoter DNA were formed as indicated above, except that the buffer contained 1 mm MgCl2 instead of 10 mm. The KMnO4 probing protocol was exactly as described (19Schroeder L.A. deHaseth P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17422-17429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Separation of the fragments generated from the unmodified DNA was accomplished by running the samples on a 10% sequencing gel. Analysis of the bands was by the use of ImageQuant 5.2 software. The Variant of the λ PR Promoter Used in This Work—The reference promoter for our studies is PR - 12T, shown in Fig. 1A. It is a derivative of the PR promoter of bacteriophage λ, with the G-12T substitution in the -10 region, which gives the -10 region the consensus sequence TATAAT. The PR - 12T promoter has just one nonconsensus base (the start site-proximal T on the nontemplate strand of the -35) among both the -10 and -35 regions. The G-12T substitution was introduced in order to improve closed complex formation with the RNAP containing the σ70 FYWW variant (abbreviated as FYWW RNAP), so as to counteract a binding defect resulting from the quadruple substitution in σ70 (15Sun L. Dove S. Panaghie G. deHaseth P.L. Hochschild A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A 2-fold decrease in the Kd (see Table 1) demonstrates that the G-12T substitution indeed improves closed complex formation. To be able to carry out quantitative DNase I footprinting studies (18Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 132-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), all promoters shown in Table 1 were 5′-end-labeled on the template strand by using a 5′-labeled downstream primer in the PCR amplification of the promoters.TABLE 1Kd for complexes between FYWW RNAP and PR - 12T promoter variantsDNA templateSequencea-35 (left) and -10 (right) regions are indicated in boldface.

The open complex, formed with WT RNAP, was seen to extend to about +19 for both PR - 12T (this work) and PR (9Craig M.L. Suh W-C. Record M.T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15624-15632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We carried out an experiment to evaluate whether the FYWW RNAP would be suitable for studies on closed complex formation. For this we used one of our strongest promoters, PR - 12T - 30A. The DNase I footprints in Fig. 1B, lanes 10 and 11, show that with this more consensus-like promoter, the FYW RNAP yielded almost complete protection of a long region of DNA extending downstream of the start site, characteristic of an open complex. However, the FYWW RNAP effected clear but incomplete protection from DNase I digestion over a shorter stretch of DNA (Fig. 1B, lanes 12 and 13), entirely upstream of the start site. This is commensurate with weaker binding and formation of a closed complex. In the presence of heparin, the protection afforded by FYWW RNAP is essentially abolished (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 13 (FYWW RNAP), lane 12 (FYWW RNAP with heparin challenge), and lane 7 (free DNA)). To directly compare the extents of melting by FYW and FYWW RNAP, we probed complexes of RNAP and the consensus PR - 12T - 30A promoter with KMnO4 both in the presence and absence of heparin. The results are shown in Fig. 1B, lanes 1–6. It is seen that after a 10-min incubation at 37 °C of 200 nm FYW RNAP with PR - 12T - 30A, the extent of strand separation is essentially the same as that for 60 nm WT RNAP, which saturates the promoter (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2 with 3 and 4). However, much fainter bands (about 2% of those obtained with WT RNAP) are seen for the FYWW RNAP (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). A similar result was obtained for FYWW RNAP at the PR - 12T promoter (data not shown). As at 200 nm FYWW RNAP only about 75% of the promoter DNA is occupied; full occupancy would have resulted in about 3% promoter melting by FYWW RNAP. This small extent of open complex formation should not significantly affect the quantitative interpretation of our binding experiments. A similar result concerning the relative abilities of FYW and FYWW RNAP to form open complexes was obtained with the Lac UV5 promoter (15Sun L. Dove S. Panaghie G. deHaseth P.L. Hochschild A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Based on the outcome of the above studies, the FYWW RNAP was chosen for our subsequent experiments. Characterization of the Interaction of FYWW RNAP with Promoter DNA—In Fig. 2A, a footprinting gel for titration of PR - 12T DNA with the FYWW RNAP is shown. From a quantification (see “Experimental Procedures”) of the [FYWW RNAP] dependence of the protection of the DNA between -38 and +1, the data shown in Fig. 2B were obtained. Using a hyperbolic fit, a value for the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of 85 nm was obtained. Three independent titrations yielded an average value for Kd of 87 ± 7 nm. The WT λ PR promoter has been extensively studied (6Saecker R.M. Tsodikov O.V. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.E. Capp M.W. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 649-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Craig M.L. Suh W-C. Record M.T.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15624-15632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20McKane M.

Biol. 1984; 176: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but because of its transient nature, little information is available concerning the closed complex. The Kd for the I1 complex (90–150 nm (6Saecker R.M. Tsodikov O.V. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.E. Capp M.W. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 649-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20McKane M. Gussin G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)) is within a factor of 2 of our 190 nm obtained with the PR promoter (see Table 1) in a similar buffer, but this comparison may not be warranted because in forming I1 likely conformational changes in the RNAP take place at the expense of the binding free energy (6Saecker R.M. Tsodikov O.V. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.E. Capp M.W. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 649-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Craig M.L. Tsodikov O.V. McQuade K.L. Schlax Jr, P.E. Capp M.W. Saecker R.M. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The Kd value obtained here for PR is similar to that determined for the interaction of WT RNAP with the much weaker promoter PRM (150 nm at 19 °C) in a similar buffer (12Li X.-Y. McClure W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Kd of 87 nm for PR - 12T is 2 orders of magnitude greater than the value of about 1 nm (obtained from the [WT-RNAP] dependence of rates of open complex formation) for another promoter with just one nonconsensus base, also in the -35 region (-35, TAGACA, and -10, TATAAT) (22Szoke P.A. Allen T.A. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6188-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the Kd values determined here might be inflated because of binding of the RNAP to the ends of the fragment used (23Melançon P. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5169-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), binding experiments were carried out at the reduced pH of 6.4 (buffered by MES instead of Tris) where end-binding is minimized (11Roy S. Semsey S. Liu M. Gussin G. Adhya S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Kd values were unchanged (data not shown). Thus, compared with WT RNAP, the FYWW RNAP has a binding defect, likely because of one or more of its substitutions impeding specific interaction with the -10 region of promoter DNA (24Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). A trace of lane 11 of Fig. 2A is shown in Fig. 2C. This trace is shown as it was more typical than that of lane 12, where the DNA was somewhat over-digested. Also displayed in this figure are traces of lane 2 (WT RNAP) and lane 1 (free DNA). The WT RNAP shows a long footprint, with clear RNAP-dependent effects in the DNase I digestion pattern from -48 (and possibly further upstream) through about +19, and nearly complete protection from about -35 through about +10. In comparison, the trace for FYWW RNAP differs in two respects. 1) The region of DNA affected by the FYWW RNAP is shorter, extending from -48 through +1, as expected for a closed complex. 2) The extent of protection afforded by the FYWW RNAP is position-dependent and overall less than that seen for WT RNAP. At two positions (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 2C) where the trace of FYWW RNAP differs most extensively from that of the free DNA, the protection is about 70%. This is also the extent of occupancy of the promoter expected at a concentration of FYWW RNAP of 180 nm if the Kd is 87 nm. Thus the extent of protection at these positions is complete. Why less than complete protection would be afforded by FYWW RNAP at other positions is unclear. The Effects of Substitutions at -15 and Downstream—Three of these substitutions are at the most conserved bases of the -10 region as follows: at -12, not known to be melted in the open complex (T-12G generates the sequence of the WT PR promoter); -11 (A-11C), where -11A is the base presumed to be flipped out in initiation of DNA melting (25Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 37: 5959-5967Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and as such is the most important base in the process of open complex formation; and at -7 (T-7C), the location of the so-called “constant T” of the -10 region. The G-15T substitution leads to an extended -10 region (27Burr T. Mitchell J. Kolb A. Minchin S. Busby S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1864-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and G-5C would disrupt a recently discovered downstream contact between σ70 and promoter DNA (28Feklistov A.

We have arbitrarily designated any increase in Kd to a value less than 1.7-fold that of the PR - 12T promoter, or any decrease to a value greater than 1/1.7 (=0.6)-fold that of the PR - 12T promoter as being insignificant, even though the Student’s t test indicated most as being statistically significant. This arbitrary cutoff is to be considered in the context of the 2- to 100-fold effects, depending on position and sequence context, typically seen for substitutions in the -35 and -10 regions (22Szoke P.A. Allen T.A. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6188-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Moyle H. Waldburger C. Susskind M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the PR - 12T promoter as a reference, we find that of the five substitutions considered here, two (G-5C and G-15T) have no significant effects on the Kd value for the interaction between FYWW RNAP and promoter DNA (see Table 1) and thus would exert their effects on a step downstream of closed complex formation. The three substitutions in the -10 region (T-12G, A-11C, and T-7C) increase the Kd value (weaken the binding) up to 3-fold (for T-7C). Effects of Alterations in the Spacer DNA Separating the -10 and -35 Regions and Further Upstream—Two of these substitutions (T-35C and T-30A) are in the -35 region, known to be involved in important contacts between σ70 and promoter DNA. Two alterations affect the length of the spacer DNA separating the -10 and -35 regions, either increasing (PR - 12T S18) or decreasing it (PR - 12T S16) with respect to the optimal separation of 17 bp in the WT PR promoter. The - 12T SM is a block substitution in the spacer DNA consisting of 7 bp of A + T-rich DNA, previously found to greatly increase in vitro transcription from the lacUV5 promoter (31Liu M. Tolstorukov M. Zhurkin V. Garges S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6911-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This block substitution in the spacer DNA was found to reduce the Kd by a factor of 1.8 (see Table 1), indicating some effect on closed complex formation. Two changes (PR - 12T - 30A and PR - 12T S16) were considered to have no significant effect, and two (PR - 12T - 35C and PR - 12T S18) led to an increase in the Kd. Thus the deletion of a base pair in the spacer DNA (PR - 12T S16) did not have a significant effect on closed complex formation, but the insertion of a base pair did, increasing the Kd by a factor of 1.8 for PR - 12T S18. Two hypersensitive sites are seen with promoters that have 17-bp spacer DNAs (near the top of Figs. 1B and 2A) and 16 bp spacer DNAs (data not shown) as follows: at -38 and -48, meaning that c"
https://openalex.org/W2084063310,"Maspin is a member of the serpin family with a reactive center loop that is incompatible with proteinase inhibition by the serpin conformational change mechanism. Despite this there are reports that maspin might regulate uPA-dependent processes <i>in vivo</i>. Using exogenous and endogenous fluorescence, we demonstrate here that maspin can bind uPA and tPA in both single-chain and double-chain forms, with <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> values between 300 and 600 nm. Binding is at an exosite on maspin close to, but outside of, the reactive center loop and is therefore insensitive to mutation of Arg<sup>340</sup> within the reactive center loop. The binding site on tPA does not involve the proteinase active site, with the result that maspin can bind to S195A tPA that is already complexed to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. The ability of maspin to bind these proteinases without involvement of the reactive center loop leaves the latter free to engage in additional, as yet unidentified, maspin-protein interactions that may serve to regulate the properties of the exosite-bound proteinase. This may help to reconcile apparently conflicting studies that demonstrate the importance of the reactive center loop in certain maspin functions, despite the inability of maspin to directly inhibit tPA or uPA catalytic activity in <i>in vitro</i> assays through engagement between its reactive center loop and the active site of the proteinase."
https://openalex.org/W2091239660,"The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex plays a critical role in the coordination of gene expression with physiological stimuli. The synthetic enzymes ribonucleotide reductase, dihydrofolate reductase, and thymidylate synthase are coordinately regulated to ensure appropriate deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate levels. Particularly, these enzymes are actively repressed as cells exit the cell cycle through the action of E2F transcription factors and the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor/p107/p130 family of pocket proteins. This process is found to be highly dependent on SWI/SNF activity as cells deficient in BRG-1 and Brm subunits fail to repress these genes with activation of pocket proteins, and this deficit in repression can be complemented, via the ectopic expression of BRG-1. The failure to repress transcription does not involve a blockade in the association of E2F or pocket proteins p107 and p130 with promoter elements. Rather, the deficit in repression is due to a failure to mediate histone deacetylation of ribonucleotide reductase, dihydrofolate reductase, and thymidylate synthase promoters in the absence of SWI/SNF activity. The basis for this is found to be a failure to recruit mSin3B and histone deacetylase proteins to promoters.

Additionally, the complex is composed of accessory proteins termed BRG-1-associated factors (5Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Together, these subunits form a 2-MDa complex that utilizes the energy from ATP hydrolysis to catalyze changes in chromatin structure. Given this central role for SWI/SNF in transcriptional control, the complex is associated with multiple biological processes including differentiation, hormonal signaling, and cell cycle control. The SWI/SNF complex is important for modulating transcriptional programs related to cell cycle control, and aberrations in SWI/SNF subunits are progressively associated with tumorigenesis (6Hendricks K.B.

In general, the loss of these factors has been implicated in deregulation of target genes associated with cell cycle control, particularly those regulated by the RB/E2F signaling axis (12Bosco E.E.

Specifically, RB and related pocket proteins p107/p130 bind to members of the E2F family of transcription factors and mediate transcriptional repression (19Cam H. Dynlacht B.D.

These effects on transcription are mediated by the co-recruitment of a myriad of co-repressors to E2F-regulated promoters (24Rastogi S. Joshi B. Dasgupta P. Morris M. Wright K. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4161-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Taylor-Harding B. Binne U.K. Korenjak M. Brehm A. Dyson N.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9124-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this context, SWI/SNF activity is critically important, and deficiency of SWI/SNF activity has been associated with deregulated E2F-dependent gene expression (26Nagl Jr., N.G. Zweitzig D.R. Thimmapaya B. Beck Jr., G.R. Moran E. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1289-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).A critical gene expression program involved in cell cycle control is the regulation of dNTP synthetic enzymes. As cells progress into S-phase there is a coordinated stimulation in the levels of ribonucleotide reductase subunit II (RNRII), thymidylate synthase (TS), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). It is believed that the up-regulation of such synthetic enzymes is important for expanding the pool of dNTPs for DNA synthesis (27Angus S.P. Wheeler L.J. Ranmal S.A. Zhang X. Markey M.P. Mathews C.K.

Consistent with this overall idea, multiple DNA tumor viruses harbor oncoproteins that up-regulate the same dNTP metabolic enzymes, presumably to promote viral replication (29Bebenek K. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3589-3596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, these oncoproteins disrupt the function of RB, and it is known that expression of each of these genes is regulated via the E2F family of transcription factors. Conversely, as cells exit cell cycle these genes are repressed by the action of RB and related proteins. Here we define the mechanism through which SWI/SNF participates in the regulation of RNRII, TS, and DHFR in the context of RB-mediated repression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Plasmids, Infections, and Transfections—SW13 and TSUPr-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C in 5% CO2.

To define the mechanisms through which this regulation occurs, we challenged the response of such enzymes to activation of the RB pathway. For these analyses we initially utilized the SW13 cell line, which is deficient in BRG-1 and Brm ATPase requisite for SWI/SNF activity, and TSUPr-1, which is proficient in Brm (35Strobeck M.W. Reisman D.N. Gunawardena R.W. Betz B.L. Angus S.P. Knudsen K.E. Kowalik T.F. Weissman B.E. Knudsen E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4782-4789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To activate the endogenous RB pathway, SW13 and TSUPr-1 cells were infected with adenoviruses encoding either GFP (control) or p16ink4a. Expression of p16ink4a inhibits cell cycle progression by disrupting the cyclinD-cdk4 kinase complex, resulting in the dephosphorylation/activation of RB as well as related pocket proteins p107 and p130 (17Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4945) Google Scholar, 36Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). As expected, overexpression of p16ink4a led to the dephosphorylation of RB, p107, and p130 in both cell types (Fig. 1A). It should be noted that the overall levels of p107 and pRB are also decreased, which is consistent with previously published models of p16ink4a-mediated cell cycle arrest (32Angus S.P. Fribourg A.F. Markey M.P. Williams S.L. Horn H.F. DeGregori J. Kowalik T.F. Fukasawa K. Knudsen E.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 276: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Alevizopoulos K. Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5322-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The expression of p16ink4a resulted in highly significant diminution of the RNA levels of RNRII, TS, and DHFR in TSUPr-1 cells (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, we observed no attenuation of endogenous RNA levels of RNRII, TS, and DHFR in SW13 cells infected with p16ink4a, even though the pocket proteins were amply dephosphorylated (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2). These observations were further strengthened by analyses of RNRII, TS, and DHFR protein levels in SW13 and TSUPr-1 cells. Consistent with RNA analyses, RNRII, TS, and DHFR protein levels were significantly attenuated in TSUPr-1 cells in the presence of p16ink4a (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4), in contrast to SW13 cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2). These results indicate that RNRII, TS, and DHFR expressions are regulated by the RB pathway in a manner that is dependent on SWI/SNF activity.Having confirmed that RNRII, TS, and DHFR genes are regulated via the RB pathway, the specific impact on their respective promoters was investigated. SW13 and TSUPr-1 cells were cotransfected with RNRII, TS, and DHFR promoter plasmid, respectively, and either vector control or p16ink4a-encoding plasmids. Overexpression of p16ink4a significantly repressed the promoter activity of RNRII, TS, and DHFR in SWI/SNF-proficient TSUPr-1 cells. In contrast, p16ink4a failed to repress promoter activity in SWI/SNF-deficient SW13 cells (Fig. 2A). To functionally demonstrate the requirement for SWI/SNF activity, BRG-1 expression was restored in SW13 cells in combination with p16ink4a, and RNRII, TS, and DHFR promoter activity was analyzed through reporter analysis. Similar to our earlier observation, p16ink4a alone failed to repress RNRII, TS, and DHFR promoter activity. However, cotransfection of BRG-1 and p16ink4a significantly repressed these promoters in SWI/SNF-deficient SW13 cells (Fig. 2B). Consistent with reporter assays, we observed attenuation of endogenous RNA (Fig. 2C) and protein levels (Fig. 2D) of RNRII, TS, and DHFR upon restoring p16ink4a and BRG-1 in SWI/SNF-deficient SW13 cells. In summary, these data demonstrate that SWI/SNF activity is required for RB-mediated repression of RNRII, TS, and DHFR promoters and attenuation of its RNA and protein levels.FIGURE 2SWI/SNF is required for RB-mediated repression of RNRII, TS, and DHFR expression. A, SW13 and TSUPr-1 cells were cotransfected with cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase and RNR11-Luc, TS-Luc, and DHFR-Luc reporter plasmids and either vector or p16ink4a expression plasmids. Relative luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity for transfection efficiency, and the vector control was set to 100. B, SW13 cells were cotransfected with cytomegalovirus β-galalactosidase, RNRII-Luc, TS-Luc, or DHFR-Luc reporter plasmids and either vector, p16ink4a, or BRG-1 expression plasmids. The relative luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity for transfection efficiency, and vector control was set to 100. Error bars represent average relative luciferase activity and S.D. Results are representative of three independent experiments. C, SW13 cells were infected with either GFP (lane 1), p16ink4a (lane 2), BRG-1 (lane 3), or p16ink4a and BRG-1 (lane 4)-encoding adenoviruses. Total RNA was extracted 36 h post-infection and subjected to linear reverse transcriptase PCR amplification with primers specific for the indicated genes. D, SW13 cells were infected as in panel C.

Initially the requirement of SWI/SNF for E2F family members to access the respective promoters was determined. Specifically, the ability of E2F proteins to bind the RNRII, TS, and DHFR promoters was evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (38Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The E2F family of transcription factors consists of at least seven members (E2F1–7), of which E2F4 and E2F5 are transcriptional repressors (39Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar, 40Gaubatz S. Lindeman G.J. Ishida S. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Livingston D.M. Rempel R.E. Mol.

SW13 and TSUPr-1 cells were infected with either GFP or p16ink4a-encoding adenoviruses, and protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked with formaldehyde and immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for E2F4 and Dbf4 (nonspecific control). Approximately equal recruitment of E2F4 at RNRII, TS, and DHFR promoters was observed in the presence or absence of SWI/SNF (Fig. 3A). Thus, SWI/SNF activity is apparently not required for the recruitment of E2F4 to these promoters.FIGURE 3SWI/SNF is dispensable for RB-related pocket proteins and E2F4 association at RNRII, TS, and DHFR promoters. All experiments utilized SW13 (lanes 1 and 2) and TSUPr-1 (lanes 3 and 4) cells infected with either GFP (lanes 1 and 3) or p16ink4a (lanes 2 and 4)-encoding adenoviruses. ChIP assays were performed with antibodies for E2F4 and Dbf4 (A) (nonspecific), p107 and Dbf4 (B), p130 and Dbf4 (C), and Brm and Dbf4 (D). Input and immunoprecipitated DNA were amplified by PCR with primers specific for the RNRII, TS, and DHFR promoters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As the subsequent step in transcriptional repression, pocket proteins are believed to be recruited to promoters to facilitate the transcriptional repression. For these analyses, SW13 and TSUPr-1 cells were infected with either GFP or p16ink4a to activate endogenous pocket proteins, and recruitment of p107 and p130 to the promoters was then determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We observed differential recruitment of p107 and p130 to the respective promoters. Specifically, there was a general trend toward loss of p107 with p16ink4a expression (Fig. 3B), which is countered by enhanced p130 recruitment to the promoters (Fig. 3C). These findings are consistent with the differential involvement of p107 and p130 in promoter regulation in quiescent versus proliferative cells (42Balciunaite E. Spektor A. Lents N.H. Cam H. Te Riele H. Scime A. Rudnicki M.A. Young R. Dynlacht B.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 8166-8178Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 43Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, this differential recruitment occurred in both SWI/SNF-proficient and -deficient cells, indicating that p107/p130 recruitment to chromatin is SWI/SNF-independent.Lastly, SWI/SNF ATPase recruitment to the promoters was determined. As shown in Fig. 3D, Brm protein present in TSUPr-1 cells is associated with all of the promoters analyzed. As expected, Brm was absent at the promoters in SW13 cells, consistent with the documented lack of Brm expression in this model (35Strobeck M.W. Reisman D.N. Gunawardena R.W. Betz B.L. Angus S.P. Knudsen K.E. Kowalik T.F. Weissman B.E. Knudsen E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4782-4789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Strikingly, Brm is present at the promoters of RNRII, DHFR, and TS irrespective of p16ink4a expression (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 and 4). This finding suggests that SWI/SNF complexes are contributing to the physiological regulation of the promoters both during unperturbed cell cycle progression and during active repression and are not required for the recruitment of E2F or pocket proteins to the promoters.RB-induced Deacetylation at RNRII, TS, and DHFR Promoters Is Mediated by HDACs in the Presence of SWI/SNF—Pocket proteins are believed to repress transcription by facilitating alterations in chromatin structure that are mediated via the recruitment of additional co-repressors (10Roberts C.W.

However, the extent to which these multiple chromatin-modifying enzymes act in concert to mediate transcription is not well documented. To initially investigate chromatin modifications and corresponding dependence on SWI/SNF for this process, we examined histone deacetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed utilizing anti-acetyl histone H4 antibody (Fig. 4A). As expected, infection with p16ink4a resulted in significant histone deacetylation at the RNRII, TS, and DHFR promoters in SWI/SNF-proficient TSUPr-1 cells. In contrast, p16ink4a infection failed to induce histone H4 deacetylation at the promoters in SWI/SNF-deficient SW13 cells. Thus, these data suggest that whereas recruitment of E2F and pocket proteins to these promoters is SWI/SNF-independent, the histone deacetylation of these promoters is SWI/SNF-dependent.FIGURE 4RB-induced deacetylation at RNRII, TS, and DHFR promoters is mediated by HDACs and dependent on SWI/SNF. A, SW13 and TSUPr-1 cells were infected with GFP or p16ink4a-encoding adenoviruses. ChIP assays were performed with antibody specific for acetylated histone H4. Real-time PCR was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the GFP control was set to 100. Error bars represent the mean ± S.D.; n = 3. B, TSUPr-1 cells were infected with GFP (lane 1), GFP+ TSA (lane 2), p16ink4a (lane 3), or p16ink4a and TSA (lane 4) for 18–24 h. Total RNA was extracted and reversed-transcribed into cDNA. This cDNA was subjected to linear PCR amplification with specific primers for the indicated genes. C, TSUPr-1 cells were infected and treated with TSA as indicated in panel B. Total protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the indicated proteins were detected by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To address the functional role of histone deacetylation, we suppressed histone deacetylase activity using the pharmacological inhibitor of HDAC, TSA. For these analyses, SWI/SNF-proficient TSUPr-1 cells were infected with adenoviruses encoding GFP or p16ink4a in the presence or absence of TSA for 18–24 h. The administration of TSA alone did not have a significant effect on target gene expression. However, TSA was able to partially reverse the transcriptional repression induced by p16ink4a, as observed at both the RNA (Fig. 4B) and protein levels (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that HDAC activity contributes to the SWI/SNF-mediated transcriptional repression of these target promoters.Recruitment of HDAC1 and mSin3B at the RNRII, TS, and DHFR Promoters Is Dependent on SWI/SNF Activity—Multiple HDAC complexes have been implicated in RB-mediated transcriptional repression, many of which contain the Sin3 subunits (47Harbour J.W.

An inframe deletion in mitN of the mitomycin biosynthetic pathway was generated in Streptomyces lavendulae to produce the DHS5373 mutant strain. Investigation of DHS5373 revealed continued production of mitomycin A and mitomycin C in addition to the accumulation of a new mitomycin analog, 9-epi-mitomycin C. The mitN gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the histidine-tagged protein (MitN) was purified to homogeneity. Reaction of 9-epi-mitomycin C with MitN in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine yielded mitomycin E showing that the enzyme functions as an aziridine N-methyltransferase. Likewise, MitN was also shown to convert mitomycin A to mitomycin F under the same reaction conditions. We conclude that MitN plays an important role in a parallel biosynthetic pathway leading to the subclass of mitomycins with 9α-stereochemistry but is not involved directly in the biosynthesis of mitomycins A and C.

However, MC also has detrimental side effects such as myelosuppression and gastrointestinal damage (10Verweij J. Pinedo H.M. Cancer Chemother. Biol. Response Modif. 1990; 11: 67-73PubMed Google Scholar). During the past 50 years numerous mitomycin derivatives have been prepared and evaluated in an effort to overcome these clinical limitations (11Kasai M. Arai H. Expert Opin. Ther. Pat. 1995; 5: 757-770Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The naturally occurring mitomycins are classified into three groups based on the constituents at the C-9 position as follows: (i) 9β-carbamoylmethyl, (ii) 9α-carbamoylmethyl, and (iii) 9-methylene (Fig. 1). Within these groups, the structures are further differentiated by the substituents at C-7, C-9a, and N-1a. Precursor incorporation experiments demonstrated that the mitosane skeleton is derived from the coupling of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (12Anderson M.G. Kibby J.J. Rickards R.W. Rothschild J.M. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1980; : 1277-1278Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and d-glucosamine (13Hornemann U. Kehrer J.P. Nunez C.S. Ranieri R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similarly, feeding experiments also revealed that the carbamoyl group at C-10 arises from l-arginine or l-citrulline (14Hornemann U. Eggert J.H. J. Antibiot. 1975; 28: 841-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas the N- and O-methyl moieties originate from l-methionine (15Bezanson G.S. Vining L.C. Can. J. Biochem. 1971; 49: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the biosynthetic origin of the mitomycins was revealed over two decades ago, the specific order of assembly leading to this family of natural products remains largely unknown. Recently, we reported the identification and analysis of the mitomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces lavendulae NRRL 2564 (16Mao Y.Q. Varoglu M. Sherman D.H. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 251-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This particular organism produces mitomycins C and A, as well as smaller amounts of mitomycin B (Fig. 1). It has been suggested that mitomycin A may be the direct precursor of mitomycin C because mitomycin A was found as the predominant compound in earlier stages of fermentation, but its concentration decreases in later stages, whereas the concentration of mitomycin C increases (2Wakaki K. Huromo H. Tomioka K. Shimizu G. Kato E. Kamada H. Kudo S. Fujimoto Y. Antibiot. Chemother. 1958; 8: 228-240PubMed Google Scholar). To unravel the downstream tailoring steps of mitomycin biosynthesis, we have focused on the roles of three S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyltransferases (encoded by mmcR, mitM, and mitN) identified previously in the mitomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (16Mao Y.Q. Varoglu M. Sherman D.H. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 251-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). MmcR shows high sequence similarity to a number of methyltransferases that are associated with gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of phenol-containing compounds such as puromycin and calicheamycin (17Lacalle R.A. Ruiz D. Jimenez A. Gene. 1991; 109: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Ahlert J. Shepard E. Lomovskaya N. Zazopoulos E. Staffa A. Bachmann B.O. Huang K.X. Fonstein L. Czisny A. Whitwam R.E. Farnet C.M. Thorson J.S. Science. 2002; 297: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The role of MmcR in installing the 7-O methyl groups of mitomycins A and B has been verified through in vivo and in vitro studies (19Gruöschow S. Chang L.C. Mao Y. Sherman D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 6470-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast to MmcR, sequence analysis indicates that MitM and MitN are similar to d-glucose O-methyltransferases associated with indolocarbazole natural products (e.g. AtmM: 36% identity, 52% similarity (20Gao Q.J.

Therefore, we initially hypothesized that MitM and MitN are involved in C-9a side chain methylation for mitomycin biosynthesis. Our previous studies had shown that a mitM deletion mutant was blocked in MA and MC production but accumulated mitomycin B (MB) and a new mitomycin analog, 9a-demethylmitomycin A (6) (27Varoglu M. Mao Y.Q. Sherman D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6712-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the conversion of 9a-demethyl-MA by MitM in the presence of AdoMet resulted in 9-epi-mitomycinB(7) instead of the expected MA, demonstrating that MitM functions as an aziridine N-methyltransferase (27Varoglu M. Mao Y.Q. Sherman D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6712-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that acts on the 9β series of mitomycins. Here we describe studies on a mitN in-frame deletion mutant as part of a continuing effort to investigate the role of methyltransferases in the late stages of the mitomycin pathway. The mitN mutant strain of S. lavendulae was unable to produce MB and accumulated a new mitomycin analogue, 9-epi-mitomycin C(10). The production of MC and MA was unaffected by the deletion of mitN. In the presence of MitN and AdoMet, 9-epi-MC was converted to a new product, mitomycin E (12). These results show that MitN is also an aziridine N-methyltransferase that is involved in tailoring of the 9α-series of mitomycins. General Procedures—NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer operating at 500 MHz for 1H and 125 MHz for 13C, using solvent signals as internal references. High-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) of 9-epi-MC were measured on a Finnigan MAT 90/95 sector-field mass spectrometer, and HR-CIMS of ME was measured on a Micromass ZAB-SE mass spectrometer. IR spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer 1600 series Fourier-transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer. The optical rotations were measured on a Jasco DIP-370 digital polarimeter. The concentration of MitN was determined with a Beckman DU640 UV spectrophotometer. A Beckman Coulter System Gold autosampler, pump, and photodiode array detector were used in the HPLC separation and analyses. Materials—All solvents were of HPLC grade and were used without further purification. S. lavendulae NRRL 2564 was used as the source strain for creation of gene disruption mutants. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on Merck silica gel G-254 plates. Chromatography—The isolation of 9-epi-MC and the conversion reactions were monitored by TLC using Merck silica gel 60F-254 aluminum sheets. TLC plates were developed in 10% methanol in chloroform. Column chromatography was performed on 32–63-μm particle size silica gel (Scientific Absorbents Inc.). Final purification of 9-epi-MC and MitN enzyme kinetic analyses was accomplished using HPLC (Alltech Econosil C18; 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; 20–60% aqueous methanol in 20 min, 60% for 4 min, and 60–100% in 2 min at 1 ml/min; monitored at 313 and 360 nm). Bacterial Strains and Cloning Vectors—Escherichia coli DH5α was routinely used as a cloning host and was propagated on LB medium. E. coli S17-1 was used as a conjugation host for gene transfer from E. coli to S. lavendulae. Conjugation was performed using AS1 medium, and chromosomal double crossover recombination was selected on R5 media as described previously (28Mao Y.Q. Varoglu M. Sherman D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) was the protein overexpression host in NZCYM media. pUC119 was the cloning vector in E. coli, and the E. coli-Streptomyces conjugative shuttle vector pKC1139 was used to create disruption mutants in S. lavendulae. pET28b was used for protein overexpression in E. coli BL21(DE3). Creation of MitN Disruption Mutant of S. lavendulae—The mitN in-frame deletion mutant was constructed in a two-step process. In the first step, a mitM insertional disruption mutant bearing the kanamycin resistance gene was created (MM106) (29Mao Y. Molecular and Genetic Analysis of Mitomycin C Biosynthesis in Streptomyces lavendulae. 2000; (Ph.D. thesis, p. , University of Minnesota, Minneapolis): 191Google Scholar). To generate this mutant, the pUC119-based plasmid bearing mitM and mitN (pDHS7608) was digested with Bpu11021, which cuts mitM, and then blunt-ended. This vector was ligated with a 1.4-kb ApaL1-HindIII fragment (aphII) from pFD666 (30Denis F. Brzezinski R. Gene. 1992; 111: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) to create pDHS7705. The insertion of the aphII gene in the Bpu11021 site results in the disruption of mitM as well as kanamycin resistance. The 3.9-kb BamHI insert was cloned into the shuttle vector pKC1139 to generate pDHS7706. In the next step, the mitN in-frame deletion mutant construct was generated. A 1.9-kb mitN upstream fragment (MTF12) and a 1.3-kb downstream fragment (MTF33) were amplified with two pairs of primers: primer f1 (5′-GC TCT AGA TCT ACG TCT CCC GCG-3′ (XbaI)) and primer r2 (5′-GC CTC GAG CGT CAT GCC GCT CAC TTT-3′ (XhoI)) for MTF12 and primer f3 (5′-GC CTC GAG TAG GGC TCC CAC GGG AGG-3′ (XhoI)) and primer r3 (5′-GC AAG CTT CGG CAT CAC GCG CCA-3′ (HindIII)) for MTF33. MTF12, the mitN upstream fragment, contains the nonmutated version of mitM. Three-way ligation of the XbaI/XhoI-digested MTF12, XhoI/HindIII-digested MTF33, and the XbaI/HindIII-digested pUC119 resulted in pDHS7709, in which a nondisrupted version of mitM was in its original orientation to the start of mitN and mitN was replaced with a XhoI site. pDHS7710 was created by subcloning the 3.2-kb XbaI/HindIII inserted from pDHS7709 into pKC1139. A two-step recombination strategy was used to create the mitN in-frame deletion mutant DHS5373. First, the mitM insertional mutant (MM106) was created by conjugating the disruption mutant pDHS7706 into the wild-type S. lavendulae NRRL 2564 according to the methods described previously (28Mao Y.Q. Varoglu M. Sherman D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mao Y. Molecular and Genetic Analysis of Mitomycin C Biosynthesis in Streptomyces lavendulae. 2000; (Ph.D. thesis, p. , University of Minnesota, Minneapolis): 191Google Scholar). Transconjugates that were both apramycin- and kanamycin-resistant were selected on AS1 plates (31Baltz R.H. Dev. Ind. Microbiol. 1980; 21: 43-54Google Scholar), overlaid with apramycin, kanamycin, and nalidixic acid, and propagated on R5T plates (32Mazodier P. Petter R. Thompson C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3583-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) at 39 °C for several generations. As the origin of the shuttle vector is temperature-sensitive, the presence of the insertional disruption on the chromosome was monitored by the phenotype shifting from both apramycin- and kanamycin-resistant to apramycin-sensitive and kanamycin-resistant. Southern blot hybridizations were used to verify the genotype of the insertional mutant (data not shown). The mitN deletion mutant (DHS5373) was created by conjugating pDHS7710 into MM106, the mitM insertional mutant (29Mao Y. Molecular and Genetic Analysis of Mitomycin C Biosynthesis in Streptomyces lavendulae. 2000; (Ph.D. thesis, p. , University of Minnesota, Minneapolis): 191Google Scholar). Deletion mutants were screened for phenotype change from apramycin- and kanamycin-resistant to apramycin- and kanamycin-sensitive. In this mutant, mitN was deleted from the chromosome, and the nondisrupted mitM was restored. Deletion of mitN in DHS5373 was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization (data not shown). Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of MitN—For the construction of the mitN overexpression vector, an NdeI site was introduced at the translational start codon of mitN with primer f5 (5′-GTG AGC CAT ATG ACG GAA ACC GCG TCC GC-3′ (NdeI)). With pDHS7608 containing the mitMN genes as template and M13/pUC reverse sequencing primer as the other PCR primer pair, a 1.45-kb fragment was amplified. The resulting fragments were digested with NdeI-HindIII and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pET28b to generate pDHS5155. The overexpressed proteins were engineered to include an N-terminal His6 tag. pDHS5515 was transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain for overexpression of MitN. E. coli was grown at 37 °C in NZCYM broth containing 50 μl/ml kanamycin until A600 = 0.6. Expression of MitN was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and reducing the temperature to 25 °C. After incubating the culture overnight, cells were harvested, suspended in ice-cold buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), and lysed by sonication (6 × 10 s with 10-s pauses at 200–300 watts). The supernatant collected by centrifuging the lysate at 10,000 × g at 4 °C was applied to a Qiagen nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The column was washed twice with wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole) followed by dissolving the protein in elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 imidazole). The eluent was desalted by passing it through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted in 50 mm potassium buffer, pH 7.4. MitN was further concentrated on an Amicon Ultra 10-kDa centrifugal device. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The final concentration of MitN was 190 μm (6.1 mg/ml). Protein size was estimated by analytical gel filtration (Sephadex 200) on an Akta FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). Enzyme Assays—Enzymatic conversion of MitN with 9-epi-MC and MA was carried out in a total volume of 50 μlin 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 200 μm AdoMet, an appropriate quantity of substrate, and 1 μm purified enzyme. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and were terminated by being extracted twice with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were dried under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in 40 μl of methanol, and subjected to TLC and HPLC analysis. New products from several standard enzymatic reactions were isolated and purified by reverse phase HPLC and subjected to NMR and mass spectral analyses. For kinetic analyses, conversion was measured by analytical HPLC. Preliminary experiments determined the parameters of initial rates of conversion, and these conditions were used to determine kinetic values of MitN with MA, 9-epi-MC, and AdoMet. Samples were run in triplicate. Curves were fitted using Prism3 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The ability of divalent cations to enhance the conversion of MA to MF by MitN was assessed. Reactions were performed in duplicate under the same conditions as described previously but with the addition of 1 mm EDTA, Ca2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+. The final concentrations of AdoMet and MA were 200 and 250 μm, respectively. 9-epi-MC was not used as a substrate because of the small amount of material available. Fermentation Conditions—The mitN mutant (DHS5373) of S. lavendulae was grown on R2YE agar medium for 7 days. A single colony was selected, inoculated into 50 ml of seed medium (tryptic soy broth), and grown at 30 °C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm). After 48 h, 500 μl of the seed medium was inoculated into 500 ml of the production culture (Nishikohri medium) (33Nishikohri K. Fukui S. Eur. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 2: 129-155Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and grown under the same conditions for 96 h. Metabolite Isolation—The fermentation broth was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extract was dried in vacuo to yield a tart brown oil. Crude extract was dissolved in methanol and loaded on a Sephadex LH-20 column (2.5 × 120 cm, methanol). MA was eluted first followed by 9-epi-MC and MC, respectively. The eluted fractions were combined based on the TLC profiles. The combined fraction that contained 9-epi-MC was further purified by silica gel column chromatography using a stepped gradient elution (2% MeOH/CHCl3 to 50% MeOH/CHCl3) followed by reverse phase HPLC to afford 9-epi-MC. The fractions containing MA and MC were purified in a similar fashion to yield 0.23 mg/liter MA and 4.93 mg/liter MC. The structure of MA was confirmed by comparison of the 1H NMR and mass spectral data with an authentic sample. Creation of a mitN Deletion Mutant—A mitN deletion mutant (DHS5373) was created from the S. lavendulae mitM insertional mutant strain MM106 (29Mao Y. Molecular and Genetic Analysis of Mitomycin C Biosynthesis in Streptomyces lavendulae. 2000; (Ph.D. thesis, p. , University of Minnesota, Minneapolis): 191Google Scholar). The mutants were screened for phenotype change from kanamycin, apramycin double resistant to double sensitive, and confirmed by the correct band shift with Southern blot hybridization (data not shown). DHS5373 had identical growth characteristics as wild-type S.-lavendulae. The two-dimensional TLC analysis of the crude extract showed production of MC (3), MA (1), and a new purple-pigmented compound. Interestingly, MB (8), which is typically produced by the S. lavendulae wild-type strain cultured under the same growth conditions, was not observed in the extract of DHS5373. Isolation and Structure Elucidation of a New Mitomycin Intermediate—To identify the structure of the accumulated intermediate, DHS5373 was fermented in 6 liters of Nishikohri medium (33Nishikohri K. Fukui S. Eur. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 2: 129-155Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After 96 h, the fermentation broth was centrifuged, and the supernatant was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The organic extract was combined and dried in vacuo to yield a brown oil (652 mg). The crude extract was subjected to gel permeation (LH-20) column chromatography using methanol as the eluent. MA (1) eluted first followed by the newly accumulated intermediate 9-epi-MC (10) and MC (3), respectively. The fractions that contained compound 9-epi-MC were combined, concentrated, and applied to a silica gel column chromatography followed by reverse phase HPLC to afford 0.65 mg/liter 9-epi-MC. For the MA- and MC-containing fractions, the purification was performed in a similar fashion to provide MA (0.23 mg/liter) and MC (4.93 mg/liter). The structures of both MA and MC were confirmed by comparing the corresponding 1H NMR spectra with authentic materials. The HR-CIMS data of 9-epi-MC provided a molecular ion peak (M + H)+ at m/z 335.1346, which suggested a molecular formula of C15H18N4O5 and nine double bond equivalents. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 9-epi-MC (Table 1) provided a data set similar to that of MC, with the large chemical shift difference observed for protons and carbons at positions 1, 2, 9, and the methoxy group. The connectivities of the carbon and hydrogen atoms of 9-epi-MC were confirmed to be identical to that of MC by the interpretation of HMBC spectral data (Table 1). With respect to stereochemistry, C-1, C-2, and C-9a of 9-epi-MC were assigned as depicted in Fig. 1 based on biosynthetic correlation with all other naturally occurring mitomycins (34Hornemann U. Heins M.J. J. Org. Chem. 1985; 50: 1301-1302Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because 9-epi-MC possesses physical properties that are unique compared with MC (i.e. NMR spectral data and Rf value), we proposed it to be a diastereomer possessing the 9α-instead of 9β-carbamoyloxymethyl configuration. To substantiate further the proposed structure of 9-epi-MC, the stereochemistry for the C-9 —C-10 bond was determined by GOESY experiments. Irradiation of OCH3 (C-9a, δ 3.31) resulted in enhancements of H-3 (δ3.58) and H-10′ (δ 4.64). Although no direct result was observed on H-9, these data clearly suggested that H-1, H-3, H-10′, and OCH3 protons lie in the same plane, whereas H-9 does not. Hence, the results from the GOESY experiments further confirmed the α-configuration of C-9 of 9-epi-MC.TABLE 1NMR spectral data for 9-epi-mitomycin C and mitomycin C in Me2SO-d-6C/H no.9-epi-Mitomycin CMitomycin CδCaRecorded at 75 MHz.δHbRecorded at 500 MHz.,cNumbers in parentheses = J in Hz.HMBCdCarbons showing long-range correlation with indicated protons.δCaRecorded at 75 MHz.δHaRecorded at 75 MHz.,cNumbers in parentheses = J in Hz.136.402.66 d (4.5)H-335.352.79 d (5.1)234.622.90 br d (4.5)H-331.472.70 br d (5.1)350.853.58 d (12.3)49.13Overlapped with OCH33.74 d (12.3)5176.99H-6a176.905a155.50H-3155.186102.83H-6a102.606a8.181.66 s8.281.66 s7149.50H-6a148.928175.27175.218a110.57109.09944.773.63 dd (10.2, 3.3)40.344.01 br d (10.2)9a103.82H-1, H-10, OCH3105.751059.244.09 dd (10.5, 3.3)60.874.09 t (10.2)4.64 t (10.5)4.56 dd (10.2, 3.9)10a157.08H-10156.51OCH350.703.31 s49.603.10 sa Recorded at 75 MHz.b Recorded at 500 MHz.c Numbers in parentheses = J in Hz.d Carbons showing long-range correlation with indicated protons. Open table in a new tab Overexpression and Purification of MitN—The MitN gene product is predicted to be an acidic protein (pI = 4.59) that consists of 275 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of ∼30 kDa. To determine the role of MitN in the biosynthesis of the mitomycins, the protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Production of MitN in the soluble form was achieved by adding very low concentrations of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm), and the protein was purified to homogeneity using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (supplemental Fig. 1). Purified MitN protein was shown by gel filtration chromatography to have a molecular mass of ∼32 kDa, suggesting that it exists in solution as a monomer (data not shown). MitN Converts 9-epi-MC (10) to Mitomycin E (12)—The disruption of mitN resulted in production of MA and MC (slight increase in production level, 3.0 mg/liter in the wild-type S. lavendulae, 4.93 mg/liter in DHS5373) with accumulation of 9-epi-MC. Interestingly, MB, which was found in the wild-type extract cultured under the same conditions, was not observed in the DHS5373 extract. This result indicates that MitN is unlikely to be involved in the biosynthesis of MA and MC but is essential to the biosynthesis of MB. To probe the role of MitN in the mitomycin biosynthetic pathway, compound 9-epi-MC was used as a substrate for MitN in the presence of AdoMet. As a result, the enzymatic reaction yielded another purple compound with a higher Rf value by TLC analysis. To identify the structure of this newly formed product, the ethyl acetate extract from the reaction was subjected to reverse phase HPLC and subsequent NMR and mass spectral analyses. The HR-CIMS measurement of the conversion product ME provided a m/z [M + Na]+ 371.1331 analyzing for a molecular formula of C16H20N4O5, which contains one more carbon and two additional protons compared with 9-epi-MC. The 1H NMR spectrum of ME revealed a methyl proton signal at δ 2.27 (supplemental Table 1) that was absent in the 1H NMR spectrum of 9-epi-MC. This methyl group was placed on the aziridine nitrogen based on the HMBC correlation observed from C-2 (δ 46.75) to the methyl group at δ 2.22. To confirm the stereochemistry of C9-C10, a GOESY experiment was conducted on ME, which the H-9 signal irradiated and which resulted in the enhancements of H-1 (δ 2.66) and H-10 (δ 4.64) but not OCH3, providing evidence to support the 9α-carbamoyloxymethyl configuration of ME. Hence, the structure is identified as ME (Fig. 1). ME was previously reported as a natural product with a low production profile, and accompanying spectral data were lacking (5Kono M. Kasai M. Shirahata K. Morimoto M. J. Antibiot. 1990; 43: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have included the NMR assignments of ME in supplemental Table 1. To test further the substrate specificity characteristics of MitN, a series of mitomycin compounds including MA, MB, MC, MD, and MH were investigated as possible substrates for the enzyme. In addition, the ability of MitN to methylate an intermediate isolated from the ΔmmcR mutant 7-demethyl-MA (Fig. 1 (19Gruöschow S. Chang L.C. Mao Y. Sherman D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 6470-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) was assayed. In the presence of AdoMet and MitN, only MA was converted to a new product, but no products were observed for the other mitomycins tested using the same reaction conditions. The MA conversion product was shown to be MF (Fig. 1) by TLC, HPLC, and 1H"

Because they differ in only 16 of their 505 amino acids, the regulatory preferences must arise from amino acid residues that are not common between hGDH1 and hGDH2. To our knowledge none of the mutagenesis studies on the hGDH isozymes to date have identified the amino acid residues fully responsible for the different regulatory preferences between hGDH1 and hGDH2.

The chimeric enzymes by reciprocal swapping resulted in double mutations in amino acid sequences at 415 and 443 residues that are not common between hGDH1 and hGDH2 and are located in the C-terminal 48-residue “antenna” helix, which is thought to be part of the regulatory domain of mammalian GDHs. Functional analyses revealed that the doubly mutated chimeric enzymes almost completely acquired most of the different regulatory preferences between hGDH1 and hGDH2 for electrophoretic mobility, heat-stability, ADP activation, palmitoyl-CoA inhibition, and l-leucine activation, except for GTP inhibition. Our results indicate that substitutions of the residues in the antenna region may be important evolutionary changes that led to the adaptation of hGDH2 to the unique metabolic needs of the nerve tissue.

On top of this domain is a “NAD binding” domain that rotates about 20° during catalysis (7Smith T.J. Schmidt T. Fang J. Wu J. Siuzdak G. Stanley C.A. J. Mol.

Partial deficiency of GDH has been reported in some patients with cerebellar degeneration, suggesting that the enzymes are important in brain function (10Hussain M.H. Zannis V.I. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GDH has shown neuroprotective value in model systems where glutamate reuptake is inhibited (11Gorovitis R. Avidan N. Avisar N. Shaked I. Vardimon L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7024-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that inhibition of GDH expression by antisense oligonucleotides was toxic to cultured mesencephalic neurons, with dopaminergic neurons being affected at the early stages of this inhibition (12Plaitakis A. Shashidharan P. J. Neurol. 2000; 247: 25-35Google Scholar). The existence of the hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome further highlights the importance of GDH in the regulation of insulin secretion and indicates that GDH has an important role in regulating hepatic ureagenesis (13Stanley C.A.

In the human, GDH exists in a housekeeping isozyme (hGDH1) encoded by the GLUD1 gene and a neural and testicular tissue-specific isozyme (hGDH2) encoded by the GLUD2 gene (15Shashidharan P.

Although the two GDH isozymes are highly homologous (showing a 97% amino acid identity), they differ markedly in their regulatory properties such as heat stability and allosteric regulation by ADP, l-leucine, and GTP (3Zaganas I.

Because the hGDH isozymes differ in only 16 of their 505 amino acids, these functional differences must arise from amino acid residues that are not common between hGDH1 and hGDH2. Reciprocally interchanging amino acids that are different between hGDH isozymes within the regulatory domain may reveal the residues important for preference in hGDH isozymes. Recent studies of structure-function relationships using site-directed mutagenesis of hGDH1 at single sites differing from hGDH2 showed that the R443S and the G456A change reproduced some but not all of the properties of hGDH2 (3Zaganas I.

In addition, several other residues differing between hGDH isozymes also have been examined by many investigators (4Yang S.-J. Huh J.-W. Hong H.-N. Kim T.U. Cho S.-W.

These results suggest that additional amino acid changes should be responsible for the unique properties of the brain-specific hGDH2 isozyme. To our knowledge, none of the single or multiple mutagenesis studies on the hGDH isozymes up to date have identified the amino acid residues fully responsible for the different regulatory properties between the hGDH1 and hGDH2. Our objective is to identify these critical residues by multiple mutagenesis. In this study we selected two such residues, Met-415 and Arg-443, because they are the only two amino acid residues that are different between hGDH1 and hGDH2 within the C-terminal 48-residue antenna region, which is thought to be part of the regulatory domain of mammalian GDH (7Smith T.J.

Using cassette mutagenesis, we constructed hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 (amino acid segment 390–448 of hGDH1 replaced by the corresponding hGDH2 segment) and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 (amino acid segment 390–448 of hGDH2 replaced by the corresponding hGDH1 segment) by swapping the corresponding amino acid segments between 390 and 448 regions in hGDH1 and hGDH2. The mutated cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble proteins, and the chimeric forms of hGDH isozymes were purified to homogeneity and studied with respect to their kinetic and regulatory characteristics. The functional and evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed. Materials—ADP, GTP, palmitoyl-CoA, and l-leucine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2,5-ADP-Sepharose and Resource-Q were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. All other chemicals and solvents were reagent grade or better. E. coli DH5α (18Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8098) Google Scholar) was purchased from Invitrogen and used as the host strain for plasmid-mediated transformations for cassette mutagenesis.

Berlyn, E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT) lacked both GDH and glutamate synthase activities (19Teller J.K. Smith R.J. McPherson M.J. Engel P.C. Guest J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and was used to test plasmids for GDH activity. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (20Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar) was used for high level expression of the recombinant enzymes. Construction of hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 Chimeric Enzymes—Using cassette mutagenesis, we created two double mutations, each containing both of two amino substitutions at 415 and 443 sites in the same polypeptide chain. The strategy to construct the chimeric enzymes is shown in Fig. 1. Synthetic hGDH1 and hGDH2 genes used in this study were previously constructed in our laboratory (4Yang S.-J. Huh J.-W. Hong H.-N. Kim T.U. Cho S.-W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. Ahn J.-Y. Lee E.-Y. Lee J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3205-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using cassette mutagenesis, the construction of hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 (amino acid segment 390–448 of hGDH1 replaced by the corresponding hGDH2 segment) and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 (amino acid segment 390–448 of hGDH2 replaced by the corresponding hGDH1 segment) was carried out by swapping the corresponding amino acid segments between 390 and 448 regions in hGDH1 and hGDH2. For this construct, the plasmids containing hGDH1 gene (21Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. Ahn J.-Y. Lee E.-Y. Lee J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3205-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and hGDH2 gene (4Yang S.-J. Huh J.-W. Hong H.-N. Kim T.U. Cho S.-W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were separately double-digested with AflII and NheI, and the large and small fragments were isolated from the agarose gel. The small and large fragments were then cross-ligated to produce the chimeric constructs hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)GDH1 and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)GDH2. The successful construction of the chimeric enzymes was confirmed by dideoxy-DNA sequencing analysis. Expression and Purification of Chimeric Enzymes—The chimeric constructs were separately transformed into E. coli/DE3 for overexpression. Fresh overnight cultures of the E. coli/DE3 were used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cell was grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 1.0, and then isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, each E. coli/DE3 was grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C and then harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were suspended in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed with a sonicator. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the crude extracts were loaded onto an 2,5-ADP-Sepharose column (1.5 × 5 cm) that was equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The column was washed with buffer A until the breakthrough peak of protein had been eluted. The enzyme was then performed using a NaCl step gradient that went from 0 to 300 mm in 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions containing GDH activity were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a fast protein liquid chromatograph Resource-Q anion exchange column equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The enzyme was then eluted using a linear gradient made with buffer B in increasing concentrations of NaCl up to 500 mm at 1 ml/min. The purified enzyme was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies previously produced in our laboratory (22Jang S.H. Kim A.Y. Bahn J.H. Eum W.S. Kim D.W. Park J. Lee K.S. Kang T.-C. Won M.H. Kang J.H. Kwon O.-S. Yoon H.-Y. Lee E.-Y. Cho S.-W. Choi S.Y. Exp. Mol. Med. 2003; 35: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Additional N-terminal residues (MIEGR) were removed by treatment with factor Xa (10 μg/1 mg of GDH) and purified by a HPLC gel filtration method as described before (4Yang S.-J. Huh J.-W. Hong H.-N. Kim T.U. Cho S.-W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. Ahn J.-Y. Lee E.-Y. Lee J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3205-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). HPLC-purified proteins were subjected to automated amino acid sequencing. Enzyme Assay and Kinetics—Steady state kinetic parameters were determined with the purified proteins unless otherwise indicated. Enzyme assays were performed by monitoring reduced coenzyme absorbance at 340 nm. Because E. coli only has an NADP+-dependent GDH (19Teller J.K. Smith R.J. McPherson M.J. Engel P.C. Guest J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the enzyme assay was performed with NADH as a coenzyme. All assays were performed in duplicate, and initial velocity data were correlated with a standard assay mixture of 1 ml containing 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0, 100 mm ammonium acetate, 0.1 mm NADH, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. Enzyme assay was performed in the presence of 1 mm ADP unless otherwise indicated. The reaction started with the addition of α-ketoglutarate to 2 mm final concentration. The Km values were calculated by linear regression analysis of double-reciprocal plots, and catalytic efficiency was estimated by use of the equation v/[E0] = (kcat/Km)[S] (24Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 98-120Google Scholar). For the heat stability studies, the hGDH isozymes were incubated at 45 °C in the absence of ADP. At various times, aliquots were withdrawn to determine remaining activities by the addition of the standard assay mixture in the presence of 1 mm ADP. Regulation of Chimeric Enzymes—Effects of allosteric regulators on GDH activities were examined by incubating the enzyme with the allosteric effectors at various concentrations in the assay buffer at 25 °C. At intervals after the initiation with the effectors, aliquots were withdrawn for the assay of GDH activity. Regulation of the hGDH isozymes and the chimeric enzymes by ADP or l-leucine was studied by adding ADP (0–1 mm final concentrations) or l-leucine (0–5 mm final concentrations) to the reaction mixture at various concentrations while keeping the other substrates constant. We also explored the effect of ADP and l-leucine used together at various concentrations on hGDH isozymes and chimeric mutants. ADP (0–1 mm) was added to the reaction mixture that contained l-leucine at various concentrations (0–5 mm). GTP inhibition and palmitoyl-CoA inhibition were studied by adding GTP (0–100 μm final concentrations) or palmitoyl-CoA (0–10 μm final concentrations) at various concentrations to the standard reaction mixture in the presence of 1 mm ADP. For the thermal stability studies, the wild-type and chimeric enzymes were incubated in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at 45 °C in the presence of 1 mm ADP. At various times, aliquots were withdrawn, and the remaining activities were assayed by the addition of the standard assay mixture. Construction, Expression, and Purification of hGDH1-(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 Chimeric Enzymes—We have reported construction of synthetic hGDH1 and hGDH2 genes and expression of hGDH1 and hGDH2 isozymes from E. coli as soluble proteins (4Yang S.-J. Huh J.-W. Hong H.-N. Kim T.U. Cho S.-W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. Ahn J.-Y. Lee E.-Y. Lee J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3205-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using cassette mutagenesis, the construction of hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 (amino acid segment 390–448 of hGDH1 replaced by the corresponding hGDH2 segment) and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 (amino acid segment 390–448 of hGDH2 replaced by the corresponding hGDH1 segment) was carried out by swapping the corresponding amino acid segments in hGDH1 and hGDH2 (Fig. 1). The chimeric enzymes by reciprocal swapping resulted in double mutations in amino acid sequences at 415 and 443 residues that are not common between hGDH1 and hGDH2. In the wild-type hGDH isozymes, the 415 site is Met in hGDH1 and Leu in hGDH2, and the 443 site is Arg in hGDH1 and Ser in hGDH2. In hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1, the 415 site is Leu and the 443 site is Ser, whereas in hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2, the 415 site is Met and the 443 site is Arg (Fig. 1). High level expression of the chimeric enzymes was achieved in E. coli strain DE3 upon induction with 1 mm isopropyl-l-d-thiogalactose at 37 °C for 3 h. Analysis of crude cell extracts by Western blot showed that expression levels of hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 were almost identical to those of wild-type hGDH isozymes (data not shown). The expressed enzymes were purified by ADP-Sepharose column and fast protein liquid chromatograph Resource-Q column. To remove five additional N-terminal residues (MIEGR) that were introduced to create an initiation codon and a factor Xa recognition site, the purified enzymes were treated with factor Xa, purified by an HPLC Protein-Pak 300SW gel filtration column, and subjected to automated Edman degradation. N-terminal sequence analysis of the first eight amino acids was identical with the published sequence of the mature hGDH isozymes (15Shashidharan P. Michaelidis T.M. Robakis N.K. Kresovali A. Papamatheakis J. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16971-16976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Julliard J. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3427-3438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified wild-type hGDH2 was estimated to be ∼96% pure by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Compared with hGDH1, the hGDH2 protein is more basic and shows a slightly lower electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2A). These differences are consistent with the electrophoretic characteristics of hGDH isozymes as reported by other investigators (15Shashidharan P. Michaelidis T.M. Robakis N.K. Kresovali A. Papamatheakis J. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16971-16976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, when the amino acid segment 390–448 of hGDH1 was replaced by the corresponding hGDH2 segment to make hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1, it was found to show the same electrophoretic mobility as hGDH2 (Fig. 2A). Likewise, when the amino acid segment 390–448 from the hGDH1 is spliced onto human GDH2, the electrophoretic mobility of hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 was almost identical to that of hGDH1. These results suggest that the amino acid differences at 415 and 443 sites within the antenna region are responsible for the electrophoretic mobility of the hGDH isozymes. Heat Stability of hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2—The relative resistance of hGDH2 to thermal inactivation was determined by incubation of the enzyme at 45 °C, pH 7.0. Heat inactivation proceeded faster for hGDH2 (half-life = 45 min) than for hGDH1 (half-life = 310 min) (Fig. 2B), supporting the previous observation that hGDH1 is the heat-stable form, and hGDH2 is the heat-labile form of human GDH (4Yang S.-J. Huh J.-W. Hong H.-N. Kim T.U. Cho S.-W. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Shashidharan P. Clarke D.D. Ahmed N. Moschonas N. Plaitakis A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1804-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 chimeric enzymes showed the reciprocal changes in thermal stability of hGDH isozymes. hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 abolished the heat lability of hGDH2 and changed the half-life of hGDH2 from 45 to ∼280 min at 45 °C, which is comparable with that of hGDH1 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 abolished the heat stability of hGDH1, and the result obtained with hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 was similar to that observed with hGDH2 (Fig. 2B). Previously, we reported that single replacement of Ser by Arg at hGDH2 position 443 abolished the heat lability of hGDH2 and changed the half-life of hGDH2 to almost the same as that of hGDH1, whereas single mutagenesis at several other sites (L415M, A456G, and H470R) that are different between hGDH1 and hGDH2 did not show any change in thermal stability (5Mastorodemos V. Zaganas I. Spanaki C. Bessa M. Plaitakis A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, the influence of heat stability on hGDH isozymes caused by swapping amino acid segment 390–448 is mainly due to the difference of the amino acid at the 443 site, which is Arg in hGDH1 and Ser in hGDH2. Catalytic Properties of hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2—To evaluate more detailed catalytic properties for the wild-type hGDH isozymes and the chimeric enzymes, the enzyme efficiencies (kcat/Km) for the individual substrates were determined. The catalytic and kinetic properties of hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 were not altered. The apparent Km values for α-ketoglutarate and NADH were essentially similar for all wild-type and mutant proteins as of 79 ∼ 86 μm and 1.25 ∼ 1.39 mm for NADH and α-ketoglutarate, respectively (Table 1). These results suggest that substitutions at position 415 and 443 site might have no appreciable effect on the affinity of hGDH isozymes for both substrate and coenzyme. However, there was an ∼30% increase in kcat values of wild-type hGDH2 (130 s–1) and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 (127 s–1) compared with that of the wild-type hGDH1 (104 s–1) and hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 (105 s–1). The increased enzyme efficiency (kcat/Km) of wild-type hGDH2 and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2, therefore, results from the increase in kcat values. Western blot analysis showed that expression levels of hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 were almost identical to those of wild-type hGDH isozymes (data not shown). In addition, hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 were purified by the same methods as was the wild-type hGDH isozymes, indicating that no gross conformational change in the chimeric enzymes had occurred. Therefore, the difference in the kcat values between hGDH1 and hGDH2 is probably not due to the amino acid differences at 415 and 443 sites within the antenna region but due to the rest of the amino acids not common between hGDH1 and hGDH2.TABLE 1Kinetic properties of hGDH isozymes and chimeric enzymesEnzymekcatKm-NADHKm-α-KGkcat/Km-NADHkcat/Km-α-KGs-1μmmms-1 μm-1s-1 mm-1hGDH1104811.251.2883.2hGDH2130861.391.5193.5hGDH1(hGDH2390-448)hGDH1105791.281.3382.0hGDH2(hGDH1390-448)hGDH2127801.371.5992.7 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 by Palmitoyl-CoA—Palmitoyl-CoA induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of hGDH isozymes. Palmitoyl-CoA especially exerted a power inhibitory effect on the hGDH2. In contrast, hGDH1 was less sensitive to palmitoyl-CoA inhibition. When the segment 390–448 from the hGDH2 is spliced onto human GDH1 to make hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1, it was found to show almost identical sensitivity to palmitoyl-CoA inhibitory aspects of hGDH2 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 resulted in the resistance to palmitoyl-CoA inhibition that is comparable with that of wild-type hGDH1 (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that the amino acid differences at 415 and 443 sites within the antenna region are responsible for the different sensitivity to inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA of hGDH1 and hGDH2. Activation of hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 and hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2 by ADP—There were differences in the sensitivity to ADP between hGDH1 and hGDH2. Although hGDH1 was activated by ADP at a hyperbolic manner, the ADP stimulatory curves of hGDH2 showed a sigmoidal pattern typically found in allosteric regulation. When the segment 390–448 from the hGDH1 is spliced onto hGDH2 to make hGDH2(hGDH1390–448)hGDH2, it was found to show almost identical sensitivity to ADP regulatory aspects of hGDH1 (Fig. 3B). Similarly, replacing amino acid segment 390–448 of hGDH1 with the corresponding region of hGDH2 to produce chimeric hGDH1(hGDH2390–448)hGDH1 resulted in the activation by ADP at a sigmoidal manner that is comparable with that of wild-type hGDH2 but substantially different from that of the wild-type hGDH1 (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that"
