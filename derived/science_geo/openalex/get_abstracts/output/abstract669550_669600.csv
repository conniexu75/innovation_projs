https://openalex.org/W3133501852,"A newly identified coronavirus, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), has spread rapidly from its epicenter in China to more than 150 countries across six continents. In this study, we have designed three reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) primer sets to detect the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid protein (N) genes of SARS CoV-2. For one tube reaction, the detection limits for five combination SARS CoV-2 LAMP primer sets (RdRP/E, RdRP/N, E/N, RdRP/E/N and RdRP/N/Internal control (actin beta)) were evaluated with a clinical nasopharyngeal swab sample. Among the five combination, the RdRP/E and RdRP/N/IC multiplex LAMP assays showed low detection limits. The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay were evaluated and compared to that of the widely used Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene, Inc., Seoul, South Korea) and PowerChek™ 2019-nCoV Real-time PCR kit (Kogenebiotech, Seoul, South Korea) for 130 clinical samples from 91 SARS CoV-2 patients and 162 NP specimens from individuals with (72) and without (90) viral respiratory infections. The multiplex RdRP (FAM)/N (CY5)/IC (Hex) RT-LAMP assay showed comparable sensitivities (RdRP: 93.85%, N: 94.62% and RdRP/N: 96.92%) to that of the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (100%) and superior to those of PowerChek™ 2019-nCoV Real-time PCR kit (RdRP: 92.31%, E: 93.85% and RdRP/E: 95.38%)."
https://openalex.org/W3135348956,"In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, we aimed to analyze the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, risk factors for mortality and impact of COVID-19 on outcomes of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients compared to a cohort of non transplant patients, evaluating if transplantation could be considered a risk factor for mortality. From March to May 2020, 261 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated, including 41 SOT recipients. Of these, thirty-two were kidney recipients, 4 liver, 3 heart and 2 combined kidney-liver transplants. Median time from transplantation to COVID-19 diagnosis was 6 years. Thirteen SOT recipients (32%) required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and 5 patients died (12%). Using a propensity score match analysis, we found no significant differences between SOT recipients and non-transplant patients. Older age (OR 1.142; 95% [CI 1.08–1.197]) higher levels of C-reactive protein (OR 3.068 ; 95% [CI 1.22–7.71]) and levels of serum creatinine on admission (OR 3.048 95% [CI 1.22–7.57]) were associated with higher mortality. The clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort of SOT recipients appear to be similar to that observed in the non-transplant population. Older age, higher levels of C-reactive protein and serum creatinine were associated with higher mortality, whereas SOT was not associated with worse outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3133557841,"We construct a novel database containing hundreds of thousands geotagged messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic sent on Twitter. We create a daily index of social distancing—at the state level—to capture social distancing beliefs by analyzing the number of tweets containing keywords such as “stay home”, “stay safe”, “wear mask”, “wash hands” and “social distancing”. We find that an increase in the Twitter index of social distancing on day t-1 is associated with a decrease in mobility on day t. We also find that state orders, an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, precipitation and temperature contribute to reducing human mobility. Republican states are also less likely to enforce social distancing. Beliefs shared on social networks could both reveal the behavior of individuals and influence the behavior of others. Our findings suggest that policy makers can use geotagged Twitter data—in conjunction with mobility data—to better understand individual voluntary social distancing actions."
https://openalex.org/W3133752412,"Frailty is considered to be a complex concept based mainly on physical vulnerability, but also vulnerabilities in mental/psychological and social aspects. Frailty can be reversible with appropriate intervention; however, factors that are important in recovering from frailty have not been clarified. The aim of the present study was to identify factors that help an individual reverse frailty progression and characteristics of individuals that have recovered from frailty. Community-dwelling people aged ≥75 years who responded to the Kihon Checklist (KCL) were enrolled in the study. The KCL consists of 25 yes/no questions in 7 areas: daily-life related activities, motor functions, nutritional status, oral functions, homebound, cognitive functions, and depressed mood. The number of social activities, degree of trust in the community, degree of interaction with neighbors, and subjective age were also evaluated. Frailty was assessed based on the number of checked items: 0–3 for robust, 4–7 for pre-frailty, and ≥8 for frailty. A total of 5050 participants were included for statistical analysis. At the time of the baseline survey in 2016, 18.7% (n = 942) of respondents had frailty, and the follow-up survey showed that the recovery rate from frailty within 2 years (median 24 months) was 31.8% (n = 300). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that exercise-based social participation (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–3.4; P &lt;0.01) and self-rated health (OR 1.2, CI 1.0–1.5; P = 0.02) were related to reversing frailty progression. Principal component analysis indicated that the main factors constituting the first principal component (contribution rate, 18.3%) included items related to social capital, such as interaction with neighbors, trust in the community, and number of social participation activities. Our results demonstrate that exercise-based social participation and high self-rated health have associations with reversing frailty progression. Individuals that recovered from frailty are characterized by high individual-level social capital components (i.e., trust in community, interaction with neighbors, and social participation)."
https://openalex.org/W3135706268,"COVID-19 is a global threat with an increasing number of infections. Research on IgG seroprevalence among health care workers (HCWs) is needed to re-evaluate health policies. This study was performed in three pandemic hospitals in Istanbul and Kocaeli. Different clusters of HCWs were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seropositivity rate among participants was evaluated by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. We recruited 813 non-infected and 119 PCR-confirmed infected HCWs. Of the previously undiagnosed HCWs, 22 (2.7%) were seropositive. Seropositivity rates were highest for cleaning staff (6%), physicians (4%), nurses (2.2%) and radiology technicians (1%). Non-pandemic clinic (6.4%) and ICU (4.3%) had the highest prevalence. HCWs in “high risk” group had similar seropositivity rate with “no risk” group (2.9 vs 3.5 p = 0.7). These findings might lead to the re-evaluation of infection control and transmission dynamics in hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W3135760945,"Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has been suggested as a useful tool to assess fatigue-sensitive psychological operations. The present study uses a between and within-subject design with a cognitively demanding task and a documentary viewing condition, to examine the temporal profile of HRV during reactivity, Time-on-Task (ToT), and recovery. In the cognitive task group, participants worked on a bimodal 2-back task with a game-like character (the Gatekeeper task) for about 1.5 hours, followed by a 12-minute break, and a post-break block of performance (about 18 min). In the other group, participants watched documentaries. We hypothesized an increasing vagal-mediated HRV as a function of Time spent on the Gatekeeper task and no HRV change in the documentary viewing group. We also analyzed the trial-based post-response cardiac activity as a physiological associate of task-related motivation. Relative to the documentary-viewing, ToT was associated with an elevated level of subjective fatigue, decreased heart rate, and increased HRV, particularly in the vagal-mediated components. Based on fatigued participants’ post-error cardiac slowing, and post-error reaction time analyses, we found no evidence for motivation deficits. The present findings suggest that the parasympathetic branch of the autonomous nervous system functioning as a relaxation system tends to be activated under increasing mental fatigue. In addition, the study shows that many HRV indices also seem to change when individuals are engaged in a prolonged, less fatiguing activity (e.g. documentary viewing). This finding emphasizes the relevance of comparisons/control conditions in ToT experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3134008627,"Background Both negative and positive associations between social networking service (SNS) usage and mental health have been suggested by previous studies; however, their differences by type of SNS and age remain unclear. We addressed this issue based on the frequency of traditional communication such as face-to-face and non-face-to-face communication (e.g., phone, email, and letters). Methods In total, 8,576 individuals participated, including 2,543 aged 18–39, 3,048 aged 40–64, and 2,985 aged over 65 years. They were asked to indicate their frequency of SNS usage, both for posting and checking, of LINE (a popular message application in Japan), Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, with frequent usage defined as posting or checking more than a few times a week. To determine mental health status, WHO-5 (i.e., well-being), K6 (i.e., distress symptoms), and feelings of loneliness were assessed. Multiple and logistic regression analyses were adjusted for the frequency of traditional communication. To avoid type 1 error, a Bonferroni correction of p ≤ 0.002 was applied in the regression models ( p = 0.05/18, a number of regression models). Results The most frequently used SNS across the three age groups was LINE; frequent usage (both posting and checking) among older adults was independently associated with better well-being. Frequent posting on Facebook was associated with better well-being in middle-aged adults. Young adults who frequently checked on Instagram showed a tendency toward better well-being and lower distress symptoms. On the contrary, frequent usage of Twitter was associated with distress symptoms or feelings of loneliness across all three age groups. Conclusions We found generational and SNS-type-dependent negative and positive associations between SNS use and mental health, indicating the possible influences of SNS use and the importance of non-SNS communication."
https://openalex.org/W3134255248,"Since the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the question regarding the efficacy of various hygiene measures and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) has become the focus of scientific and above all public discussion. To compare respirators, medical face masks, and cloth masks and determine if it is recommendable to wear face masks to protect the individual wearer of the mask from inhaling airborne particles, we challenged 29 different masks with aerosols and tested the pressure drop as a surrogate for breathing resistance owing to the mask material. We found that Type II medical face masks showed the lowest pressure drop (12.9±6.8 Pa/cm 2 ) and therefore additional breathing resistance, whereas respirators such as the KN95 (32.3±7.0 Pa/cm 2 ) and FFP2 (26.8±7.4 Pa/cm 2 ) showed the highest pressure drops among the tested masks. The filtration efficacy of the mask material was the lowest for cloth masks (28±25%) followed by non-certified face masks (63±19%) and certified medical face masks (70±10%). The materials of the different respirators showed very high aerosol retentions (KN95 [94±4%] and FFP2 [98±1%]). For evaluating the as-worn filtration performance simulating real live conditions each mask type was also tested on a standardized dummy head. Cloth masks and non-EN-certified face masks had the worst as-worn filtration efficacies among the tested masks, filtering less than 20% of the test aerosol. Remarkably, certified type II medical face masks showed similar (p&gt;0.5) as-worn filtration results (47±20%) than KN95 masks (41±4%) and FFP2 masks (65±27%), despite having a lower pressure drop. Face shields did not show any significant retention function against aerosols in our experiment. Our results indicate that it seems recommendable to wear face masks for providing base protection and risk reduction against inhaling airborne particles, in low-risk situations. In our study, especially EN 14683 type II certified medical face masks showed protective effectiveness against aerosols accompanied by minimal additional breathing resistance. FFP2 Respirators, on the other hand, could be useful in high-risk situations but require greater breathing effort and therefore physical stress for users."
https://openalex.org/W3133492263,"Aims The trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) pathway is related to intestinal microbiota and has been associated to risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We investigated associations between four plasma metabolites in the TMAO pathway and risk of all-cause mortality, CVD and deterioration in renal function in individuals with type 2-diabetes (T2D) and albuminuria. Materials and methods Plasma concentrations of TMAO, choline, carnitine, and betaine were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at baseline in 311 individuals with T2D and albuminuria. Information on all-cause mortality and fatal/non-fatal CVD during follow-up was obtained from registries. The association of each metabolite, and a weighted sum score of all four metabolites, with the endpoints were examined. Serum creatinine was measured at follow-up visits and the renal endpoint was defined as eGFR-decline of ≥30%. Associations were analysed using proportional hazards models adjusted for traditional risk factors. Results Baseline mean(SD) age was 57.2(8.2) years and 75% were males. Follow-up was up to 21.9 years (median (IQR) follow-up 6.8 (6.1–15.5) years for mortality and 6.5 (5.5–8.1) years for CVD events). The individual metabolites and the weighted sum score were not associated with all-cause mortality (n = 106) or CVD (n = 116) (adjusted p≥0.09). Higher choline, carnitine and the weighted sum score of the four metabolites were associated with higher risk of decline in eGFR (n = 106) (adjusted p = 0.001, p = 0.03 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). Conclusions In individuals with T2D and albuminuria, higher choline, carnitine and a weighted sum of four metabolites from the TMAO pathway were risk markers for deterioration in renal function during long-term follow-up. Metabolites from the TMAO pathway were not independently related to risk of all-cause mortality or CVD."
https://openalex.org/W3133806278,"Objectives In the present study, the relationship between family functioning, differentiation of self and trait anxiety was examined. In addition, differences in trait anxiety and differentiation of self according to sex were studied. It was also checked whether family functioning predicted the achieved degree of differentiation of self, and whether family functioning and differentiation of self predicted the level of trait anxiety. Finally, it was analyzed whether the level of differentiation of self mediated the relationship between family functioning and trait anxiety. Methods The study involved 185 Spanish participants, aged between 18 and 56 years and the scales used were the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale-20Esp (FACES-20Esp), the Differentiation of Self Scale (EDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results The results indicated that family functioning was related to differentiation of self and trait anxiety, and that differentiation of self was related to trait anxiety. In addition, according to sex, differences were found in the degree of differentiation of self and in the I Position, with a higher score for men, as well as in Emotional Reactivity and trait anxiety, with higher scores for women. It was also observed that family functioning predicted the level of differentiation of self, and that differentiation of self and family functioning predicted trait anxiety. Finally, it was found that the relationship between family functioning and trait anxiety was partially mediated by differentiation of self. Conclusions There are relationships between family functioning, differentiation of self and trait anxiety, and there are differences in differentiation of self and trait anxiety based on sex. The relevance of the results and their implications for clinical practice are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3134056803,"Population ageing requires society to adjust by ensuring additional types of services and assistance for elderly people. These may be provided by either organized services and sources of informal social support. The latter are especially important since a lack of social support is associated with a lower level of psychological and physical well-being. During the Covid-19 pandemic, social support for the elderly has proven to be even more crucial, also due to physical distancing. Therefore, this study aims to identify and describe the various types of personal social support networks available to the elderly population during the pandemic. To this end, a survey of Slovenians older than 64 years was conducted from April 25 to May 4, 2020 on a probability web-panel-based sample (n = 605). The ego networks were clustered by a hierarchical clustering approach for symbolic data. Clustering was performed for different types of social support (socializing, instrumental support, emotional support) and different characteristics of the social support networks (i.e., type of relationship, number of contacts, geographical distance). The results show that most of the elderly population in Slovenia has a satisfactory social support network, while the share of those without any (accessible) source of social support is significant. The results are particularly valuable for sustainable care policy planning, crisis intervention planning as well as any future waves of the coronavirus."
https://openalex.org/W3135643485,"Novel chemistry for vector control is urgently needed to counter insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. Here a new meta-diamide insecticide, broflanilide (TENEBENALTM), was evaluated in East African experimental huts in Moshi, northern Tanzania. Two consecutive experimental hut trials with broflanilide 50WP were conducted; the first evaluating the efficacy of three concentrations, 50 mg/m2, 100 mg/m2, and 200 mg/m2 using a prototype formulation, and the second trial evaluating an improved formulation. The IRS treatments were applied on both mud and concrete surfaces and efficacy was monitored over time. The mortality, blood-feeding inhibition and exiting behaviour of free-flying wild mosquitoes was compared between treatment arms. Additionally, cone assays with pyrethroid-susceptible and resistant mosquito strains were conducted in the huts to determine residual efficacy. The first trial showed a dosage-mortality response of the prototype formulation and 3-8 months of residual activity, with longer activity on concrete than mud. The second trial with an improved formulation showed prolonged residual efficacy of the 100 mg/m2 concentration to 5-6 months on mud, and mosquito mortality on the concrete surface ranged between 94-100% for the full duration of the trial. In both trials, results with free-flying, wild Anopheles arabiensis echoed the mortality trend shown in cone assays, with the highest dose inducing the highest mortality and the improved formulation showing increased mortality rates. No blood-feeding inhibition or insecticide-induced exiting effects were observed with broflanilide. Broflanilide 50WP was effective against both susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant mosquito strains, demonstrating an absence of cross resistance between broflanilide and pyrethroids. The improved formulation, which has now been branded VECTRONTM T500, resulted in a prolonged residual efficacy. These results indicate the potential of this insecticide as an addition to the arsenal of IRS products needed to maintain both control of malaria and resistance management of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W3135267077,"Ecological niche models (ENMs) aim to recreate the relationships between species and the environments where they occur and allow us to identify unexplored areas in geography where these species might be present. These models have been successfully used in terrestrial organisms but their application in aquatic organisms is still scarce. Recent advances in the availability of species occurrences and environmental information particular to aquatic systems allow the evaluation of these models. This study aims to characterize the niche of the Sabaleta Brycon henni Eigenmann 1913, an endemic fish of the Colombian Andes, using ENMs to predict its geographical distribution across the Magdalena Basin. For this purpose, we used a set of environmental variables specific to freshwater systems in addition to the customary bioclimatic variables, and species' occurrence data to model its potential distribution using the Maximum Entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). We evaluate the relative importance between these two sets of variables, the model's performance, and its geographic overlap with the IUCN map. Both on-site (annual precipitation, minimum temperature of coldest month) and upstream variables (open waters, average minimum temperature of the coldest month and average precipitation seasonality) were included in the models with the highest predictive accuracy. With an area under the curve of 90%, 99% of the species occurrences and 68% of absences correctly predicted, our results support the good performance of ENMs to predict the potential distribution of the Sabaleta and the utility of this tool in conservation and decision-making at the national level."
https://openalex.org/W3134958871,"Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an acute infectious disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and is transmitted by mosquitoes. Meteorological conditions are known to play a pivotal role in the spread of JEV. In this study, a zero-inflated generalised additive model and a long short-term memory model were used to assess the relationship between the meteorological factors and population density of Culex tritaeniorhynchus as well as the incidence of JE and to predict the prevalence dynamics of JE, respectively. The incidence of JE in the previous month, the mean air temperature and the average of relative humidity had positive effects on the outbreak risk and intensity. Meanwhile, the density of all mosquito species in livestock sheds (DMSL) only affected the outbreak risk. Moreover, the region-specific prediction model of JE was developed in Chongqing by used the Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the JE dynamics and helps the local government establish precise prevention and control measures."
https://openalex.org/W3135280944,"Objective Cervical remodeling is an important component in determining the pathway of parturition; therefore, assessing changes in cervical tissue composition may provide information about the cervix’s status beyond the measurement of cervical length. Photoacoustic imaging is a non-invasive ultrasound-based technology that captures acoustic signals emitted by tissue components in response to laser pulses. This optical information allows for the determination of the collagen-to-water ratio (CWR). The purpose of this study was to compare the CWR evaluated by using spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) imaging in cervical samples obtained from pregnant and non-pregnant women. Methods This cross-sectional study comprised cervical biopsies obtained at the time of hysterectomy (n = 8) and at the scheduled cesarean delivery in pregnant women at term who were not in labor (n = 8). The cervical CWR was analyzed using a fiber-optic light-delivery system integrated to an ultrasound probe. The photoacoustic signals were acquired within the range of wavelengths that cover the peak absorption of collagen and water. Differences in the CWR between cervical samples from pregnant and non-pregnant women were analyzed. Hematoxylin and eosin and Sirius Red stains were used to compare the collagen content of cervical samples in these two groups. Results Eight cervix samples were obtained after hysterectomy, four from women ≤41 years of age and four from women ≥43 years of age; all cervical samples (n = 8) from pregnant women were obtained after 37 weeks of gestation at the time of cesarean section. The average CWR in cervical tissue samples from pregnant women was 18.7% (SD 7.5%), while in samples from non-pregnant women, it was 55.0% (SD 20.3%). There was a significantly higher CWR in the non-pregnant group compared to the pregnant group with a p-value &lt;0.001. A subgroup analysis that compared the CWR in cervical samples from pregnant women and non-pregnant women ≤41 years of age (mean 46.3%, SD 23.1%) also showed a significantly higher CWR (p &lt;0.01). Lower collagen content in the pregnancy group was confirmed by histological analysis, which revealed the loss of tissue composition, increased water content, and collagen degradation. Conclusion The proposed bimodal ultrasound and sPA imaging system can provide information on the biochemical composition of cervical tissue in pregnant and non-pregnant women. Photoacoustic imaging showed a higher collagen content in cervical samples from non-pregnant women as compared to those from pregnant women, which matched with the histological analysis. This novel imaging method envisions a new potential for a sensitive diagnostic tool in the evaluation of cervical tissue composition."
https://openalex.org/W3134212458,"MaxEnt is an important aid in understanding the influence of climate change on species distributions. There is growing interest in using IPCC-class global climate model outputs as environmental predictors in this work. These models provide realistic, global representations of the climate system, projections for hundreds of variables (including Essential Climate Variables), and combine observations from an array of satellite, airborne, and in-situ sensors. Unfortunately, direct use of this important class of data in MaxEnt modeling has been limited by the large size of climate model output collections and the fact that MaxEnt can only operate on a relatively small set of predictors stored in a computer’s main memory. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of a Monte Carlo method that overcomes this limitation by finding a useful subset of predictors in a larger, externally-stored collection of environmental variables in a reasonable amount of time. Our proposed solution takes an ensemble approach wherein many MaxEnt runs, each drawing on a small random subset of variables, converges on a global estimate of the top contributing subset of variables in the larger collection. In preliminary tests, the Monte Carlo approach selected a consistent set of top six variables within 540 runs, with the four most contributory variables of the top six accounting for approximately 93% of overall permutation importance in a final model. These results suggest that a Monte Carlo approach could offer a viable means of screening environmental predictors prior to final model construction that is amenable to parallelization and scalable to very large data sets. This points to the possibility of near-real-time multiprocessor implementations that could enable broader and more exploratory use of global climate model outputs in environmental niche modeling and aid in the discovery of viable predictors."
https://openalex.org/W3134329898,"The objective of this study was to analyse reports on adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from Germany in the particularly vulnerable patient group of children and adolescents. Reporting characteristics, demographic parameters and off-label use were examined among others. The ratio of ADR reports per number of German inhabitants and the ratio of ADR reports per number of German inhabitants exposed to drugs were calculated and compared. These parameters were examined to derive trends in reporting of ADRs. 20,854 spontaneous ADR reports for the age group 0–17 years were identified in the European ADR database EudraVigilance for the time period 01.01.2000–28.02.2019 and analysed with regard to the aforementioned criteria. 86.5% (18,036/20,854) of the ADR reports originated from Healthcare Professionals and 12.2% (2,546/20,854) from non-Healthcare Professionals. 74.4% (15,522/20,854) of the ADR reports were classified as serious. The proportion of ADR reports per age group was 11.8% (0–1 month), 11.0% (2 months—1 year), 7.4% (2–3 years), 9.3% (4–6 years), 25.8% (7–12 years), and 34.8% (13–17 years) years, respectively. Male sex slightly dominated (51.2% vs. 44.8% females). Only 3.5% of the ADR reports reported off-label use. The annual number of ADR reports increased since 2000, even if set in context with the number of inhabitants and assumed drug-exposed inhabitants. The pediatric population declined in the study period which argues against its prominent role for the increase in the total number of ADR reports. Instead, among others, changes in reporting obligations may apply. The high proportion of serious ADR reports underlines the importance of pediatric drug safety."
https://openalex.org/W3135214233,"Healthcare workers (HCW) treating COVID-19 patients are at high risk for infection and may also spread infection through their contact with vulnerable patients. Smell loss has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is unknown whether monitoring for smell loss can be used to identify asymptomatic infection among high risk individuals. In this study we sought to determine if tracking smell sensitivity and loss using an at-home assessment could identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCW.We performed a prospective cohort study tracking 473 HCW across three months to determine if smell loss could predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk group. HCW subjects completed a longitudinal, behavioral at-home assessment of olfaction with household items, as well as detailed symptom surveys that included a parosmia screening questionnaire, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our main measures were the prevalence of smell loss in SARS-CoV-2-positive HCW versus SARS-CoV-2-negative HCW, and timing of smell loss relative to SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 17 (3.6%) of 473 HCW. HCW with SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to report smell loss than SARS-CoV-2-negative HCW on both the at-home assessment and the screening questionnaire (9/17, 53% vs 105/456, 23%, P < .01). 6/9 (67%) of SARS-CoV-2-positive HCW reporting smell loss reported smell loss prior to having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and smell loss was reported a median of two days before testing positive. Neurological symptoms were reported more frequently among SARS-CoV-2-positive HCW who reported smell loss compared to those without smell loss (9/9, 100% vs 3/8, 38%, P < .01).In this prospective study of HCW, self-reported changes in smell using two different measures were predictive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Smell loss frequently preceded a positive test and was associated with neurological symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3133841631,"Impacts of climate change can differ substantially across species’ geographic ranges, and impacts on a given population can be difficult to predict accurately. A commonly used approximation for the impacts of climate change on the population growth rate is the product of local changes in each climate variable (which may differ among populations) and the sensitivity (the derivative of the population growth rate with respect to that climate variable), summed across climate variables. However, this approximation may not be accurate for predicting changes in population growth rate across geographic ranges, because the sensitivities to climate variables or the rate of climate change may differ among populations. In addition, while this approximation assumes a linear response of population growth rate to climate, population growth rate is typically a nonlinear function of climate variables. Here, we use climate-driven integral projection models combined with projections of future climate to predict changes in population growth rate from 2008 to 2099 for an uncommon alpine plant species, Douglasia alaskana , in a rapidly warming location, southcentral Alaska USA. We dissect the causes of among-population variation in climate change impacts, including magnitude of climate change in each population and nonlinearities in population response to climate change. We show that much of the variation in climate change impacts across D . alaskana’ s range arises from nonlinearities in population response to climate. Our results highlight the critical role of nonlinear responses to climate change impacts, suggesting that current responses to increases in temperature or changes in precipitation may not continue indefinitely under continued changes in climate. Further, our results suggest the degree of nonlinearity in climate responses and the shape of responses (e.g., convex or concave) can differ substantially across populations, such that populations may differ dramatically in responses to future climate even when their current responses are quite similar."
https://openalex.org/W3134808810,"This paper examines long-term developments in stadium attendance in professional football in the Netherlands. As in many other European countries attendance had a U-shaped development with the lowest numbers in the mid-1980s. The developments in the Netherlands do not seem to have been affected by hooliganism but by socioeconomic factors. Furthermore, the association with stadium attendance in other European leagues in particular the English Premier League is very high. This suggests that stadium attendance is affected not only by national developments but also by common international trends in the interest in football matches."
https://openalex.org/W3134965842,"This article provides information about the psychometric limitations of the original Compound Psychological Capital Scale (CPC-12) and suggests a revised version CPC-12R, a free-to-use measure of Psychological Capital. The investigation consisted of three studies: two of these identified psychometric limitations of the original scale, and the third presented the revised version of the scale. The first study did not confirm the hypothesized four-factor structure of the CPC-12 on a sample of Czech teachers (n = 282) and found psychometric limitations in the resilience subscale. The second study identified the same problem using secondary analyses of the original data from two samples of German employees (n = 202 and 321 respectively). The third study proposed a revised version of the scale with new items for resilience, and provided support for reliability and factorial validity of the new CPC-12R on a sample of Czech employees (n = 333). CPC-12R demonstrated a better fit to the theoretically supported model of Psychological Capital than CPC-12, and further displays adequate psychometric properties to be recommended for application in both research and practice."
https://openalex.org/W3134677237,"The aim of this study is to determine whether basic housing, financial, and food insecurities in part explain the relationship between childhood neglect and violence as documented in the “cycle of violence” literature. Using a prospective cohort design, neglected children (under the age of 12) with court substantiated histories (1967–1971) in one metropolitan Midwest area and demographically matched non-neglected children were followed into adulthood. Housing, financial, and food insecurities were assessed in 2003–2005 interviews at mean age 41. Official arrest data were used to measure violence ever and from 2003 through 2013. Mediation was tested using probit structural equation modeling. Controlling for age, sex, and race, childhood neglect predicted violent arrests and housing, financial, and food insecurities in middle adulthood. Housing and financial securities predicted violent arrests ever and after 2003, whereas food insecurity only predicted any violent arrest ever. Housing and financial insecurities partially mediated the relationship between childhood neglect and violent criminal behavior. Greater attention and efforts need to focus on providing basic housing, financial, and food support for neglected children to reduce their risk for violent criminal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3134749722,"In this study, the effects of sea ice and wind speed on the timing and composition of phytoplankton spring bloom in the central and southern Baltic Sea are investigated by a hydrodynamic–biogeochemical model and observational data. The modelling experiment compared the results of a reference run in the presence of sea ice with those of a run in the absence of sea ice, which confirmed that ecological conditions differed significantly for both the scenarios. It has been found that diatoms dominate the phytoplankton biomass in the absence of sea ice, whereas dinoflagellates dominate the biomass in the presence of thin sea ice. The study concludes that under moderate ice conditions (representing the last few decades), dinoflagellates dominate the spring bloom phytoplankton biomass in the Baltic Sea, whereas diatoms will be dominant in the future as a result of climate change i.e. in the absence of sea ice."
https://openalex.org/W3135030258,"African swine fever virus is highly contagious, and mortality rates reach up to 100% depending on the host, virus dose, and the transmission routes. The main objective of this study was to develop a network-based simulation model for the farm-level transmission of ASF virus to evaluate the impact of changes in farm connectivity on ASF spread in Vietnam. A hypothetical population of 1,000 pig farms was created and used for the network-based simulation, where each farm represented a node, and the connection between farms represented an edge. The three scenarios modelled in this way (baseline, low, and high) evaluated the impact of connectivity on disease transmission. The median number of infected farms was higher as the connectivity increased (low: 659, baseline: 968 and high: 993). In addition, we evaluated the impact of the culling strategy on the number of infected farms. A total of four scenarios were simulated depending on the timing of culling after a farm was infected. We found that the timing of culling at 16, 12, 8, and 6 weeks had resulted in a reduction of the number of median infected farms by 81.92%, 91.63%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Finally, our evaluation of the implication of stability of ties between farms indicated that if the farms were to have the same trading partners for at least six months could significantly reduce the median number of infected farms to two (95th percentile: 413) than in the basic model. Our study showed that pig movements among farms had a significant influence on the transmission dynamics of ASF virus. In addition, we found that the either timing of culling, reduction in the number of trading partners each farm had, or decreased mean contact rate during the outbreaks were essential to prevent or stop further outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3134526173,"Variance and covariance components of growth and production traits were analyzed employing REML animal model to assess the Dahlem Red (PD-3) chicken population for direct additive genetic, maternal effects and to estimate the estimated breeding value (EBV), genetic parameters, genetic trends and rate of inbreeding (ΔF) utilizing seven generation's data. The generation and hatch had significant (P≤0.01) effect on the body weight at 0 day (BW0), 2 (BW2), 4 (BW4) and 6 weeks (BW6) and shank length at six weeks of age (SL6). The average least squares means (LSM) for BW6 and SL6 were 273.93±0.62 g and 53.97±0.05 mm, respectively. All the production traits were significantly (P≤0.01) influenced by generation and hatch. The average LSM for age at sexual maturity (ASM), egg production up to 40 weeks (EP40) and egg mass up to 40 weeks (EM40) were 168.82±0.25 d, 72.60±0.41 eggs and 4.21±0.07 kg, respectively. Model 5 with additive direct, maternal genetic, maternal permanent environmental and residual variance components was the best for BW0, BW2 and BW4 based on the AIC values obtained in WOMBAT. Model 4 was the best model for BW6, SL6, ASM, EP40 and EM40 with additive direct, maternal permanent environmental and residual variance components. Maternal effects were higher during early age, decreased with age, and remained present until 20 weeks of age. The heritability (h2) estimates were low to moderate in magnitude for all the growth traits and ranged from 0.02±0.03 to 0.19±0.03. The maternal heritability was high at hatch (0.35±0.06), decreased gradually until 4th week (0.02±0.01) and ceased afterwards. The heritabilities of EP40 (0.11±0.03) and EM40 (0.12±0.04) were low. The direct additive genetic correlations (ra) between BW2, BW4, BW6 and SL6 were high and positive (P≤ 0.05). The additive genetic and maternal permanent environmental correlation between EP40 and EM40 were high and positive (P≤ 0.05). The EBV of EM40 was significant (P≤ 0.05) with 0.48 kg/generation in PD-3 chicken at the end of the seventh generation. The EBV of EP40 showed an increasing trend with a genetic gain of 1.87 eggs per generation. The average inbreeding coefficient of the population was 0.019 and average ΔF was 0.007 over the last seven generations of selection. The EBV trends for primary and associated traits showed linear trends in the desired direction and negligible inbreeding."
https://openalex.org/W3134678726,"The vertical vibration compaction method (VVCM), heavy compaction method and static pressure method were used to form phyllite specimens with different degrees of weathering. The influence of cement content, compactness, and compaction method on the mechanical properties of phyllite was studied. The mechanical properties of phyllite was evaluated in terms of unconfined compressive strength ( R c ) and modulus of resilience ( E c ). Further, test roads were paved along an expressway in China to demonstrate the feasibility of the highly weathered phyllite improvement technology. Results show that unweathered phyllite can be used as subgrade filler. In spite of increasing compactness, phyllite with a higher degree of weathering cannot meet the requirements for subgrade filler. With increasing cement content, R c and E c of the improved phyllite increases linearly. R c and E c increase by at least 15% and 17%, respectively, for every 1% increase in cement content and by at least 10% and 6%, respectively, for every 1% increase in compactness. The higher the degree of weathering of phyllite, the greater the degree of improvement of its mechanical properties."
https://openalex.org/W3135039046,"Background Primary care is the major point of access in most health systems in developed countries and therefore for the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. The quality of its IT systems, together with access to the results of mass screening with Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, makes it possible to analyse the impact of various concurrent factors on the likelihood of contracting the disease. Methods and findings Through data mining techniques with the sociodemographic and clinical variables recorded in patient’s medical histories, a decision tree-based logistic regression model has been proposed which analyses the significance of demographic and clinical variables in the probability of having a positive PCR in a sample of 7,314 individuals treated in the Primary Care service of the public health system of Catalonia. The statistical approach to decision tree modelling allows 66.2% of diagnoses of infection by COVID-19 to be classified with a sensitivity of 64.3% and a specificity of 62.5%, with prior contact with a positive case being the primary predictor variable. Conclusions The use of a classification tree model may be useful in screening for COVID-19 infection. Contact detection is the most reliable variable for detecting Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases. The model would support that, beyond a symptomatic diagnosis, the best way to detect cases would be to engage in contact tracing."
https://openalex.org/W3135881180,"Thrips and thrips-transmitted tospoviruses cause significant losses in crop yields worldwide. The melon thrips ( Thrips palmi ) is not only a pest of cucurbit crops, but also a vector that transmits tospoviruses, such as the watermelon silver mottle virus (WSMoV). Vector transmission of tospoviruses has been well studied in the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV)– Frankliniella occidentalis model system; however, until now the transmission mode of WSMoV by T . palmi has not been sufficiently examined. The results of the transmission assays suggest that T . palmi transmits WSMoV in a persistent manner, and that the virus is mainly transmitted by adults, having been ingested at the first-instar larval stage. Complementary RNAs corresponding to the NSm and NSs genes of WSMoV were detected in viruliferous thrips by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; NSs protein was also detected in viruliferous thrips by western blotting, verifying the replication of WSMoV in T . palmi . Furthermore, we demonstrated that in thrips infected with WSMoV at the first-instar larval stage, the virus eventually infected various tissues of the adult thrips, including the primary salivary glands. Taken together, these results suggest that T . palmi transmits WSMoV in a persistent-propagative mode. The results of this study make a significant contribution to the understanding of the transmission biology of tospoviruses in general."
https://openalex.org/W3134356052,"Elucidating the genetic variation and structure of Lemnos and Lesvos sheep is critical for maintaining local genetic diversity, ecosystem integrity and resilience of local food production of the two North Aegean islands. In the present study, we explored genetic diversity and differentiation as well as population structure of the Lemnos and Lesvos sheep. Furthermore, we sought to identify a small panel of markers with the highest discriminatory power to assign animals across islands. A total number of n = 424 (n = 307, Lemnos and n = 117, Lesvos) ewes, sampled from n = 24 herds dispersed at different geographic regions on the two islands, were genotyped with the 50K SNP array. Mean observed heterozygosity was higher (but not statistically significantly different) in Lesvos than in Lemnos population (0.384 vs. 0.377) while inbreeding levels were higher in Lemnos than Lesvos herds (0.065 vs. 0.031). Results of principal components along with that of admixture analysis and estimated genetic distances revealed genetic clusters corresponding to Lesvos and Lemnos origin and the existence of infrastructure within islands that were associated with geographical isolation and genetic history of the studied populations. In particular, genetic analyses highlighted three geographically isolated herds in Lemnos that are located at mountainous areas of the island and are characterized as representatives of the local sheep by historic data and reports. Admixture analysis also showed a shared genetic background between Lemnos and Lesvos sheep attributable to past gene flow. Little overall genetic differentiation was detected between the two island sheep populations, while 150 discriminatory SNPs could accurately assign animals to their origin. Present results are comparable with those reported in the worldwide sheep breeds, suggesting geography related genetic patterns across and within islands and the existence of the local Lemnos sheep."
https://openalex.org/W3134880121,"Mammals, born with a near-sterile intestinal tract, are inoculated with their mothers’ microbiome during birth. Thereafter, extrinsic and intrinsic factors shape their intestinal microbe assemblage. Wastewater treatment works (WWTW), sites synonymous with pollutants and pathogens, receive influent from domestic, agricultural and industrial sources. The high nutrient content of wastewater supports abundant populations of chironomid midges (Diptera), which transfer these toxicants and potential pathogens to their predators, such as the banana bat Neoromicia nana (Vespertilionidae), thereby influencing their intestinal microbial assemblages. We used next generation sequencing and 16S rRNA gene profiling to identify and compare intestinal bacteria of N . nana at two reference sites and two WWTW sites. We describe the shared intestinal microbiome of the insectivorous bat, N . nana , consisting of seven phyla and eleven classes. Further, multivariate analyses revealed that location was the most significant driver (sex, body size and condition were not significant) of intestinal microbiome diversity. Bats at WWTW sites exhibited greater intestinal microbiota diversity than those at reference sites, likely due to wastewater exposure, stress and/or altered diet. Changes in their intestinal microbiota assemblages may allow these bats to cope with concomitant stressors."

We examined the effects of disusing closed suction drainage (CSD) on postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirement in cementless SBTHA.A retrospective cohort study was conducted with a consecutive series of cementless SBTHAs performed by a single surgeon between January 2014 and March 2017. The surgeon routinely used CSD until May 2015 and refrained from CSD in all primary THAs thereafter. This study included SBTHAs with intravenous administration of tranexamic acid (TXA). Postoperative hemoglobin drop, blood loss, transfusion rate, pain scores, complication rates, and implant survivorships were compared between the groups of SBTHA with and without CSD. The minimum follow-up duration was 1 year.Among the 110 patients (220 hips), 46 (92 hips) and 64 (128 hips) underwent SBTHA with and without CSD, respectively. Maximum hemoglobin drop (mean, 4.8 vs. 3.9 g/dL; P = 0.001), calculated blood loss (mean, 1530 vs. 1190 mL; P<0.001), transfusion rate (45.7% vs. 21.9%; P = 0.008), and length of hospital stay (mean, 6.6 vs. 5.8 days; P = 0.004) were significantly lower in patients without CSD. There were no significant differences in postoperative pain scales and wound complication rates. The mean Harris Hip scores at final follow-up (92.5 vs. 92.1; P = 0.775) and implant survivorships with an end-point of any revision at 4 years (98.9% vs. 98.4%; log-rank, P = 0.766) were similar between groups.Disusing CSD significantly reduced postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirement without increasing postoperative pain and surgical wound complications in cementless SBTHA with concurrent administration of intravenous TXA."
https://openalex.org/W3135105993,"An isolated human cranium, dated to the early Eneolithic period, was discovered in 2015 at the top of a vertical shaft in the natural Marcel Loubens gypsum Cave (Bologna area, northern Italy). No other anthropological or archaeological remains were found inside the cave. In other caves of the same area anthropic and funerary use are attested from prehistory to more recent periods. We focused on investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of this individual, since the cranium shows signs of some lesions that appear to be the results of a perimortem manipulation probably carried out to remove soft tissues. Anthropological analyses revealed that the cranium belonged to a young woman. We analysed the taphonomic features and geological context to understand how and why the cranium ended up (accidentally or intentionally) in the cave. The analyses of both the sediments accumulated inside the cranium and the incrustations and pigmentation covering its outer surface suggested that it fell into the cave, drawn by a flow of water and mud, likely from the edges of a doline. The accidental nature of the event is also seemingly confirmed by some post-mortem lesions on the cranium. The comparison with other Eneolithic archaeological sites in northern Italy made it possible to interpret the find as likely being from a funerary or ritual context, in which corpse dismemberment (in particular the displacement of crania) was practiced."
https://openalex.org/W3135110756,"Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) and Acinetobacter spp. present monumental global health challenges. These organisms represent model Gram-negative pathogens with known antibiotic resistance and biofilm-forming properties. Herein, a novel, nontoxic biocide, AB569, consisting of acidified nitrite (A-NO2-) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), demonstrated bactericidal activity against all Ab and Acinetobacter spp. strains, respectively. Average fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) of 0.25 mM EDTA plus 4 mM A-NO2- were observed across several clinical reference and multiple combat wound isolates from the Iraq/Afghanistan wars. Importantly, toxicity testing on human dermal fibroblasts (HDFa) revealed an upper toxicity limit of 3 mM EDTA plus 64 mM A-NO2-, and thus are in the therapeutic range for effective Ab and Acinetobacter spp. treatment. Following treatment of Ab strain ATCC 19606 with AB569, quantitative PCR analysis of selected genes products to be responsive to AB569 revealed up-regulation of iron regulated genes involved in siderophore production, siderophore biosynthesis non-ribosomal peptide synthetase module (SBNRPSM), and siderophore biosynthesis protein monooxygenase (SBPM) when compared to untreated organisms. Taken together, treating Ab infections with AB569 at inhibitory concentrations reveals the potential clinical application of preventing Ab from gaining an early growth advantage during infection followed by extensive bactericidal activity upon subsequent exposures."
https://openalex.org/W3135266906,"Aim Real-world predictors of major bleeding (MB) have been well-studied among warfarin users, but not among all direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) users diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF). Thus, our goal was to build a predictive model of MB for new users of all oral anticoagulants (OAC) with AF. Methods We identified patients hospitalized for any cause and discharged alive in the community from 2011 to 2017 with a primary or secondary diagnosis of AF in Quebec’s RAMQ and Med-Echo administrative databases. Cohort entry occurred at the first OAC claim. Patients were categorized according to OAC type. Outcomes were incident MB, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), non-GI extracranial bleeding (NGIB) and intracranial bleeding within 1 year of follow-up. Covariates included age, sex, co-morbidities (within 3 years before cohort entry) and medication use (within 2 weeks before cohort entry). We used logistic-LASSO and adaptive logistic-LASSO regressions to identify MB predictors among OAC users. Discrimination and calibration were assessed for each model and a global model was selected. Subgroup analyses were performed for MB subtypes and OAC types. Results Our cohort consisted of 14,741 warfarin, 3,722 dabigatran, 6,722 rivaroxaban and 11,196 apixaban users aged 70–86 years old. The important MB predictors were age, prior MB and liver disease with ORs ranging from 1.37–1.64. The final model had a c-statistic of 0.63 (95% CI 0.60–0.65) with adequate calibration. The GIB and NGIB models had similar c-statistics of 0.65 (95% CI 0.63–0.66) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.64–0.70), respectively. Conclusions MB and MB subtype predictors were similar among DOAC and warfarin users. The predictors selected by our models and their discriminative potential are concordant with published data. Thus, these models can be useful tools for future pharmacoepidemiologic studies involving older oral anticoagulant users with AF."

The poor community awareness and knowledge of canine rabies have thwarted the realization of zero deaths from dog mediated human rabies. This study aimed to assess the awareness and knowledge of canine rabies in Kwara state. A total of 1,460 questionnaires were administered to respondents in the three senatorial zones of the state using open data kit (ODK) on mobile phones between September 2019 to January 2020. The rabies awareness rate was 38.1%. The mean knowledge score was 3.78 ± 2.15. Only 10.6% (n = 59/557) of the respondents had satisfactory knowledge of canine rabies. Respondents had poor knowledge of the mode of transmission, symptoms, prevention, and the control measures needed to eliminate canine rabies. Only 20.1% of respondents owned at least a dog. Dog owners were 3.85× (95% CI: 2.89, 5.13; p &lt; 0.01) more likely to be aware of canine rabies and were 1.78× (95% CI: 1.22–2.60; p = 0.003) more likely to have satisfactory knowledge about canine rabies than non-dog owners. Respondents with tertiary education were at least 6.81× (95% CI: 4.24, 10.92; p &lt; 0.01) more likely to be aware of rabies than respondents with no formal education. The findings of this study showed very low awareness and knowledge of canine rabies among residents of Kwara state. Mass sensitization of the populace on the dangers of rabies should be intensified.

https://openalex.org/W3134285899,"Purpose The aim of this study was to gather data from female students studying in both health and non-health colleges at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University and report the prevalence, reasons, and determinants of dietary supplements use. Methods A month-long cross-sectional study was conducted in health and non-health colleges affiliated to Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. Convenient sampling was employed, and the data was gathered through an online survey using the English and Arabic versions of the Dietary Supplement Questionnaire (DSQ). The data was analyzed using SPSS version 23 and Medcalc. The study was approved by an ethics committee. Results Data from 545 participants was collected. The overall prevalence of dietary supplement use was 32.7% (95% CI: 29.06%– 36.51%). The prevalence was 29.77% (95% CI: 25.29%– 34.56%) among students at all health colleges combined and, it was 37.50% (95% CI: 31.36%– 43.96%) among students at all non-health colleges. Most students used a brand product, spent a monthly cost of SAR 286 (USD 76.3) on supplements and agreed that supplements were good for health (N = 392, 71.9%). Students from non-health- colleges agreed that dietary supplements are good for health in greater numbers as compared to non-health college students (p &lt; 0.001). Students aged ≥ 20 years, studying in a non-health college and up to 3 rd year of study, were more 2 times more likely to agree that dietary supplements are good for health. Conclusion Supplements were commonly used among female students at this university however, it was quite low as compared to students from other local and regional universities. Prevalence was higher in non-health colleges as compared to health colleges and the most commonly used supplements were brand products and, multivitamins, used for general health and well-being. This highlights the inclination of students towards supplement use."
https://openalex.org/W3134776116,"Background and objectives Only few smaller studies have examined if impaired kidney function increases the risk of acute kidney injury in patients with acute pyelonephritis. Therefore, we estimated 30-day risk of acute kidney injury by preadmission kidney function in patients with acute pyelonephritis. Furthermore, we examined if impaired kidney function was a risk factor for development of acute kidney injury in pyelonephritis patients. Methods This cohort study included patients with a first-time hospitalization with pyelonephritis from 2000 to 2017. Preadmission kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30, 30–44, 45–59, 60–89, and ≥90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 ) and acute kidney injury within 30 days after admission were assessed using laboratory data on serum creatinine. The absolute 30-days risk of acute kidney injury was assessed treating death as a competing risk. The impact of eGFR on the odds of acute kidney injury was compared by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals estimated using logistic regression adjusted for potential confounding factors. Results Among 8,760 patients with available data on preadmission kidney function, 25.8% had a preadmission eGFR &lt;60. The 30-day risk of acute kidney injury was 16% among patients with preadmission eGFR ≥90 and increased to 22%, 33%, 42%, and 47% for patients with preadmission eGFR of 60–89, 45–59, 30–44, and &lt;30 respectively. Compared with eGFR≥90, the adjusted ORs for the subgroups with eGFR 60–89, 45–59, 30–45, and &lt;30 were 0.95, 1.32, 1.78, and 2.19 respectively. Conclusion Acute kidney injury is a common complication in patients hospitalized with acute pyelonephritis. Preadmission impaired kidney function is a strong risk factor for development of acute kidney injury in pyelonephritis patients and more attention should be raised in prevention of pyelonephritis in patients with a low kidney function."
https://openalex.org/W3135155476,"Palisadegrass [Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R. D. Webster cv. Marandu] is widely used in Brazil and is typically managed with little or no N fertilizer, which often leads to pasture decline in the long-term. The current relationship between beef price and fertilizer cost in Brazil does not favor fertilizer use in pastures. Legume inclusion is an alternative to adding fertilizer N, but often legumes do not reach a significant proportion (> 30%) in pasture botanical composition. This study evaluated herbage responses to N inputs and pasture species composition, under intermittent stocking. Treatments included palisadegrass-forage peanut (Arachis pintoi Krapov. & W.C. Greg. cv. Amarillo) mixture (mixed), unfertilized palisadegrass (control), and palisadegrass fertilized with 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (fertilized). Treatments were applied over two rainy seasons with five growth cycle (GC) evaluations each season. Response variables included herbage biomass, herbage accumulation, morphological components, total aboveground N of forage peanut (TAGNFP), and contribution of biological N2 fixation (BNF). Herbage biomass was greater for fertilized palisadegrass [5850 kg dry matter (DM) ha-1] than for the palisadegrass-forage peanut mixture (3940 kg DM ha-1), while the unfertilized palisadegrass (4400 kg DM ha-1) did not differ from the mixed pasture. Nitrogen fertilizer increased leaf mass of palisadegrass (2490 kg DM ha-1) compared with the control and mixed treatments (1700 and 1310 kg DM ha-1, respectively). The contribution of BNF to the forage peanut ranged from 79 to 85% and 0.5 to 5.5 kg N ha-1 cycle-1. Overall, benefits from forage peanut were minimal because legume percentage was less than 10%, while N input in the system by N-fertilizer increased palisadegrass herbage biomass."
https://openalex.org/W3135640966,"An in-depth study on the characteristics of coke in the hearths of blast furnaces is of great significance for explaining the mechanism of coke deterioration in blast furnaces. In the present work, the changes in macromorphology, degree of graphitization, and microstructure of the coke taken from different hearth locations of a 5,800 m 3 superlarge blast furnace during its intermediate repair period were systematically studied. Significant differences were found between cokes obtained from the edge (“edge coke”) and from the center (“center coke”) of the hearth in terms of properties and degradation mechanisms. Edge coke was severely eroded by liquid metal, and only a small amount of slag was detected in the coke porosity, whereas center coke was basically free from erosion by liquid metal, and a large amount of slag was detected in the coke porosity. The degree of graphitization of edge coke was higher than that of center coke. The carburizing effect of liquid metal was the main cause of the degradation of edge coke and made it smaller or even disappear. Center coke was degraded due to the combination of two factors: slag inserted into micropores on the surface of center coke loosened the surface structure; and graphite-like flakes that appeared on the center coke surface lowered the strength and caused cracks in the surface."

We used confirmatory factor analysis, for both classroom and clinical learning, to examine the psychometric properties.The analysis of construct validity showed a good fit to the hypothesised models. Cronbach's alpha values ranged from 0.70 to 0.87 for classroom learning and from 0.56 to 0.86 for clinical learning, indicating good reliability. Differentiating between the H-PEPSS constructs in the clinical setting showed to be complicated; hence, discriminant validity was not supported for all dimensions.Overall, this provides us with a reliable instrument to measure self-reported patient safety competence among nursing students. Further research is needed to validate the H-PEPSS as a longitudinal monitoring tool and as a pre-and-post measurement on the impact of interventions related to patient safety in the nursing curricula."
https://openalex.org/W3091155042,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic many researchers and health advisory institutions have focused on virus spread prediction through epidemiological models. Such models rely on virus- and disease characteristics of which most are uncertain or even unknown for SARS-CoV-2. This study addresses the validity of various assumptions using an epidemiological simulation model. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, we show that multiple scenarios all lead to realistic numbers of deaths and ICU admissions, two observable and verifiable metrics. Second, we test the sensitivity of estimates for the number of infected and immune individuals, and show that these vary strongly between scenarios. Note that the amount of variation measured in this study is merely a lower bound: epidemiological modeling contains uncertainty on more parameters than the four in this study, and including those as well would lead to an even larger set of possible scenarios. As the level of infection and immunity among the population are particularly important for policy makers, further research on virus and disease progression characteristics is essential. Until that time, epidemiological modeling studies cannot give conclusive results and should come with a careful analysis of several scenarios on virus- and disease characteristics."

The purpose of the study was to investigate this link with the hip fracture risk in Taiwanese men and women aged 50 years and above. Materials and methods From 2000 through 2012, a population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted; claims data of 18,976 patients diagnosed with LUTS (dysuria, urinary retention, incontinence, and increased urinary frequency and urgency) were retrieved from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. The patients were compared with 1:2 age, sex, and index year-matched controls (comparison group, n = 37,952). The incidence and hazard ratios of the hip fracture risk were calculated by the Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results The mean age was 66.2 ± 9.7 years, and the proportion of men was 58.1% in both study groups. Fractures occurred in 772 patients and 1,156 control subjects. The corresponding incidences were 7.0 and 5.0/1000 person-years. Compared to the control subjects, the patients with LUTS had an increased hip fracture risk [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17–1.42]. LUTS was independently associated with an increased hip fracture risk in both men (aHR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.08–1.42) and women (aHR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.18–1.53) ( p for interaction = 0.557). Similarly, the subgroup effect of age on hip fracture risks was not found (p for interaction = 0.665). Conclusion The study found LUTS was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. Large-scale prospective studies in diverse populations are required to investigate causalities."

We describe STI prevalence and correlates among men living with HIV (MLWH) accessing safer conception care to conceive a child with an HIV-uninfected partner while minimizing HIV transmission risks. This study reflects an ongoing safer conception program embedded within a regional referral hospital HIV clinic in southwestern Uganda. We enrolled MLWH, planning for pregnancy with an HIV-uninfected partner and accessing safer conception care. Participants completed interviewer-administered questionnaires detailing socio-demographics, gender dynamics, and sexual history. Participants also completed STI laboratory screening for syphilis (immunochromatographic testing confirmed by rapid plasma reagin), and chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and HIV-RNA via GeneXpert nucleic acid amplification testing. Bivariable associations of STI covariates were assessed using Fisher’s exact test. Among the 50 men who completed STI screening, median age was 33 (IQR 31–37) years, 13/50 (26%) had ≥2 sexual partners in the prior three months, and 46/50 (92%) had HIV-RNA &lt;400 copies/mL. Overall, 11/50 (22%) had STIs: 16% active syphilis, 6% chlamydia. All participants initiated STI treatment. STI prevalence was associated with the use of threats/intimidation to coerce partners into sex (27% vs 3%; p = 0.03), although absolute numbers were small. We describe a 22% curable STI prevalence among a priority population at higher risk for transmission to partners and neonates. STI screening and treatment as a part of comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare should be integrated into HIV care to maximize the health of men, women, and children."
https://openalex.org/W3134449418,"Background Accurately measuring abortion incidence poses many challenges. The list experiment is a method designed to increase the reporting of sensitive or stigmatized behaviors in surveys, but has only recently been applied to the measurement of abortion. To further test the utility of the list experiment for measuring abortion incidence, we conducted list experiments in two countries, over two time periods. Materials and methods The list experiment is an indirect method of measuring sensitive experiences that protects respondent confidentiality by hiding individual responses to a binary sensitive item (i.e., abortion) by combining this response with answers to other non-sensitive binary control items. Respondents report the number of list items that apply to them, not which ones. We conducted a list experiment to measure cumulative lifetime incidence of abortion in Malawi, and separately to measure cumulative five-year incidence of abortion in Senegal, among cisgender women of reproductive age. Results Among 810 eligible respondents in Malawi, list experiment results estimated a cumulative lifetime incidence of abortion of 0.9% (95%CI: 0.0, 7.6). Among 1016 eligible respondents in Senegal, list experiment estimates indicated a cumulative five-year incidence of abortion of 2.8% (95%CI: 0.0, 10.4) which, while lower than anticipated, is seven times the proportion estimated from a direct question on abortion (0.4%). Conclusions Two test applications of the list experiment to measure abortion experiences in Malawi and Senegal likely underestimated abortion incidence. Future efforts should include context-specific formative qualitative research for the development and selection of list items, enumerator training, and method delivery to assess if and how these changes can improve method performance."
https://openalex.org/W3134903159,"The increased exposure of pastoralist communities in East Africa to climatic shocks has focused attention on the resilience of these communities. Although many social scientists directly or indirectly infer versions of homo-economic agents, increasing evidence in development behavioral economics, indicates that such assumptions may be misplaced. Despite on-going advances in the science concerning the effects of stress on dynamic changes in short-term cognitive capacity, there remains limited understanding of the effects of changes in cognitive capacity on economic decision making. The present research empirically evaluates the drivers of short-term changes in cognitive capacity–cognitive ability and heuristic use–and its effect on crop and livestock expenditure among predominantly poor Kenyan agro-pastoralists. Three rounds of cognition and survey data from Samburu, Kenya is analysed. The primary data was collected at the end of the 2015–16 East African drought and covers an 11-month period between October 2016 and September 2017. Dynamic panel estimation, employing maximum likelihood, is used on balanced and unbalanced data. Results indicate that fluid intelligence and heuristic use, along with literacy and stressors, affect crop expenditure. Perceptions of scarcity, relative to prior expectations, are also identified as an important determinant of short-term changes in cognitive ability. These results underscore the importance of better understanding the effects of short-term changes in cognitive capacity on economic expenditure among the poor."
https://openalex.org/W3135182394,"Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate possible patterns of demand for chest imaging during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and derive a decision aid for the allocation of resources in future pandemic challenges. Materials and methods Time data of requests for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lung disease were analyzed between February 27th and May 27th 2020. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to evaluate differences in the number of requests between 3 time intervals (I1: 6am - 2pm, I2: 2pm - 10pm, I3: 10pm - 6am). A cosinor model was applied to investigate the demand per hour. Requests per day were compared to the number of regional COVID-19 cases. Results 551 COVID-19 related chest imagings (32.8% outpatients, 67.2% in-patients) of 243 patients were conducted (33.3% female, 66.7% male, mean age 60 ± 17 years). Most exams for outpatients were required during I2 (I1 vs. I2: odds ratio (OR) = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62–0.86, p = 0.01; I2 vs. I3: OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.04–1.48, p = 0.03) with an acrophase at 7:29 pm. Requests for in-patients decreased from I1 to I3 (I1 vs. I2: OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.09–1.41, p = 0.01; I2 vs. I3: OR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.05–1.28, p = 0.01) with an acrophase at 12:51 pm. The number of requests per day for outpatients developed similarly to regional cases while demand for in-patients increased later and persisted longer. Conclusions The demand for COVID-19 related chest imaging displayed distinct distribution patterns depending on the sector of patient care and point of time during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These patterns should be considered in the allocation of resources in future pandemic challenges with similar disease characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3134374354,"High-speed roads present a considerable level of risk for frontline workers operating in these environments. To optimise safety, prevention activities need to target the key skills required to mitigate risk. The aim of this research was to explore the behavioural (compliance, participation, voice), motivational (safety motivation) and work demand (role clarity) factors that influence safety outcomes for incident responders working on high-speed roads. Safety outcomes included secondary incidents and near misses with passing vehicles. A total of 295 complete survey responses were received from six emergency service and incident response agencies in one Australian state. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling. The results showed that higher levels of safety voice, safety motivation and, role clarity were significantly associated with safer self-reported safety outcomes after controlling for the number of incidents attended. The findings from this study will be used to guide the development of a training program to improve the cognitive, behavioural and perceptual skills of incident responders operating on high-speed roads. Some insight into the structure and format of this program is provided."
https://openalex.org/W3135284726,"Access to quality veterinary antimicrobial products contributes to efficient treatment of diseases in Vietnamese livestock and to reducing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Poor quality antimicrobial drugs can lead to treatment failure, potentially influencing the inappropriate use of antimicrobials products, including increasing the dose, combining drugs, or changing to a broader spectrum antimicrobial. The objective of the study was to determine the actual concentration of antimicrobial active ingredient (AAI) in commercially available veterinary antimicrobial products as an indicator of their quality. A total of 144 veterinary antimicrobial products were purchased from randomly selected veterinary drug stores in 34 districts in eight provinces. For the qualitative analysis, we observed criteria linked to form, colour, and labelling information according to the Department of Animal Health regulations. For the quantitative analysis, high-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the actual concentration of AAI in each sample. Of the 144 samples, 131 (91%) met the national standard of quality of being within ±10% of the labelled concentration. Ten antimicrobials (6.9%) contained less than half of the labelled content concentrations. Veterinary antimicrobial product quality control is an important part of addressing AMR. To support the national action plan to lower AMR, a veterinary drug quality control program should be implemented at all stages of the supply chain to assure high quality drugs and effective treatment of sick animals."
https://openalex.org/W3135639139,"Cultured sensory neurons can exhibit complex activity patterns following stimulation in terms of increased excitability and interconnected responses of multiple neurons. Although these complex activity patterns suggest a network-like configuration, research so far had little interest in synaptic network formation ability of the sensory neurons. To identify interaction profiles of Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) neurons and explore their putative connectivity, we developed an in vitro experimental approach. A double transgenic mouse model, expressing genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) in their glutamatergic neurons, was produced. Dissociated DRG cultures from adult mice were prepared with a serum-free protocol and no additional growth factors or cytokines were utilized for neuronal sensitization. DRG neurons were grown on microelectrode arrays (MEA) to induce stimulus-evoked activity with a modality-free stimulation strategy. With an almost single-cell level electrical stimulation, spontaneous and evoked activity of GCaMP6s expressing neurons were detected under confocal microscope. Typical responses were analyzed, and correlated calcium events were detected across individual DRG neurons. Next, correlated responses were successfully blocked by glutamatergic receptor antagonists, which indicated functional synaptic coupling. Immunostaining confirmed the presence of synapses mainly in the axonal terminals, axon-soma junctions and axon-axon intersection sites. Concisely, the results presented here illustrate a new type of neuron-to-neuron interaction in cultured DRG neurons conducted through synapses. The developed assay can be a valuable tool to analyze individual and collective responses of the cultured sensory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3133528047,"Increasing numbers of people are surviving critical illness throughout the world, but survivorship is associated with long-term disability. In high-income settings physical rehabilitation is commonly employed to counter this and improve outcomes. These utilize highly-trained multidisciplinary teams and are unavailable and unaffordable in most low and middle income countries (LMICs). We aimed to design a sustainable intensive care unit (ICU) rehabilitation program and to evaluate its feasibility in a LMIC setting. In this project patients, care-givers and experts co-designed an innovative rehabilitation programme that can be delivered by non-expert ICU staff and family care-givers in a LMIC. We implemented this programme in adult patient with patients with tetanus at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City over a 5-month period, evaluating the programme’s acceptability, enablers and barriers. A 6-phase programme was designed, supported by written and video material. The programme was piloted in total of 30 patients. Rehabilitation was commenced a median 14 (inter quartile range (IQR) 10–18) days after admission. Each patient received a median of 25.5 (IQR 22.8–34.8) rehabilitation sessions out of a median 27 (22.8–35) intended (prescribed) sessions. There were no associated adverse events. Patients and staff found rehabilitation to be beneficial, enhanced relationships between carers, patients and staff and was deemed to be a positive step towards recovery and return to work. The main barrier was staff time. The programme was feasible for patients with tetanus and viewed positively by staff and participants. Staff time was identified as the major barrier to ongoing implementation."
