https://openalex.org/W2069536209,"We have used endocytotic uptake of the styryl dye FM1-43 at synaptic terminals (Betz and Bewick, 1992) to study properties of individual synapses formed by axons of single hippocampal neurons in tissue culture. The distribution of values for probability of evoked transmitter release p estimated by dye uptake is continuous, with a preponderance of low p synapses and a broad spread of probabilities. We have validated this method by demonstrating that the optically estimated distribution of p at autapses in single-neuron microislands predicts, with no free parameters, the rate of blocking of NMDA responses by the noncompetitive antagonist MK-801 at the same synapses. Different synapses made by a single axon exhibited varying amounts of paired-pulse modulation; synapses with low p tended to be facilitated more than those with high p. The increment in release probability produced by increasing external calcium ion concentration also depended on a synapse's initial p value. The size of the recycling pool of vesicles was strongly correlated with p as well, suggesting that synapses with higher release probabilities had more vesicles. Finally, p values of neighboring synapses were correlated, indicating local interactions in the dendrite or axon, or both."

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the attentional modulation of neural activity in the human homolog of the MT–MST complex, which is known to be involved in the processing of visual motion. Using a visual stimulus containing both moving and stationary dots, we found significantly more MT–MST activation when subjects attended to the moving dots than when they attended to the stationary dots, even though the visual stimulus was identical during the two conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2090257483,"Little is known about the physiological principles that govern large-scale neuronal interactions in the mammalian brain. Here, we describe an electrophysiological paradigm capable of simultaneously recording the extracellular activity of large populations of single neurons, distributed across multiple cortical and subcortical structures in behaving and anesthetized animals. Up to 100 neurons were simultaneously recorded after 48 microwires were implanted in the brain stem, thalamus, and somatosensory cortex of rats. Overall, 86% of the implanted microwires yielded single neurons, and an average of 2.3 neurons were discriminated per microwire. Our population recordings remained stable for weeks, demonstrating that this method can be employed to investigate the dynamic and distributed neuronal ensemble interactions that underlie processes such as sensory perception, motor control, and sensorimotor learning in freely behaving animals."

https://openalex.org/W1966815375,"We studied the mechanism by which Hanatoxin (HaTx) inhibits the drk1 voltage-gated K+ channel. HaTx inhibits the K+ channel by shifting channel opening to more depolarized voltages. Channels opened by strong depolarization in the presence of HaTx deactivate much faster upon repolarization, indicating that toxin bound channels can open. Thus, HaTx inhibits the drk1 K+ channel, not by physically occluding the ion conduction pore, but by modifying channel gating. Occupancy of the channel by HaTx was studied using various strength depolarizations. The concentration dependence for equilibrium occupancy as well as the kinetics of onset and recovery from inhibition indicate that multiple HaTx molecules can simultaneously bind to a single K+ channel. These results are consistent with a simple model in which HaTx binds to the surface of the drk1 K+ channel at four equivalent sites and alters the energetics of channel gating."
https://openalex.org/W2022720897,"Agrin-induced clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the postsynaptic membrane is a key step in synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junction. The receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK is a component of the agrin receptor, while the cytoplasmic protein rapsyn is necessary for the clustering of AChRs and all other postsynaptic membrane components studied to date. We show here that MuSK remains concentrated at synaptic sites in rapsyn-deficient mutant mice, suggesting that MuSK forms a primary structural scaffold to which rapsyn attaches other synaptic components. Using nonmuscle cells, we show that rapsyn-MuSK interactions are mediated by the ectodomain of MuSK, suggesting the existence of a transmembrane intermediate. In addition to rapsyn's structural role, we demonstrate that it is required for an early step in MuSK signaling, AChR phosphorylation. This signaling requires the kinase domain of MuSK, but not its ectodomain. Thus, MuSK may interact with rapsyn in multiple ways to play both structural and signaling roles in agrin-induced differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2326198238,"The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK-1 and ERK-2 are activated by a wide variety of oncogenes and extracellular stimuli. The MAPKs participate in a signalling cascade downstream of growth factor/cytokine receptors, Ras, Raf, and MEK. However, MAPK activation is more complicated than a simple linear pathway, and the evidence presented here supports a model of multiple, temporally distinct pathways converging on MAPK which are differentially utilized by various stimuli and cell types. In addition to MEK-dependent MAPK activation, we provide evidence for MEK-independent regulation of the MAPKs. Our results suggest that phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI(3)K) or conventional protein kinase C isoforms (cPKCs) partially contribute to MEK-dependent activation. Importantly, we also find that PI3K and cPKCs play a major role in the MEK-independent, prolonged MAPK activation by platelet-derived growth factor signalling. This finding is of interest as the maintained activation of MAPK has been correlated by others to the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2072050469,"When exposed to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), uncommitted neuroepithelial cells from the developing cortex of embryonic day 14 (E14) rats develop into neurons. Outward signs of the neuronal phenotype are not observed for 4 days following exposure to PDGF. However, only a brief (2–3 hr) period of PDGF receptor activation is required to initiate neuronal development. During the window of receptor activation, RNA synthesis is essential, but protein synthesis is not. These observations indicate that specification of neuronal fate is mediated by an immediate early gene response."

https://openalex.org/W2021354353,"The >30 known members of the Ets multigene family of transcriptional regulators are increasingly being recognized for their involvement in early embryonic development and late tissue maturation, directing stage-specific and tissue-restricted programs of target gene expression. Identifiable primarily by their 85 amino acid ETS DNA-binding domain and dispersed across all metazoan lineages into distinct subfamilies, Ets genes also produce malignancies in humans and other vertebrates when overexpressed or rearranged into chimeras retaining the ETS domain, suggesting that their oncogenic potential is determined by the program of target genes they regulate. Searching for Ets factors that regulate expression of the HER2/neu (c-erbB2) oncogene in human breast cancer, we identified a new epithelium-restricted Ets encoding an ETS domain homologous to the Drosophila E74/human Elf-1 subfamily, an amino-terminal region (A-region or Pointed domain) homologous to the distantly related Ets-1 subfamily, and a serine-rich box homologous to the transactivating domain of the lymphocyte-restricted High Mobility Group (HMG) protein, SOX4. Recombinant protein encoded by ESX (for epithelial-restricted with serine box) exhibits Ets-like DNA binding specificity in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and, in transient transfection assays, transactivates Ets-responsive promoter elements including that found in the HER2/neu oncogene. ESX is located at chromosome 1q32 in a region known to be amplified in 50% of early breast cancers, is heregulin-inducible and overexpressed in HER2/neu activated breast cancer cells. Tissue hybridization suggests that ESX becomes overexpressed at an early stage of human breast cancer development known as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)."
https://openalex.org/W2070344212,"Dendritic arbors are critical for the information processing capability of central neurons, but quantitative analysis of their membrane properties has been hampered by their geometrical complexity. Here, we have focused on an important source of Ca2+ entry in dendrites, the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, by applying the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique to isolated dendritic segments (""dendrosomes"") from rat hippocampal neurons. We found that low voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ channels provide a significantly larger fraction of the Ca2+ influx in dendrites than their counterparts in cell bodies. Surprisingly, 60%-70% of the high voltage-activated Ca2+ current in dendrosomes was N and P/Q type, and these channels were susceptible to neurotransmitter inhibition, suggesting a novel physiological role for G protein-regulated Ca2+ channel modulation in controlling dendritic excitability and Ca2+ signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1981761798,"Transgenic animals were developed to assess the role of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in skin growth, differentiation and organization, as well as its importance in tumor formation. Expression of a human IGF-1 cDNA was targeted to the interfollicular epidermis of transgenic mice using a human keratin 1 promoter construct (HK1). Transgenic animals (HK1.IGF-1 mice) could be identified at birth by early ear unfolding and excessive ear and skin growth compared to non-transgenic littermates. Further examination of the skin from these mice showed epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis, marked thickening of the dermis and hypodermis, and early hair follicle generation in newborns. The severity of this phenotype correlated with transgene expression both of which subsided with age. Adult HK1.IGF-1 mice developed spontaneous tumors following treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) alone and exhibited an exaggerated epidermal proliferative response following treatment with the tumor promoter compared to non transgenic littermates. Additionally, HK1.IGF-1 transgenic mice developed papillomas faster and in markedly greater numbers compared to non-transgenic littermates in standard initiation-promotion experiments. The data presented suggest an important role for IGF-1 in the process of multistage carcinogenesis in mouse skin."
https://openalex.org/W2162203821,"C. elegans aex-3mutations cause pleiotropic behavioral defects that are suggestive of reduced synaptic transmission. aex-3mutations also show strong genetic interactions with mutations in unc-31and unc-64, two other genes implicated in synaptic transmission. Physiological and pharmacological studies indicate that aex-3defects are presynaptic. In aex-3mutants, the synaptic vesicle–associated RAB-3 protein aberrantly accumulates in neuronal cell bodies and is reduced in synapse-rich axons. This localization defect is specific to RAB-3, since other synaptic proteins are localized normally in aex-3mutants. aex-3encodes a 1409 amino acid protein with strong homology to DENN, a human protein of unknown function. In C. elegans, aex-3is expressed in all or nearly all neurons. These results suggest that AEX-3 is a novel regulator of presynaptic activity that interacts with RAB-3 to regulate synaptic vesicle release."
https://openalex.org/W1968700644,"Studies on the reeler mutation have shown that pioneer Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells are involved in neuronal migration in the developing cortex. Here, we use grafting and coculture experiments to investigate the mechanisms by which CR cells govern migration. We show that transplantation of embryonic CR cells, but not other cortical neurons, into adult cerebella induces a transient rejuvenation of host Bergmann glia into a radial glia phenotype. Similarly, CR cells sustain the phenotype of developing radial glia in postnatal cerebellar slices and induce the organization of a glial scaffold inside the CR cell explants. Studies with semipermeable inserts show that these effects are mediated by diffusible signals. We also show that CR cells adjacent to the surface of cerebellar slices reverse the direction of the migration of granule cells. Finally, CR cells from reeler mutant embryos elicited similar effects. These observations imply a role for CR cells in the regulation of the radial glia phenotype, a key step for neuronal migration, and suggest that these pioneer neurons may also exert a chemoattractive influence on migrating neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2170137693,"The vertebrate retina contains ganglion cells that appear to be specialized for detecting temporal changes. The characteristic response of these cells is a transient burst of action potentials when a stationary image is presented or removed, and often a strong discharge to moving images. These transient and motion-sensitive responses are thought to result from processing in the inner retina that involves amacrine cells, but the critical interactions have been difficult to reveal. Here, we used a cell-ablation technique to remove a subpopulation of amacrine cells from the mouse retina. Their ablation changed transient ganglion cell responses into prolonged discharges. This suggests that transient responses are generated, at least in part, by a truncation of sustained excitatory input to the ganglion cells and that the ablated amacrine cells are critical for this process."
https://openalex.org/W2061630160,"The myelin basic proteins (MBPs) are a set of membrane proteins that function to adhere the cytoplasmic leaflets of the myelin bilayer. During oligodendrocyte maturation prior to compact myelin formation, however, certain MBPs have been observed within the cell body and nucleus. We explored the parameters of the translocation of the exon II-containing MBPs (MBPexII) from the site of synthesis in the cell cytoplasm into the nucleus and in some experiments used GFP as a molecular reporter to monitor the intracellular distribution of MBP-GFP fusion proteins in living cells. We show here that the transport of MBPexII into cell nuclei is an active process, which is temperature and energy dependent, and may be regulated by phosphorylation state. Further, MBPexII can direct the entry of macromolecular complexes into cell nuclei, revealing that the exon II peptide segment may provide a nuclear localization signal (NLS), perhaps a novel one, or may induce a conformational change in the full-length protein that exposes a cryptic NLS. The MBPexII are thus very unusual in that they are plasma membrane proteins that are also targeted to the nucleus. In oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, where the MBPs are naturally expressed, it is likely that karyophilic MBPs subserve a regulatory function in implementing the myelination program."

https://openalex.org/W2329652372,"Radiation resistant squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cell line JSQ-3 carries a mutant form of tumor suppressor gene p53. Treatment of these cells with an adenoviral vector containing wild-type p53 (Av1p53) was able to inhibit their growth in vitro and in vivo while having no effect on normal cells. More significantly, introduction of wtp53 also reduced the radiation-resistance level of this cell line in vitro, in a viral dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, this radiosensitization also carried over to the in vivo situation where the response of JSQ-3 cell-induced mouse xenografts to radiotherapy was markedly enhanced after treatment with Av1p53. Complete, long-term regression of the tumors for up to 162 days was observed when a single dose of Av1p53 was administered in combination with ionizing radiation, demonstrating the effectiveness of this combination of gene therapy and conventional radiotherapy. This sensitization of tumors to radiation therapy by replacement of wtp53 could significantly decrease the rate of recurrence after radiation treatment. Since radiation is one of the most prevalent forms of adjunctive therapy for a variety of cancers, these results have great relevance in moving toward an improved cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2328730164,"Rho small G protein regulates various actin-dependent cell functions. As to the functioning sites of Rho, Rho regulates formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions in many types of cultured cells, whereas we have shown that the association sites of actin filaments with the plasma membrane controlled by the ERM (Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) family are the functioning sites of Rho in MDCK cells stably expressing myc-RhoA. We have investigated here the effect of microinjection of Rho GDI, a negative regulator of Rho which inhibits activation of Rho, C3, an exoenzyme of Clostridium botulinum which ADP-ribosylates Rho and inhibits its functions, or guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio) triphosphate-bound active form of Rho on the intracellular localization of both the ERM family and vinculin, which is one of the structural proteins of focal adhesions, in wild type MDCK cells. The ERM family was preferentially localized at peripheral bundles of actin filaments which are localized at the outer edge of colonies of the cells, microvilli and low Ca2+-induced cortical bundles of actin filaments in wild type MDCK cells. Microinjection of Rho GDI or C3 inhibited the localization of the ERM family at both the peripheral bundles and the low Ca2+-induced cortical bundles. On the other hand, vinculin was localized at both focal adhesions and basal edges of the colonies of the cells, and microinjection of Rho GDI or C3 inhibited the localization of vinculin at both of these sites. These results indicate that activation of Rho is necessary for the association of both the ERM family and vinculin with the plasma membrane in wild type MDCK cells. Microinjection of the guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio) triphosphate-bound form of Rho induced an increase in the localization of vinculin at focal adhesions, but did not induce an increase in the localization of the ERM family at the plasma membrane, indicating that activation of Rho itself is sufficient only for the association of vinculin with the plasma membrane at focal adhesions."
https://openalex.org/W2324975577,"In order to gain a better understanding of the role of p53 in radiation-induced mitotic failure, apoptosis and mutagenesis, we introduced the HPV16 E6 gene via a retroviral vector into the TK6 human lymphoblast cell line which expresses wild type p53. Abrogation of p53 function by E6 resulted in a delayed and reduced apoptotic response and a moderate increase in the frequency of mutations at the thymidine kinase (tk) locus following γ-irradiation, but failed to alter radiosensitivity. The apoptotic response of the E6-transduced line was intermediate between that of wild type TK6 and the WTK1 cell line. WTK1 is derived from the same parental cell line as TK6 but expresses mutant p53. The spontaneous and γ-ray-induced mutation frequencies in E6-transduced TK6 cells, although higher than that of the parental TK6 cell line, were still much lower than that of the WTK1 line. No effect on apoptosis, radiosensitivity or mutability was observed when the HPV16 E6 gene was introduced into the WTK1 cells. These results indicate that p53 does not regulate the radiosensitivity of TK6 cells through the apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, the previously observed enhanced radioresistance and mutability in WTK1 cells must be attributed to a more complex mechanism than p53 status alone."
https://openalex.org/W2323496633,"DNA polymerase alpha-primase is the only known eukaryotic enzyme that can start DNA replication de novo. In this study, we investigated the regulation of DNA replication by phosphorylation of DNA polymerase alpha-primase. The p180 and the p68 subunits of DNA polymerase alpha-primase were phosphorylated using Cyclin A-, B- and E- dependent kinases. This phosphorylation did not influence its DNA polymerase activity on activated DNA, but slightly stimulated primase activity using poly(dT) single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) without changing the product length of primers. In contrast, site-specific initiation of replication on plasmid DNA containing the SV40 origin is affected: Cyclin A-Cdk2 and Cyclin A-Cdc2 inhibited initiation of SV40 DNA replication in vitro, Cyclin B-Cdc2 had no effect and Cyclin E-Cdk2 stimulated the initiation reaction. DNA polymerase alpha-primase that was pre-phosphorylated by Cyclin A-Cdk2 was completely unable to initiate the SV40 DNA replication in vitro; Cyclin B-Cdc2-phosphorylated enzyme was moderately inhibited, while Cyclin E-Cdk2-treated DNA polymerase alpha-primase remained fully active in the initiation reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2329705114,"Concentrations of the bioactive lipids, phosphatidate and diacylglycerol, increased with time in culture in ras- and tyrosine kinase (fps)-transformed fibroblasts but not in control fibroblasts. On Day 3, diacylglycerol and phosphatidate concentrations were about 3.3- and 5.5-fold higher respectively in the ras-transformed compared to control fibroblasts. These concentrations in fps-transformed fibroblasts were increased about twofold. The changes in phosphatidate and diacylglycerol resulted from enhanced phospholipid turnover rather than from synthesis de novo. The increased ratio of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol is explained by decreased activities of two distinct phosphatidate phosphohydrolases and increased diacylglycerol kinase in ras-transformed fibroblasts. Ceramide concentrations were about 2.5- and threefold higher in the fps- and ras-transformed cells respectively on Day 3 compared to the controls. Incubating control fibroblasts from Days 1 to 3 with phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C increased diacylglycerol, phosphatidate and ceramide concentrations, and decreased Mg2+-independent-phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity. 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP had a cytostatic effect in ras-transformed cells, it decreased the concentrations of phosphatidate and diacylglycerol, but increased that of ceramide. The consequences of increased ceramide and phosphatidate concentrations in ras-transformed cells are discussed in relation to signal transduction, cell division and the transformed phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2315965467,"The CREM gene encodes both activators and repressors of cAMP-induced gene expression. An isoform of CREM encodes the powerful transcriptional repressor ICER (Inducible cAMP Early Repressor), which has been shown to be inducible by virtue of an alternative, intronic promoter. The CREM gene belongs to the early response class and displays a characteristic neuroendocrine cell- and tissue-specific expression. To date ICER inducibility has been described in non-replicating, terminally differentiated tissues. In this paper we document a robust induction of CREM expression in the regenerating rat liver after partial hepatectomy. This represents the first link of inducible CREM expression to the phenomenon of cellular proliferation. Furthermore, it represents the first example of transcriptional activation of a cAMP-responsive factor in the regenerating liver. This has significant physiological relevance since the adenylate cyclase signalling pathway is strongly implicated in liver regeneration. Finally, we show that the repressor ICER is inducible in the hepatoma cell line H35 upon activation of the adenylate cyclase and phosphorylation of the activator CREB."

https://openalex.org/W2158131697,"The involvement of murine protein tyrosine phosphatase-PEST (MPTP-PEST) in signal transduction pathways is suggested by its ability to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine residues, its interaction with the adaptor protein SHC and by the presence of five proline-rich stretches in its non-catalytic carboxyl terminus. Proline-rich sequences have been identified as binding sites for Src homology 3 (SH3) domains found in proteins associated with signal transduction events. The ability of these sequences to act as SH3 domain recognition motifs was investigated using bacterially expressed SH3 domains derived from several different signalling proteins. In vitro binding assays indicate that four of these proline-rich sequences constitute specific binding sites for both SH3 domains of the adaptor molecule Grb2. Wild type Grb2, but not Grb2 proteins corresponding to loss-of-function mutants in the Caenorhabditis elegans sem-5 protein, associate with MPTP-PEST in vivo. Experiments in EGF receptor expressing cells show that the interaction between MPTP-PEST and Grb2 results in the binding of this complex to activated EGF receptors. In addition, identification of putative substrate(s) of MPTP-PEST have revealed a candidate protein of approximately 120 kDa which is tyrosine phosphorylated upon EGF stimulation. Together, these results describe a novel SH3 domain-dependent recruitment of a protein tyrosine phosphatase to an activated receptor tyrosine kinase and establish a potential role for MPTP-PEST in signalling pathways at the molecular level."

At midgestation, TWH expression identifies subsets of spinal cord motor neurons and interneurons. TWH-expressing motor neurons were restricted to specific spinal cord levels, distinguishing motor neurons at lumbar from those at cervical levels. To understand the developmental role of TWH, we replaced the TWH gene with the lacZ reporter gene and generated mice with a homozygous disruption of the TWH gene. TWH(-/-) mutant mice had increased perinatal mortality, retarded postnatal growth, and motor weakness. The TWH(-/-) mutation resulted in alterations in the sizes and position of different neuronal populations. Our results demonstrate that TWH plays a critical role in neuronal development and suggest that TWH regulates the early differentiation of neural progenitors."

In contrast to the extensive body of knowledge related to the genetics of ras activation, relatively little is known of the transcriptional events triggered by ras. In previous work we have used differential display to identify Mob-1, a member of α-chemokine family, as one of the immediate transcriptional targets following Ras activation. Here, we provide additional experimental evidence to support this finding by the use of an inducible H-ras expression system, the treatment of Ras farnesyl transferase inhibitor and activation of endogenous Ras by serum growth factors. We further demonstrate that IP-10, the human homolog of Mob-1, is overexpressed in the majority of colorectal cancers."

In this study we attempted to establish whether the tumorigenic progression induced by oncogenic activation of p21ras or pp60c-src in human colonic cells is associated with alterations of the activity and expression of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor suspected to participate in the development of cancer. To this end, we used Caco-2 cells made highly tumorigenic by transfection with an activated Val-12 human Ha-ras gene or with the polyoma middle T (PyMT) oncogene, a constitutive activator of pp60c-src tyrosine kinase activity. Compared with control vector-transfected Caco-2 cells, both oncogene-transfected cell lines exhibited: (i) decreased constitutive NF-κB DNA-binding activity and NF-κB-mediated reporter gene expression, without alteration of their response to TNF-α for activation of these parameters; (ii) reduced NF-κB cytosolic stores along with a decreased p65 expression due, at least in part, to destabilization of p65 mRNA; (iii) a decrease in adhesion to extracellular matrix component-coated substrata which was partially corrected when stimulating NF-κB transcriptional activity with TNF-α. These results indicate that the tumorigenic progression induced by oncogenic p21ras or PyMT/pp60c-src in human colonic Caco-2 cells is associated with a down-regulation of p65 expression and NF-κB activity which could be responsible for the reduced adhesive properties of these cells after oncogene transfection."

https://openalex.org/W1980745837,"Nerve growth factor (NGF)- and ras-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells is accompanied by expression of transin, a secreted metalloproteinase. Retinoic acid (RA) is known to exert important effects on neural cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study we have analysed different PC12 sublines which express either activated Ras or dominant negative p21N17 Ras, to evaluate the influence of retinoic acid (RA) on the response of the transin gene to NGF and Ras. There was a good correlation between neurite extension and induction of transin mRNA levels in the different subclones. NGF did not induce transin mRNA in cells which do not differentiate in response to this neurotrophin. In addition, incubation with RA did not detectably increase basal transin mRNA levels, but caused a significant increase in the transin response to NGF or Ras in cells in which these factors induce a neuronal morphology. Sequences contained within 750 base pairs of the 5′ flanking region of the transin gene confer responsiveness to NGF and Ras, but do not mediate the stimulatory effect of RA. In addition, expression of oncogenic Raf increases transin promoter activity in PC12 cells, but a dominant-negative Raf mutant was unable to block NGF-induced transin activity suggesting the existence of a bifurcation downstream of ras in the signaling mechanism leading to transin expression by NGF."
https://openalex.org/W2019889997,"The ability of the E6 protein from high risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) to degrade p53 via the ubiquitin pathway plays a major role in the development of cervical carcinomas. We have previously generated cell hybrids between a p53 null peripheral neuroepithelioma (PNET) cell line and a cervical carcinoma HeLa cell line which exhibits efficient E6-mediated degradation of p53. All of the resulting hybrids expressed HPV 18 E6 from the HeLa parent and some of the hybrids additionally expressed HPV 16 E6. Surprisingly, in spite of abundant E6 expression, the hybrids expressed relatively high steady-state levels of the wild-type p53 protein. We then examined the hybrids to determine whether other components of the E6-mediated degradation pathway were missing or nonfunctional. Specifically, we determined that the E6-associated protein (E6-AP), essential for E6-mediated degradation, was expressed. We further verified that these hybrids had a functional ubiquitination pathway, which suggests that this phenomenon is not due to a general defect in this pathway. We therefore conclude that other unidentified, possibly cell-specific factors can play a role in the E6-mediated degradative process and may act to inhibit this process."

https://openalex.org/W2328136312,"In the Xenopus egg and oocyte system, oncogenic Ras protein can induce cell cycle arrest. The effect of oncogenic Ras on the cell cycle seems to be mediated by the Raf – Mek – Erk pathway of Ras signal transduction since constitutively active Raf, Mek, or Erk can mimic the effect of oncogenic Ras protein and since specific inhibition of these kinases can block the effect of oncogenic Ras. Using activated Xenopus egg extracts, we previously reported that the cell cycle arrest induced by oncogenic Ras correlates with the activation of a 96 kDa protein that phosphorylates histone h2b in vitro. This result raised the possibility that the 96 kDa kinase (designated as p96h2bk) is a potential target of the Raf – Mek – Erk pathway that links the pathway to the control of the cell cycle. We report here that constitutively active Mek1 could activate p96h2bk in the absence of oncogenic Ras. Moreover, inhibition of endogenous Mek by a specific inhibitor, PD 098059, suppressed the activation of p96h2bk by oncogenic Ras. These results are consistent with the concept that p96h2bk is a component or target of the Raf – Mek – Erk pathway. Furthermore, we have shown that activation of p96h2bk requires serine/threonine phosphorylation of p96h2bk."
