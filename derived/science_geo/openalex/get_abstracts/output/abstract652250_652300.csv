Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cell-entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)2. Here we infected transgenic mice that express human ACE2 (hereafter, hACE2 mice) with SARS-CoV-2 and studied the pathogenicity of the virus. We observed weight loss as well as virus replication in the lungs of hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. The typical histopathology was interstitial pneumonia with infiltration of considerable numbers of macrophages and lymphocytes into the alveolar interstitium, and the accumulation of macrophages in alveolar cavities. We observed viral antigens in bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages and alveolar epithelia. These phenomena were not found in wild-type mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Notably, we have confirmed the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 mice. This mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be valuable for evaluating antiviral therapeutic agents and vaccines, as well as understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes interstitial pneumonia and viral replication in the lungs of transgenic mice that express a human version of ACE2, confirming the pathogenicity of the virus in this model."

Khairallah et al. used experiments and a multiphysics model to determine the origin of the melt spatter and defect formation that degrade the properties of built parts (see the Perspective by Polonsky and Pollock). Informed modulation of laser power is important to avoid disturbing the powder bed and creating laser shadowing. This reduces pore formations and leads to more uniform properties of 3D-printed parts.

Miller et al. appropriated natural components, thylakoid membranes from spinach, for the light reactions and showed that these could be coupled to a synthetic enzymatic cycle that fixes carbon dioxide within water-in-oil droplets. The composition of the droplets could be tuned and optimized and the metabolic activity monitored in real time by NADPH fluorescence (see the Perspective by Gaut and Adamala). These chloroplast-mimicking droplets bring together natural and synthetic components in a small space and are amenable to further functionalization to perform complex biosynthetic tasks.

Mitigation and suppression of new infections have emerged as the two predominant public health control strategies5. Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term. We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests6,7 to identify and deploy recovered individuals8 as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission. Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well-recognized roles in estimating prevalence10,11 and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies12-15."

We report sample collection from Ryugu's surface by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft on 21 February 2019. Touchdown images and global observations of surface colors are used to investigate the stratigraphy of the surface around the sample location and across Ryugu. Latitudinal color variations suggest the reddening of exposed surface material by solar heating and/or space weathering. Immediately after touchdown, Hayabusa2's thrusters disturbed dark, fine grains that originate from the redder materials. The stratigraphic relationship between identified craters and the redder material indicates that surface reddening occurred over a short period of time. We suggest that Ryugu previously experienced an orbital excursion near the Sun."

Our data provide fresh insights into the evolutionary trade-offs that come with successful adaptation of vertebrates to their microbial environment. Border surfaces of multicellular organisms are colonized by a complex ecosystem composed of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively referred to as the microbiota (Blander et al., 2017Blander J.M.

Immune adaptations that maintain homeostasis with the intestinal microbiota.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Microbiota-controlled signaling pathways affect various aspects of host physiology and fitness. For example, we and others have shown that signals of the microbiota are required to calibrate the function of a broad range of mononuclear phagocytes (MPhs), including those residing at non-mucosal sites, such as in spleen, lymph nodes (LNs), and brain. MPhs and microglia of germ-free (GF) mice were unable to produce various cytokines and chemokines upon stimulation, rendering them more susceptible to virus infections (Abt et al., 2012Abt M.C.

USA. 2011; 108: 5354-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). On a mechanistic level, signals from the microbiota were needed to remove a chromatin barrier required for the transcription of immune defense genes after ligation of pathogen sensors (e.g., pattern recognition receptors [PRRs] such as Toll-like receptors). Thus, microbiota-generated signals are required to instruct MPhs during the steady state for future immune defense functions. We refer to such a poised state of MPhs as their basal state. The nature of the microbiota-guided signals and the molecular programs that they control in MPhs to establish such a poised state are poorly understood. Dendritic cells are a subset of MPhs and are subdivided into plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). pDCs can produce high levels of type I interferons (IFN-Is) following virus infections and have been linked to the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases (Reizis, 2019Reizis B. Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells: Development, Regulation, and Function.Immunity. 2019; 50: 37-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). cDCs fulfill critical and non-redundant functions in regulating and inducing T cell (Liu et al., 2007Liu K.

Dendritic cells prime natural killer cells by trans-presenting interleukin 15.Immunity. 2007; 26: 503-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). During an infection, cDCs located at the pathogen entry site take up antigens and transport them to the draining LNs. cDCs are equipped with a plethora of PRRs, the ligation of which leads to cDC activation, cDC maturation (i.e., upregulation of major histocompatibility complexes [MHCs] and co-stimulatory molecules), and the release of inflammatory mediators. By providing all three signals for potent T cell priming, cDCs efficiently translate pathogen recognition by the innate immune system into highly antigen (Ag)-specific adaptive immunity (Janeway, 1989Janeway Jr., C.A. Approaching the asymptote? Evolution and revolution in immunology.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The benefits of adaptive immunity in vertebrates have come with a substantial trade-off, comprising unwanted immune responses to autoantigens and ubiquitous components of the environment. Numerous mechanisms operating within the mammalian immune system cooperatively form a barrier to such deleterious immune responses, referred to as peripheral tolerance. For example, at the immunological steady state, Ag presentation by cDCs induces T cell tolerance to avoid unwanted immune responses against “self” or against harmless, environmental Ag (Bonifaz et al., 2002Bonifaz L. Bonnyay D. Mahnke K. Rivera M. Nussenzweig M.C. Steinman R.M. Efficient targeting of protein antigen to the dendritic cell receptor DEC-205 in the steady state leads to antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex class I products and peripheral CD8+ T cell tolerance.J.

However, despite low level expression of co-stimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines, resting cDCs can prime CD8+ T cells, when components of the peripheral tolerance machinery are removed (Muth et al., 2012Muth S. Schütze K. Schild H. Probst H.C. Release of dendritic cells from cognate CD4+ T-cell recognition results in impaired peripheral tolerance and fatal cytotoxic T-cell mediated autoimmunity.Proc. Natl.

USA. 2010; 107: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The signals and molecular networks instructing the basal state of cDCs are largely unknown but have broad ramifications for the pathophysiology and treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We set out to interrogate on a molecular level the impact of the commensal microbiota on the basal state of cDCs. Using genome-wide profiling of cDCs, we demonstrate that microbiota-controlled IFN-I production by pDCs controlled a distinct transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic basal state of cDCs, enabling them to provide a powerful response following pathogen encounter, but at the same time, also permitting priming of unwanted T cell responses at the steady state. The IFN-I-instructed metabolic basal state of cDCs was characterized by enhanced mitochondrial function, and cDCs genetically deficient for the IFNAR were unfit to prime T cells even if cDCs were directly activated. Previous studies had revealed functional incompetence of cDCs in GF mice during immune responses against viruses (Abt et al., 2012Abt M.C. Osborne L.C. Monticelli L.A. Doering T.A. Alenghat T. Sonnenberg G.F. Paley M.A. Antenus M. Williams K.L.

USA. 2011; 108: 5354-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). In particular, the production of various inflammatory cytokines was reduced. In extension of these data, we now show that, both splenic cDC1 and cDC2 from GF mice were profoundly unresponsive to direct stimulation with CD40 antibodies (Figures 1A–1C). This unresponsiveness is not limited to splenic cDCs, because we found very low levels of serum cytokines in GF mice after anti-CD40 treatment (Figures S1A and S1B). Mice are colonized with an increasingly complex microbiota during the first weeks of life (Hooper et al., 2012Hooper L.V. Littman D.R. Macpherson A.J. Interactions between the microbiota and the immune system.Science. 2012; 336: 1268-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (2687) Google Scholar), and splenic cDCs from 3- and 4-week-old mice were impaired in their tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-12 (Figures S1C and S1D) responses when compared to cDCs from adult mice.Figure S1Commensal Microbiota Instruct MPhs for Cytokine Responses to Microbial Stimulation, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A,B) Mice of the indicated strains were injected with a CD40 antibody and serum TNF (A) or IFN-I (B) concentrations were determined by ELISA or VSV bioassay, respectively.(C,D) Mice of the indicated age were injected with LPS.

Using a transgenic mouse model (dubbed DIETER) allowing for the tamoxifen (TAM)-inducible expression of class I MHC-restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes specifically on cDCs (Probst et al., 2003Probst H.C. Lagnel J. Kollias G. van den Broek M. Inducible transgenic mice reveal resting dendritic cells as potent inducers of CD8+ T cell tolerance.Immunity. 2003; 18: 713-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we had previously shown that Ag presentation on cDCs at steady state resulted in spontaneous priming of CD8+ T cells, when barriers of peripheral tolerance were removed (i.e., CD4+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, or all CD4+ T cells) (Muth et al., 2012Muth S. Schütze K. Schild H. Probst H.C. Release of dendritic cells from cognate CD4+ T-cell recognition results in impaired peripheral tolerance and fatal cytotoxic T-cell mediated autoimmunity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 9059-9064Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To investigate if such cDC activity is also instructed by signals from the microbiota, we treated DIETER mice with antibiotics (ABX) depleting them of culturable bacteria (Figure S1E). As expected, induction of Ag expression on cDCs, after depletion of CD4+ T cells, led to robust expansion of Ag-specific CD8+ T cells, which was significantly diminished in ABX-treated mice (Figure 1D). The data indicate that signals from the commensal microbiota instructs a basal cDC state that allows for powerful cytokine responses following microbe recognition. However, such basal state is also permissive for priming of CD8+ T cells against harmless antigens, an activity that is normally blunted by barriers of peripheral tolerance. GF mice lack all components of the microbiota. We investigated if colonization of GF mice with bacterial consortia of increasing complexity was sufficient to normalize cDC responsiveness. Mono-colonization of GF mice with one gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia [E.] coli JM83) (Hapfelmeier et al., 2010Hapfelmeier S. Lawson M.A. Slack E. Kirundi J.K. Stoel M. Heikenwalder M. Cahenzli J. Velykoredko Y. Balmer M.L. Endt K. et al.Reversible microbial colonization of germ-free mice reveals the dynamics of IgA immune responses.Science. 2010; 328: 1705-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) led to a reproducible increase in TNF production by cDCs in response to poly(I:C) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Figures 1E and 1F). Colonization with a stable model microbiota (referred to as sDMDMm2), consisting of 12 defined bacterial species representing five major prokaryote phyla of gut microbial communities (Uchimura et al., 2016Uchimura Y. Wyss M. Brugiroux S. Limenitakis J.P. Stecher B. McCoy K.D. Macpherson A.J. Complete Genome Sequences of 12 Species of Stable Defined Moderately Diverse Mouse Microbiota 2.Genome Announc. 2016; 4: e00951-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), normalized cDC responses to LPS (Figure 1F), and significantly increased responsiveness to poly(I:C) (Figure 1E). Similar results were obtained when analyzing systemic TNF or IFN-I levels (Figures S1F–S1I). While the data do not exclude that other components of the microbiota may generate signals that prime cDC (and likely broader MPh) function, re-colonization of GF mice with bacterial consortia of increasing complexity progressively restored cDC responsiveness to microbial stimulation. We wondered if functional priming of cDCs would require sensing of commensal microbes via PRRs. To this end, we employed Myd88−/− Trif−/− Cardif−/− (MyTrCa−/−) mice lacking three major adaptors of the microbe sensing machinery and directly stimulated cDCs via CD40 that activates cDCs independent of these PRR adaptors. MyD88 and TRIF are required for TLR signaling, and CARDIF transduces signals from the RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 (Broz and Monack, 2013Broz P. Monack D.M.

Pattern recognition receptors and inflammation.Cell. 2010; 140: 805-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5704) Google Scholar). cDC1 and cDC2 from mice lacking all three adaptor proteins (MyTrCa−/− mice) (Spanier et al., 2014Spanier J. Lienenklaus S. Paijo J. Kessler A. Borst K. Heindorf S. Baker D.P. Kröger A. Weiss S. Detje C.N. et al.Concomitant TLR/RLH signaling of radioresistant and radiosensitive cells is essential for protection against vesicular stomatitis virus infection.J. Immunol. 2014; 193: 3045-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were largely unresponsive to CD40 stimulation, comparable to GF mice (Figures 1A–1C). Interestingly, serum levels of TNF and IFN-I were also substantially reduced after systemic CD40 stimulation (Figures S1A and S1B). In contrast, cDC responses in MyTr−/− double knockout mice and in Cardif−/− mice were not significantly impaired (Figures 1A–1C, S1A, and S1B). Does programming of the cDCs basal state by the microbiota require direct “sensing” of commensal microbial components by cDCs? To explore this, we created mixed bone marrow chimeras by reconstituting lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice with an equal mixture of MyTrCa−/− DIETER (CD45.2) and wild-type (CD45.1) bone marrow, so that only model Ag-expressing cDCs were MyTrCa−/−. MyTrCa+/+ DIETER (CD45.2) and wild-type (CD45.1) mixed chimeras were used as controls. Upon depletion of CD4+ T cells, induction of Ag presentation on both sets of chimeras led to comparable priming of functional GP33–41-specific CD8+ T cells (Figures 1G and 1H). Thus, direct sensing of commensal microbial molecules by cDCs is not required for their steady-state calibration. We next asked if PRR signaling is required at all for priming of CD8+ T cells at the steady state. We generated DIETER mice lacking PRR signaling on all cells by injecting lethally irradiated MyTrCa−/− mice with bone marrow from MyTrCa−/− DIETER mice. In these mice, CD8+ T cell priming upon antigen induction and CD4+ T cell depletion was strongly reduced (Figure 1I). In control chimeras, priming of MyTrCa−/− and MyTrCa+/+ CD8+ T cells was comparable, excluding that the impaired expansion of CD8+ T cells in MyTrCa−/− mice was due to direct signals through these adaptors in T cells (Figure S1J). Thus, functional calibration of cDCs during steady state requires recognition of commensal microorganisms through PRRs utilizing MyD88, TRIF, and/or CARDIF on cells other than cDCs. To obtain insights into microbiota-controlled transcriptional circuits, we performed genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis using RNA isolated from unstimulated splenic cDCs of specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice and GF mice (Figure S2A). Gene Ontology (GO) term clustering of the top 100 differentially expressed genes that were most significantly changed between GF and SPF mice contained functional annotations for cytokine responses. Among the genes included in the GO term “Response to Cytokines” were various transcripts associated with IFN-I signaling (e.g., Oas2, Socs2, Itga6, Itgav, Ifi35, Ifi205, Ifitm1, and Il15) that were less expressed by cDCs from GF mice.

Xiang et al. measured the two-dimensional infrared spectrum of a molecular mixture, W(CO) 6 and W( 13 CO) 6 , with saturated concentrations in a binary solvent embedded in an optical microcavity. This experiment showed that the VET between the asymmetric stretch vibrations of two solute molecules is enhanced via polaritonic intermediate states formed by a strong coupling with the cavity mode. The efficiency is modulated by the cavity lifetime, which provides an opportunity to control the VET process in the liquid phase. This could lead to various practical implementations.

https://openalex.org/W3023788516,"Innate immune cells remember Immunological memory is a phenomenon by which immune cells can quickly recognize an antigen that the host has previously encountered. Certain cells of the innate immune system exhibit memory-like responses know as trained immunity. Rapid, antigen-specific secondary (anamnestic) responses were long thought to be the domain of B and T cells. However, Dai et al. report that monocytes and macrophages can acquire memory specific for particular major histocompatibility complex I antigens using paired A-type immunoglobulin-like receptors (PIR-As) (see the Perspective by Dominguez-Andrés and Netea). This pathway contributes to recognition and rejection of allograft-transplanted tissue from a donor of the same species. Genetic depletion or blockade of PIR-As in mice diminished the rejection of kidney and heart allografts. This work, which expands immunological memory to include myeloid cells, points to targets that may improve organ transplantation outcomes in the future.

We study the onset of the resonance regime by probing the lowest-lying resonance dominated by s and p waves only.

In the brain, lack of copper impairs cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) in the electron transport chain, which leads to progressive neurological injury in Menkes patients. No treatment exists for Menkes disease because of the difficulty in supplying the brain with copper using traditional hydrophilic copper complexes such as copper histidine.

Nocturnal mosquitoes exhibit a behavioral response to divert away from surfaces when vision is unavailable, indicating a short-range, mechanosensory collision-avoidance mechanism. We suggest that this behavior is mediated by perceiving modulations of their self-induced airflow patterns as they enter a ground or wall effect. We used computational fluid dynamics simulations of low-altitude and near-wall flights based on in vivo high-speed kinematic measurements to quantify changes in the self-generated pressure and velocity cues at the sensitive mechanosensory antennae. We validated the principle that encoding aerodynamic information can enable collision avoidance by developing a quadcopter with a sensory system inspired by the mosquito.

Typically, synapse loss precedes symptoms of cognitive and motor decline. This suggests the existence of compensatory mechanisms that can temporarily counteract the effects of ongoing neurodegeneration. Here, we demonstrate that presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) is induced at degenerating neuromuscular junctions, mediated by an evolutionarily conserved activity of presynaptic ENaC channels in both Drosophila and mouse. To assess the consequence of eliminating PHP in a mouse model of ALS-like degeneration, we generated a motoneuron-specific deletion of Scnn1a, encoding the ENaC channel alpha subunit. We show that Scnn1a is essential for PHP without adversely affecting baseline neural function or lifespan. However, Scnn1a knockout in a degeneration-causing mutant background accelerated motoneuron loss and disease progression to twice the rate observed in littermate controls with intact PHP. We propose a model of neuroprotective homeostatic plasticity, extending organismal lifespan and health span."

We used 3T-magnetic resonance imaging to examine patients with SZ, BD, or healthy control (HC) subjects (aged 20-50 years, N = 65 in each group). We generated modulated GM maps through voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for T1-weighted images and skeletonized fractional anisotropy, mean diffusion, and radial diffusivity maps through tract-based special statistics (TBSS) methods for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. These data were analyzed using a generalized linear model with pairwise comparisons between groups with a family-wise error corrected P < 0.017. The VBM analysis revealed widespread decreases in GM volume in SZ compared to HC, but patients with BD showed GM volume deficits limited to the right thalamus and left insular lobe. The TBSS analysis showed alterations of DTI parameters in widespread WM tracts both in SZ and BD patients compared to HC. The two disorders had WM alterations in the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, internal capsule, external capsule, posterior thalamic radiation, and fornix. However, we observed no differences in GM volume or WM integrity between SZ and BD. The study results suggest that GM volume deficits in the thalamus and insular lobe along with widespread disruptions of WM integrity might be the common neural mechanisms underlying the pathologies of SZ and BD."

In metazoans, cell-to-cell communication is predominantly controlled by the activation of specific cell surface receptors localized within the plasma membrane. Receptor-activating ligands are secreted from (paracrine) or presented on the surface (cell contact) of neighboring cells or presented as a humoral ligand with systemic effects (endocrine). Ligand-receptor interaction initiates conformational changes in the receptor to activate diverse intracellular signal transduction events that alter cellular behavior in a context-specific manner.

However, the introduction of a large fluorescent moiety into a protein often compromises the stability and functionality of the target protein.

Despite these advancements, studies reporting quantitative analysis of the binding of a full-length, soluble Wnt protein to a full-length FZD protein on cells remain elusive.

A combination of two recent developments enabled this: 1) the availability of a fluorescently tagged Wnt protein that is active, stable, and secreted into the medium of cultured cells, and 2) a highly sensitive proximity-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay, termed NanoBRET (19Stoddart L.A.

Compared with the standard luciferase from Renilla reniformis, Nluc from the deep-sea shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris is smaller and brighter and has a spectrum reduced by ∼20 nm, all of which lends itself well to the precise study of ligand-receptor interactions in the complex milieu of living cells (19Stoddart L.A.

Our analysis of Wnt-3a binding to full-length FZD4 indicates that a high-affinity Wnt-FZD pair presents with a low-nanomolar equilibrium dissociation constant in living cells. Furthermore, we identify Afamin-dependent differences in the association of Wnt-3a with FZD4. Encouraged by recent reports of successful tagging of mouse Wnt-3a (16Farin H.F. Jordens I. Mosa M.H.

We fused eGFP directly to the N terminus of Wnt-3a, which projects away from the Wnt/FZD-CRD binding region (21Hirai H. Matoba K. Mihara E. Arimori T. Takagi J. Crystal structure of a mammalian Wnt-frizzled complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 (31036956): 372-37910.1038/s41594-019-0216-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Janda C.Y. Waghray D.

Our construct is similar to Flag-GFP-Wnt-3a generated by Takada et al. but lacks the Flag epitope tag (18Takada R. Mii Y. Krayukhina E. Maruyama Y. Mio K. Sasaki Y. Shinkawa T. Pack C.G. Sako Y. Sato C. Uchiyama S. Takada S. Assembly of protein complexes restricts diffusion of Wnt3a proteins.Commun.

We generated a stably expressing L-cell line, which secretes biochemically stable eGFP-mWnt-3a into the medium similarly to WT Wnt-3a (Fig. 1b, lower panels, and Fig. S1b). When the conditioned medium (CM) is tested for functional activity using T-cell factor (TCF) reporter assays, eGFP-Wnt-3a behaves like WT Wnt-3a when using NCI-H1703 cells (Fig. 1b, upper graph). H1703 cells were chosen because they display strong Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity (23Winn R.A. Bremnes R.M. Bemis L. Franklin W.A. Miller Y.E. Cool C. Heasley L.E. Gamma-catenin expression is reduced or absent in a subset of human lung cancers and re-expression inhibits transformed cell growth.Oncogene. 2002; 21 (12386812): 7497-750610.1038/sj.onc.1205963Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and distinct cell surface expression of overexpressed Wnt receptors. Using HEK293 cells, however, eGFP-Wnt-3a shows only ≈20% activity of WT Wnt-3a (Fig. 1b, upper right graph). Transfection of LRP6 increased the basal Wnt activity of HEK293 cells and, under these conditions, the activity of eGFP-Wnt-3a relative to that of Wnt-3a increased from ≈20% to ≈60% (Fig. S1d). We next tested the ability of eGFP-Wnt-3a CM to induce LRP6 phosphorylation, which occurs in response to acute pathway stimulation (24Zeng X. Tamai K. Doble B. Li S. Huang H. Habas R. Okamura H. Woodgett J. He X. A dual-kinase mechanism for Wnt co-receptor phosphorylation and activation.Nature. 2005; 438 (16341017): 873-87710.1038/nature04185Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 25Davidson G. Wu W.

Similar to Wnt-3a CM, the addition of eGFP-Wnt-3a CM to either HEK293 cells (Fig. 1c) or NCI-H1703 cells (Fig. S1, d–e) promotes phosphorylation of endogenous LRP6, which is accompanied by the characteristic upshift of the mature, cell surface LRP6 protein band (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1d). Further, we validated the activity of eGFP-Wnt-3a in vivo in Xenopus embryos, which provides a physiologically relevant model system for assessing Wnt activity (26Hoppler S. Studying Wnt signaling in Xenopus.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 469 (19109718): 319-33210.1007/978-1-60327-469-2_21Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Duplication of the primary embryonic axis is well known to be robustly induced by Wnts (27McMahon A.P. Moon R.T. Ectopic expression of the proto-oncogene int-1 in Xenopus embryos leads to duplication of the embryonic axis.Cell. 1989; 58 (2673541): 1075-108410.1016/0092-8674(89)90506-0Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and mouse eGFP-Wnt-3a displays activities similar to those of untagged Wnt-3a in the axis duplication assay (Fig. 1d). Wnt-3a/eGFP-Wnt-3a CM was also prepared using transiently transfected HEK293F suspension cells in serum-free medium (Fig. S1e). The serum component Afamin binds to Wnt-3a and aids its secretion and/or release from cells into serum-free medium (28Mihara E. Hirai H. Yamamoto H. Tamura-Kawakami K. Matano M. Kikuchi A. Sato T. Takagi J. Active and water-soluble form of lipidated Wnt protein is maintained by a serum glycoprotein afamin/alpha-albumin.Elife. 2016; 5: e1162110.7554/eLife.11621Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and Afamin also improved eGFP-Wnt-3a secretion (Fig. S1f). Taken together, these results confirm that synthesis, secretion, stability, and signaling activity of eGFP-Wnt-3a are largely preserved upon fusion of the 25-kDa eGFP protein to the N terminus of Wnt-3a. Wnt proteins are acylated in the endoplasmic reticulum by the palmitoyltransferase porcupine (29Gao X. Hannoush R.N. Single-cell imaging of Wnt palmitoylation by the acyltransferase porcupine.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10 (24292069): 61-6810.1038/nchembio.1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and the Wnt-specific chaperone EVI/Wntless mediates subsequent transport through the secretory pathway, which is necessary for correct cell surface transportation and release of lipidated Wnts from cells (30Bartscherer K. Boutros M. Regulation of Wnt protein secretion and its role in gradient formation.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9 (18787559): 977-98210.1038/embor.2008.167Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Herr P. Basler K. Porcupine-mediated lipidation is required for Wnt recognition by Wls.Dev. Biol. 2012; 361 (22108505): 392-40210.1016/j.ydbio.2011.11.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Since eGFP-Wnt-3a is efficiently secreted from mammalian cells, we investigated whether secretion depends on EVI/Wntless using ΔEVI mutant cells. Expression levels of WT and eGFP-Wnt-3a are similar; however, neither is secreted in ΔEVI mutant HEK293 cells (Fig. 2a). Another characteristic of lipidated Wnt proteins is their trafficking in exosomes, which is one mechanism that accounts for Wnt secretion (32Zhang L. Wrana J.L. The emerging role of exosomes in Wnt secretion and transport.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2014; 27 (24791688): 14-1910.1016/j.gde.2014.03.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Gross J.C. Chaudhary V. Bartscherer K. Boutros M. Active Wnt proteins are secreted on exosomes.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14 (22983114): 1036-104510.1038/ncb2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In a further confirmation of the functional similarity between WT and fluorescently tagged Wnt-3a, exosomes purified from conditioned medium associate with both Wnt-3a and eGFP-Wnt-3a (Fig. 2b and Fig. S2). This was the case for exosomes purified using either ultracentrifugation (Fig. 2b and Fig. S2) or magnetic-activated cell sorting antibody-based sorting (Fig. S2). Exosomes were prepared from either HEK293 adherent cells in serum-containing medium (Fig. 2b) or HEK293F suspension cells in serum-free medium (Fig. S2). Wnt-3a acts through FZDs and LRP5/6 to transduce Wnt/β-catenin signaling manifested in the phosphorylation of LRP5/6, phosphorylation of the scaffold protein Disheveled (DVL), stabilization of β-catenin, and transcriptional regulation of TCF/LEF-dependent genes. Although endogenously expressed FZDs in HEK293 cells are sufficient to mediate WNT/β-catenin pathway activation, removal of FZD expression blunts Wnt-induced signaling (34Eubelen M. Bostaille N.

To define the role of FZDs in the eGFP-Wnt-3a-induced WNT/β-catenin response, we compared the transcriptional response induced by untagged Wnt-3a and eGFP-Wnt-3a in WT HEK293 cells or HEK293 cells lacking FZD1,2,4,5,7,8 (35Voloshanenko O. Gmach P. Winter J. Kranz D. Boutros M.

The complete absence of a Wnt response in FZD mutant HEK293 cells emphasizes that Wnt/β-catenin signaling activated by eGFP-Wnt-3a is transduced in an FZD-dependent manner (Fig. 2c). Transfection of FZD2 in the FZD mutant cells restores the ability of both untagged Wnt-3a and eGFP-Wnt-3a to transduce WNT/β-catenin signaling (Fig. 2c). Extracellular dispersal of Wnt proteins contributes to signaling events (38Pani A.M. Goldstein B. Direct visualization of a native Wnt in vivo reveals that a long-range Wnt gradient forms by extracellular dispersal.Elife. 2018; 7: e3832510.7554/eLife.38325Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and it is reported that Wnt-3a forms homotrimeric complexes, with dynamic formation of larger structures controlling the range with which Wnt proteins can diffuse through the extracellular space (18Takada R. Mii Y. Krayukhina E. Maruyama Y. Mio K. Sasaki Y. Shinkawa T. Pack C.G. Sako Y. Sato C. Uchiyama S. Takada S. Assembly of protein complexes restricts diffusion of Wnt3a proteins.Commun. Biol. 2018; 1 (30320232): 16510.1038/s42003-018-0172-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To study the diffusion of our fluorescently tagged Wnt-3a, we developed a controllable, microdroplet-based cell spheroid formation and fusion assay (see Materials and methods for details), which provides a visual readout of Wnt paracrine signaling. For the fluorescently tagged Wnt-3a, spheroids are prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with mCherry-Wnt-3a, which has an activity similar to that of eGFP-Wnt-3a (Fig. 3a). For the Wnt/β-catenin signaling readout, we prepared spheroids of TOP-GFP HEK293 reporter cells, representing a TCF activity-reporting fluorescent reporter assay (see Supporting information for details). Confocal imaging of spheroids was performed 24 h or 48 h after their fusion, and the activation of TCF activity evoked by mCherry-Wnt3a-secreting cells is evident (Fig. 3b). The strongest TOP-GFP reporter activation is detected in cells that are in direct contact with the mCherry-Wnt-3a-expressing cells (see arrows in Fig. 3b, 24 h); however, distinct activation of TOP-GFP is observed in all spheroid cells, including those located several cell diameters away from mCherry-Wnt-3a-expressing cells. Background activation of fluorescence in TOP-GFP spheroids is low at the 24-h time point, and fluorescence levels are also similar after their fusion with control spheroids prepared from LacZ-transfected cells (Fig. 3b, 24 h), which confirms specific and mCherry-Wnt-3a-dependent activation. At the 48-h time point, background TOP-GFP reporter fluorescence increased only marginally in the control spheroid fusions, whereas the fluorescence intensity in TOP-GFP spheroids fused to mCherry-Wnt-3a-producing spheroids increased substantially (Fig. 3, b and c). These results indicate that fluorescently tagged Wnt-3a can readily diffuse between the tightly packed cells in the spheroids to signal at a distance. Wnts bind to FZDs with some degree of promiscuity (9Dijksterhuis J.P. Baljinnyam B. Stanger K. Sercan H.O. Ji Y. Andres O. Rubin J.S. Hannoush R.N. Schulte G.

To assess the relative interaction of eGFP-Wnt-3a to FZDs on live cells, we generated stable NCI-H1703 cell lines expressing moderate levels of FZD1–10 C-terminally tagged with mCherry at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4a and Fig. S3b). Cell lines with broadly similar expression levels of FZD1,2,4,6,7,8,9 at the cell surface were selected for imaging (Fig. 4a, top); however, suitable cell lines for FZD3,5,10 could not be obtained.

https://openalex.org/W3021139144,"Synapse formation is a dynamic process essential for the development and maturation of the neuronal circuitry in the brain. At the synaptic cleft, trans-synaptic protein–protein interactions are major biological determinants of proper synapse efficacy. The balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (E-I balance) stabilizes synaptic activity, and dysregulation of the E-I balance has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the E-I balance remain to be elucidated. Here, using single-cell transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiology approaches to murine CA1 pyramidal neurons obtained from organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, we investigate neuroligin (Nlgn) genes that encode a family of postsynaptic adhesion molecules known to shape excitatory and inhibitory synaptic function. We demonstrate that the NLGN3 protein differentially regulates inhibitory synaptic transmission in a splice isoform–dependent manner at hippocampal CA1 synapses. We also found that distinct subcellular localizations of the NLGN3 isoforms contribute to the functional differences observed among these isoforms. Finally, results from single-cell RNA-Seq analyses revealed that Nlgn1 and Nlgn3 are the major murine Nlgn genes and that the expression levels of the Nlgn splice isoforms are highly diverse in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our results delineate isoform-specific effects of Nlgn genes on the E-I balance in the murine hippocampus.

Our results delineate isoform-specific effects of Nlgn genes on the E-I balance in the murine hippocampus. Neuroligin proteins (NLGNs) were the first identified binding partners of α-latrotoxin receptors, neurexin proteins (NRXs), and localize at postsynaptic sites to regulate synapse maturation and function (1Sudhof T.C. Synaptic neurexin complexes: a molecular code for the logic of neural circuits.Cell. 2017; 171 (29100073): 745-76910.1016/j.cell.2017.10.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Four Nlgn genes (Nlgn1, Nlgn2, Nlgn3, and Nlgn4) encode trans-synaptic adhesion proteins (NLGN1, NLGN2, NLGN3, and NLGN4) that contain extracellular cholinesterase-like domains and transmembrane and PDZ-binding motif–containing intracellular domains. Whereas the intracellular domain is important for NLGN binding with postsynaptic scaffold molecules, the extracellular domain confers the formation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses with NRX, its sole presynaptic binding partner. Therefore, precise combinations of NRX-NLGN interactions allow NLGN to diversify synapse identity. NLGN1 and NLGN2 are postsynaptic adhesion molecules localized to excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively. Overexpression, knockdown, and knockout approaches have revealed that NLGN1 is important for excitatory synaptic structure and transmission and synaptic plasticity, but not for inhibitory synaptic function (2Jiang M.

This unique ability alludes to a NLGN3 protein-specific molecular code that promotes its translocation to both excitatory and inhibitory sites. Splice insertion in Nlgn genes differentially regulates E-I balance and alters their binding affinity with presynaptic NRX proteins. In the extracellular cholinesterase-like domain, Nlgn genes have one or two splice insertion sites, Nlgn1 (A and B sites), Nlgn2 (A), and Nlgn3 (A1 and A2), leading to 2-4 theoretical splice isoforms. The splice insertion site B in NLGN1 determines its binding preference to NRXs (13Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Südhof T.C.

Similarly, NLGN2 contains a splice insertion at site A, which regulates inhibitory synaptic function (8Nguyen Q.A. Horn M.E. Nicoll R.A.

However, to the best of our knowledge, the splice isoform–specific function of NLGN3 and the transcript levels of Nlgn splice isoforms at the single-cell level have not been addressed. In the present study, we assess the function of NLGN3 splice isoforms on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons in mouse organotypic slice cultures. Our results suggest that NLGN3 up- or down-regulates inhibitory synaptic transmission in a splice isoform–dependent manner. Furthermore, our single-cell RNA-Seq analysis reveals that Nlgn1 and Nlgn3 are the major Nlgn genes, and the expressions of Nlgn splice variants are highly distinct in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. The Nlgn3 gene contains two splice insertion sites (A1 and A2) that can yield four NLGN3 splice isoforms (Nlgn3Δ, A1, A2, and A1A2). NLGN3Δ lacks all splice insertions, whereas NLGN3A1, 3A2, and 3A1A2 receive insertion of A1, A2, or both A1A2 cassettes, respectively. To examine the potential roles of NLGN3 splice isoforms on excitatory and inhibitory synapse function, we biolistically transfected the Nlgn3 splice isoform genes in CA1 pyramidal cells of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (Fig. 1). Transfection of NLGN3 splice variants did not alter gross cell morphology or levels of overexpressed NLGN3 splice variants identified by HA immunoreactivity (Fig. S1, A and B). Simultaneous electrophysiological recordings were made from transfected and neighboring untransfected neurons. CA1 pyramidal neurons overexpressing NLGN3Δ or 3A2 showed increased evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) compared with neighboring untransfected control neurons and a marked increase in excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), as reported previously (Fig. 1, A and C) (7Shipman S.L. Schnell E. Hirai T. Chen B.S. Roche K.W. Nicoll R.A. Functional dependence of neuroligin on a new non-PDZ intracellular domain.Nat.

In contrast, overexpression of NLGN3A1 or 3A1A2 resulted in reduced amplitude of IPSCs and increased amplitude of EPSCs compared with neighboring untransfected cells (Fig. 1, B and D). Paired stimulation of input fibers with a short interval (50 ms) induced paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and depression (PPD) of EPSCs and IPSCs, respectively. NLGN3Δ or 3A2 transfection displayed both reduced AMPAR-PPF and GABAAR-PPD compared with untransfected neurons, consistent with previous work (5Futai K. Kim M.J. Hashikawa T. Scheiffele P. Sheng M. Hayashi Y. Retrograde modulation of presynaptic release probability through signaling mediated by PSD-95-neuroligin.Nat.

As paired-pulse ratio (PPR) inversely correlates with presynaptic release probability, these results suggest that overexpression of NLGN3Δ and 3A2 can modulate presynaptic release probability. NLGN3 increased or decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission in a splice isoform–dependent manner, whereas all NLGN3 splice isoforms enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission. Next, we tested whether NLGN3 overexpression changes membrane excitability. The input-output relationship of CA1 pyramidal neurons transfected with any NLGN3 splice isoforms exhibited no significant difference compared with untransfected control neurons (Fig. S2). The findings above suggest that NLGN3 splice isoforms regulate synaptic but not membrane functions. Expression of NLGN3 at excitatory and inhibitory synapses has been observed in primary neurons, but in vivo NLGN3 expression has been studied only in the cerebellum and striatum (11Budreck E.C.

To ensure the expression of NLGN3 in the hippocampus, we performed immunohistochemistry against NLGN3 with the markers for excitatory and inhibitory synapses, vesicular glutamate transporter type 1 (VGluT1) and vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT), respectively (Fig. 2). Our NLGN3 antibody, validated by Nlgn3 knockout tissue, detected punctate signals in the hippocampus (Fig. 2, A and B). The signals overlapped with VGluT1 and VIAAT puncta, indicating that NLGN3 proteins are targeted to both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). To understand the mechanistic roles of NLGN3 splice isoforms in inhibitory synaptic transmission, we next performed immunocytochemistry to elucidate the subcellular localization of NLGN3Δ and 3A1A2, which displayed strong enhancement and suppression of IPSC, respectively. Excitatory synaptic sites were characterized by spine or VGluT1. Inhibitory synaptic sites were identified by the dendritic shaft proximal to VIAAT puncta. HA immunoreactivity illustrated that NLGN3A1A2 is highly concentrated in spines. In contrast, NLGN3Δ showed more diffuse expression in both spines and dendrites (Fig. 3A). The ratio of NLGNA1A2 signals between excitatory and inhibitory synapses was significantly higher than that of 3Δ (Fig. 3B). Next, we addressed whether these NLGN3 splice isoforms differentially promote excitatory and inhibitory synapses by comparing NLGN3/GFP and GFP (control) transfected neurons. Importantly, inhibitory synapse density was comparable among NLGN3Δ, 3A1A2, and control, whereas VIAAT signal intensity in 3Δ-expressing neurons was significantly higher than that of 3A1A2 and control (Fig. 3, C and D). The spine density or length was comparable among NLGN3Δ, 3A1A2, and control neurons (Fig. 3, E and F). The signal intensities of VGluT1 were markedly elevated in neurons overexpressing NLGN3Δ or 3A1A2 compared with control neurons (Fig. 3, G and H). These results suggest that differences in the subcellular localization of NLGN3Δ and 3A1A2 contribute to their distinct inhibitory synaptic functions. Last, we tested whether NLGN3Δ or 3A1A2 overexpression changes endogenous expression of NLGN2 protein, an inhibitory synapse-specific NLGN protein (3Chubykin A.A. Atasoy D. Etherton M.R. Brose N.

The t-SNE plot indicates that the four cell transcripts (G418) were clustered together and close to that of adult hippocampal CA1-3 pyramidal neurons derived from the Allen Brain Atlas (Fig. 4A). The expression of Nlgn genes was clustered and well-correlated with the single-cell RNA-Seq data in the RNA-Seq data sets provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (Fig. 4B). The quantification of Nlgn genes (Fig. 4C) indicates that the expression of Nlgn1 and Nlgn3 are comparable but that of Nlgn2 is significantly lower than the other two genes. We also compared the expression of Nlgn splice isoforms in each Nlgn gene. Six Nlgn splice isoforms, Nlgn1A, 1B, 2Δ, 3Δ, and 3A1, that were not annotated were manually modified (Fig. S4A), and their expression was compared. Nlgn1Δ, 1B, and 1AB were the most highly expressed Nlgn1 splice isoforms (Fig. 4D). Nlgn2Δ was the only isoform counted in the Nlgn2 gene (Fig. 4E). Nlgn1A and 2A transcripts were not detected in any of the four CA1 pyramidal neurons. Importantly, Nlgn3Δ and 3A2, which exhibited increased inhibitory synaptic transmission, were the dominant Nlgn3 splice isoforms in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Fig. 4F). The expressions of Nlgn3A1 and 3A1A2 were significantly lower than that of Nlgn3Δ (TPM: Nlgn3A1: 0.004 ± 0.004, 3A1A2: 0.3 ± 0.3). The expression of these single-cell Nlgn splice isoforms was also confirmed by semi-quantitative PCR (Fig. S4B). Trans-synaptic protein–protein interactions are fundamental biological events for synapse formation, maturation, and function. NLGNs are critical postsynaptic adhesion molecules that regulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Here we demonstrated that NLGN3 regulates inhibitory synaptic transmission and excitatory and inhibitory synapse localization in a splice isoform–dependent manner. Our single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed that Nlgn3Δ and 3A2 are the highest-expressed Nlgn3 splice isoforms in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. The distinct subcellular localization of NLGN3Δ and 3A1A2 suggests intriguing mechanisms regarding how splice isoforms influence synapse specificity. Given that the intracellular and transmembrane domains are identical between NLGN3 splice isoforms, each isoform exerts their synapse coding effect through their unique extracellular domains. Similarly, the extracellular domain of NLGN2 mediates changes in inhibitory synaptic function (6Futai K. Doty C.D. Baek B. Ryu J. Sheng M. Specific trans-synaptic interaction with inhibitory interneuronal neurexin underlies differential ability of neuroligins to induce functional inhibitory synapses.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33 (23426688): 3612-362310.1523/JNEUROSCI.1811-12.2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Based on our current knowledge, NRXs are the only trans-synaptic family proteins that directly bind to NLGNs. Trans-synaptic interactions between NLGN3Δ, but not 3A1A2, and NRXs modulate inhibitory synaptic transmission in pyramidal neurons. We previously reported that postsynaptic NLGN2 can couple with presynaptic αNRX1 but not with βNRX1 to form functional inhibitory synapses (6Futai K. Doty C.D. Baek B. Ryu J. Sheng M. Specific trans-synaptic interaction with inhibitory interneuronal neurexin underlies differential ability of neuroligins to induce functional inhibitory synapses.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33 (23426688): 3612-362310.1523/JNEUROSCI.1811-12.2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that the specific binding of NLGN and NRX isoforms regulates functional synapse formation. It is possible that inhibitory interneurons do not express NRX isoforms that can bind to NLGN3A1A2. Therefore, NLGN3A1A2 may exclusively localize to excitatory synapses. Further studies should be performed to identify specific NRX-NLGN3 isoform interactions that affect inhibitory synaptic function. Another possible mechanism is cis-cis protein interactions between NLGN3 and postsynaptic proteins. It has been reported that protein complexes formed between the extracellular domain of NLGN1 and NMDAR are important for synaptic function (19Budreck E.C. Kwon O.B. Jung J.H. Baudouin S. Thommen A. Kim H.S. Fukazawa Y. Harada H. Tabuchi K. Shigemoto R. Scheiffele P. Kim J.H. Neuroligin-1 controls synaptic abundance of NMDA-type glutamate receptors through extracellular coupling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23269831): 725-73010.1073/pnas.1214718110Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). NLGN3 splice variants may have different binding interactions with postsynaptic proteins that provide distinct functions on inhibitory synapses. It has been suggested that the relative levels of NLGNs and their postsynaptic scaffold complex at excitatory and inhibitory synapses determine E-I balance (20Levinson J.N. El-Husseini A. Building excitatory and inhibitory synapses: balancing neuroligin partnerships.Neuron. 2005; 48 (16242398): 171-17410.1016/j.neuron.2005.09.017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Additional studies are required, but it is interesting to address the hypothesis that postsynaptic NLGN3A1 and A1A2 are strong and specific regulators at excitatory synaptic sites and sequester the necessary protein interactions (i.e. NLGN2-mediated scaffold complex) from inhibitory synapses to reduce inhibitory synaptic transmission. The single-cell sequencing results demonstrate a comprehensive unbiased gene expression profile of Nlgn splice isoforms in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons obtained from neonatal mice. Our transcriptome findings are highly correlated with the expression pattern of the three Nlgns genes provided by the Allen Brain Atlas single-cell database from adult neurons, indicating that the expression ratio of Nlgns are stable throughout development. Interestingly, NLGN2 has been well-characterized at inhibitory synapses, yet its transcript levels were significantly lower than Nlgn1 and Nlgn3 (Fig. 4, B and C). NLGN2 may have unique post-translational modifications and turnover mechanisms compared with NLGN1 and NLGN3. The expression of Nlgn3A1 and 3A1A2 were much lower than of Nlgn3Δ and 3A2, suggesting that these two splice isoforms are not the major functional Nlgn3 molecules under basal conditions. Further work is necessary to address whether modifications to neuronal activity such as synaptic plasticity can alter the expression of Nlgn splice isoforms. A shift in E-I balance has been considered a pathophysiological hallmark of neurodevelopmental disorders and repeatedly reported in corresponding mouse models (21Nelson S.B. Valakh V. Excitatory/inhibitory balance and circuit homeostasis in autism spectrum disorders.Neuron. 2015; 87 (26291155): 684-69810.1016/j.neuron.2015.07.033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar).

Knowing how the cross-linking of collagen changes with age is key to understanding why the mechanical properties of tissues change over a lifetime. The current scientific consensus is that collagen cross-linking increases with age and that this increase leads to tendon stiffening. Here, we show that this view should be reconsidered. Using MS-based analyses, we demonstrated that during aging of healthy C57BL/6 mice, the overall levels of collagen cross-linking in tail tendon decreased with age. However, the levels of lysine glycation in collagen, which is not considered a cross-link, increased dramatically with age. We found that in 16-week-old diabetic db/db mice, glycation reaches levels similar to those observed in 98-week-old C57BL/6 mice, while the other cross-links typical of tendon collagen either decreased or remained the same as those observed in 20-week-old WT mice. These results, combined with findings from mechanical testing of tendons from these mice, indicate that overall collagen cross-linking in mouse tendon decreases with age. Our findings also reveal that lysine glycation appears to be an important factor that contributes to tendon stiffening with age and in diabetes.

Our findings also reveal that lysine glycation appears to be an important factor that contributes to tendon stiffening with age and in diabetes. The literature surrounding the mechanical and chemical properties of collagen and changes which occur with age is extensive. The general consensus is that as collagen ages there is an increase in the stiffness with loss of elasticity and that this is due to an increase in covalent intermolecular cross-linking between collagen molecules which develops with age (1Fratzl, P., (ed) (2008) Collagen: Structure and Mechanics. Springer, New York, NY.Google Scholar). In this paper we challenge the simplicity of this conclusion. The collagen cross-links can be divided into two groups, those that are of enzymatic origin and those that form through purely chemical reactions with reactive molecules perfusing the tissues. The enzymatically derived cross-links that are first formed can be analyzed after reduction with sodium borohydride (2Bailey A.J. Peach C.M. Isolation and structural identification of a labile intermolecular crosslink in collagen.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Another collagen cross-link, histidine-hydroxymerodesmosine (HHMD), is commonly found during the analysis of reduced samples (4Tanzer M.L. Housley T. Berube L. Fairweather R. Franzblau C. Gallop P.M.

These cross-links are early structures in the enzymatic cross-linking process and are often described as immature cross-links. The immature cross-links can go on to form irreversible cross-links (1Fratzl, P., (ed) (2008) Collagen: Structure and Mechanics. Springer, New York, NY.Google Scholar) (pyridinolines), often described in the literature as “mature” cross-links, through further reactions. It has been noted in numerous papers that the number of immature cross-links per mole of collagen decreases with age and that the increase in mature pyridinoline cross-links does not seem to match this decrease (7Robins S.P. Shimokomaki M. Bailey A.J. The chemistry of the collagen cross-links. Age-related changes in the reducible components of intact bovine collagen fibres.Biochem.

In papers describing mature cross-link formation, the emphasis is usually on the increase in mature cross-links, and this increase is correlated to an increase in stiffness of the tissue; however, this overlooks the fact that there is potentially an overall decrease in cross-linking with age from the loss of the immature cross-links. The paradox here is that if total cross-linking is decreasing with age, then how is it that the tissues get stiffer? Cross-links formed through nonenzymatic processes involving sugars are referred to as advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and in this paper, we include them when referring to mature cross-links. These are formed through the reaction of sugars or products of sugar metabolism with collagen, which then react further to create cross-links. The AGE cross-links generally considered to be most important are glucosepane and pentosidine (9Saito M. Marumo K. Collagen cross-links as a determinant of bone quality: a possible explanation for bone fragility in aging, osteoporosis, and diabetes mellitus.Osteoporos.

A significant proportion of the literature has focused on increased AGE cross-linking, particularly glucosepane, as a potential cause of stiffening in aging tendon. This has been concluded through correlations of measured AGE cross-link levels with the mechanical testing of diabetic tissue and of collagen incubated in vitro in the presence of sugars. However, these studies measured the absolute glucosepane concentration not as a proportion of the total collagen content but usually as a relative increase in signal (11Nash A. Notou M. Lopez-Clavijo A.F. Bozec L. de Leeuw N.H. Birch H.L. Glucosepane is associated with changes to structural and physical properties of collagen fibrils.Matrix Biology Plus. 2019; 4: 10001310.1016/j.mbplus.2019.100013Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or as a proportion of the extracted insoluble collagen content (12Monnier V.M. Bautista O. Kenny D. Sell D.R. Fogarty J. Dahms W. Cleary P.A. Lachin J. Genuth S. Collagen glycation, glycoxidation, and crosslinking are lower in subjects with long-term intensive versus conventional therapy of type 1 diabetes.Diabetes. 1999; 48 (10102706): 870-88010.2337/diabetes.48.4.870Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Here we measured the absolute glucosepane content as a proportion of the total collagen content of tendon in addition to the pentosidine content and the glycation products of lysine and hydroxylysine. Although increases in glucosepane with age have been demonstrated, without knowing the absolute amount relative to the total collagen content it is impossible to assess if glucosepane cross-linking is an important factor in the stiffening of normal healthy tendon during aging and what the impact of other AGEs might be. In this study we chose to use mouse tail tendon because it is primarily collagen I and the impact of altered cross-linking on the mechanical properties can be readily tested. We used tendon from WT C57BL/6 mice because they have been shown not to develop diabetes (13Leiter E.H. Premdas F. Harrison D.E. Lipson L.G. Aging and glucose homeostasis in C57BL/6J male mice.FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2807-281110.1096/fasebj.2.12.3044905Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and so represent a model of healthy aging. We studied both the mechanical and chemical changes across a population of mice from 8 weeks to 100 weeks old. In order to remove as many population variables as possible and show what happens in the normal, healthy aging process, a cohort of C57BL/6 mice housed under highly controlled conditions of diet and environment were used. The aim of the study described here was to clarify the quantitative changes in cross-linking that occur in normal healthy mouse tail tendon with age and identify which cross-links are likely to give rise to the altered physical properties with age. Blood glucose levels were found to be controlled well across all age groups under fasting and nonfasting conditions (Fig. S1, a and b). The approximate rate of collagen synthesis in tendon at 33, 63, and 88 weeks of age was determined by feeding [13C6]lysine for 28 days and then measuring the incorporation of the label into the collagen within the tissues. The rate of incorporation of [13C6]lysine was found to be between 0.04% and 0.06% collagen lysine content per day in tail tendon, showing little change with age (Fig. S1c). The stress-strain profiles for multiple tail tendons from 5 mice with a range of ages were measured using a tensile stress stage (“stress” is defined as force/cross-sectional area; “strain” is defined as extension/initial length). There are 4 tendons for each vertebral bone in the tail, which run from the base of the tail to each bone insertion point in four bundles of tendons. The individual tendons were carefully dissected out from the bundles for use. Individual tendons were stretched to the breaking point at a rate of 1 mm/min and the stress measured every 0.5 s. The stress-strain profiles (Fig. 2) for the fibers from younger animals were more homogeneous across the population than those from older animals. Tendon from 10-week-old mice showed an initial stretching phase followed by a long plastic extension phase before breaking. The stress-strain profiles of tendons from older animals had a much greater spread, with some fibers still showing a plastic extension phase and others breaking earlier at a lower strain with only a modest plastic extension phase. With increasing age, a greater proportion of the tendons showed an increase in the gradient of the initial stretching phase; that is, the stiffness (Young's modulus) of the tendons increased. The initial stretching phase in animals of all ages extended to about 5% strain before transitioning into the plastic phase. Young adult tendons in the 20-week-old group frequently reached a greater strain before breaking than either younger tendons or tendons more than 1 year old. The picture of changes seen here is more subtle than the impression usually presented in the literature, where a simplified schematic of increasing stiffness of tendon with age is shown. The cross-links present and collagen content were measured by HPLC-MS using tissue processing and MS methods developed for this project. It was of particular concern to us to remove reactive soluble compounds released from cell lysis, such as ribose-5-phosphate, which are known to be highly reactive glycating molecules. To do this we used a continuous-flow system to wash the soluble components from the samples. We confirmed that the processing method for removal of soluble components did not impact the proportions of analytes under study by comparing the levels in tendon immediately after dissection without processing and after processing. In addition to this, a novel method for the analysis of the AGE cross-link glucosepane by MS was developed where the acid hydrolysis products of both the endogenous and synthetic 13C5-labeled glucosepane used to spike the sample before hydrolysis were measured. Fig. 3 shows changes in the cross-links found in mouse tail tendon with age. The most abundant cross-link at all ages was HLNL, and the greatest change with age occurred in the level of this cross-link. A large drop in HLNL occurred up to 20 weeks when the animal was maturing, decreasing from 3 cross-links per collagen molecule at 8 weeks to 1.5 cross-links per collagen molecule at 20 weeks. HLNL levels continued to decrease more gradually after the animal had matured, falling to ∼0.85 cross-links per collagen molecule at 96 weeks. While we could not quantify the absolute amount of HHMD due to the lack of a synthetic standard, we were able to measure the relative change in the mass spectrometer detector response. HHMD can be seen to increase significantly up to 20–36 weeks and then significantly decrease as the animals age (Fig. 3D). Both HHMD and HLNL are formed from aldehydes generated by the activity of lysyl oxidase. The aldehydes could also be produced from the hydrolysis of HLNL, and because we saw a large drop in HLNL up to 20 weeks, we looked at whether a correlation between HLNL and HHMD could be seen. There were clearly two phases in the data shown in the correlation plots between HLNL and HHMD (Fig. 3E). In the first phase, between 8 and 36 weeks, it can be seen that as HLNL decreases, HHMD increases. In the second phase, from 36 to 96 weeks, it can be seen that both HLNL and HHMD decline with age. These data suggest that as the HLNL levels drop rapidly in early life, the aldehyde generated undergoes an aldol reaction and HHMD formation faster than any alternative aldehyde or aldol removal process. In later life, the rate of formation of aldol adducts is then lower than the rate of removal, and so both the levels of HLNL and HHMD are seen to decline. In an attempt to estimate the possible level of HHMD, we made an assumption that the HLNL change between the ages of 11 weeks and 20 weeks is converted into the measured change in HHMD based on the correlation seen. With this assumption, the level of HHMD converts to about 1.1 HHMD per collagen molecule at 20 weeks and 0.6 to 0.8 HHMD per collagen molecule at 96 weeks (the conversion factor is ∼10 HHMD area ratio units to 1 HHMD molecule in Fig. 3D). This level of HHMD is broadly consistent with reported levels of the compound found in tendon using tritium labeling and ion-exchange chromatography (14Terajima M. Taga Y. Chen Y. Cabral W.A. Hou-Fu G. Srisawasdi S. Nagasawa M. Sumida N. Hattori S. Kurie J.M. Marini J.C. Yamauchi M. Cyclophilin-B modulates collagen cross-linking by differentially affecting lysine hydroxylation in the helical and telopeptidyl domains of tendon type I collagen.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 (26934917): 9501-951210.1074/jbc.M115.699470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). No single mature cross-link type increased dramatically with age; however, as a group, mature cross-links contributed to a modest increase in overall number of cross-links per collagen molecule (Fig. 3L). The increase in mature cross-links equated to an increase from 1 cross-link per 33 collagen molecules at 10 weeks to 1 cross-link in 5 collagen molecules at 96 weeks. This increase in mature cross-links was 3 times less than the drop in HLNL between 20 weeks and 96 weeks (Fig. 3, C and L). The sum of mature and immature cross-links at 96 weeks was ∼1 cross-link per collagen molecule excluding the HHMD contribution. Over the lifetime of the animals, there was only a modest increase in AGE cross-links; however, in contrast with this, the increase in lysine glycation was a major change (Fig. 3F). The glycation of lysine is the direct addition of a monosaccharide, typically glucose, to the side chain nitrogen of lysine and is not a cross-link. Cross-link formation would require further reaction with another residue in the collagen structure. The addition reaction can also happen on the side chain of hydroxylysine. By 60 weeks of age, the glycation of tendon collagen lysine reached 1.5 per collagen molecule, the glycation of hydroxylysine being much lower at about 0.2 per molecule of collagen. The level of lysine glycation appears to plateau after 50 weeks of age. Increased levels of glycation appear to correlate with decreased HLNL levels, although both were changing rapidly during the growth phase, and the changes may not be causally linked (Fig. 3I). It has been reported that glycation occurs at the same site as the lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-links (15Hudson D.M. Archer M. King K.B. Eyre D.R. Glycation of type I collagen selectively targets the same helical domain lysine sites as lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-linking.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (30143533): 15620-1562710.1074/jbc.RA118.004829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, in that report only glycation of Hly was seen. In our study, we saw glycation of Lys rather than Hly as the major adduct. With the changes seen in collagen lysine side chain glycation in healthy WT C57BL/6 mice, we decided to examine the levels in diabetic mice. Tail tendon samples from 16-week-old JAX™ db/db mice (Charles River) on the C57BLKS/J background were obtained. These diabetic mice have a point mutation in the Lepr gene and are used as an animal model for diabetes research. The tendon fibers were subjected to physical and chemical analysis as described above, and the results are shown in Fig. 4A and Fig. S2. The spread and stiffness observed in the break test profiles of tendon from 16-week-old db/db mice resembled those seen in tendon from older WT animals, while the plastic extension phase often looked more like that in tendon from younger animals (less than 1 year). Kinks and wobbles in the profiles of the db/db tendon can be seen in the traces and were more prevalent than in WT tendon. Chemical analysis showed that levels of all forms of detectable cross-link for the diabetic animals, apart from HHMD, were lower than the levels found in both 20- and 96-week-old WT animals (Fig. 4, B and C). The HHMD level was not significantly different between 20-week-old WT and 16-week-old db/db tendon. The HLNL level in 16-week-old db/db tendon was found to be ∼0.6 HLNL bonds per collagen molecule, which is much lower than the 1.5 HLNL bonds per collagen molecule found in 20-week-old WT tendon. The level of glycation in the 16-week-old db/db tendon was comparable to that in 96-week-old WT mice and much higher than that seen in 20-week-old WT mice. The levels of irreversible cross-links in the db/db mice, both the mature and AGE classes, were lower than those in 20-week-old WT mice. In the literature on aging collagen, the focus is usually on the increase in mature cross-links formed through mature covalent bonding as the reason for the changing properties observed. What we saw here shows that the situation is more complex than this and that both the loss of reversible cross-links and increase in lysine glycation are important changes to consider in the overall picture of how tendon collagen functions. The often-stated view that tendon stiffens with age due to an increase in cross-linking does not fit the entire data set shown here, and in light of the db/db data, it appears that the mechanical changes do not have to be linked to an increase in AGEs such as glucosepane or pentosidine. With the marked decrease in cross-linking in db/db mice, it might be expected that the tendons would be less stiff than those of older WT mice; however, the stiffness of the db/db tendons is similar to that in older WT mice. The one clear factor that could give rise to the observed stiffness of db/db tendon is the increased glycation of lysine residues, which is similar to that found in tendon from 98-week-old mice. It is apparent from the kinks and wobbles in the db/db stress-strain profiles that there are faults in the tendon structure. It is likely that these faults are due to the lower levels of cross-linking, explaining why the diabetic tendon is often unable to maintain structure under stress. While tendon does generally stiffen with age, another important change is the loss of the plastic extension phase. It seems likely from the results presented here that the loss of the plastic phase is due to a decrease in immature cross-links with an increase in mature cross-linking, while the stiffening is caused by both the glycation of lysine and mature cross-link formation. The mechanisms by which cross-links contribute to these properties and a demonstration of the involvement of glycated lysine in tendon functioning are the subject of an accompanying paper (16Stammer M. Niewczas I.S. Segonds-Pichon A. Clark J. Mechanical stretching changes cross-linking and glycation levels in the collagen of mouse tail tendon.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295Google Scholar). In conclusion, tendon stiffening and the loss of the plastic phase in extension are important mechanical changes with age and diabetes observed in this study. Defining the parameters for healthy aging requires an understanding of the underlying chemical changes that underpin these mechanical changes. Here we have shown that lysine glycation products are likely to play a significant role in these mechanical changes as well as the altered distribution of immature and mature enzymatic cross-links. Animal experiments were performed according to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, license PPL 70/8303, and approved by the Babraham Institute Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Body. Cohorts of C57BL/6 mice were culled using the standard schedule 1 method of CO2 exposure for killing the mice followed by cardiac bleed as the secondary method of confirmation. The glucose level was measured in the blood from the cardiac bleed and from a drop of blood taken from the tail vein after culling. The blood glucose level was measured using S.D. CodeFree blood glucose strips from S.D. Biosensor. Cohorts of C57BL/6 mice were fed on MouseExpress l-[13C6]lysine (99%)-irradiated mouse feed from CK Isotopes for 28 days. After day 28 the mice were switched to a normal diet for a further 7 days and then culled. After removal of the skin from isolated tails, tendon was drawn out of the tail under PBS (pH 7.4) by grasping the tip and the base of the tail with forceps. Twisting the forceps holding the tip caused the tail to break, bringing attached tendon fibers with it attached to the vertebral bone. Tendon was isolated sequentially one vertebral bone at a time, working up the tail from the tip to the base. Tendon fibers were detached from the tail vertebrae with a scalpel. Cellular and soluble extracellular components were removed from tail tendon by washing in 3% Triton in a continuous-flow system (∼200 ml/24 h) for 3 days, followed by washing in water for 2–3 days (∼200 ml/24 h). Of note here is that that the chemistry of the immature cross-links is potentially reversible; any processing that changes chemical environment before reduction could perturb the equilibrium and impact the results (17Davison P.F. The contribution of labile crosslinks to the tensile behavior of tendons.Connect.

For example, when we incubated skin with a 50% glycerol solution in PBS (pH 7.4) for 2 h, we found that after reduction there was a 37% drop in the level of HLNL and a 27% drop in Lys glycation. Fig. S3 shows the impact on tendon collagen of using TES/Tris buffer as commonly used (14Terajima M. Taga Y. Chen Y. Cabral W.A. Hou-Fu G. Srisawasdi S. Nagasawa M. Sumida N. Hattori S. Kurie J.M.

It can be seen that in TES/Tris buffer, HLNL is 13% lower and the glycated lysine is 61% lower than that obtained in PBS. Both TES and Tris contain functionality similar to glycerol and could act chemically in a similar way. Tail tendon (wet weight, 16 to 22 mg) suspended in 200 μl PBS (pH 7.4) was reduced by the addition of 10 μl of 10 mg/ml NaBH4 in 1 mm NaOH. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the tendon was washed 3 times with water and then freeze-dried. Lipid was removed by the addition of 1 ml CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (100:50:5). After incubation overnight at room temperature, the tendon was washed with a further 1 ml CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (100:50:5) before air-drying and freeze-drying. [13C5]Glucosepane internal standard was added and samples freeze-dried. Acid hydrolysis was carried out by incubation overnight at 95°C with 200 μl of 7.4 M HCl. Samples were then dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and resuspended in 400 μl 30% MeCN/0.1% formic acid. After filtering through a 0.22-μm nylon filtration membrane, samples were freeze-dried before resuspension at 10 μg/μl (dry weight) in 30% MeCN/0.1% formic acid. Solutions were then made up at different concentrations with appropriate internal standards for the analysis of the different analytes. Five microliters of solution for analysis was injected onto a Cogent Diamond Hydride column (4 μm, 100 Å, 150 × 2.1 mm).

Complement component 5 (C5) is a validated therapeutic target for complement-mediated diseases, but the development of new therapeutics has been limited by a paucity of preclinical models to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of candidate therapies. The present report describes a novel humanized C5 mouse and its utility in evaluating a panel of fully human anti-C5 antibodies. Surprisingly, humanized C5 mice revealed marked differences in clearance rates amongst a panel of anti-C5 antibodies. One antibody, pozelimab (REGN3918), bound C5 and C5 variants with high affinity and potently blocked complement-mediated hemolysis in vitro. In studies conducted in both humanized C5 mice and cynomolgus monkeys, pozelimab demonstrated prolonged PK and durable suppression of hemolytic activity ex vivo. In humanized C5 mice, a switch in dosing from in-house eculizumab to pozelimab was associated with normalization of serum C5 concentrations, sustained suppression of hemolytic activity ex vivo, and no overt toxicity. Our findings demonstrate the value of humanized C5 mice in identifying new therapeutic candidates and treatment options for complement-mediated diseases."

However, there is little mention of genetic information for this species, especially regarding the biosynthetic pathways of anthraquinones. To understand the key genes and regulatory mechanism of anthraquinone biosynthesis pathways, we performed spatial and temporal transcriptome sequencing of S. tora using short RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and long-read isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) technologies, and generated two unigene sets composed of 118,635 and 39,364, respectively. A comprehensive functional annotation and classification with multiple public databases identified array of genes involved in major secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways and important transcription factor (TF) families (MYB, MYB-related, AP2/ERF, C2C2-YABBY, and bHLH). Differential expression analysis indicated that the expression level of genes involved in anthraquinone biosynthetic pathway regulates differently depending on the degree of tissues and seeds development. Furthermore, we identified that the amount of anthraquinone compounds were greater in late seeds than early ones. In conclusion, these results provide a rich resource for understanding the anthraquinone metabolism in S. tora."

Amot also regulates the Hippo signaling pathway via interactions with the WW-domain–containing Hippo effector protein Yes-associated protein (YAP). In this report, we demonstrate that endogenous Amot is crucial for positively regulating egress of eVP40 virus-like particles (VLPs) and for egress and spread of authentic EBOV. Mechanistically, we show that ectopic YAP expression inhibits eVP40 VLP egress and that Amot co-expression rescues budding of eVP40 VLPs in a dose-dependent and PPxY-dependent manner. Moreover, results obtained with confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy suggested that Amot's role in actin organization and dynamics also contributes to promoting eVP40-mediated egress. In summary, these findings reveal a functional and competitive interplay between virus and host proteins involving the multifunctional PPxY-containing adaptor Amot, which regulates both the Hippo pathway and actin dynamics.

We propose that our results have wide-ranging implications for understanding the biology and pathology of EBOV infections. EBOV is a zoonotic and emerging pathogen that continues to cause severe outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in animals and humans. A more comprehensive understanding of EBOV-host interactions that regulate and/or influence transmission and pathogenesis of this deadly virus is critical for the development of future strategies and countermeasures for therapeutic intervention. EBOV VP40 (eVP40) is the major structural protein that independently directs assembly and egress of virus-like particles (eVP40 VLPs) and drives the budding process of infectious virus. To accomplish this, VP40 possesses two late (L) budding domains (PTAP and PPxY) that hijack select host proteins to facilitate late stages of virus-cell separation (1Noda T. Ebihara H. Muramoto Y.

We recently identified host YAP1, the downstream transcriptional effector of the Hippo pathway, as a novel WW-domain–bearing protein that interacts with the PPxY motifs of filovirus VP40 (9Han Z.

The cellular localization and function of YAP1 is itself regulated via strong, modular interactions with the PPxY motifs present at the N terminus of full-length angiomotin (Amot-p130) (10Lv M.

Dash S. Sagum C.A. Ruthel G. Jaladanki C.K. Berry C.T. Schwoerer M.P. Harty N.M. Freedman B.D. Bedford M.T. Fan H. Sidhu S.S. Sudol M. Shtanko O. Harty R.N.

Because two of the three PPxY-like motifs present within Amot-p130 have core sequences that precisely match the PPEY motif within eVP40, we postulated that a potential competitive interplay between binding of these host and viral PPEY-containing proteins to WW-domain–containing YAP could influence eVP40-mediated egress of VLPs and EBOV. Here, we demonstrate that egress of eVP40 VLPs and authentic EBOV was reduced significantly in a stable Amot knockdown cell line (shAmot cells) compared with egress of VLPs and EBOV from control cells (shCtrl cells). As we recently demonstrated for MARV and mVP40 VLPs, ectopic expression of YAP1 inhibited egress of eVP40 VLPs, whereas co-expression of Amot-p130 rescued YAP1 inhibition of eVP40-mediated egress in a dose- and PPxY-dependent manner. Indeed, the N-terminally truncated isoform of Amot (Amot-p80), which lacks all PPxY motifs and the F-actin–binding domain, failed to rescue YAP1-mediated inhibition of eVP40 VLP egress. Moreover, images of eVP40 VLP formation and egress obtained using TIRF microscopy of transfected shCtrl or shAmot cells show that in the absence of Amot, the actin cytoskeleton appears less organized and is misaligned with eVP40 VLPs budding at the plasma membrane, whereas actin filaments observed in shCtrl cells appear to align with, and form a foundation for, budding eVP40 VLPs. In sum, our findings identify EBOV as a PPxY-containing virus whose egress and spread in vitro is regulated by host Amot-p130 via a mechanism involving competitive PPxY-mediated interactions with YAP1 and actin cytoskeleton dynamics at the plasma membrane. Full-length Amot-p130 possesses three PPxY-like motifs at its N terminus, two of which have the core sequence PPEY, which precisely matches that conserved at the N terminus of eVP40 (Fig. 1A). To determine whether endogenous expression of Amot affected budding of eVP40 VLPs, shCtrl or shAmot cells were transfected with eVP40, and both cell extracts and VLPs were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). We observed robust inhibition of eVP40 VLP egress from shAmot cells compared with that from shCtrl cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that expression of endogenous Amot is important for efficient egress of eVP40 VLPs. Because the second PPxY motif of Amot-p130 interacts strongly with the WW-domain of YAP1 (15Moleirinho S. Hoxha S. Mandati V. Curtale G. Troutman S. Ehmer U. Kissil J.L.

Toward this end, HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid combinations (Fig. 1C), and both cell extracts and VLPs were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. As observed previously for mVP40 (9Han Z. Dash S. Sagum C.A. Ruthel G. Jaladanki C.K. Berry C.T. Schwoerer M.P. Harty N.M. Freedman B.D. Bedford M.T. Fan H. Sidhu S.S. Sudol M. Shtanko O. Harty R.N.

Interestingly, co-expression of Amot-p130 relieved the inhibitory effect of YAP1 and rescued budding of eVP40 VLPs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C, lanes 3-5). Importantly, co-expression of Amot-p80 did not relieve the inhibitory effect of YAP1 and did not rescue egress of eVP40 VLPs (Fig. 1C, lane 6). These results indicate that YAP1 negatively regulates egress of eVP40 VLPs, as it does for mVP40 VLPs, and suggest that the PPxY/WW-domain interaction between Amot-p130 and YAP1 may outcompete the PPxY/WW-domain interaction between eVP40 and YAP1, thus relieving YAP1's inhibitory effect on VLP budding. The potential interplay among eVP40/Amot/YAP1 in EBOV-infected cells could have wide-ranging pathological implications because Amot-YAP1 interactions regulate a wide array of cellular processes, including actin polymerization, filopodia formation, tight junction formation, and cell adhesion/migration (15Moleirinho S.

Because Amot-p130 is an F-actin–binding protein and affects many cellular processes, such as cell morphology, migration, and plasma membrane dynamics, that are probably biologically relevant for the egress and spread of filoviruses, we sought to determine whether the observed differences in eVP40 VLP budding from shAmot and shCtrl cells may be related to Amot's role in actin cytoskeletal dynamics at the plasma membrane. Toward this end, we co-transfected either shCtrl or shAmot cells with plasmids expressing fluorescently tagged F-actin (pCMV-LifeAct-RFP) and eVP40 (YFP-eVP40) and used TIRF microscopy to visualize these proteins at the cell surface (Fig. 1, D and E). In the majority of shCtrl cells visualized, we observed pronounced localization of both F-actin and eVP40 in cell surface projections, and F-actin appeared to be most abundant at the base or foundation of the short, well-defined eVP40 VLP projections (Fig. 1D). Indeed, the actin cytoskeleton appeared to serve as a platform from which eVP40 VLPs could form and pinch off efficiently. In contrast, F-actin filaments were not as well-aligned with eVP40 projections in shAmot cells, and the eVP40 projections themselves appeared longer, tangled, more abundant, and less-defined than those observed in the shCtrl cells (Fig. 1E). These results highlight the importance of endogenous Amot as an actin-binding and organizing scaffold that contributes mechanistically in regulating efficient formation and egress of eVP40 VLPs. In a complementary approach, we sought to use confocal microscopy to investigate the localization patterns of eVP40, YAP1, and/or Amot-p130 alone or in combinations in transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 2). Amot-p130 displayed a distinct tubular pattern throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A), whereas YAP1 displayed a more punctate cytoplasmic pattern (Fig. 2B), and eVP40 displayed the typical filamentous projections at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2D). We observed colocalization of Amot-p130 and YAP1 in large globular regions within the cytoplasm when co-expressed (Fig. 2C), indicative of their ability to interact in a PPxY/WW-domain manner. We also observed that eVP40 colocalized partially with YAP1 in puncta in the cytoplasm with a concomitant reduction in the levels of eVP40 at the plasma membrane and in the number and sharpness of VLP projections (Fig. 2E). These observations are consistent with the ability of YAP1 to physically interact with eVP40 and functionally reduce egress of eVP40 VLPs. Last, we found that the patterns of eVP40 membrane localization and filamentous VLP projections in cells co-expressing YAP1 + eVP40 + Amot-p130 (Fig. 2F) were similar to those observed in cells expressing eVP40 alone (Fig. 2D). This observation is consistent with the ability of exogenously expressed Amot-p130 to rescue the inhibitory effect of YAP1 on eVP40 VLP egress. Next, we sought to determine whether the dramatic visual and functional differences observed for eVP40 VLP formation and egress in shCtrl versus shAmot cells would be evident during live EBOV infection. Toward this end, shCtrl or shAmot cells were infected with EBOV at MOIs of either 0.01 or 0.05, and the cells were fixed at either 24, 48, or 72 h post-infection to assess virus spreading. We observed that spread of EBOV throughout the shAmot cells was inhibited significantly compared with the degree of spread observed in the shCtrl cells (Fig. 3, A and C). We also quantified release of infectious EBOV from both shCtrl and shAmot cells, and we observed significant inhibition of virion release from shAmot cells compared with that measured from shCtrl cells (Fig. 3, B and D). These live virus experiments clearly indicate that expression of endogenous Amot plays a key role in regulating efficient egress and spread of authentic EBOV in cell culture. Moreover, these results support the mechanisms proposed for Amot-mediated regulation of EBOV budding, as they correlate well with data obtained using eVP40 VLPs. Overall, our results are in excellent agreement with those reported recently for MARV (9Han Z. Dash S. Sagum C.A. Ruthel G. Jaladanki C.K. Berry C.T. Schwoerer M.P. Harty N.M. Freedman B.D.

Moving forward, it will be of interest to investigate additional Amot PPxY-mediated interactions that may be influenced or disrupted by the presence of VP40 during virus infection. For example, Amot contributes to the formation and maintenance of cellular tight junctions and to the regulation of cellular adhesion/migration/invasion. Interestingly, another member of the Amot family, Amotl2, localizes to and regulates formation of podosomes, mechanosensitive adhesive structures used by macrophages and dendritic cells to migrate through tissues (22Proszynski T.J. Sanes J.R. Amotl2 interacts with LL5β, localizes to podosomes and regulates postsynaptic differentiation in muscle.J.

These cells are primary targets of EBOV and believed to harbor and disseminate infection in the host (24Zeng X. Blancett C.D. Koistinen K.A. Schellhase C.W. Bearss J.J. Radoshitzky S.R. Honnold S.P.

Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the interplay among VP40, Amot, and perhaps other Hippo pathway components (e.g. YAP, TAZ, and LATS kinases) may influence how EBOV is spread to various tissues during infection and how EBOV may cross or breach cellular barriers/junctions to enter and establish persistence in immunologically privileged sites, such as the central nervous system and eye. In sum, our findings serve as a foundation for a new area of investigation into the biological and pathological intersection of the Hippo pathway, the angiomotin family of proteins, and PPxY-mediated virus egress and transmission.

For confocal imaging, HEK293T cells on glass slides were transfected with 0.5 μg of the appropriate plasmids for 20 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and then mounted with Prolong gold anti-fade mountant with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were obtained on a Leica SP5 inverted confocal microscope with a ×100 (numerical aperture 1.46) objective lens. The confocal images were subsequently deconvolved with Huygens Essential deconvolution software. For TIRF imaging, cells were seeded onto coverglass-bottom 35-mm dishes (MatTek) and co-transfected with 0.5 μg each of the appropriate plasmids in Opti-MEM. Dishes were placed onto the stage of a GE DeltaVision OMX SR microscope and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a stage-top incubator. Approximately 100 cells/group were randomly chosen and imaged in SIM-TIRF mode. SIM superresolution images were reconstructed from the acquired TIRF images. All experiments with replication competent EBOV were performed in the biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute (San Antonio, TX). The recombinant EBOV variant Mayinga expressing enhanced GFP (EBOV-EGFP) (NCBI accession number KF_990213) was kindly provided by Heinz Feldmann (NIH, Hamilton, MT).

Three separate plates were challenged in triplicate for each MOI. After 1 h, inoculum was removed, cells were washed with medium, and new medium was added to wells. Cells were fixed 24, 48, or 72 h after virus challenge, stained with Hoechst 33342, and photographed using a Nikon Ti-Eclipse microscope running high content analysis software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The numbers of nuclei and EGFP-positive (infected) cells were counted using Cell Profiler software (Broad Institute, Boston, MA). Virus release from shCtrl or shAmot cells was determined by overlaying supernatants of infected cells onto monolayers of Vero cells (American Type Culture Collection; ATCC, Manassas, VA) for 24 h and analysis as above. Absolute intensities for immunoblot lanes were normalized to the intensity of the first lane and averaged across at least three replicates (collected from three or more separate transfections). Mean normalized intensity ± S.D. is shown. Because of observed inequality of variance between the groups (determined by F-test p value <0.05), Welch's t test was used to determine statistical significance.

https://openalex.org/W3022704550,"Effective sampling of marine communities is essential to provide robust estimates of species richness and abundance. Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) are a useful tool in assessment of fish assemblages, but research on the optimal sampling period required to record common and rare elasmobranch species is limited. An appropriate 'soak time' (time elapsed between settlement of the BRUVS on the seabed and when it is hauled off the seabed) requires consideration, since longer soak times may be required to record species rare in occurrence, or sightings in areas of generally low elasmobranch abundance. We analysed 5352 BRUVS deployments with a range of soak times across 21 countries in the Coral Triangle and Pacific Ocean, to determine the optimal soak time required for sampling reef-associated elasmobranchs, considering species rarity, and community abundance at each site. Species were categorised into 4 'rarity' groups (very rare to common), by their relative occurrence in the dataset, defined simply by the proportion of BRUVS on which they occurred. Individual BRUVS were categorised into 3 'abundance' groups (low to high) by overall relative elasmobranch abundance, defined as total number of all elasmobranchs sighted per unit of sampling effort. The effects of BRUVS soak times, and levels of rarity and abundance groupings, on the time to first sighting (TFS) and time to maximum number of elasmobranchs observed (tMaxN) were examined. We found that TFS occurred earlier for species groups with high occurrence, and on BRUVS with high elasmobranch abundance, yet longer soak times were not essential to observe rarer species. Our models indicated an optimum of 95% of both sighting event types (TFS, tMaxN) was recorded within 63-77 minutes, and a soak time of 60 minutes recorded 78-94% of the elasmobranch sighting events recorded (78-94% of TFS events and 82-90% of tMaxN events), when species rarity and abundance on BRUVS was accounted for. Our study shows that deployments of ~ 77 minutes are optimal for recording all species we observed, although 60 minutes soak time effectively samples the majority of elasmobranch species in shallow coral reef habitats using BRUVS."
https://openalex.org/W3021356310,"Purpose To investigate if, regardless of language background (tonal or non-tonal), musicians may show stronger CP than non-musicians; To examine if native speakers of English (English or non-tonal musicians henceforth) or Mandarin Chinese (Mandarin or tonal musicians henceforth) can better accommodate multiple functions of the same acoustic cue and if musicians’ sensitivity to pitch of lexical tones comes at the cost of slower processing. Method English and Mandarin Musicians and non-musicians performed a categorical identification and a discrimination task on rising and falling continua of fundamental frequency on two vowels with 9 duration values. Results Non-tonal musicians exhibited significantly stronger categorical perception of pitch contour than non-tonal non-musicians. However, tonal musicians did not consistently perceive the two types of pitch directions more categorically than tonal non-musicians. Both tonal and non-tonal musicians also benefited more from increasing stimulus duration in processing pitch changes than non-musicians and they generally require less time for pitch processing. Musicians were also more sensitive to intrinsic F0 in pitch perception and differences of pitch types. Conclusion The effect of musical training strengthens categorical perception more consistently in non-tonal speakers than tonal speakers. Overall, musicians benefit more from increased stimulus duration, due perhaps to their greater sensitivity to temporal information, thus allowing them to be better at forming a more robust auditory representation and matching sounds to internalized memory templates. Musicians also attended more to acoustic details such as intrinsic F0 and pitch types in pitch processing, and yet, overall, their categorization of pitch was not compromised by traces of these acoustic details from their auditory short-term working memory. These findings may lead to a better understanding of pitch perception deficits in special populations, particularly among individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)."
https://openalex.org/W3023266308,"Bus services naturally tend to be unstable and are not always capable of adhering to schedules without control strategies. Therefore, bus users and bus service providers face travel time variation and irregularity. After a comprehensive review of the literature, a significant gap was recognized in the field of public transportation reliability. According to literature, there is no consistency in reliability definition and indicators. Companies have their own definition of bus service reliability, and they mostly neglect the passengers' perspective of reliability. Therefore, four reliability indicators were selected in this study to fill the gap in the literature and cover both passengers' and operators' perceptions of reliability: waiting time and on-board crowding level from passengers' perspective, and headway regularity index at stops (HRIS) and bus bunching/big gap percentage from operators' perspective. The primary objective of this research is to improve the reliability of high frequency of bus service and simulation tools currently being used by the public transportation companies. Therefore, a simulation model of bus service was developed to study the strategies to alleviate it. Four different types of strategies were selected and implemented according to Route U32 (Kuala Lumpur) specifications. Model out-put showed that control strategies such as headway-based dispatching could significantly improve headway regularity by almost 62% and the waiting time by 51% on average. Both holding strategies at key stops (previous and Prefol holding) have shown an almost similar impact on reliability indicators. Waiting time was reduced by 44% and 43% after the previous and Prefol Headway strategies were adopted, respectively. However, the implementation of the component of headway-based strategies at the terminal and key stops showed the best impact on reliability, in terms of passenger waiting time. Waiting time and excess waiting time were both significantly reduced by 52.86% and 81.44%, respectively. Nevertheless, the strategies did not show any significant positive effect on the level of crowding during morning peak hours."
https://openalex.org/W3021879733,"Purpose Clinical pathways in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) consist of general guidelines, including several topics as early rehabilitation and antibiotic systematization, which are used to improve patient’s management, decrease complication rates and enhance clinical outcomes. The primary purpose of this study was to assess whether the use of a clinical pathway for TKA can contribute to reduce LOS and healthcare costs in a private hospital, without an increase in the hospital readmission rate. We also aimed to assess whether care providers adhered to the recommendations mainly antibiotic use and physical therapy. Methods Retrospective cohort study of 485 patients who underwent TKA at private hospital. Patients were analyzed in two groups: Group I (GI), composed by 220 TKA patients, prior to the clinical pathway implementation, and Group 2 (GII), with 265 TKA patients post-clinical pathway. Several outcomes were analyzed: length of hospital stay, time from use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy, readmission within 30 days, physical therapy and costs associated to procedures and hospitalization rates. Results The implementation of the clinical pathway was related with the reduction of the length of hospital stay from 6.3 days to 4.9 days (p = 0.021) without increase in readmissions. The physical therapy on the first postoperative day was most frequent in GII than GI (96.2% vs 78.1%, p < 0.001). Prophylactic ATB 60 minutes prior the surgery was significantly more used in GII than GI (99.2% vs 87.4%, p < 0.001). In addition, ATB suspension within 48 hours was significantly more frequent in GII than GI (84.7% vs. 51.6%, p < 0.001). The cost procedure of TKA showed a reduction of US$1,252.00 in GII when compared with GI (p<0,001). Conclusion The implementation of a clinical pathway, with focus on early rehabilitation, for patients underwent TKA, contributed to a reduction of LOS and costs during hospital stay, with no increase in the readmission rate. We also concluded that there was adherence to the clinical pathway by care providers in our institution."
https://openalex.org/W3021543789,"Background Sexually-transmitted infections are a public health problem in developing countries including Ethiopia. However, there is limited evidence on factors associated with sexually-transmitted infections among men in Ethiopia. Therefore, this analysis was done to fill this gap. Methods This analysis was done based on the 2016 Ethiopian demographic health survey data. The survey was a community-based cross-sectional study conducted from January 18 to June 27, 2016. The survey used two stage-stratified cluster sampling technique. A total of 8849 sexually active men were included in this analysis. Descriptive and analytical analyses were performed. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Results Muslim men (AOR = 1.68; 95%CI: 1.02–2.76), men who were not exposed to media (AOR = 1.75; 95%CI: 1.01–3.03) and men who had multiple sexual partners (AOR = 2.29; 95%CI: 1.05–5.01) had higher odds of having a sexually transmitted infection. In addition, men living in Amhara (AOR = 3.31; 95%CI: 1.33–8.22), Oromia (AOR = 4.62; 95%CI: 1.85–11.55), Gambella (AOR = 3.64; 95%CI: 1.27–10.42), and Harari regions (AOR = 4.57; 95%CI: 1.49–14.02) had higher odds of developing sexually transmitted infection. On the other hand, men who believe women are asked to use a condom if she knows he has STIs (AOR = 0.53; 95%CI: 0.33–0.85) had low odds of developing a sexually transmitted infection. Conclusions Men not exposed to mass media, Muslims and men with multi-sexual partners had higher odds of having sexually transmitted infections. Encouraging monogamous relationships and exposing men to mass media may help to reduce the burden of STIs in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3023634011,"Background Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The present study was directed to investigate the beneficial effects of benfotiamine pre- and post-treatments in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced MI in rats. Methods Myocardial heart damage was induced by subcutaneous injection of ISO (150 mg/kg) once daily for two consecutive days. Benfotiamine (100 mg/kg/day) was given orally for two weeks before or after ISO treatment. Results ISO administration revealed significant changes in electrocardiographic recordings, elevation of levels of cardiac enzymes; creatinine kinase (CK-MB) and troponin-I (cTn-I), and perturbation of markers of oxidative stress; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and markers of inflammation; protein kinase C (PKC), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). The apoptotic markers (caspase-8 and p53) were also significantly elevated in ISO groups in addition to histological alterations. Groups treated with benfotiamine pre- and post-ISO administration showed significantly decreased cardiac enzymes levels and improved oxidative stress, inflammatory and apoptotic markers compared to the ISO groups. Conclusion The current study highlights the potential role of benfotiamine as a promising agent for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in myocardial damage in several cardiovascular disorders via NADPH oxidase inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W3023808604,"Umbilical hernia (UH) is one of the most frequent defects affecting pig production, however, it also affects humans and other mammals. UH is characterized as an abnormal protrusion of the abdominal contents to the umbilical region, causing pain, discomfort and reduced performance in pigs. Some genomic regions associated to UH have already been identified, however, no study involving RNA sequencing was performed when umbilical tissue is considered. Therefore, here, we have sequenced the umbilical ring transcriptome of five normal and five UH-affected pigs to uncover genes and pathways involved with UH development. A total of 13,216 transcripts were expressed in the umbilical ring tissue. From those, 230 genes were differentially expressed (DE) between normal and UH-affected pigs (FDR <0.05), being 145 downregulated and 85 upregulated in the affected compared to the normal pigs. A total of 68 significant biological processes were identified and the most relevant were extracellular matrix, immune system, anatomical development, cell adhesion, membrane components, receptor activation, calcium binding and immune synapse. The results pointed out ACAN, MMPs, COLs, EPYC, VIT, CCBE1 and LGALS3 as strong candidates to trigger umbilical hernias in pigs since they act in the extracellular matrix remodeling and in the production, integrity and resistance of the collagen. We have generated the first transcriptome of the pig umbilical ring tissue, which allowed the identification of genes that had not yet been related to umbilical hernias in pigs. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to identify the causal mutations, SNPs and CNVs in these genes to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3023312834,"Previous studies have reported on several genetic variants related to breast cancer, but a substantial proportion of mutation loci have not yet been identified. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and susceptibility to breast cancer in Shaanxi Han women in China.Six SNPs were genotyped in 530 breast cancer patients and 628 healthy women from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University Hospital. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by unconditional logistic regression analysis to assess the association between breast cancer risk and polymorphisms of six loci.Two SNPs, rs3024490 and rs1800871, were found to be significantly different between breast cancer patients and healthy women. These SNPs also increased the risk of breast cancer in co-dominant and dominant models. Moreover, another SNP, rs1554286, was significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in the co-dominant model. Functional assessments indicated that these three variants may influence the expression and transcription factor binding of IL-10.Our findings suggest that variants of IL-10 may be likelihood risk factors for the development and progression of breast cancer. Future studies should replicate this study and evaluate functional assessments in Chinese Han women and women from other regions."

https://openalex.org/W3023018979,"There is no effectual pathological factor to predict the long-term renal prognosis of IgA nephropathy. Glomerular hypertrophy plays a crucial role in kidney disease outcomes in both experimental models and humans. This study aimed to 1) confirm the long-term prognostic significance of a maximal glomerular diameter (Max GD) ≥ 242.3 μm, 2) test a renal prognosis prediction model adding Max GD ≥ 242.3 μm to the Oxford classification (MEST-C), and 3) examine the time series changes in the long-term renal prognosis of patients with IgA nephropathy. The study included 43 patients diagnosed with IgA nephropathy from 1993 to 1998 at Kameda General Hospital. Renal prognosis with the endpoint of a 50% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or the development of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis was examined using logistic regression analysis, Cox regression analysis, and the Kaplan-Meier method. Pathological evaluation was performed using MEST-C and Max GD, and the validity of the prediction model was evaluated. Patients with Max GD ≥ 242.3 μm had significantly poor renal prognosis with multivariate Cox analysis (P = 0.0293). The results of the Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that kidney survival rates in the high-Max GD group were significantly lower than those in the low-Max GD group (log rank, P = 0.0043), which was confirmed in propensity score-matched models (log rank, P = 0.0426). Adding Max GD ≥ 242.3 μm to MEST-C improved diagnostic power of the renal prognosis prediction model by renal pathology tissue examination (R2: 3.3 to 14.5%, AICc: 71.8 to 68.0, C statistic: 0.657 to 0.772). We confirm that glomerular hypertrophy is useful as a long-term renal prognostic factor."
https://openalex.org/W3023095125,"Understanding key healthcare system challenges experienced by women during pregnancy and birth is crucial to scale up available interventions and reduce perinatal mortality. A community perspective about preferences and experience of care during this period can be used to improve community-based programs to reduce perinatal mortality. Using a qualitative exploratory approach, we examined women’s experience of perinatal loss, aiming to understand the main factors, as perceived and experienced by women, leading to perinatal loss. Qualitative in-depth Interviews were conducted with 25 mothers with a recent perinatal loss, three family members, six healthcare officials, and two focus group discussions with 17 lady health workers. Data were analysed using inductive and deductive coding, by thematic analysis. Our findings revealed three distinct but interrelated themes, which include: 1) poor access to care during pregnancy and birth, 2) unavailability of appropriate healthcare services, and 3) poor quality of care during pregnancy and birth. Women frequently delayed seeking formal care around birth because of delays by themselves, their family members, or the local traditional birth attendants who frequently induced births at women’s homes without recognising the dangers to the mothers or their babies. Preference for private care was common, however they often could not bear the cost of care when they needed caesarean section or in-patient care for their sick newborns because these services were absent in public health facilities of the district. Referral to the regional tertiary care hospital was often not officially arranged leading to risky births in small and crowded private clinics. Women’s views about negative staff attitudes and the lack of attention given to them in public health facilities highlighted a lack of quality and respectful antenatal care. Improvement in women’s access to essential care during pregnancy and around birth, availability of emergency obstetric and newborn care, improving the quality of maternal and newborn care in both public and private health facilities at the district level might reduce perinatal mortality in Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W3020840005,"The domestic silkworm Bombyx mori expresses two sucrose-hydrolyzing enzymes, BmSUH and BmSUC1, belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 13 subfamily 17 (GH13_17) and GH32, respectively. BmSUH has little activity on maltooligosaccharides, whereas other insect GH13_17 α-glucosidases are active on sucrose and maltooligosaccharides. Little is currently known about the structural mechanisms and substrate specificity of GH13_17 enzymes. In this study, we examined the crystal structures of BmSUH without ligands; in complexes with substrates, products, and inhibitors; and complexed with its covalent intermediate at 1.60-1.85 Å resolutions. These structures revealed that the conformations of amino acid residues around subsite -1 are notably different at each step of the hydrolytic reaction. Such changes have not been previously reported among GH13 enzymes, including exo- and endo-acting hydrolases, such as α-glucosidases and α-amylases. Amino acid residues at subsite +1 are not conserved in BmSUH and other GH13_17 α-glucosidases, but subsite -1 residues are absolutely conserved. Substitutions in three subsite +1 residues, Gln191, Tyr251, and Glu440, decreased sucrose hydrolysis and increased maltase activity of BmSUH, indicating that these residues are key for determining its substrate specificity. These results provide detailed insights into structure-function relationships in GH13 enzymes and into the molecular evolution of insect GH13_17 α-glucosidases."
https://openalex.org/W3023886537,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is a major acute phase protein used to monitor response to treatment during surgical recovery. Depending on the anatomical problem, surgery type and technique, the level of CRP can change drastically. The aim of this study was to describe the changes in CRP and white blood cell (WBC) levels following surgery for medial patellar luxation in otherwise healthy dogs. Twenty-two dogs completed the study. CRP was measured using a commercially available dry chemistry slide on a commercially available in-clinic analyser. Analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and a mixed effects Poisson regression model. A significant change in CRP levels was found between the pre-anesthetic and 24 hr post-surgical timepoint with a median difference of 92.0 mg/dL (P < 0.001). Though a median drop in the CRP value of 13.9 mg/dL was observed between the 24 hr and 48 hr post-surgical time period, the result was not statistically significant (P = 0.456). Similarly, there was a significant increase in WBC between the pre-anesthetic and 24-hr post-surgical time point (P < 0.001) followed by a significant decrease in WBC between the 24 hr and 48-hr post-surgical time points (P = 0.015). In this study population, CRP levels were observed to aid in monitoring of the overall health of the dogs following surgery for medial patellar luxation. The results of this study suggest that both CRP and WBC values significantly increase by 24 hr but where CRP levels remain elevated through 48 hr post-surgery, WBC showed a significant drop between 24 and 48 hr. Further investigation into the length of time for both CRP and WBC to reach basal levels in this particular type of surgery would be of value to monitor recovery from surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3022628756,"Metabolic parameters ranging from circulating nutrient levels and substrate utilization to energy expenditure and thermogenesis are temporally modulated by the circadian timing system. During critical embryonic developmental periods, maternal over-nutrition could alter key elements in different tissues associated with the generation of circadian rhythmicity, compromising normal rhythmicity development. To address this issue, we determine whether maternal over-nutrition leads to alterations in the development of circadian rhythmicity at physiological and behavioral levels in the offspring. For this, female rabbits were fed a standard diet (SD) or high-fat and carbohydrate diet (HFCD) before mating and during gestation. Core body temperature and gross locomotor activity were continuously recorded in newborn rabbits, daily measurements of body weight and the amount of milk ingested was carried out. At the end of lactation, tissue samples, including brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT), were obtained for determining the expression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) and cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor-like effector A (CIDEA) genes. HFCD pups exhibited conspicuous differences in the development of the daily rhythm of temperature and locomotor activity compared to the SD pups, including a significant increase in the daily mean core temperature, changes in the time when temperature or activity remains above the average, shifts in the acrophase, decrease in the duration and intensity of the anticipatory rise previous to nursing, and changes in frequency of the rhythms. HFCD pups exhibited a significant increase in BAT thermogenesis markers, and a decrease of these markers in WAT, indicating more heat generation by brown adipocytes and alterations in the browning process. These results indicate that maternal over-nutrition alters offspring homeostatic and chronostatic regulation at the physiological and behavioral levels. Further studies are needed to determine whether these alterations are associated with the changes in the organization of the circadian system of the progeny."
https://openalex.org/W3021630911,"Alkyl phosphotriester (alkyl-PTE) lesions are frequently induced in DNA and are resistant to repair. Here, we synthesized and characterized methyl (Me)- and n-butyl (nBu)-PTEs in two diastereomeric configurations (Sp and Rp) at six different flanking dinucleotide sites, i.e. XT and TX (X = A, C, or G), and assessed how these lesions impact DNA replication in Escherichia coli cells. When single-stranded vectors contained an Sp-Me-PTE in the sequence contexts of 5′-AT-3′, 5′-CT-3′, or 5′-GT-3′, DNA replication was highly efficient and the replication products for all three sequence contexts contained 85–90% AT and 5–10% TG. Thus, the replication outcome was largely independent of the identity of the 5′ nucleotide adjacent to an Sp-Me-PTE. Furthermore, replication across these lesions was not dependent on the activities of DNA polymerases II, IV, or V; Ada, a protein involved in adaptive response and repair of Sp-Me-PTE in E. coli, however, was essential for the generation of the mutagenic products. Additionally, the Rp diastereomer of Me-PTEs at XT sites and both diastereomers of Me-PTEs at TX sites exhibited error-free replication bypass. Moreover, Sp-nBu-PTEs at XT sites did not strongly impede DNA replication, and other nBu-PTEs displayed moderate blockage effects, with none of them being mutagenic. Taken together, these findings provide in-depth understanding of how alkyl-PTE lesions are recognized by the DNA replication machinery in prokaryotic cells and reveal that Ada contributes to mutagenesis of Sp-Me-PTEs in E. coli. Alkyl phosphotriester (alkyl-PTE) lesions are frequently induced in DNA and are resistant to repair. Here, we synthesized and characterized methyl (Me)- and n-butyl (nBu)-PTEs in two diastereomeric configurations (Sp and Rp) at six different flanking dinucleotide sites, i.e. XT and TX (X = A, C, or G), and assessed how these lesions impact DNA replication in Escherichia coli cells. When single-stranded vectors contained an Sp-Me-PTE in the sequence contexts of 5′-AT-3′, 5′-CT-3′, or 5′-GT-3′, DNA replication was highly efficient and the replication products for all three sequence contexts contained 85–90% AT and 5–10% TG. Thus, the replication outcome was largely independent of the identity of the 5′ nucleotide adjacent to an Sp-Me-PTE. Furthermore, replication across these lesions was not dependent on the activities of DNA polymerases II, IV, or V; Ada, a protein involved in adaptive response and repair of Sp-Me-PTE in E. coli, however, was essential for the generation of the mutagenic products. Additionally, the Rp diastereomer of Me-PTEs at XT sites and both diastereomers of Me-PTEs at TX sites exhibited error-free replication bypass. Moreover, Sp-nBu-PTEs at XT sites did not strongly impede DNA replication, and other nBu-PTEs displayed moderate blockage effects, with none of them being mutagenic. Taken together, these findings provide in-depth understanding of how alkyl-PTE lesions are recognized by the DNA replication machinery in prokaryotic cells and reveal that Ada contributes to mutagenesis of Sp-Me-PTEs in E. coli. The specific sequence of DNA within an organism imparts the genetic code for all domains of life; however, this code is susceptible to alterations because of limited chemical stability of DNA (1Lindahl T. Instability and decay of the primary structure of DNA.Nature. 1993; 362 (8469282): 709-71510.1038/362709a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (4085) Google Scholar). As a result, the genetic integrity of DNA can be compromised by endogenous metabolites and exogenous chemicals, resulting in different types of damage (1Lindahl T. Instability and decay of the primary structure of DNA.Nature. 1993; 362 (8469282): 709-71510.1038/362709a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (4085) Google Scholar, 2Fu D. Calvo J.A. Samson L.D.

Alkylation is a major type of DNA damage (3Shrivastav N. Li D. Essigmann J.M. Chemical biology of mutagenesis and DNA repair: Cellular responses to DNA alkylation.Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31 (19875697): 59-7010.1093/carcin/bgp262Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and the cytotoxic effects of DNA alkylation adducts are manifested by the fact that DNA alkylation also constitutes the central mechanism of action for many widely prescribed chemotherapeutic agents (2Fu D. Calvo J.A. Samson L.D. Balancing repair and tolerance of DNA damage caused by alkylating agents.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12 (22237395): 104-12010.1038/nrc3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Nucleobase modifications have been the major focus of DNA alkylation studies (3Shrivastav N. Li D. Essigmann J.M. Chemical biology of mutagenesis and DNA repair: Cellular responses to DNA alkylation.Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31 (19875697): 59-7010.1093/carcin/bgp262Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), although alkyl phosphotriesters (alkyl-PTEs) can also be efficiently induced (4Jones G.D.D. Le Pla R.C. Farmer P.B. Phosphotriester adducts (PTEs): DNA's overlooked lesion.Mutagenesis. 2010; 25 (19920061): 3-1610.1093/mutage/gep038Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The latter lesions are formed when alkylating agents conjugate with one of the two non–carbon-bonded oxygen atoms and, based on which of these oxygen atoms is attacked, alkyl-PTEs can form in Sp or Rp configuration (Fig. 1) (4Jones G.D.D. Le Pla R.C. Farmer P.B. Phosphotriester adducts (PTEs): DNA's overlooked lesion.Mutagenesis. 2010; 25 (19920061): 3-1610.1093/mutage/gep038Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It was also shown that chronic exposure of rats to 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, a major tobacco-specific N-nitrosamine, through drinking water induces the formation of Me-PTE lesions in lung tissues (5Ma B. Zarth A.T. Carlson E.S. Villalta P.W. Upadhyaya P. Stepanov I. Hecht S.S. Methyl DNA phosphate adduct formation in rats treated chronically with 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and enantiomers of its metabolite 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2018; 31 (29131934): 48-5710.1021/acs.chemrestox.7b00281Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). There have been some studies about the repair and biological consequences of alkyl-PTEs (4Jones G.D.D. Le Pla R.C. Farmer P.B. Phosphotriester adducts (PTEs): DNA's overlooked lesion.Mutagenesis. 2010; 25 (19920061): 3-1610.1093/mutage/gep038Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because the addition of an alkyl group to the backbone phosphate neutralizes its negative charge, the presence of alkyl-PTE lesions in DNA may perturb its interactions with proteins. For instance, a mixture of Sp- and Rp-ethyl-PTE impedes in vitro primer extension catalyzed by T4 DNA polymerase and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (6Tsujikawa L. Weinfield M. Reha-Krantz L.J. Differences in replication of a DNA template containing an ethyl phosphotriester by T4 DNA polymerase and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 (12930945): 4965-497210.1093/nar/gkg722Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Isopropyl-PTE was also found to inhibit the unwinding of duplex DNA mediated by superfamily 2 DNA helicases (6Tsujikawa L. Weinfield M. Reha-Krantz L.J. Differences in replication of a DNA template containing an ethyl phosphotriester by T4 DNA polymerase and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 (12930945): 4965-497210.1093/nar/gkg722Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that the two diastereomers of alkyl-PTEs exhibited different replication bypass efficiencies in E. coli cells, where replication across Sp-Me-PTE at TT dinucleotide site is mutagenic, and intriguingly the mutagenicity of the lesion requires the presence of Ada protein (7Wu J. Wang P. Wang Y. Cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of alkyl phosphotriester lesions in Escherichia coli cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29514270): 4013-402110.1093/nar/gky140Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the frequencies for the formation of alkyl-PTEs are influenced by flanking sequences. For instance, Guichard et al. (8Guichard Y. Jones G.D. Farmer P.B. Detection of DNA alkylphosphotriesters by 32P postlabeling: evidence for the nonrandom manifestation of phosphotriester lesions in vivo.Cancer Res. 2000; 60 (10728687): 1276-1282PubMed Google Scholar) employed N-nitrosodiethylamine to treat three strains of mice, detected the levels of Et-PTE products by 32P-postlabeling, and observed higher frequencies of Et-PTE lesions with the 5′-flanking nucleoside being a thymidine or 2′-deoxyguanosine compared with a 2′-deoxyadenosine or 2′-deoxycytidine. Likewise, the relative frequencies of 5′-nucleobases at PTE sites exhibited nonrandom distribution in calf thymus DNA and liver DNA of BALB/c mice treated with diethyl sulfate (9Le Pla R.C. Guichard Y. Bowman K.J. Gaskell M. Farmer P.B. Jones G.D. Further development of 32P-postlabeling for the detection of alkylphosphotriesters: evidence for the long-term nonrandom persistence of ethyl-phosphotriester adducts in vivo.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17 (15540947): 1491-150010.1021/tx049798gCrossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). LC-MS/MS results also revealed the effects of flanking sequences on the levels of Me-PTE lesions induced in lung tissues of rats treated with 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and its metabolite, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (5Ma B. Zarth A.T. Carlson E.S. Villalta P.W. Upadhyaya P. Stepanov I. Hecht S.S. Methyl DNA phosphate adduct formation in rats treated chronically with 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and enantiomers of its metabolite 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2018; 31 (29131934): 48-5710.1021/acs.chemrestox.7b00281Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Several models were proposed to rationalize the sequence-dependent accumulation of alkyl-PTE lesions: 1) Other than the non–carbon-bound oxygen atoms on backbone phosphate groups, each nucleobase possesses unique nucleophiles with different reactivities toward alkylating agents; 2) the alkylating agents' electrophilicity may also influence the nonrandom distribution of alkyl-PTE lesions, where highly reactive alkylating agents may confer a more random distribution (4Jones G.D.D. Le Pla R.C. Farmer P.B. Phosphotriester adducts (PTEs): DNA's overlooked lesion.Mutagenesis. 2010; 25 (19920061): 3-1610.1093/mutage/gep038Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); or 3) the repair efficiencies for alkyl-PTEs may vary with flanking base sequences. However, not much is known about how the flanking base sequence contexts modulate the biological consequences of alkyl-PTEs. Here, we employed a shuttle vector–based method, in conjunction with LC-MS (10Hong H. Cao H. Wang Y. Formation and genotoxicity of a guanine-cytosine intrastrand cross-link lesion in vivo.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 (17942427): 7118-712710.1093/nar/gkm851Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Wang P. Amato N.J. Zhai Q. Wang Y. Cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of O4-alkylthymidine lesions in Escherichia coli cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (26400162): 10795-1080310.1093/nar/gkv941Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), to analyze how the flanking nucleobases of Me- and nBu-PTE lesions influence the fidelity and efficiency of DNA replication in E. coli cells, and how replication past alkyl-PTEs is modulated by Ada protein and translesion synthesis DNA polymerases. Considering that we have previously investigated the TT sequence (7Wu J. Wang P. Wang Y. Cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of alkyl phosphotriester lesions in Escherichia coli cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29514270): 4013-402110.1093/nar/gky140Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), here we examined the Me- and nBu-PTE lesions in both Sp and Rp configurations and in six different combinations of flanking sequences (TX and XT, with X being A, C, or G) (Fig. 1). The Me- and nBu-PTE lesions were selected to examine the influence that the size of the alkyl group has on the replicative bypass of the alkyl-PTE lesions. The aim of the present study was to gain a comprehensive understanding about the impact flanking base sequences have on DNA replication past alkyl-PTE lesions in E. coli, and to examine the roles of Ada protein and translesion synthesis DNA polymerases in modulating the replicative bypass of these lesions. We synthesized 12-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) containing a site-specifically inserted alkyl-PTE lesion in different sequence contexts following our recently published procedures (7Wu J. Wang P. Wang Y. Cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of alkyl phosphotriester lesions in Escherichia coli cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29514270): 4013-402110.1093/nar/gky140Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), except that the exocyclic amino groups of adenine, cytosine, and guanine bases in the phosphoramidite building blocks were protected (see “Materials and Methods” in supporting information, Fig. 2, Figs. S1–S4). The synthesized ODNs were purified by HPLC (Fig. S5). Because the Sp and Rp diastereomers of the T(Me)C- and T(nBu)A-containing ODNs cannot be resolved from each other by HPLC, a mixture of the two diastereomers was utilized for these two ODNs in the subsequent experiments. We characterized the ODNs using electrospray ionization-MS (ESI-MS) and tandem MS (MS/MS), and the results confirmed the expected site of alkyl-PTE incorporation and the sequences of the modified ODNs (Figs. S6–S17). We employed a previously reported shuttle vector method to assess the bypass efficiencies and mutation frequencies of the alkyl-PTE lesions (12Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Assays for determining lesion bypass efficiency and mutagenicity of site-specific DNA lesions in vivo.DNA Repair. 2006; 408 (16793359): 1-1510.1016/S0076-6879(06)08001-3Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The lesion-containing ODNs were ligated into single-stranded M13 phage (Fig. S18). After replication, progeny recovery, PCR amplification, and restriction enzyme digestion, the liberated ODNs were analyzed by native PAGE and LC-MS/MS to identify the replication products (Fig. 3 and Figs. S19–S30). As shown in Fig. 3, we employed two restriction enzymes, BbsI and MluCI, to digest the PCR products of the progeny genome, resulting in the release of the initial damage-containing region as 10-mer ODNs for the lesion-containing or control genome, or a 13-mer ODN for the corresponding region in the competitor genome. By switching the order of digestion of the two restriction enzymes, we selectively radiolabeled the 5′-terminus of either the original lesion-situated strand (p*GGCMNGCTAT) or the opposite strand (p*AATTATAGCY), where p* designates the 32P-labeled phosphate group. Replication across the alkyl-PTEs may yield up to 16 potential products (i.e. with the four natural nucleotides being incorporated at the two nucleosides flanking the PTE site), some of which could not be resolved from one another by PAGE analysis. Thus, we employed a restriction endonuclease and MS assay to identify the mutagenic products and to quantify the mutation frequencies (10Hong H. Cao H. Wang Y. Formation and genotoxicity of a guanine-cytosine intrastrand cross-link lesion in vivo.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 (17942427): 7118-712710.1093/nar/gkm851Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this vein, the aforementioned digestion products were subjected to LC-MS and MS/MS analyses, where we monitored the fragmentation of the [M-3H]3− ions. The mutation frequencies were quantified by the calibrated ratios of peak areas found in the selected-ion chromatograms for the mutagenic and nonmutagenic products (Fig. 4b and Figs. S21 and S22). We found that intriguingly the replication products of the Sp-Me-PTEs at the three XT sites (X = A, C, or G) are largely independent of the neighboring 5′ nucleosides, with ∼85–90% and ∼5–10% of products carrying AT and TG at bases flanking the initial damage site (XT), respectively, although replication across C(Me)T also yields 7% of nonmutagenic replication product (Fig. 4b and Figs. S19 and S20). Additionally, none of the Rp diastereomers of the Me-PTEs in the XT sequences, none of Me-PTEs in the TX sequences, and none of the nBu-PTEs in the TX or XT sequence are mutagenic (Figs. S19, S23, S29, and S30). The bypass efficiencies of the Me-PTE lesions were quantified by comparing the relative intensity of signal for the 10-mer products from the lesion-containing or control genome to that of the 13-mer replication product from the competitor genome; this value was adjusted based on the molar ratios of lesion/competitor and control/competitor genomes used for the transfection (Fig. 4a). For Me-PTEs, none of the Sp-PTEs at the three XT sites were strong impediments to DNA replication, although the corresponding Rp diastereomers significantly blocked DNA replication. Additionally, the blockage effects were more pronounced when the flanking 5′-nucleobase was a purine (adenine and guanine). Meanwhile, all Me-PTEs at TX sites elicited moderate blockage effects on DNA replication. We also examined whether SOS-induced DNA polymerases (Pol II, Pol IV, and Pol V) promote the replicative bypass of different Me-PTEs. Our results showed that, similar to the results obtained for the alkyl-PTE lesions at TT site (7Wu J. Wang P. Wang Y. Cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of alkyl phosphotriester lesions in Escherichia coli cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29514270): 4013-402110.1093/nar/gky140Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), simultaneous depletion of all three SOS-induced DNA polymerases did not exert any apparent effects on the replication bypass efficiencies for the Me-PTE lesions (Fig. 4a). For nBu-PTEs, we found that none of the Sp-PTEs at XT sites significantly impede DNA replication in E. coli cells, whereas the Rp diastereomer in the XT sequence and both diastereomers of nBu-PTEs in the TX sequence elicit moderate blockage effects (Fig. 4c). Considering our previous observation that Ada protein can influence the mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of Sp-Me-PTE at TT dinucleotide site (7Wu J. Wang P. Wang Y. Cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of alkyl phosphotriester lesions in Escherichia coli cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29514270): 4013-402110.1093/nar/gky140Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we next asked how Ada protein affects the replication bypass efficiencies and mutation patterns of Sp-Me-PTEs in different flanking base sequences (Fig. 5 and Figs. S25–S27). We found that genetic ablation of the ada gene resulted in a moderate decline in bypass efficiencies for the Sp-Me-PTEs in all three XT sequences, and a complete abrogation of mutations. However, depletion of ada gene did not elicit significant changes in efficiency or accuracy in replication across the Sp-Me-PTE in any of the three TX sequences. We previously investigated how size and stereochemistry of the alkyl-PTEs at TT site influence DNA replication in E. coli (7Wu J. Wang P. Wang Y. Cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of alkyl phosphotriester lesions in Escherichia coli cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29514270): 4013-402110.1093/nar/gky140Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here, we systematically investigated how compositions of the flanking nucleobases of the alkyl-PTE lesions affect DNA replication. We found that replication across Me-PTEs in XT sequences (X = A, C, or G) shares common features as what we observed for the replicative bypass of T(Me)T (7Wu J. Wang P. Wang Y. Cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of alkyl phosphotriester lesions in Escherichia coli cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29514270): 4013-402110.1093/nar/gky140Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). First, we demonstrated that neither the replication bypass efficiency nor the mutation frequency of Me-PTEs was impacted by concurrent ablation of the three SOS-induced DNA polymerases. Second, we revealed that none of Sp-Me-PTEs in the three XT sequences suppress DNA replication in E. coli cells, whereas the Rp-Me-PTEs in these sequence contexts exhibit significant replication blockage effects. Third, we show that Sp-Me-PTEs at XT sites are mutagenic and Ada protein is indispensable for the mutagenic bypass. In this vein, removal of Ada protein also resulted in decreases in bypass efficiencies for the Sp-Me-PTEs in the three XT sequences. We also uncovered some unique features regarding replicating past alkyl-PTEs with different flanking base sequences. Strikingly, we found that the distribution of replication products for Sp-Me-PTEs in the three XT sequences (X = A, C, or G) was largely independent of the 5′-neighboring nucleobase being an A, C, or G, where ∼85–90% and 5–10% of the replication products were with AT and TG being inserted at the initial XT site, respectively (Fig. 4b). In this context, it is worth noting that Sp-Me-PTE at TT site induced 50% TT→GT and 15% TT→GC mutations, and the induction of these mutations also entails Ada protein (7Wu J. Wang P. Wang Y. Cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of alkyl phosphotriester lesions in Escherichia coli cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29514270): 4013-402110.1093/nar/gky140Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Ada was reported to remove the methyl group from Sp-Me-PTEs, where Cys-38 on N-terminal domain of the protein interacts with the methyl group on the DNA backbone (13He C. Hus J.-C. Sun L.J. Zhou P.

A previous structural study showed that the N-terminal domain of Ada protein preferentially recognizes A/T in the Ada box (13He C. Hus J.-C. Sun L.J. Zhou P. Norman D.P.G. Dötsch V. Wei H. Gross J.D.

In this recognition, Arg45 participates in hydrogen bonding interactions with thymine residues in both strands, and the binding with Arg-45 is sterically incompatible with a G positioned in the last two bases of the Ada box (13He C. Hus J.-C. Sun L.J. Zhou P. Norman D.P.G. Dötsch V. Wei H. Gross J.D. Lane W.S. Wagner G. Verdine G.L.

In contrast to what we found for Me-PTEs at XT sites (X = A, C, G, or T), replication across the Me-PTEs at TX sites (X = A, C, or G) was accurate. In addition, neither the efficiency nor fidelity of replication across any of the Me-PTEs at TX site was altered upon genetic ablation of Ada. We also examined the replication past nBu-PTEs and found that the trends in bypass efficiency were similar to what we found for Me-PTEs (Fig. 4c); however, none of nBu-PTEs were mutagenic. The results from our replication studies prompted us to propose a tentative model where Ada protein binds to Sp-Me-PTE lesions formed at XT dinucleotide sites, and this binding is maintained during the replicative bypass of these lesions in ssDNA. In this vein, the very high levels of AT (85–90%) and GT (5–10%) replication products induced at the Sp-Me-PTE–containing XT (X = A, C, or G) dinucleotide sites, together with the dependence of these product distributions on Ada, suggest that Ada protein is bound with the lesion during replicative bypass of the Sp-Me-PTE at these sites (Fig. 4b). Moreover, this interaction with Ada protein also assists the replicative bypass of these lesions in E. coli cells. The lack of apparent dependence of the distributions of replication products for the Sp-Me-PTE lesion in the three XT sequences (X = A, C, or G) on the identities of the 5′-flanking nucleobases strongly suggests their lack of recognition by DNA polymerases during nucleotide incorporation at the site. These results, together with the previous observation that an arginine residue in REV1 could direct the incorporation of dCMP through direct hydrogen bonding interaction with the nucleobase in the incoming nucleotide (16Nair D.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Rev1 employs a novel mechanism of DNA synthesis using a protein template.Science. 2005; 309 (16195463): 2219-222210.1126/science.1116336Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), indicate that some amino acid residue(s) in the Ada protein may direct nucleotide incorporation when E. coli replication machinery incorporates a nucleotide opposite the 5′ flanking base of the Me-PTE lesions. Harper and Lee (17Harper M. Lee C.J. Genome-wide analysis of mutagenesis bias and context sensitivity of N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG).Mutat.

Our results, however, suggest that the G→A mutation may also arise, in part, from Sp-Me-PTE formed at GT site. In summary, the results from our shuttle vector–based replication study showed that flanking base sequences play important roles in DNA replication across Me- and nBu-PTE lesions. Sp-Me-PTEs and Sp-nBu-PTEs at XT sites (X = A, C, or G) were not strong impediments to DNA replication, whereas their Rp counterparts exhibited blockage effects. Meanwhile, Me- and nBu-PTEs at TX sites moderately block DNA replication in E. coli. Furthermore, replication across Sp-Me-PTEs at XT sites is mutagenic, which requires the presence of Ada protein. However, this phenomenon was not observed for Rp-Me-PTEs at XT sites, which is consistent with the notion that Ada protein does not recognize Rp-Me-PTEs. There are two established functions for Ada protein, i.e. removal of the methyl group from Sp-Me-PTE or O6-MedG, and transcriptional activation of ada, alkA, alkB, and aidB genes (3Shrivastav N.

Our work suggests that, aside from these two well-characterized functions, Ada may assume other important functions in cells, i.e. by binding and modulating the replicative bypass of Sp-Me-PTE lesions in some sequence contexts. In the future, it will be important to investigate whether a mutant form of Ada protein that is competent in binding with Sp-Me-PTE, but deficient in removal of the methyl group from the lesion (e.g. a Cys-38 mutant), can still support the replicative bypass of the lesion, and if so, whether this role of Ada is modulated by the flanking nucleobases of Sp-Me-PTE. Additionally, future studies about how alkyl-PTE lesions influence DNA replication in mammalian cells will also provide additional insights into the biological impacts of this unique class of DNA damage.

The detailed materials, synthetic procedures, reaction yields, and spectroscopic characterizations of compounds are provided in the supporting information, and the NMR spectra for these compounds are shown in Figs. S1–S4. A Beckman Oligo 1000M DNA synthesizer (Fullerton, CA, USA) was used to synthesize the 12-mer lesion-containing ODNs, 5′-ATGGCX(Y)TGCTAT-3′ and 5′-ATGGCT(Y)XGCTAT-3′ (X represents A, C, or G; Y represents an Me or nBu group) at 1 μmol scale. The synthesized phosphoramidite building block was dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile at a concentration of 67 mm. Incorporation of unmodified nucleotides was conducted by using commercially available ultramild phosphoramidite building blocks (Glen Research Inc., Sterling, VA, USA) following standard protocols. Synthesized ODNs were cleaved and deprotected from controlled pore glass with concentrated ammonium hydroxide at room temperature for 55 min. After solvent removal using a SpeedVac, the solid residues were dissolved in water and HPLC purified. HPLC separation was conducted on an Agilent 1100 system with a Synergi Fusion-RP column (10 × 150 mm, 4 μm in particle size and 80 Å in pore size; Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA, USA). Triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) solution (50 mm, pH 6.8), and a mixture of 50 mm TEAA and acetonitrile (70:30, v/v) were employed as mobile phases A and B, respectively. The gradient profile was 5–30% B in 5 min and 30–60% B in 70 min, and the flow rate was 0.8 ml/min. The HPLC traces for the purification of the 12-mer lesion-containing ODNs are shown in Fig. S5 and their ESI-MS and MS/MS are provided in Figs. S6–S17. The 12-mer lesion-containing ODNs were 5′-phosphorylated and ligated with a 10-mer ODN (5′-AGTGGAAGAC-3′) to yield 22-mer lesion-containing ODNs, and the ensuing ligation products were purified by denaturing PAGE. The single-stranded lesion-containing and lesion-free competitor M13 genomes were prepared following published procedures (Fig. S18) (12Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Assays for determining lesion bypass efficiency and mutagenicity of site-specific DNA lesions in vivo.DNA Repair. 2006; 408 (16793359): 1-1510.1016/S0076-6879(06)08001-3Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 pmol of M13mp7 (L2) plasmid was digested with 40 units EcoRI-HF at 25°C for 8 h to linearize the vector. Two scaffolds, 5′-CTTCCACTCACTGAATCATGGTCATAGCTTTC-3′ and 5′-AAAACGACGGCCAGTGAATTATAGC-3′ (25 pmol each), were subsequently annealed with the linearized vector. A phosphorylated 22-mer lesion-containing or lesion-free control ODN, or a 25-mer competitor ODN, was then added to the mixture and incubated with scaffold ODNs and T4 DNA ligase at 16°C for 8 h. Unligated linear vector and ODNs were removed by the exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase (22.5 units, 16°C for 2 h). The resulting plasmids were purified using Cycle Pure Kit (Omega), and the purified lesion-containing and lesion-free control plasmids were subsequently normalized against the competitor plasmid (12Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Assays for determining lesion bypass efficiency and mutagenicity of site-specific DNA lesions in vivo.DNA Repair. 2006; 408 (16793359): 1-1510.1016/S0076-6879(06)08001-3Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). P1 transduction was employed to obtain the Ada-deficient E. coli strain (Δada::kan) in AB1157 background from JW2201-1 strain (26Thomason L.C. Costantino N. Court D.L. E. coli genome manipulation by P1 transduction.Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2007; (Chapter 1) (18265391): 1.1710.1002/0471142727.mb0117s79Google Scholar). Genotype of the ensuing deficient strain was confirmed by antibiotic resistance and PCR followed by sequencing. The lesion-free control or lesion-containing plasmids were mixed with the competitor plasmid at a 1:1 molar ratio. The mixtures were transfected into electrocompetent WT AB1157 E. coli strains as well as the isogenic cells deficient in Ada, or all three SOS-induced DNA polymerases (i.e. Pol II, Pol IV and Pol V, TKO) (11Wang P. Amato N.J. Zhai Q. Wang Y.

The transfected E. coli cells were cultured at 37°C for 5.5 h and the M13 phage was isolated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 5 min. The purified M13 phage was transfected into SCS110 E. coli cells for amplification, followed by extraction with QIAprep Spin M13 kit (Qiagen) to obtain M13 ssDNA template for PCR amplification. We utilized a modified version of the competitive replication and adduct bypass assay to assess the bypass efficiency of alkyl-PTE lesions in E. coli cells (10Hong H. Cao H. Wang Y.

The regions of interest in the progeny M13 genomes were amplified by PCR with the use of Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase. The primers were 5′-YCAGCTATGACCATGATTCAGTGAGTGGA-3′ and 5′-YTCGGTGCGGGCCTCTTCGCTATTAC-3′, where Y represents a 5′-amino modifier conjugated to the 5′-phosphate group of ODNs, i.e. H2N(CH2)6-. The PCR amplification started from 98°C for 30 s, followed by 35 cycles of amplification, with each cycle consisting of 98°C for 10 s, 65°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 15 s, and then with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min, ending at 4°C. The PCR products were purified by Cycle Pure kit (Omega). The PCR products (100 ng) were digested with BbsI-HF restriction endonuclease (10 units) and recombinant shrimp alkaline phosphatase (rSAP, 10 units) in 10 μl 1 × CutSmart buffer (New England Biolabs) at 37°C for 25 min, followed by deactivation of rSAP at 80°C for 10 min. To the above mixture were added 5 mm DTT, 1.66 pmol [γ-32P]ATP, 10 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (T4 PNK), CutSmart buffer, and water to give a total volume of 15 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and T4 PNK was then deactivated by heating the solution at 70°C for 10 min. The resulting mixture was further digested with 10 units MluCI at 37°C for 25 min and subsequently quenched by adding 15 μl formamide gel-loading buffer containing xylene cyanol FF and bromphenol blue dyes. The radiolabeled digestion mixtures were resolved using a 30% native polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide:bis) and the intensities for the radiolabeled gel bands were measured by using a Typhoon 9410 imager. The aforementioned digestion procedures yield a 10-mer duplex: 5′-p*GGCMNGCTAT-3′/5′-AATTATAGCY-3′ for full-length replication products of the lesion-containing plasmid, with M and N being the nucleobases at the dinucleotides initially flanking the alkyl-PTE lesions, Y being the complementary base of N in the opposite strand, and p* being the radiolabeled phosphate. The corresponding digestion of the PCR product for the competition genome yielded a 13-mer duplex: 5′-p*GGCGATAAGCTAT-3′/5′-AATTATAGCTTAT-3′. The bypass efficiency was calculated by: Bypass efficiency (%) = (lesion signal/competitor signal)/(control signal/competitor signal) × 100%. Approximately 3 μg PCR products in 250 μl of 1 × CutSmart buffer was mixed with 50 units BbsI-HF, 20 units rSAP, and incubated at 37°C for 2 h, followed by deactivation of rSAP at 80°C for 20 min MluCI (20 units) was subsequently added to the mixture and the digestion was continued at 37°C for 1 h. The resulting mixture was extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v) and the aqueous phase was evaporated, desalted by Waters Oasis HLB extraction cartridges (Milford, MA, USA), and redissolved in 10 μl water. A 5-μl aliquot was analyzed by LC-MS/MS on an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA, USA) with an Agilent Zorbax SB-C18 column (0.5 × 150 mm, 5 μm in particle size). The gradient was 5 min of 5–20% methanol followed by 35 min of 20–50% methanol in 400 mm HFIP (pH was adjusted to 7.0 with triethylamine). The temperature for the ion transfer tube was 300°C, and the mass spectrometer was set up for acquiring the higher-resolution ultra-zoom scan MS and full-scan MS/MS for the [M-3H]3− ions of 10-mer ODNs, d(GGCMNGCTAT), with M and N being A, T, C, and G.

https://openalex.org/W3021781153,"The structure of lactose permease, stabilized in a periplasmic open conformation by two Gly to Trp replacements (LacYww) and complexed with a nanobody directed against this conformation, provides the highest resolution structure of the symporter. The nanobody binds in a different manner than two other nanobodies made against the same mutant, which also bind to the same general region on the periplasmic side. This region of the protein may represent an immune hotspot. The CDR3 loop of the nanobody is held by hydrogen bonds in a conformation that partially blocks access to the substrate-binding site. As a result, kon and koff for galactoside binding to either LacY or the double mutant complexed with the nanobody are lower than for the other two LacY/nanobody complexes though the Kd values are similar, reflecting the fact that the nanobodies rigidify structures along the pathway. While the wild-type LacY/nanobody complex clearly stabilizes a similar ‘extracellular open’ conformation in solution, judged by binding kinetics, the complex with wild-type LacY did not yet crystallize, suggesting the nanobody does not bind strongly enough to shift the equilibrium to stabilize a periplasmic side-open conformation suitable for crystallization. However, the similarity of the galactoside binding kinetics for the nanobody-bound complexes with wild type LacY and with LacYWW indicates that they have similar structures, showing that the reported co-structures reliably show nanobody interactions with LacY."
https://openalex.org/W3022649077,"Major depressive disorder is a common disease with high mortality and morbidity worldwide. Though peak onset is during late adolescence, the prevalence of major depressive disorder remains high throughout adulthood. Leveraging an association study design, this study screened a large number of variables in the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to characterize differences between adult and youth depression across a wide array of phenotypic measurements.All dichotomous variables were manually identified from the survey for association screening. Association between each dichotomous variable and past-year major depressive episode (MDE) occurrence was calculated as an odds ratio for adults (≥18 years) and youth (12-17 years), and tested for significance with Fischer's exact test. Logarithm of the calculated odds ratios were plotted and fitted to a linear model to assess correlation between adult and youth risk factors.Many of the screened variables showed similar association between past-year depressive episode occurrence in youth and adults; Lin's concordance correlation coefficient between adult and youth associations was 0.91 (95% CI 0.89-0.92). Differentially associated variables were identified, tracking: female sex, alcohol use, cigarette use, marijuana use, Medicaid/CHIP coverage, cognitive changes due to a mental, physical or emotional condition, and respondents' identification of a single depressive event as the worst experienced.While some youth-specific correlates of major depressive episodes were identified through screening, including some novel associations, most examined variables showed similar association with youth and adult depression. Further study of results is warranted, especially concerning the finding of increased association between marijuana use and depressive episodes in youth."
https://openalex.org/W3020871323,"Katherine Johnson, a mathematician for NASA and its predecessor agency, passed away on 24 February at age 101. She and women like her worked unseen for decades to ensure America's success in the space race. The 2016 movie Hidden Figures finally brought her story to light. The recognition of Katherine's contributions to aeronautics and to America's ventures into space is well deserved, as she and her African American colleagues did vital work while facing Jim Crow barriers in nearly every aspect of their lives.

Katherine, the youngest child of Joshua and Joylette Coleman, was born on 26 August 1918, in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. The state had been part of the Union during the Civil War, but in every way that mattered it was part of the segregated South. Where the Colemans lived, education for Black children only extended through grade school, so Joshua rented a house more than 100 miles away to give his children the opportunity to attend the laboratory school at West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later West Virginia State College), a historically Black public land-grant institution established by the second Morrill Act. In 1933, at the age of 15, Katherine enrolled as a college freshman. She graduated summa cum laude in 1937 with a double major in mathematics and French.

Following the path often taken by Black, college-educated women of her generation, Katherine became a teacher. The possibility of using her education in mathematics in any other career was unimaginable, although her professor did encourage and prepare her to pursue graduate study. An opportunity for graduate work came along when she was among those selected to integrate all-White West Virginia University after a Supreme Court decision mandated equal access to graduate educational opportunities. However, after one summer at the university in 1940, Katherine chose not to continue. Recently married, she stepped away to assume the role of wife and mother.

In 1952, through family, Katherine learned of and seized an opportunity to apply her mathematical skills at the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, a research center of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, NASA's predecessor). During World War II and the ensuing Cold War, NACA needed the skills of female mathematicians (“human computers”) to support the work of their engineers. With executive orders urging desegregation, the all-Black West Area computing group came onboard, joining the all-White East Area computing group in providing that mathematical power.

At that time, women in government experienced economic inequality—in title, salary, and limited opportunities for promotion. Meanwhile, Black Americans in the segregated South faced educational, social, and economic inequities. And yet, on the strength of her mathematical abilities, Katherine was considered an equal within the community of engineers and scientists with whom she worked. Margot Lee Shetterly, author of the book on which the Hidden Figures movie was based, referred to this paradox as a “triumph of meritocracy.”



The Soviet Union's successful launch of Sputnik in 1957 led to a blistering pace of work for the engineers, scientists, and mathematicians charged with bolstering American pride in space. Long hours and the agency's demand for results were layered atop increasing family responsibilities. Katherine's husband, James Goble, had died in 1956, leaving her carrying the added weight of single parenting.

In 1959, she married Jim Johnson and published her first research report under the name Katherine G. Johnson. That report and her subsequent work developing precise trajectory calculations for NASA's early human spaceflights were essential to establishing the United States as the leading spacefaring nation. Electronic computers were just being introduced into the space program, and their results were not always reliable. The human computers were there to backstop the machines. In the early 1960s, she worked on lunar orbits. Her contribution was crucial in helping to realize President Kennedy's goal of landing a man on the Moon.

I never had the privilege of meeting Katherine, except in the pages of Shetterly's book, which provides incredible insight into the gifted and confident yet understated mathematician whom astronaut John Glenn was prepared to trust with his life. I attended a panel at the 2017 Emerging Researchers National Conference featuring Shetterly; her father, Robert B. Lee III, a former Langley climate scientist; and “hidden figure” and aeronautical engineer Christine Darden. The panelists' discussions provided insight into NASA's early days and the contributions of pioneering minority and female mathematicians and engineers, pieces of the early history and public face of the agency that had been missing until recently. The 950 attendees at that session included students from 52 historically Black colleges and universities. Katherine's experience of being the first, the only, or among the few who looked like her in a given professional setting was strikingly familiar to us. We were all moved by the stories of triumph over adversity.

In 2015 Katherine was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama. In 2016 she received a Silver Snoopy Award from astronaut Leland Melvin and a NASA Group Achievement Award. In November 2019, by way of bipartisan legislation, Johnson and other hidden figures of NASA were honored with Congressional Gold Medals.

The girl who loved to count became the woman whose aptitude and passion for mathematics helped propel the space ambitions of the United States. Katherine's story and those of other hidden figures have been embraced in popular culture and by those of us working to diversify science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. But there are other lessons to be learned: Her story demonstrates why we must work to provide excellent education and opportunities for all. It also elucidates the importance of policy interventions and laws in sustaining those opportunities. Katherine Johnson earned her place in the pantheon of America's space heroes; she and the other women who contributed to the country's path to the heavens are hidden no more."
https://openalex.org/W3023343529,"Cells are crowded and spatially heterogeneous, complicating the transport of organelles, proteins and other substrates. One aspect of this complex physical environment, the mobility of passively transported substrates, can be quantitatively characterized by the diffusion coefficient: a descriptor of how rapidly substrates will diffuse in the cell, dependent on their size and effective local viscosity. The spatial dependence of diffusivity is challenging to quantitatively characterize, because temporally and spatially finite observations offer limited information about a spatially varying stochastic process. We present a Bayesian framework that estimates diffusion coefficients from single particle trajectories, and predicts our ability to distinguish differences in diffusion coefficient estimates, conditional on how much they differ and the amount of data collected. This framework is packaged into a public software repository, including a tutorial Jupyter notebook demonstrating implementation of our method for diffusivity estimation, analysis of sources of uncertainty estimation, and visualization of all results. This estimation and uncertainty analysis allows our framework to be used as a guide in experimental design of diffusivity assays."
