https://openalex.org/W2040517893,"The adhesion strengths of a viscoelastic adhesive were measured on various substrates that were prepared by grafting silanes bearing organic functional groups to silicon wafers. Conventional theories predict that adhesion should be proportional to the surface free energy of the substrate; but adhesion on a fluorocarbon surface was significantly greater than on some of the hydrocarbon surfaces, although the fluorocarbon surface has the lowest surface free energy. This result could be explained by invoking a model of adhesion based on the slippage of the adhesive at the interface."
https://openalex.org/W2031377315,"Ocean numerical models have become quite realistic over the past several years as a result of improved methods, faster computers, and global data sets. Models now treat basin-scale to global domains while retaining the fine spatial scales that are important for modeling the transport of heat, salt, and other properties over vast distances. Simulations are reproducing observed satellite results on the energetics of strong currents and are properly showing diverse aspects of thermodynamic and dynamic ocean responses ranging from deep-water production to EI Ni√±o. Now models can represent not only currents but also the consequences for climate, biology, and geochemistry over time spans of months to decades. However, much remains to be understood from models about ocean circulation on longer time scales, including the evolution of the dominant water masses, the predictability of climate, and the ocean's influence on global change."
https://openalex.org/W2089383515,"Observations of the sun reveal highly complex flows and magnetic structures that must result from turbulent convection in the solar envelope. A remarkable degree of large-scale coherence emerges from the small-scale turbulent dynamics, as seen in the cycles of magnetic activity and in the differential rotation profile of this star. High-performance computing now permits numerical simulations of compressible turbulence and magnetohydrodynamics with sufficient resolution to show that compact structures of vorticity and magnetic fields can coexist with larger scales. Such structured turbulence is yielding transport properties for heat and angular momentum at considerable variance with earlier models. These simulations are elucidating the coupling of turbulent fluid motions with rotation and magnetic fields, which must control the interlinked differential rotation and magnetic dynamo action."

https://openalex.org/W2086820245,"Volcanic eruptions of gassy magmas on Earth, Venus, and Mars produce plumes with markedly different fluid dynamics regimes. In large part the differences are caused by the differing atmospheric pressures and ratios of volcanic vent pressure to atmospheric pressure. For each of these planets, numerical simulations of an eruption of magma containing 4 weight percent gas were run on a workstation. On Venus the simulated eruption of a pressure-balanced plume formed a dense fountain over the vent and continuous pyroclastic flows. On Earth and Mars, simulated pressure-balanced plumes produced ash columns, ash falls, and possible small pyroclastic flows. An overpressured plume, illustrated for Mars, exhibited a complex supersonic velocity structure and internal shocks."

https://openalex.org/W2062965821,"Supercomputer simulations have been used in conjunction with analytic studies to investigate the central issue of astrophysical accretion-disk dynamics: the nature of the angular momentum transport. Simulations provide the means to investigate and experiment with candidate mechanisms, including global hydrodynamic instabilities, spiral shock waves, and local magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities. Simulations have demonstrated that accretion disks are generally MHD turbulent. These results suggest that the fundamental physical mechanism for angular momentum transport in accretion disks has now been identified."
