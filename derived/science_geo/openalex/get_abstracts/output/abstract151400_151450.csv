Oxidative toxicity can be induced by glutamate treatment in cells that lack ionotrophic glutamate receptors, such as the immortalized HT22 hippocampal cell line and immature primary cortical neurons. Previously, we found that neuroprotective effects of geldanamycin, a benzoquinone ansamycin, in HT22 cells were associated with a down-regulation of c-Raf-1, an upstream activator of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs). ERK activation, although often attributed strictly to neuronal cell survival and proliferation, can also be associated with neuronal cell death that occurs in response to specific insults. In this report we show that delayed and persistent activation of ERKs is associated with glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in HT22 cells and immature primary cortical neuron cultures. Furthermore, we find that U0126, a specific inhibitor of the ERK-activating kinase, MEK-1/2, protects both HT22 cells and immature primary cortical neuron cultures from glutamate toxicity. Glutamate-induced ERK activation requires the production of specific arachidonic acid metabolites and appears to be downstream of a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation characteristic of oxidative stress in HT22 cells. However, inhibition of ERK activation reduces glutamate-induced intracellular Ca2+accumulation. We hypothesize that the precise kinetics and duration of ERK activation may determine whether downstream targets are mobilized to enhance neuronal cell survival or ensure cellular demise.

Coyle J.T. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1547-1558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) and primary neuronal cell cultures (10.Murphy T.H. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T.

Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Because cystine is a precursor for glutathione synthesis, cellular glutathione levels decline and reactive oxygen species (ROS)1accumulate under conditions of oxidative stress (2.Simonian N.A. Coyle J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). In these cases, reducing cystine levels in the medium can mimic the effect of glutamate, whereas increasing cystine concentrations reverse glutamate-induced toxicity (9.Murphy T.H. Miyamoto M. Sastre A. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1547-1558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The reduction of ROS accumulation by antioxidants also prevents cell death (9.Murphy T.H. Miyamoto M. Sastre A. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1547-1558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 12.Davis J.B. Maher P. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). ROS contribute to cell death, in part, through effects on various cellular signaling pathways including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (13.Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 14.Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol.

Zhang P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). MAPKs are a family of related serine/threonine protein kinases that integrate diverse signals that direct cellular responses to proliferative cues or stressful stimuli (17.Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 19.Cobb M. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). In general, MAPKs are activated upon tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation by MAPK kinases (20.Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar), which in turn are activated upon phosphorylation by MAPK kinase kinases (21.Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Particular members of the MAPK family include extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), and the p38 MAP kinase (p38 MAPK) (17.Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the MAPK family have different substrate specificities that mediate their diverse biological effects (17.Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK is often correlated with neuronal degeneration. For example, apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor withdrawal in rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells is associated with activation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK (22.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar). Specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK can prevent apoptosis in PC12 cells and fibroblasts (23.Horstman S. Kahle P.J. Borasio G.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24.Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), as well as in primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons (25.Kawasaki H. Morooka T. Shimohama S. Kimura J. Hirano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18518-18521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Furthermore, certain survival-promoting factors, such as insulin, decrease p38 MAPK activation. Some of the adverse effects of JNK/SAPK might be mediated via phosphorylation of the JNK/SAPK substrate c-Jun, because expression of a dominant negative c-Jun mutant confers resistance to nerve growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis in superior cervical ganglion cells (26.Ham J. Babjj C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The role of ERKs in neuronal degeneration is less clear and may depend upon the specific neuronal cell type. ERK activation is typically associated with cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation given their activation by mitogens and some cell survival factors (22.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar, 27.Boulton T. Nye S. Robbins D. Ip N. Radziejewska E. Morgenvesser S. Depinho R. Panayotatos N.

Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). However, activation of ERKs has recently been found to contribute to neuronal cell death in certain in vitro models of neurotoxicity (29.Runden E. Seglen P.O. Haug F.M. Ottersen O.P. Wieloch T. Shamloo M. Laake J.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7296-7305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Murray B.A. Alessandrini A.J. Cole A.J. Yee A.G. Furshpan E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11975-11980Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 31.Creedon D.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20713-20718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In fact, inhibition of MEK-1/2, the upstream activators of ERKs, afforded some degree of protection against apoptosis generated by nerve growth factor withdrawal of differentiated PC12 cells (24.Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). MEK-1 inhibition was also shown recently to protect against neuron cell damage induced by focal cerebral ischemia in rats (32.Alessandrini A. Namura S. Moskowitz M.A. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12866-12869Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Clearly, the view that JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK promote apoptosis whereas ERKs oppose apoptosis in neuronal cells is overly simplistic, and detailed analysis of these pathways is warranted in any model of neurotoxicity or neurodegeneration. The HT22 mouse hippocampal cell line has provided a useful in vitro model of glutamate-induced oxidative stress (12.Davis J.B. Maher P. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 33.Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because these cells are devoid of ionotropic glutamate receptors (12.Davis J.B. Maher P. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), excitotoxicity does not contribute to HT22 cell death that results from glutamate treatment. We had previously found that geldanamycin (GA), a benzoquinoid ansamycin, protected HT22 cells from glutamate toxicity, even if given several hours after glutamate (34.Xiao N. Callaway C. DeFranco D.B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One of the biochemical effects associated with the neuroprotective effects of GA in HT22 cells was the down-regulation of c-Raf-1, an upstream activator of the ERK pathway. In this report we show that persistent activation of ERKs may commit both HT22 cells and primary cortical neurons to programmed cell death in response to glutamate treatment. Thus, activation of ERKs, which is more often associated with protection against cell death, can participate in a cell death pathway that is induced by oxidative stress in neurons. The anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP Kinase mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and the anti-MAP kinase 1/2 rabbit polyclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Baicalein (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and U0126 (Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO to 10 mm and stored under nitrogen at −20 °C. If baicalein or U0126 were added to cells, control cultures were treated with equivalent amounts of Me2SO. The mouse HT22 hippocampal cell line (12.Davis J.B. Maher P. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) is a subclone of the HT4 cell line (35.Morimoto B.H. Koshland D.E. Neuron. 1990; 5: 875-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) that was selected for its sensitivity to glutamate-induced toxicity. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlantic Biological, Norcross, GA). Primary cortical neuron cultures were prepared using a modification of a previously described protocol (36.Li-Smerin Y. Johnson J.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 491: 121-135Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sixteen-day pregnant Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, and 9–12 fetuses were removed and chilled to 5 °C. Brain cortices were isolated from the fetuses and incubated for 45 min at 36 °C in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5.3 mmd-glucose, 1.9 mm glutamine, 19 mm HEPES, and 0.03% trypsin. The cortices then were incubated for 35 min at 36 °C in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Earle's balanced salt solution, and cells were dispersed by trituration, and debris was removed by filtration through Falcon cell strainers. Cells were maintained for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum prior to treatment with glutamate and/or baicalein or U0126. As shown previously (10.Murphy T.H. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1624-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), glutamate toxicity in similar primary cultures of rat embryonic cortical neurons is limited to neurons and is due to oxidative stress that results from cystine depletion. Such cultures are not subject to ionotropic glutamate receptor-mediated neurotoxicity during the first 2 days in culture, probably because of very low receptor expression (10.Murphy T.H. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1624-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Following indicated treatments, HT22 cells or primary cortical neuron cultures were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. Protein samples for blotting were prepared by resuspension of cell pellets in sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Soluble extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations in isolated extracts were determined using a Bradford Protein Assay kit from Bio-Rad. Equal amounts of total extract protein (10–20 μg) were used for Western blot analysis as described earlier (34.Xiao N. Callaway C. DeFranco D.B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of the Western blot data was performed using a MacBAS software package. Cell viability was assessed by measuring their ability to metabolize 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (37.Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar), as described previously (34.Xiao N. Callaway C. DeFranco D.B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HT22 cells, or primary cortical neuronal cultures, were seeded onto 96-well plates at 5,000 cells per well in growth medium (see above) and grown overnight prior to the initiation of any experimental treatments. Following the indicated treatments, 10 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well, and cells were maintained in growth medium for 4 h at 37 °C. 100 μl of solubilization solution (50% dimethylformamide and 20% SDS, pH 4.8) was then added to each individual well. Following an overnight incubation at room temperature, absorbance at 570 nm was measured. HT22 Cells were plated on glass coverslips 1 day prior to experiments. The cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in growth media either containing 5 mm glutamate or 5 mm glutamate + 10 μm UO126. At the end of this incubation, cells were washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (SFM) and loaded at 37 °C with 10 μmcarboxy-H2DCFDA (DCF; Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) in Me2SO (15 min) or with 2 μm Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes) (20 min) in SFM. Loaded cells were then washed twice with SFM, placed into a Bioptechs live cell chamber, and imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope equipped with an automated xyz stage. Images were acquired from three fields per plate using standard fluorescein isothiocyanate or Fura-2 AM optical filter sets. Quantitation of DCF fluorescence was achieved by averaging the integrated fluorescent signal from 5 to 10 cells per field, for each plate. At least two plates were imaged for each condition. A similar quantitation was carried out for Fura-2 AM by averaging the ratio of fluorescent signals acquired at 340 and 380 nm. Previously, we showed that down-regulation of c-Raf-1 was associated with neuroprotective effects of GA in HT22 cells following exposure to toxic levels of glutamate (34.Xiao N. Callaway C. DeFranco D.B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). c-Raf-1 is an upstream activator of the ERK pathway through its phosphorylation and activation of the ERK kinases, MEK-1/2 (38.Dent P. Haser W. Haystead T.A. Vincent L.A. Roberts T.M. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1992; 257: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To assess ERK activation in HT22 cells, we used a monoclonal antibody that recognizes only the activated, dually phosphorylated forms of ERKs. As shown in Fig.1, treatment of HT22 cells with 5 mm glutamate led to activation of ERKs (i.e. p44 ERK-1 and p42 ERK-2) that was first apparent at 6 h of glutamate treatment. By 9 h of glutamate treatment, a 4-fold activation of ERK had been obtained relative to control, untreated cells. Although the kinetics of ERK activation by glutamate varied slightly with different batches of HT22 cells, persistent activation of ERKs in cells exposed to glutamate for 9–16 h was consistently observed. Total ERK levels were not significantly affected by glutamate treatment (Fig. 1) and were therefore used as an internal standard in quantification of ERK activation. The onset of ERK activation in HT22 cells occurs at a time following glutamate treatment (i.e. 6–9 h) that is close to the onset of an irreversible execution phase of cell death (33.Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Does ERK activation contribute to cell death in HT22 cells or is it merely a marker for cells that are engaged in a cell death program? To address this question, we tested whether selective inhibition of ERK activation would impact glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in HT22 cells. The compound U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene) has been identified as a selective inhibitor of the dual specificity ERK-activating kinases, MEK-1 and MEK-2, both in vitro andin vivo (39.Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). U0126 exerts little, if any, effect on the activities of protein kinase C, Abl, c-Raf-1, MEK kinase, ERK, JNK/SAPK, MKK-3, MKK-4/SEK, MKK-6, Cdk2, or Cdk4 (39.Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). As shown inlanes 5 and 6 of Fig. 1, treatment of HT22 cells with U0126 markedly reduced the basal level of activated ERKs. A single addition of U0126 at the time of glutamate treatment maintained the reduced basal level of activated ERKs, for at least 15 h (Fig.2). Importantly, U0126 also blocked glutamate-induced activation of ERKs in HT22 cells (Fig. 2). Although U0126 reduced the basal level of activated ERK in HT22 cells maintained under our standard culture conditions (Fig. 2), it exerted minimal effects on HT22 cell morphology at concentrations up to 10 μm (Fig. 3 C). In fact, glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity was inhibited in HT22 cells treated with 10 μm U0126 (Fig. 3 D). To provide a more reliable quantitative measure of the protective effects of U0126, HT22 cell viability was measured using the MTT assay (34.Xiao N. Callaway C. DeFranco D.B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, U0126 protected HT22 cells from glutamate toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. Protective effects of U0126 were maximal at 5 μmand maintained at 20 μm, where minimal cytotoxic effects were observed. A previous report showed that when COS-7 cells were treated with 5 μm U0126, and ERK activation was inhibited by approximately 95% (39.Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). Similar inhibition of ERK activation was also observed in U0126-treated HT22 cells (Fig. 1, lanes 5and 6).Figure 4Dose-dependent protective effect of U0126 against glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in HT22 cells. HT22 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 5,000 cells per well and grown for 24 h. Cells were then treated with U0126 alone or U0126 plus 5 mm glutamate (Glu) for 20 h. Cell viability was measured using the MTT method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are presented relative to control cells (no treatment) ± S.D. Each determination was performed in quadruplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) U0126 also protected HT22 cells from glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity even when added after glutamate treatment (Fig.5). The ability of U0126, given following glutamate treatment, to protect HT22 cells from glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity diminished over time but was still apparent 12 h after cells were initially exposed to 5 mm glutamate (Fig. 5). In previous studies, minimal protective effects of GA (34.Xiao N. Callaway C. DeFranco D.B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), or other compounds (40.Tan S.

The fact that we observed protective effects of U0126 when it was added 12 h after glutamate addition (Fig. 5) may be related to variations in HT22 cell growth conditions or medium components (i.e. serum). Many of the mechanistic features of glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in HT22 cells likewise operate in immature primary cortical neurons (33.Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 41.Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D.

Immature cortical neurons do not express ionotropic glutamate receptors and therefore undergo oxidative stress when exposed to high concentrations of glutamate (10.Murphy T.H. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1624-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in primary cortical neuron cultures is blocked by U0126. The enhanced survival of the primary cells in the presence of U0126 and glutamate (Fig. 6) was also noted when U0126 was added alone (not shown) and contrasts the slight toxicity associated with U0126 treatment of HT22 cells (Figs. 4 and 5). Constitutive activation of ERKs was observed in the primary cortical neuron cultures (Fig. 7), which might be because of their maintenance in serum-containing medium. As observed in HT22 cells, glutamate treatment of these primary cultures increased ERK activation, which was most evident following 15 h of glutamate treatment (Fig. 7). Furthermore, a single treatment with U0126 reduced both the basal and glutamate-stimulated activated ERK levels (Fig. 7). Total ERK levels in the primary cortical neuron cultures were not affected by either glutamate or U0126 (Fig. 7). The production of peroxides and influx of Ca2+ that follows glutamate treatment of HT22 cells and primary cortical neuron cultures are triggered by the activation of neuronal 12-LOX (41.Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 1997; 19: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Because ERK can be activated by arachidonic acid metabolites (44.Dulin N., O.

We have recently shown that some of these proteins, such as Bcl-xL, Bax, and Bak, directly modulate the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and thus regulate apoptogenic cytochrome crelease and potential loss. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of VDAC regulation by Bcl-2 family proteins, an electrophysiological study was carried out. It was found that VDAC and pro-apoptotic Bax created a large pore, with conductance levels 4- and 10-fold greater than those of the VDAC and Bax channels, respectively. Although the VDAC and Bax channels both show ion selectivity and voltage-dependent modulation of their activity, the VDAC-Bax channel had neither of their properties. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and its BH4 oligopeptide completely closed the VDAC, in contrast to the Bax. Cytochromec passed through a single VDAC-Bax channel but not through the VDAC or Bax channel in a planar lipid bilayer. These data provide direct evidence that VDAC forms a novel large pore together with Bax.

Bcl-2 homology voltage-dependent anion channel 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid picosiemens Apoptosis is a tightly regulated cell death mechanism that is required for selective elimination of cells. Various apoptotic signals eventually converge to activate a family of cysteine proteases called caspases, which then cleave a critical set of cellular proteins to initiate apoptotic cell death. The Bcl-2 family of proteins is a well characterized regulator of apoptosis that acts upstream of caspase activation (1.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar, 2.Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). It consists of the following three distinct subfamilies: 1) anti-apoptotic members, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, with sequence homology at Bcl-2 homology 1 (BH1),1 BH2, and BH3 domains, and in most cases BH4 domain as well; 2) pro-apoptotic members, such as Bax and Bak, with sequence homology at BH1, BH2, and BH3; and 3) pro-apoptotic proteins that only share homology at the BH3 domain (BH3-only proteins), such as Bid, Bik, and Bim (1.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar, 2.Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). It has been shown that in addition to BH1 and BH2, the BH4 domain is required for anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and that the BH3 domain of the pro-apoptotic members is essential and, itself, sufficient for pro-apoptotic activity (1.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar, 2.Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 3.Green D.R.. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence has shown that the mitochondria play a crucial role in apoptosis by releasing the apoptogenic cytochrome c from the inter-membrane space into the cytoplasm (1.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar, 2.Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 3.Green D.R.. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once in the cytoplasm, cytochrome c activates a major apical caspase, caspase-9, in concert with Apaf-1 and dATP (or ATP), and the activated caspase-9 subsequently activates an effector caspase, caspase-3 (4.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 5.Thornberry N.A.. Lazebnil Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Bcl-2 family proteins regulate cytochrome crelease in isolated mitochondria: pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak induce cytochrome c release, whereas anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent the change (6.Jürgensmeier J.M.

Biochem. 1999; 260: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that some of the Bcl-2 family of proteins can bind directly to the VDAC and modulate its activity (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). VDAC is a mitochondrial outer membrane channel that usually functions as the pathway for the movement of various substances to and from the mitochondria (13.Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and it is considered a component of permeability transition pore complex that plays a role in permeability transition (14.Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M.. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 15.Zoratti M.. Szabó I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). Bax and Bak enhance VDAC activity, whereas Bcl-xL inhibits it (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar), although the regulatory mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. We have also shown that Bax and Bak induce the translocation of cytochromec through the VDAC in liposomes (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). To investigate the detailed mechanism of VDAC regulation by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, we employed electrophysiological techniques in the present study. Anti-human Bax (N20) polyclonal antibodies and anti-human VDAC (31HL) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), respectively. Anti-pigeon cytochrome c monoclonal antibodies (65971A), which cross-react with horse cytochrome c, were from PharMingen (Tokyo, Japan). Cy3-labeling kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Other chemicals were obtained from Wako Biochemicals (Osaka, Japan). Human Bax and its mutants were expressed as a His-tagged protein in Escherichia coli strain XL1-blue using the Xpress System (Invitrogen), as described elsewhere (7.Narita M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14681-14686Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Human Bcl-xL protein was expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins in E. coli strain DH5α and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column and was released from glutathione S-transferase by cleavage with thrombin (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). All purified proteins were finally suspended in buffer composed of 20 mm Hepes-K+ (pH 7.4) and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Mock control proteins were prepared using glutathioneS-transferase- and His-tagged proteins from empty vectors. Rat liver mitochondrial VDAC was purified as described previously (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). The electrophysiological study was performed as described previously (16.Yuto J. Ide T. Kasai M. Biophy. J. 1997; 72: 720-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, a planar lipid bilayer was formed across a 300-μm diameter aperture in a Teflon wall. The bilayer-forming solution contained asolectin (20 mg/mln-decane). The test protein (1 μg/ml) was added to one side (cis) of the bilayer, and the other side of the bilayer (trans) was grounded. The symmetrical solution contained 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3), and 0.1 mm CaCl2, except in the Bcl-xLexperiment, which was carried out at pH 5.5 to facilitate incorporation of Bcl-xL by the lipid membranes (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). The asymmetrical solution was made by changing the salt concentration to 500:100 mm NaCl (cis:trans). Both the cis andtrans compartments were connected by a KCl agar bridge to separate chambers with an AgCl2 electrodes. Data were acquired and analyzed using pClamp software (Axon Instruments). Purified VDAC (20 μg/ml) was incubated with rBaxΔC and rBaxΔBH3ΔC, and the mixtures were immunoprecipitated with anti-VDAC antibody (Calbiochem; 31HL) and with normal mouse IgG, as described previously (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of Bax was detected by Western blotting using anti-Bax antibody (Santa Cruz; N20). Horse cytochromec (1 mm) was labeled with Cy3 dye according to the manufacture's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-cytochrome c antibody (0.4 μg) was applied to a glass dish with a diameter of 5 mm for 1 h. After drying, 3% BSA (3 μl) was added. After 3 h, the indicated amount of Cy3-cytochromec or trans side solution was added for 1 h. After drying and washing with phosphate-buffered saline, samples were observed under a confocal fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, LSM410), and the fluorescence intensity was measured. Recently, we have shown that Bax and Bak enhance VDAC activity through direct binding with VDAC (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Enhancement of VDAC activity by Bax/Bak can be explained in the following three ways: 1) Bax/Bak enhances VDAC activity, 2) VDAC enhances Bax/Bak activity, or 3) Bax/Bak and VDAC produce a novel channel. As we previously showed that a VDAC inhibitor, polyanion, blocks Bax-mediated enhancement of VDAC activity (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar), the second possibility is rather unlikely. To obtain some insights into a channel formed by VDAC and Bax/Bak, we performed an electrophysiological study by measuring channel currents in a planar lipid bilayer system with symmetrical and asymmetrical salt solutions. BaxΔC, lacking the C-terminal 20 amino acids, has been shown to form an ion channel with weak cation selectivity and an elementary channel conductance (conductance is expressed by S = A (current)/V (voltage)) of 5.6 pS with long bursts of 26 and 250 pS in a planar lipid bilayer at neutral pH (17.Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Similar results were also observed by us (data not shown), although weak anion selectivity of the BaxΔC channel has been reported elsewhere (18.Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5113-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). We also found that highly purified full-length Bax (Fig.1 A) also formed an ion channel, which had its main elementary channel conductance below 20 pS with a long burst of 210 ± 20 pS (n = 5) in 0.1m NaCl at pH 7.2 (Fig. 1 B). The VDAC formed an ion channel with a single channel conductance of 600 ± 25 pS (n = 6) in 0.1 m NaCl (Fig. 1, Cand D), which was consistent with the previous observations of VDAC having a conductance of 4.5 nS in 1M KCl and 0.65 nS in 150 mm KCl (13.Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 20.Szabó I. Pinto V.D. Zoratti M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 21.Blachly-Dyson E. Zambronicz E.B., Yu, W.H. Adams V. McCabe E.R. Adelman J. Colombini M. Forte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1835-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Bathóri G. Szabó I. Schmehl I. Tombola F. Messina A. De Pinto V. Zoratti M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When Bax was added to the VDAC-incorporating planar lipid bilayer, a novel channel with a larger conductance was formed (Fig. 1 E), and it was never observed in the absence of Bax. The conductance values of the single large channel formed with VDAC and Bax were calculated to be 2.3 ± 0.1 nS (n = 8) in 0.1 m NaCl (Fig. 1,E and I), about 4- and 10-fold larger than those of the VDAC and the Bax channel, respectively. Interestingly, this channel was almost continuously in an open state below 50 mV (open duration, 44 h, and closed duration, 1.3 min, as determined from the data of 7 independent similar experiments) (Fig. 1, Eand F). Because a channel with a similar conductance was repeatedly generated only in the presence of both Bax and VDAC and because the channel conductance occasionally showed discrete changes, representing the transition from two VDAC-Bax channels (O1+ O1) to one channel (O1) and then back to two channels (O1 + O1) (Fig. 1 F), this 2.3 nS channel was not a nonspecific hole but a specific channel formed by the combination of Bax and VDAC. In some cases, we also observed a channel with another conductance of 1.8 ± 0.1 nS (n = 3) in the presence of Bax and VDAC (Fig. 1,G and H (O2)). Unlike the 2.3 nS channel, this channel with 1.8 nS conductance showed frequent current fluctuations (Fig. 1 G). The duration of the 1.8 nS channel (O2) observed was only 1.4 h, whereas the durations of the 2.3 nS single (O1) and double (O1 + O1) channels were 42.3 and 1.7 h, respectively. The nature of the 1.8 nS channel is still unknown, but it may represent another VDAC-Bax channel or sublevels of the VDAC-Bax channel. Because this 1.8 nS channel was not generated alone but only when the 2.3 nS channel was formed, the 4.1 nS channel (O1 + O2) may represent a different conductance state of the VDAC-Bax channel. Both the 2.3 and 1.8 nS channels were also observed when BaxΔC was added to VDAC and VDAC was added to the Bax channel (data not shown). Note that in the presence of VDAC, no formation of Bax channel was observed (discussed below). The VDAC-Bax channel showed significantly different properties from the VDAC and the Bax channel, as follows. As reported previously (13.Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar,20.Szabó I. Pinto V.D. Zoratti M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 21.Blachly-Dyson E.

Tombola F. Messina A. De Pinto V. Zoratti M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), VDAC activity was modulated by the membrane potential, with the channel almost continuously open below 30 mV, whereas it showed frequent opening and closing above 30 mV (Fig. 1 C). Bax channel activity was also reported to be enhanced when a negative potential was applied to the same cis side as the protein (17.Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). In contrast, VDAC-Bax channel activity was never affected by the membrane potential under the conditions studied (Fig. 1 F). To further characterize the VDAC-Bax channel, ion selectivity was assessed using asymmetrical NaCl solutions. The VDAC showed weak anion selectivity (Fig. 1 D) and the Bax channel showed cation selectivity (data not shown), consistent with previous reports (13.Colombini M. J. Membr.

Furthermore, a VDAC inhibitor, DIDS (23.Thinnes F.P. Florke H. Winkelbach H. Stadtmuller U. Heiden M. Karabinos A. Hesse D. Kratzin H.D. Fleer E. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24.Shoshan-Barmatz V. Hadad N. Feng W. Shafir I. Orr I. Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer L.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), did not influence the VDAC-Bax channel (data not shown), indicating that this channel had lost sensitivity to a VDAC inhibitor. These data indicated that the VDAC-Bax channel was substantially different from the Bax channel or VDAC and suggested that VDAC and Bax co-operated to form a functionally novel large pore. The BH3 region of Bax has been shown to be essential for the activity of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, including Bax and Bak (1.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar, 2.Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 3.Green D.R.. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, we previously showed that the BH3 region is essential for Bak-induced apoptotic mitochondrial changes (7.Narita M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14681-14686Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), as well as for Bax-induced enhancement of VDAC activity (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, rBaxΔBH3ΔC, which lacked both the BH3 region (amino acids 55–74) and the C-terminal 20 amino acids of Bax, bound to VDAC to the same extent as did BaxΔC but did not enhance VDAC activity in liposomes (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). These results suggested that Bax can bind to VDAC via another site besides BH3 and that VDAC is regulated via the BH3 region. To extend our studies, we also analyzed the channel properties of BaxΔBH3ΔC and the combination of BaxΔBH3ΔC and VDAC in planar lipid bilayers. As shown in Fig. 2 B, BaxΔBH3ΔC formed an ion channel with a primary conductance of 220 ± 10 pS (n = 3) in 0.1m NaCl, which was similar to that of the Bax channel (Fig.1 B). Like the Bax and BaxΔC channels, the BaxΔBH3ΔC channel showed weak cation selectivity and enhanced activity with a negative potential applied to the same cis side as the protein (data not shown). The only difference observed between the Bax and BaxΔBH3ΔC channels was in their opening probability: the Bax and BaxΔC channels showed fast opening and closing (Fig.1 B), whereas the BaxΔBH3ΔC channel tended to be continuously open below 50 mV (Fig. 2 B), being similar to the VDAC-Bax channel. Thus, the BH3 domain seems to play an important role in gating. The fact that BaxΔBH3ΔC, like Bax, could form an ion channel but could not effectively induce apoptosis might suggest that the pro-apoptotic activity of Bax is not dependent solely on its channel-forming ability. When BaxΔBH3ΔC was added to a VDAC-incorporating planar lipid bilayer, a larger conductance channel, such as the 2.3 nS VDAC-Bax channel, was not formed (n= 5) (Fig. 2 C), consistent with the observation that BaxΔBH3ΔC did not enhance VDAC activity in liposomes (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). The cooperativity of Bax mutants with VDAC parallels their pro-apoptotic activity, suggesting that the ability to form the VDAC-Bax channel underlies the pro-apoptotic ability of Bax. We also examined the effect of Bcl-xL on the VDAC in planar lipid bilayers. As previously shown (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar), VDAC activity is inhibited by addition of rBcl-xL. As shown in Fig.3 A, addition of rBcl-xL to the VDAC reduced the channel current to nearly zero in a planar lipid bilayer. Although it has been shown that Bcl-xL itself forms a channel (25.Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), Bcl-xL-specific channel was not observed. The lack of an observation of formation of Bcl-xL (Fig. 3 A) or Bax channels (Fig. 1 E) in the presence of VDAC was probably due to higher affinity of Bcl-xL and Bax to VDAC than lipid membranes. Surprisingly, the BH4 oligopeptide (corresponding to amino acids 4–23 of Bcl-xL), when added at a concentration slightly higher than that of rBcl-xL, almost completely inhibited VDAC activity in a planar lipid bilayer (Fig. 3 B), consistent with our previous observations with VDAC liposomes (26.Shimizu, S., Konishi, A., Kodama, T., and Tsujimoto, Y. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar). This activity was not observed with BH4 mutant oligopeptides or with an oligopeptide from the corresponding region of Bak (data not shown). These results indicated that Bcl-xL completely closed the VDAC and suggested that the BH4 domain, which has been shown to be essential for the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (27.Borner C.

EMBO J. 1998; 117: 1029-1039Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar), has an intrinsic ability to cause VDAC inhibition. Because we recently found that addition of Bax to VDAC-liposomes allows cytochrome c to pass through the liposome membranes (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar), we examined whether cytochrome c could pass through a single Bax-VDAC in a planar lipid bilayer. To measure the movement of cytochrome c through the Bax-VDAC, Cy3-labeled cytochromec was produced and was detected by binding to anti-cytochrome c antibody-coated dishes followed by spectrophotometric detection. As shown in Fig.4 A, the amount of Cy3-cytochrome c could be quantitatively measured from 105–1015 molecules. Cy3 itself was not detected even at 1020 molecules (data not shown). When Cy3-cytochrome c was added to the cis side of a VDAC-Bax-incorporating planar lipid bilayer at 30 mV, a significant increase of Cy3-cytochrome c was detected in solution on thetrans side in a time-dependent manner (Fig.4 B). Translocation of cytochrome c was roughly calculated to occur at 10 molecules/s/channel. During the assay, the VDAC-Bax channel was continuously open, and channel conductance remained unchanged (Fig. 4 C), excluding the possibility of physical rupture of the lipid bilayer in these experiments. In contrast, neither VDAC nor the Bax channel allowed Cy3-cytochromec translocation across a planar lipid bilayer (Fig.4 B). These results indicated that cytochrome ccould pass through a single VDAC-Bax channel. Here, we have shown that the combination of Bax and VDAC forms a large nonselective channel. This channel was substantially different from VDAC and the Bax channel in that it did not show voltage-dependent modulation of activity and ion selectivity, so the VDAC-Bax channel seems to possess a novel function. The molecular structure of the VDAC-Bax channel is still unknown, but it might be a composite channel. We have previously shown using a liposome system that a large channel through which cytochromec passes is formed only in the presence of both VDAC and Bax, even when the proteins are initially incorporated into the lipid membranes (12.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar), excluding the possibility that VDAC merely facilitates incorporation of Bax into a planar lipid bilayer to form a large Bax channel. The VDAC was reported to be 3 nm in diameter (19.Mannella C.A. Guo X.W. Dias J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which is similar to the size of cytochrome c. Because the pore size of the VDAC-Bax channel was 4-fold greater than that of the VDAC according to our electrophysiological data, the VDAC-Bax channel should be large enough for cytochrome c to pass through. Indeed, we were able to detect cytochrome c translocation through this channel. In contrast, neither VDAC nor the Bax channel allowed Cy3-cytochrome c translocation across a planar bilayer. There was no significant change of current through the channel even when cytochrome c passed through it, probably due to both the large pore size and the low rate of cytochrome ctranslocation. To completely understand the regulation of VDAC by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, elucidation of the molecular structure of the VDAC-Bax and VDAC-Bcl-xL channels is essential, but this awaits the three-dimensional structural analysis."

We recorded neuron activity in the anterior cingulate sulcus of macaques while they performed a sequential problem-solving task. By trial and error, animals determined the correct sequence for touching three fixed spatial targets. After the sequence was repeated three times, we then changed the correct solution order, requiring a new search. Irrespective of component movements or their kinematics, task-related neurons encoded the serial order of the sequence. Neurons activated with sequence components (68%) differed in activity between search and repetition. Search-related activity occurred when behavioral flexibility was required and ended as soon as the animal accumulated enough information to infer the solution, but had not yet tested it. Repetition-related activity occurred in a regime of memory-based motor performance in which attention to action is less necessary."

They act in concert with their regulatory subunits, the cyclins, to facilitate the cell cycle progression. The cell cycle regulatory machinery is controlled by both positive and negative regulators. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their cyclin partners are positive regulators or accelerators that help cell cycle progression. The recently characterized cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) are important negative regulators that act as brakes to stop cell cycle progression in response to regulatory signals (1Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Two families of CKIs have been characterized based on the specificity of interaction with CDKs and sequence homology. The CIP/KIP family, which shares homology at the N-terminal CDK inhibitory domain, includes p21CIP1/WAF1 (2Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D.

They interact with the cyclin·CDK complexes and inhibit the kinase activity of cyclin A-CDK2, cyclin D-CDK4, and cyclin E-CDK2. Overexpression of CIP/KIP inhibitors in cells can cause G1 arrest, suggesting that they preferentially target G1 cyclin·CDK complexes. The INK4 family includes p15 (INK4b) (10Hannon G.J. Beach D.

The INK4 family recognizes CDK4 and CDK6 but not CDK2 and may cause G1 arrest of the cell cycle by competing with cyclin D for binding with CDK4. Because the cell cycle regulatory machinery is such a complex system, it seems possible that more cell cycle regulators have yet to be discovered. Insights into the detailed regulation of the cell cycle machinery will help us understand the signals that render cells oncogenic. In order to understand the basic cell cycle regulatory machinery, we used an expression cloning method to search for CDK2-associated proteins and isolated a 14-3-3 protein. The 14-3-3 proteins comprise a family of highly conserved acidic proteins, and there are at least seven different mammalian isoforms. Several activities have been ascribed to these proteins, including signal transduction of Raf-1 (14Fantl W.J. Muslin A.J. Kikuchi A. Martin J.A. MacNicol A.M. Gross R.W. Williams L.T.

Sci. 1992; 17: 498-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism behind cell cycle regulation has remained elusive. First, 14-3-3 epsilon and 14-3-3 beta have been isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify proteins that interact with the human CDC25A and CDC25B phosphatases. They bind to CDC25 but do not affect the phosphatase activities of CDC25 (18Conklin D.S. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7892-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Second, in a yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify Wee1-associated proteins, the 14-3-3 zeta has been found to interact with the Wee1 kinase, which plays a key role in cell cycle progression by inactivating cyclin-dependent kinases (19Honda R. Ohba Y. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the binding of 14-3-3 zeta to Wee1 does not change the activity of Wee1 (19Honda R. Ohba Y. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Third, 14-3-3 has been shown to interact with polyoma middle T antigen (20Pallas D.C. Fu H. Haehnel L.C. Weller W. Collier R.J. Roberts T.M. Science. 1994; 265: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) involved in cell proliferation, but it remains to be elucidated how regulation of 14-3-3 protein contributes to the development of neoplasia. Fourth, in yeast, two checkpoint genes,rad24 and rad25, encode 14-3-3 protein homologues that together provide a function that is essential for cell proliferation (16Ford J.C. Al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Carr A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The roles of RAD24 and RAD25 in regulating the activity of Chk1 or CDC25 in determining the progression of mitosis in response to DNA damage are not all clear (21Chen L. Liu T.H. Walworth N.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Finally, 14-3-3 sigma (human mammary epithelial marker 1 or HME1) is expressed in epithelial cells, and its expression is dramatically low in human mammary carcinoma. However, its role in neoplastic formation is not understood (23Prasad G.L. Valverius E.M. McDuffie E. Cooper H.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 507-513PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, 14-3-3 sigma is induced by p53 in response to gamma irradiation and other DNA-damaging agents (24Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 sigma induction results in a G2 arrest through an uncharacterized mechanism (24Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Together, these observations imply that 14-3-3 proteins play important roles in cell cycle and that different 14-3-3 isoforms may bind to specific proteins for executing its biological function in cell cycle progression. Here, we describe the isolation, molecular cloning, and characterization of a CDK-associated protein 14-3-3 sigma. We show that 14-3-3 sigma could bind CDK2, CDC2, and CDK4 and emerges as a new class of CDK inhibitor. We prepared the FLAG-CDK2 following the procedure described before (8Lee M.H. Reynisdottir I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Briefly, a PCR-generated NdeI-BamHI fragment of the human CDK2 cDNA containing the full-length coding region was subcloned into pET21a (Novagen), yielding a construct that encodes CDK2 with a FLAG tag sequence. Recombinant FLAG-CDK2 carrying the heart muscle kinase phosphorylation site was phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase A with [γ-32P]ATP following the procedure previously described (25Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C. Skolnik E. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated CDK2 were used to screen a mouse 16-day embryonic library that is a T7 RNA polymerase-driven λEXlox mouse embryonic cDNA library (Novogen). At least 10 × 106 clones were screened. Several positive clones were sequenced, and one positive clone contained full-length c-DNA of mouse 14-3-3 sigma. A PCR-generated NdeI-BamHI fragment of the mouse 14-3-3 sigma cDNA containing the full-length coding region was subcloned into pET21a (Novagen) to yield a construct that encodes 14-3-3 sigma with a FLAG tag sequence. The protein was expressed in BL21(DE3), and FLAG-tagged proteins were prepared as described previously (8Lee M.H. Reynisdottir I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), except that proteins were immobilized on the beads without elution. Baculoviral proteins containing cyclins and CDKs were prepared by following the method described before (26Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cyclin D2 and CDK4 complex, cyclin B and CDC2 complex, or cyclin E and CDK2 complex was formed by preincubating in activating buffer (30 mmHEPES, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 40 mmphosphocreatine, 0.2 mg phosphocreatine kinase, 0.03 mmATP). A T7 RNA polymerase-driven pET vector containing the coding region of the mouse cyclin E or CDK2 cDNA was transcribed in vitro and translated using a TNT kit (Promega). These products were labeled with [35S]methionine. These complexes, CDK, or the products translated in vitro were then incubated with the immobilized FLAG-tagged 14-3-3 sigma. After extensive washing in Nonidet P-40/RIPA buffer, the retained protein complexes were resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The complexes were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by hybridization with CDK2 (PharMingen), CDK4 (PharMingen), and CDC2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) or by fluorography. MCF-7, HER-18, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-361 were kindly provided by Dr. Mien-Chi Hung and grown to 80% confluence. The cells were then infected with Ad-HME1 in serum-free media for 1 h. Complete media were added, and the cells were harvested 48 h later. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and quantified with a Bio-Rad kit following the conditions suggested by the manufacturer. Equal amounts of total protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK2 (1:1000) for 1 h followed by incubation with protein A beads for 30 min. After washing with lysis buffer, the proteins were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5, Babco). Immunocomplexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cells were infected with Ad-HME1 in serum-free media for 1 h. Complete medium was added, and the cells were harvested 48 h later. The cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and quantified. 500 μg of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK2 antibody (PharMingen) or anti-CDC2 antibody (PharMingen). The immunoprecipitates were assayed for histone H1 kinase activity as described previously (8Lee M.H. Reynisdottir I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). MCF-7, HER-18, and MDA-MB-361 cells were infected with either Ad-HME1 or Ad-β-galactosidase and compared with noninfected controls. The cells were harvested 48 h later, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and trypsinized. By using the cell counter, 3000 cells/well (96 well plate) were seeded for each cell line and type of infection. This was replicated 7 times for serial time point measurements. Starting the following day and continuing daily for a total of 7 days, 50 μl of 4.8 mm MTT was added per well for 2 h. The cells were lysed with 200 μl of 100% Me2SO, and the absorbance at 570 nm reading was obtained using the 96-well plate reader (Ceres UV900C, Bio-Tek instruments Inc.). The absorbance is directly proportional to the number of cells. A tridium-thymidine incorporation assay was performed using the same three cell lines and infection method as mentioned previously. Ten thousand cells per well were seeded for each cell line and type of infection in a 96-well plate. Six hours later, 0.2 μCi/well of tridium-thymidine was added and incubated for 16 h. Cells were lysed with 200 μl of 0.1 n KOH, and lysates were collected using the harvester (Tomtec). Tridium-thymidine incorporation was quantitated with the beta plate liquid scintillation counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Soft agar colony assays were performed on the same three cell lines and under the same infection conditions. The following day, 2000 cells per well mixed in a 0.35% agarose/complete media suspension were seeded onto 0.7% agarose/complete media bottom layer. Three weeks later, 100 μl per well of p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (1 mg/ml, Sigma) was added for 16 h before photographed. Indicated breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, HER-18, MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-468) were infected with or without Ad-HME1 (m.o.i. = 10). Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were sorted, and their DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry, all as described (7Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells (2 × 105) were seeded onto chamber slides (Nunc) and infected without or with Ad-HME1 (m.o.i. = 10). R1b/L17 cells were transfected with pCMV5 plasmid containing FLAG-tagged HME1, FLAG-tagged HME1 (NES), T7-tagged-CDK2, or with empty vector. FLAG-tagged-HME1 (NES) is the NES mutant with point mutations (I205A and L208A) at the NES sequence (STLIMQLLRDNLTLW). This mutant was constructed by PCR mutation. T7-tagged CDK2 was constructed by PCR cloning to contain the T7 gene 10 leader peptide tag sequence (MASTGGQQMG). Twenty-four hours after infection or transfection, 2 × 105 cells were seeded onto tissue culture chamber slide (Nunc). Two days later, cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1 v/v) and stained for 1 h with rabbit anti-CDK2, rabbit anti-CDC2 antibodies (Santa Crutz), mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma), or mouse anti-T7 monoclonal antibody (Novgen), followed by 30-min exposures to anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated or anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Cells were then incubated with 0.1 μg/ml of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma) to stain the nuclei. Immunofluorescence was detected using a BX50 Fluorescent microscope (Olympus). The mouse 14-3-3 sigma gene was identified during a search for CDK2-associated proteins using an expression cloning method to screen a mouse 16-day embryonic cDNA library (27Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K.

A GenBankTM search revealed that, at the amino acid level, one clone showed significantly high homology to human 14-3-3 sigma or HME1 (Human mammary epithelium marker 1) (23Prasad G.L. Valverius E.M. McDuffie E. Cooper H.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 507-513PubMed Google Scholar) and is the mouse ortholog of 14-3-3 sigma. The mouse 14-3-3 sigma (MME1) cDNA had an open reading frame of 744 base pairs, and it encodes a predicted protein of 248 amino acids. The human and mouse 14-3-3 sigma amino acid sequences are highly related, showing ∼96% identity (Fig. 1 A). Sequence analysis revealed an important feature of a leucine-rich nuclear exporting signal (NES) located at amino acids 202–216 (STLIMQLLRDNLTLW) that plays an important role in cell cycle regulation (22Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Since we identified mouse 14-3-3 sigma using CDK2 as a bait through expression cloning, we compared the cyclin-CDK binding domain of all the important cell cycle regulatory proteins, including p27KIP1, p57KIP2, p21CIP1, p107, p130, and found that there is a consensus cyclin-CDK binding sequence (ZRXL, where Z and X are basic amino acids) that can be deduced in these proteins as shown in Fig. 1 B. Structure determination of p27KIP1 has indicated that peptides around the ZRXL region are very critical for CDK binding (28Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Therefore, 14-3-3 sigma is likely to use this CDK binding motif to interact with various CDKs. To confirm further the binding of 14-3-3 sigma to cyclin-CDK2, recombinant FLAG-tagged 14-3-3 sigma protein was purified by M2 monoclonal antibody-Sepharose and used for in vitro biochemical binding assays. As shown in Fig. 2, 14-3-3 sigma can bind to CDK2, CDK4, cyclin A/CDK2, cyclin B/CDC2, cyclin E/CDK2, and cyclin D2/CDK4 specifically. 14-3-3 sigma also binds to in vitro translated cyclin E or CDK2. In order to confirm that 14-3-3 sigma interacts with CDK in vivo, we infected cells with recombinant adenovirus overexpressing HA-tagged 14-3-3 sigma, and we found that both CDC2 and CDK2 associated with 14-3-3 sigma, as demonstrated in the detection of CDK2 or CDC2 in the anti-HA immunoprecipitation complex (Fig. 3). Since CDKs are activated by their regulatory cyclins, we then tested the role of 14-3-3 sigma in this dynamic activating process. Affinity purified 14-3-3 sigma was used to test the binding character during the activating process of CDK2 by cyclin E. The data show that 14-3-3 sigma binds both active and inactive forms of CDK (Fig. 2 E). These results provide evidence that 14-3-3 sigma does not block CDK activation, which is different from KIP1. KIP1 binds preactive cyclin E·CDK2 complexes and prevents Thr160 phosphorylation and activation of CDK2 (7Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J.

Ad-HME1- and Ad-β-galactosidase-infected cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by anti-CDK2 or anti-CDC2 antibody (PharMingen), resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Babco) to observe the association between 14-3-3 sigma and CDK2 or CDC2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Most CDK-associated proteins can either negatively or positively regulate the activity of the CDKs. To investigate if 14-3-3 sigma can regulate the activity of the CDKs through protein association, we overexpressed 14-3-3 sigma in various cell lines by virus gene transfer (24Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), and we examined whether 14-3-3 sigma regulates the activity of CDKs. Recombinant 14-3-3 sigma adenovirus (Ad-HME1) was used to infect breast cancer cells under conditions in which the majority of the cell population was infected (m.o.i. = 10). The activity of both CDK2 and CDC2 was inhibited by the expression of 14-3-3 sigma as demonstrated in CDK2/CDC2-associated histone H1 kinase assays (Fig. 4). Also, immunoblotting bands demonstrate that when these cells were infected with Ad-HME1, HME1 associated with more than 95% of endogenous CDK2 or CDC2 as quantitated by PhosphorImager Imagequant program (data not shown), suggesting that 14-3-3 sigma can bind to most of the CDK2/CDC2 to inhibit their activities. All breast cancer cell lines tested were sensitive to the inhibitory activity of 14-3-3 sigma regardless of p53, Rb (retinoblastoma protein), or HER-2/neu status. These results provided evidence that 14-3-3 sigma can physically associate with CDKs and inhibit their activities. The inhibitory activity is also observed in a cell line with non-epithelial origin (NIH3T3) that does not express 14-3-3 sigma (data not shown). The fact that 14-3-3 sigma can inhibit CDK activity suggests that 14-3-3 sigma may inhibit cell proliferation by cell cycle arrest. To determine if 14-3-3 sigma could inhibit cell proliferation, we assessed its inhibitory effect by MTT assay (29Qiu Y. Ravi L. Kung H.J. Nature. 1998; 393: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis of several breast cancer cell lines infected with recombinant 14-3-3 sigma adenovirus by fluorescence-activated cell sorter demonstrated that 14-3-3 sigma has an effect on G2/M progression (TableI). Three breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-361, MCF7, and HER-18) were infected with recombinant 14-3-3 sigma adenovirus and assayed for live cells every 24 h. Overexpression of 14-3-3 sigma markedly decreased the viable cell number during a 7-day growth period as indicated by the decrease of A 570 reading (Fig.5 A). In a parallel virus infection assay, the cells infected with adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (Ad-β-galactosidase) grew normally as the cells that did not receive 14-3-3 sigma. Also, the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was reduced by half in cells infected with 14-3-3 sigma as compared with cells receiving no 14-3-3 sigma (Fig. 5 B). Collectively, these results suggest that 14-3-3 sigma overexpression can prevent cell proliferation.Table IEffect of Hme1 on cell cycle distribution% of cell cycleMCF-7MCF7 + Hme1HER-18HER18 + Hme14531-aMDA-MB-453 cells.4531-aMDA-MB-453 cells.+ Hme14681-bMDA-MB-468 cells.4681-bMDA-MB-468 cells.+ Hme1%%%%%%%%G17472797561516139S171214721232431G28167.51818251428Indicated breast cancer cell lines were infected with or without Ad-Hme1.

Two days after infection, cells were collected in a cell sorter and subjected to flow cytometry to analyze the cell cycle distribution according to DNA content. Percent distribution in different cell cycle compartment is indicated. 14-3-3 sigma was originally characterized as a molecule that was down-regulated in transformed breast carcinoma cell lines (23Prasad G.L. Valverius E.M. McDuffie E. Cooper H.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 507-513PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the activity of 14-3-3 sigma plays a pivotal role in the transformation. To evaluate the effect of 14-3-3 sigma on the transformation potency of the breast cancer cells, we performed the soft agar colony formation assays. As shown in Fig.6, breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and HER-18) that received recombinant 14-3-3 sigma adenovirus had a dramatic decrease in the number of colonies formed after 3 weeks (Fig.6). The cells infected with adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase showed almost the same number of colonies as the cells that did not receive 14-3-3 sigma. Taken together, our data indicated that the transformed phenotypes of breast cancer cells can be reversed by overexpression of 14-3-3 sigma. To support the hypothesis that interaction of 14-3-3 sigma and CDK proteins could have a physiological role, subcellular localization of these proteins was analyzed. As shown in Fig.7, 14-3-3 sigma caused a decrease in the nuclear staining for both CDK2 and CDC2 compared with the controls. These results indicate that 14-3-3 sigma can sequester CDK2 and CDC2 from the nucleus, thereby preventing the activity of CDK2 and CDC2. Because 14-3-3 sigma contains a leucine-rich nuclear exporting signal at amino acid residues 202–216 (Fig. 1), we determined whether the nuclear accumulation of CDK2/CDC2 is mediated by the nuclear exporting activity of 14-3-3 sigma. An NES mutant of 14-3-3 sigma was constructed by mutating the leucine-rich NES sequence with alanine (I205A and L208A). Immunolocalization studies showed that wt 14-3-3 sigma was detected in the cytoplasm, whereas the NES mutant of 14-3-3 sigma was mainly detected in the nucleus (Fig. 8,A and C). We also found that CDK2 is distributed in the cytoplasm in the presence of wt 14-3-3 sigma (Fig.8 G), but CDK2 remains in the nucleus when coexpressed with the NES mutant of 14-3-3 sigma (Fig. 8 I). CDK2 transfection was used as a control and was demonstrated as a nuclear protein (Fig.8 K). DAPI is used to stain the nuclei. These results demonstrated that the binding of 14-3-3 sigma to CDK can cause the sequestration of CDK2 and CDC2 into the cytoplasm, and the NES of 14-3-3 sigma is required for this biological function.Figure 814-3-3 sigma NES mutant cannot sequester CDK2 in the cytoplasm. R1b/L17 cells were transfected or co-transfected with indicated plasmids encoding wt HME1 (FLAG-HME1), HME1 NES mutant (FLAG-HME1 (NES)), or CDK2 (T7-CDK2). Empty vector transfection (CMV) was used as controls. After 48 h, cells were immunostained with anti-FLAG antibody for immunolocalization of HME1 (A, C, and E), or with anti-T7 antibody for immunolocalization of CDK2 (G, I, K, and M), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin. The location of nuclei was indicated by DAPI staining (B, D, F, H, J, L, and N).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a search for CDK2-associated proteins, we have identified a 14-3-3 protein, 14-3-3 sigma, that specifically associates with CDK2. 14-3-3 proteins are important and highly related dimeric factors found in eukaryotic organisms, including yeast, mammals, Drosophila, and plants (17Aitken A.

Expression of either type of Pex5p complements the impaired PTS1 import in Chinese hamster ovary pex5 mutants, but only Pex5pL can rescue the PTS2 import defect noted in a subgroup of pex5 mutants such as ZP105. In this work, we found that Pex5pL directly interacts with the PTS2 receptor Pex7p, carrying its cargo PTS2 protein in the cytosol. Pex5pL, but not Pex5pS, mediated the binding of PTS2 protein to Pex14p by translocating Pex7p, demonstrating that Pex5pL plays a pivotal role in peroxisomal PTS2 import. Pex5p was localized mostly in the cytosol in wild-type CHO-K1 and Pex14p-deficient mutant cells, whereas it accumulated in the peroxisomal remnants in cell mutants defective in Pex13p or the RING family peroxins such as Pex2p and Pex12p. Furthermore, overexpression of Pex14p, but not Pex10p, Pex12p, or Pex13p, caused accumulation of Pex5p in peroxisomal membranes, with concomitant interference with PTS1 and PTS2 import. Therefore, Pex5p carrying the cargoes most likely docks with the initial site (Pex14p) in a putative import machinery, subsequently translocating to other components such as Pex13p, Pex2p, Pex10p, and Pex12p."

The gene maps to the critical human tumor suppressor gene region in chromosome 3p21.3, showing very frequent allele loss and occasional homozygous deletions in lung, breast, and other cancers. The tissue distribution of α2δ-2 expression is different from α2δ-1, and α2δ-2 mRNA is most abundantly expressed in lung and testis and well expressed in brain, heart, and pancreas. In contrast, α2δ-1 is expressed predominantly in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. When co-expressed (via cRNA injections) with α1B and β3subunits in Xenopus oocytes, α2δ-2 increased peak size of the N-type Ca2+ currents 9-fold, and when co-expressed with α1C or α1G subunits in Xenopus oocytes increased peak size of L-type channels 2-fold and T-type channels 1.8-fold, respectively. Anti-peptide antibodies detect the expression of a 129-kDa α2δ-2 polypeptide in some but not all lung tumor cells. We conclude that the α2δ-2 gene encodes a functional auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Because of its chromosomal location and expression patterns, CACNA2D2 needs to be explored as a potential tumor suppressor gene linking Ca2+signaling and lung, breast, and other cancer pathogenesis.

They are formed by heteromultimeric complexes of α1, α2δ, β, and γ subunits. The α1 subunits contain the channel pore, voltage sensors, and the receptors for various classes of drugs and toxins (1.Perez-Reyes E. Schneider T. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1111-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). There are three families of α1 subunits: the L-type, Cav1, family, composed of α1S, α1C (Cav1.2), α1D, and α1F; the non-L-type high voltage-activated, or Cav2, family, which contains the P/Q-types encoded by α1A, the N-type encoded by α1B (Cav2.2), and R-types encoded by α1E; and the T-type family, or Cav3, encoded by α1G (Cav3.1), α1H, and α1I (2.Randall A. Benham C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 255-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The β subunit family is less diverse, with only four genes cloned so far (3.Castellano A. Perez-Reyes E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Co-expression studies have established two physiological roles of β subunits in high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels: they dramatically increase α1 expression at the plasma membrane, and they alter the biophysical properties of the channel currents. In general, β subunits have little effect on the expression of low voltage-activated currents (4.Dolphin A.C. Wyatt C.N. Richards J. Beattie R.E. Craig P. Lee J.-H. Cribbs L.L. Volsen S.G. Perez-Reyes E. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1999; 519: 35-45Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although only one γ and α2δ subunit have been characterized biochemically, recent evidence suggests that there may be additional members of these gene families (5.Letts V.A. Felix R. Biddlecome G.H.

The 175-kDa protein product is post-translationally cleaved to form disulfide-linked α2 and δ peptides, both of which are heavily glycosylated. Biochemical and mutation analysis supports a single transmembrane domain in the δ subunit that anchors the α2δ protein to the membrane (16.Brown J.P. Gee N.S. J. Biol.

In contrast to the β subunits that have a dramatic effect on gating of all high voltage-activated channel in many expression systems, the effects of α2δ-1 are more controversial, perhaps depending on the α1 subunit used or the expression system.

Birnbaumer L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1324-C1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α2δ-1 subunit has a high affinity binding site for the anti-epileptic drug gabapentin (16.Brown J.P. Gee N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25458-25465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Gabapentin has been shown to modestly inhibit (∼30%) neuronal Ca2+ currents, although it is unclear if this is its mechanism of action (24.Stefani A. Spadoni F. Bernardi G. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).We have been attempting to identify a new human tumor suppressor gene in chromosome region 3p21.3, where frequent allele loss and occasional homozygous deletions have been found in lung, breast, and other human tumors (25.Wei M.H.

Several genes in the region have been identified using positional cloning strategies. The sequence of one of the genes and its mRNA splicing variants in the region (α2δ-2; GenBank™ numbers AF040709, AF042792, and AF042793;CACNA2D2) showed extensive homology with the known calcium channel α2δ-1 subunit. We have studied the tissue distribution of expression of this new α2δ-2 gene and tested the function of the gene product in Xenopus oocytes by coexpressing α2δ-2 cRNAs along with a representative member of the three families of calcium subunit α1 subunits. We find a pattern of expression different from the other α2δ subunit, whereas the α2δ-2 enhances the activity of the calcium subunit α1 subunits.DISCUSSIONThis study describes the cloning and functional properties of a novel α2δ subunit of voltage-gated Ca2+channels. The gene (CACNA2D2) was discovered by positional cloning while searching for a lung cancer tumor suppressor gene. GenBank™ deposits AF040709 and AF042792 represent alternatively spliced forms (in the 5′-untranslated region) with the same conceptual 1,145-amino acid sequence. GenBank™ deposit AF042793 represents another 5′ alternatively spliced form uncommonly found in lung cDNA clones resulting in an open reading frame beginning at the second 5′ methionine at codon 70 and, thus, resulting in a deletion of the 70 N-terminal amino acids found in the common α2δ-2 form studied here. Sequences were deposited in the GenBank™ to stimulate research on its function. Klugbauer et al. (7.Klugbauer N. Lacinova L. Marais E. Hobom M. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 684-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cloned another related α2δ subunit, then proposed the following nomenclature: α2δ-1, for the original α2δ cloned from skeletal muscle; α2δ-2, for the protein described herein, and α2δ-3, for their novel sequence. Similarly the genes will be referred to asCACNA2D1, CACNA2D2, and CACNA2D3, respectively (38.Lory P. Ophoff R.A. Nahmias J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 100: 149-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). While this paper was in preparation, an α2δ-2 clone (KIAA0558, GenBank™ number AB011130) was independently isolated by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute from human brain as part of large scale anonymous cDNA sequencing efforts (39.Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The present study reports on the expression of theCACNA2D2 gene in human tissues and on electrophysiological studies that show it can modulate the expression of functional Ca2+ channels.Expression of the CACNA2D2 gene was determined by Northern analysis. It was most highly expressed in lung and testis, well expressed in brain, heart, and pancreas, and expressed to a lower extent in skeletal muscle and prostate. Our results do not agree with those of Klugbauer et al. (7.Klugbauer N. Lacinova L. Marais E. Hobom M. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 684-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who found abundant cross-reactive material from what they reported to be α2δ-2 in mRNA from skeletal muscle, pancreas, and heart, with hardly any signal from lung. We feel our expression pattern is the correct one since we had performed four independent Northern blot analysis using four probes including one (nt 2729–3293) that is very similar to the probe that Klugbauer et al. (7.Klugbauer N. Lacinova L. Marais E. Hobom M. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 684-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used (nucleotides 2877–3249).The result of our cDNA screening also supports the high expression of α2δ-2 in lung, since we obtained 120 α2δ-2 clones from a screening of 1 million clones of a lung cDNA library. A possible explanation for the discrepancy could be that their probe cross-reacted with α2δ-1, since it has an expression pattern very similar to what they reported for α2δ-2 (40.Angelotti T. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is unlikely that α2δ-2 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, because α2δ proteins were purified from that tissue, and only the sequence of α2δ-1 was detected (13.Ellis S.B. Williams M.E. Ways N.R. Brenner R. Sharp A.H. Leung A.T. Campbell K.P. McKenna E. Koch W.J. Hui A. et al.Science. 1988; 241: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar).The tissue distribution of mRNA for the three α2δ subunits is very different (7.Klugbauer N. Lacinova L. Marais E. Hobom M. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 684-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Angelotti T. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All three genes are expressed in brain, which is the only tissue that expresses α2δ-3. The α2δ-1 gene is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, where we find little or no expression of α2δ-2. Both α2δ-1 and -2 are expressed in heart. The α2δ-2 gene is highly expressed in lung where the expression of α2δ-1 is low. It will be important to determine what cells in the lung express α2δ-2; however, we have shown that several lung cancers representing different lung epithelial types can express α2δ-2, so that presumably some normal lung epithelial cells also express α2δ-2. In this regard, it is also interesting to note that α1C was cloned from lung cDNA libraries (19.Biel M. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hullin R. Stuhmer W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and L-type currents have been characterized from tracheal smooth muscle (41.Welling A. Felbel J. Peper K. Hofmann F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L351-L359PubMed Google Scholar). The only β subunit detected in lung mRNA is β2 (3.Castellano A. Perez-Reyes E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, the minimum subunit composition of lung L-type channels can be deduced as α1Cα2δ-2β2.The possible role of α2δ-2 as a Ca2+channel subunit was examined using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. We tested for an effect on currents using three α1 subunits. The α1 subunits were chosen to represent each of the three subfamilies of Ca2+ channels: Cav1.2 or α1C, Cav2.2 or α1B, and a low voltage-activated channel Cav3.1 or α1G. In each case, α2δ-2 was able to stimulate functional expression. No effect was observed on the biophysical properties of the current, suggesting that α2δ-2 simply increased the number of functional channels at the plasma membrane. Similar results were obtained with α2δ-1 on the expression of α1G in both COS cells andXenopus oocytes (4.Dolphin A.C. Wyatt C.N. Richards J. Beattie R.E. Craig P. Lee J.-H. Cribbs L.L. Volsen S.G. Perez-Reyes E. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1999; 519: 35-45Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Coexpression studies of α2δ-2 plus α1B also included the β3 subunit. In these experiments we observed the largest stimulatory effect on expression. Some studies report a synergistic action of α2 and β on α1B expression (17.Brust P.F. Simerson S. Mccue A.F. Deal C.R. Schoonmaker S. Williams M.E. Velicelebi G. Johnson E.C. Harpold M.M. Ellis S.B. Neuropharmacology. 1993; 32: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The experiments with α1C did not include a β subunit because they stimulate current so much already that it has been difficult to see any effect of α2δ at the whole cell level (18.Wei X. Pan S. Lang W. Kim H. Schneider T. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27106-27111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Interest in the physiological roles of Ca2+ channels has increased due to findings that mutations in their genes can lead to human diseases (42.Lehmann-Horn F. Jurkat-Rott K. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1317-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In addition, defects in the auxiliary subunits of Ca2+ channels have been described in mouse models of absence epilepsy. These include mouse strains that have lost the expression of β4 and the recently discovered γ2 subunit (5.Letts V.A. Felix R. Biddlecome G.H. Arikkath J. Mahaffey C.L. Valenzuela A. Bartlett II F.S. Mori Y. Campbell K.P. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 43.Burgess D.L. Jones J.M. Meisler M.H. Noebels J.L. Cell. 1997; 88: 385-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In this regard, after we clonedCACNA2D2 we noted with great interest that the syntenic region in the mouse (mouse chromosome 9, 59.0–60.0 centimorgan) contains the mouse mutant ducky and also 4 other flanking genes (CISH, GNAI2, GNAT, and HYAL1) that we have identified in our ∼600-kb region (25.Wei M.H. Latif F. Bader S. Kashuba V. Chen J.Y. Duh F.M. Sekido Y. Lee C.C. Geil L. Kuzmin I. Zabarovsky E. Klein G. Zbar B. Minna J.D. Lerman M.I. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1487-1492PubMed Google Scholar) and deposited as GenBank™ numbers AF132297 for CISH and U03056 forHYAL1. Our partial mouse cDNA sequence is 92% identical to the human α2δ-2 sequence (GenBank™ number AF169633.1). In fact, preliminary evidence suggests that loss of α2δ-2 expression leads to the epileptic phenotype, ducky (44.Barclay J. Kusumi K. Lander E. Perez-Reyes E. Frankel W. Gardiner M. Rees M. Epilepsia. 1999; 40: 137Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Histological examination of mouse ducky mutants reveals atrophy of the cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord (45.Meier H. Acta Neuropathol. 1968; 11: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These mice develop a spike-and-wave phenotype in the electroencephalogram, which is similar to that observed in absence epilepsy patients. Thus, it will be of great interest to see if inherited defects in CACNA2D2also occur in humans (46.Noebels J.L. Malafosse A. Genton P. Hirsch E. Marescaux D. Broglin D. Bernasconi R. Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsies: Clinical, Experimental, and Genetic Aspects. John Libbey & Co. Ltd., London1994: 215-225Google Scholar). It remains to be determined how these Ca2+ channel defects lead to these epileptic phenotypes.We began these studies searching for a human lung cancer tumor suppressor gene. The specific 600-kb 3p21.3 chromosome region within which the CACNA2D2 gene resides is a site of homozygous deletions occurring in lung and breast cancer and is a frequent target region for allele loss occurring very early in the pathogenesis of lung and other cancers (25.Wei M.H. Latif F. Bader S. Kashuba V. Chen J.Y. Duh F.M. Sekido Y. Lee C.C. Geil L. Kuzmin I. Zabarovsky E. Klein G. Zbar B. Minna J.D. Lerman M.I. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1487-1492PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Sekido Y. Ahmadian M. Wistuba II, Latif F. Bader S. Wei M.H. Duh F.M. Gazdar A.F. Lerman M.I. Minna J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3151-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 48.Sekido Y. Fong K. Minna J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F21-F59PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Wistuba I. Behrens C. Milchgrub S. Bryant D. Hung J. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, we are also studyingCACNA2D2 for mutations, expression alterations, and functional characteristics of a tumor suppressor gene in these cancers. In this regard we were interested to see its high expression in normal lung tissue and in some but not all lung cancer cell lines. A clinical connection between voltage-dependent calcium channels and lung cancer is well established by the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, seen in some small cell lung cancer patients (50.Takamori M. Intern. Med. 1999; 38: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a human autoimmune disorder that impairs neuromuscular transmission such that patients with this syndrome have a defect in the Ca2+-dependent quantal release of acetylcholine from motor nerve terminals (51.O'Neill J.H. Murray N.M. Newsom-Davis J. Brain. 1988; 111: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In this syndrome patients develop antibodies (presumably initiated by expression of the channel proteins in their small cell lung cancer) that react with voltage-gated calcium channel polypeptides that block depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx, leading to the myasthenia (52.Lennon V.A. Kryzer T.J. Griesmann G.E. O'Suilleabhain P.E. Windebank A.J. Woppmann A. Miljanich G.P. Lambert E.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 53.Raymond C.

Dalmau J. Muscle Nerve. 1999; 22: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this report we have seen α2δ-2 to functionally interact with the T-type channel subunit α1G. Thus, it was of great interest to us when Toyota et al. (55.Toyota M. Ho C. Ohe-Toyota M. Baylin S.B. Issa J.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4535-4541PubMed Google Scholar) reported that CACNA1G encoding this subunit could have its expression inactivated by aberrant methylation of its 5′ CpG island in human tumors such as colorectal cancers, gastric cancers, and acute myelogenous leukemias. CACNA1G maps to chromosome region 17q21, another site of frequent allele loss in human cancer. Such acquired CpG island methylation in promoter regions of cancer cells as an acquired abnormality silencing genes such as tumor suppressor genes is well described (56.Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Vertino P.M. Issa J.P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 141-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57.Schmutte C. Jones P.A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated calcium channels including T-type channels and intracellular calcium signaling plays a role in apoptosis (58.Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). In addition, platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated calcium influx changed during transformation of mouse C3H 10T1/2 fibroblasts accompanied by a marked reduction in expression of T-type calcium channels (59.Estacion M. Mordan L.J. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, the inactivation of voltage-gated calcium channel subunits such as CACNA2D2 andCACNA1G by any of several means merit serious consideration as an important step in cancer pathogenesis. Electrophysiological and molecular cloning studies have revealed an incredible diversity of voltage-gated calcium channels. They are formed by heteromultimeric complexes of α1, α2δ, β, and γ subunits. The α1 subunits contain the channel pore, voltage sensors, and the receptors for various classes of drugs and toxins (1.Perez-Reyes E. Schneider T. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1111-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). There are three families of α1 subunits: the L-type, Cav1, family, composed of α1S, α1C (Cav1.2), α1D, and α1F; the non-L-type high voltage-activated, or Cav2, family, which contains the P/Q-types encoded by α1A, the N-type encoded by α1B (Cav2.2), and R-types encoded by α1E; and the T-type family, or Cav3, encoded by α1G (Cav3.1), α1H, and α1I (2.Randall A. Benham C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 255-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The β subunit family is less diverse, with only four genes cloned so far (3.Castellano A. Perez-Reyes E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Co-expression studies have established two physiological roles of β subunits in high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels: they dramatically increase α1 expression at the plasma membrane, and they alter the biophysical properties of the channel currents. In general, β subunits have little effect on the expression of low voltage-activated currents (4.Dolphin A.C. Wyatt C.N. Richards J. Beattie R.E. Craig P. Lee J.-H. Cribbs L.L. Volsen S.G. Perez-Reyes E. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1999; 519: 35-45Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although only one γ and α2δ subunit have been characterized biochemically, recent evidence suggests that there may be additional members of these gene families (5.Letts V.A. Felix R. Biddlecome G.H. Arikkath J. Mahaffey C.L. Valenzuela A. Bartlett II F.S. Mori Y. Campbell K.P. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 6.Black III, J.L. Lennon V.A.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 684-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The γ1 subunit was shown to be part of the skeletal muscle L-type channel (8.Sharp A.H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2816-2825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); coexpression studies have indicated that it aids in the formation of L-type channels, as assayed by dihydropyridine binding (9.Suh-Kim H. Wei X. Klos A. Pan S. Ruth P. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. Receptors & Channels. 1996; 4: 217-225PubMed Google Scholar), and may play a role in channel inactivation (10.Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The α2δ subunit (α2δ-1) was first identified in biochemical studies of skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channels (reviewed in Ref. 1.Perez-Reyes E. Schneider T. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1111-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Using antibodies, it has also been shown to be part of the cardiac L-type and neuronal N-type channels (11.Schmid A. Barhanin J. Coppola T. Borsotto M. Lazdunski M.

Although they play a key role in adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, or glucose homeostasis regulation, recent studies suggested that they might be involved in the inflammation control and especially in the modulation of the cytokine production. This strongly suggests that these transcriptional factors could modulate the deleterious effects of interleukin-1 (IL-1) on cartilage. However, to date, their presence in cartilage has never been investigated. By quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry analysis, we demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of PPARα, PPARγ, and RORα in rat cartilage, at both mRNA and protein levels. Comparatively, the PPARα mRNA content in cartilage was much lower than in the liver but not significantly different to that of the adipose tissue. PPARγ mRNA expression in cartilage was weak, when compared with adipose tissue, but similar to that found in the liver. RORα mRNA levels were similar in the three tissues. mRNA expression of the three nuclear receptors was very differently modulated by IL-1 or mono-iodoacetate treatments. This indicates that they should be unequally involved in the effects of IL-1 on chondrocyte, which is in accordance with results obtained in other cell types. Indeed, we showed that 15d-PGJ2 mainly, but also the drug troglitazone, that are ligands of PPARγ could significantly counteract the decrease in proteoglycan synthesis and NO production induced by IL-1. By contrast, PPARα ligands such as Wy-14,643 or clofibrate had no effect on this process. Therefore, the presence of PPARγ in chondrocytes opens up new perspectives to modulate the effects of cytokines on cartilage by the use of specific ligands.

Mc Carthy D.J. Koopman W.J. Arthritis and Allied Conditions. 12th Ed. Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia1993: 279-333Google Scholar). Its progressive destruction, which results from an imbalance between the anabolic and catabolic processes, is a common feature of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (OA).1 Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) have been shown to inhibit the synthesis of cartilage components and to promote their degradation by activating metalloproteases (2.Arend W.P. Dayer J.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 33: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 3.Arend W.P. Dayer J.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Concurrently to these effects, they induce the production by chondrocytes of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, nitric oxide (NO), and other reactive oxygen species (4.Lotz M. Blanco F.J. von Kempis J. Dudler J. Maier R. Villiger P.M. Geng Y. J. Rheumatol. Suppl. 1995; 43: 104-108PubMed Google Scholar). To date, most of the drugs marketed as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids are unable to prevent cartilage damage (5.Dingle J.T. J. Rheumatol. 1991; 18: 30-37Google Scholar). Thus, intense investigations are carried out to precise the transduction pathways that impair cartilage homeostasis in order to find new strategies that would be helpful to prevent cartilage destruction. In this way, much interest was recently focused on three transcriptional factors that belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily and are closely related to the thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors: (i) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), (ii) PPARγ, and (iii) retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor/retinoid Z receptor α (ROR/RZRα) (6.Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 7.Carlberg C. Wiesenberg I. J. Pineal Res. 1995; 18: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Upon interaction with specific ligands, they bind to DNA response elements and control the transcription of genes mainly involved in lipid metabolism and in the glucose homeostasis regulation (8.Schoonjans K. Martin G. Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin Lipidol. 1997; 8: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 9.Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). PPARs heterodimerize with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor, also called retinoid X receptor, and bind with preference to response elements with spacing of one nucleotide between hexameric direct repeats (10.Palmer C.N.A.

ROR/RZRα belongs to those nuclear receptors that bind DNA as a monomer (12.Becker-André M. André E. DeLamarter J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In addition to their classical role, recent studies showed that they were also involved in inflammation control and, especially, in modulating cytokine production. Thus, a wide range of agonists of PPARγ, such as 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) or drugs of the thiazolidinedione class, have been shown to strongly inhibit the production of TNFα, IL-1 and IL-6 by activated human monocytes (14.Jiang C.

A related study was performed with murine macrophages and the activation of PPARγ inhibited the transcriptional induction of genes such as TNFα, inducible NO synthase, and gelatinase B by inflammation agents (16.Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3227) Google Scholar,17.Colville-Nash P.R. Qureshi S.S. Willis D. Willoughby D.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 978-984PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, in aortic smooth muscle cells, it was reported that PPARα ligands (Wy-14,643), and not PPARγ ligands, inhibited IL-1-induced production of interleukin-6 and prostaglandin and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (18.Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.-C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of PPARα by the potent pro-inflammatory mediator leukotriene B4 (LTB4) enhanced degradation of this eicosanoid, suggesting a new aspect of down-regulation of inflammation (19.Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Thus, the use of PPARα knock-out mice has demonstrated that inflammation due to either arachidonic acid or LTB4, was prolonged in these animals as compared with controls (19.Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 20.Gonzalez F.J. Biochimie. 1997; 79: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The authors proposed that PPARα would constitute a promising therapeutic target in disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. RORα gained special attention in the field of inflammation through the finding that the pineal gland hormone melatonin, a ligand of this receptor, was able to repress the expression of 5-lipoxygenase in human B cells, a key enzyme in allergic and inflammatory reactions (21.Steinhilber D. Brungs M. Werz O. Wiesenberg I. Danielsson C. Kahlen J-P. Nayeri S. Schräder M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7037-7040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 22.Carlberg C. Wiesenberg I. J. Pineal Res. 1995; 18: 171-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a correlation between activation of RORα by drugs belonging to the thiazolidinediones and inhibition of rat adjuvant arthritis has been shown, suggesting a key role of this nuclear receptor in mediating the antiarthritic effects of these compounds (23.Missbach M. Jagher B. Sigg I. Nayeri S. Carlberg C. Wiesenberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13515-13522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24.Wiesenberg I. Chiesi M. Missbach M. Spanka C. Pignat W. Carlberg C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1131-1138PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that PPARα, PPARγ, or RORα would be of great interest in preventing cartilage damages by modulating the effects of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNFα). However, to our knowledge, the presence of these receptors has never been demonstrated in cartilage. As the equilibrium between anabolic and catabolic processes is under the control of chondrocytes, the main objective of the present work was to check the presence of PPARα, PPARγ, and RORα in cartilage, at the mRNA and the protein levels. Furthermore, by evaluating variations of their mRNA expression, we examined if the receptors might be involved in the chondrocyte signaling pathway of IL-1β and of mono-iodoacetate (MIA). The role of IL-1β in proteoglycan synthesis suppression and in proteoglycan and collagen degradation has been well established (3.Arend W.P. Dayer J.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), whereas MIA is known to disturb chondrocyte metabolism and to rapidly induce OA-like lesions in cartilage (25.Guingamp C. Gegout-Pottie P. Philippe L. Terlain B. Netter P. Gillet P. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1670-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Moreover, as IL-1β, this compound has an inhibitory effect on proteoglycan anabolism in cartilage. Finally, by activating PPARα or PPARγ with specific ligands, we evaluated their possible implication in modulating the effects of IL-1β on chondrocytes at the level of proteoglycan anabolism and NO production. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of PPARα, PPARγ, and RORα in rat cartilage, at both mRNA and protein levels. We further showed that mRNA expression of the three nuclear receptors was differently modulated by IL-1 and by MIA. Furthermore, we found that PPARγ ligands, and not PPARα ligands, could significantly counteract the decrease in proteoglycan synthesis and NO production induced by IL-1β. This suggests that PPARγ could be a new potential target to modulate the effects of cytokines on cartilage and/or to limit their production by chondrocytes themselves. Normal articular cartilage was obtained from Wistar male rats (130–150 g, Charles River) killed under dissociative anesthesia (ketamine (Rhône-Mérieux) and acepromazine (Sanofi SantéAnimale)). After joint surgery, articular cartilage pieces were aseptically dissected from femoral head caps and chondrocytes were obtained by sequential digestion with Pronase and collagenase B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (26.Kuettner K.E. Pauli B.U. Gall G. Memoli V.A. Schenk R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The cells were washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured to confluence in 25-cm2 flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The medium used was DMEM/Ham's F-12 supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), gentamicin (50 μg·ml−1), amphotericin B (0.5 μg·ml−1), and heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (10%) (Life Technologies, Inc.). All experiments reported here were performed with primary or first passage chondrocytes, 8–12 days after collagenase treatment. To perform anabolism measurements, chondrocytes were also cultured in alginate beads according to the method of Haüselmann et al. (27.Haüselmann H.J. Aydelotte M.B. Schumacher B.L. Kuettner K.E. Gitelis S.H. Thonar E.J.M.A. Matrix. 1992; 12: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in sterile filtered low viscosity alginate (1.2%, w/v) (from Macrocystis pyrifera, Sigma) at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells·ml−1 and slowly expressed through a 22-gauge needle into a 102 mm CaCl2 solution. After instantaneous gelation, the beads were incubated in CaCl2 solution for 15 min and washed two times in 0.15m NaCl and then in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium. The beads were finally maintained in complete culture medium for 6 days in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C before further experiments. 12 h before the treatments, complete medium was replaced by serum-free medium. Chondrocyte monolayer cultures were then treated with MIA (1·10−5m or 5·10−5m, Sigma) for 1 h or rhIL-1β in the range of 0–250 units·ml−1 for different periods: (i) 1 h, (ii) 12 h, and (iii) 1 h followed by 11 h of incubation with IL-1-free medium. Immediately after the treatments, the medium was removed and cell cultures were carefully washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Total RNA was isolated by a single-step guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was also extracted from cartilage, liver, and white adipose tissue from a healthy rat. RNA was recovered in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and quantified by spectrophotometry at 260/280 nm, and its integrity was assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (ratio of ribosomal 28 S versus 18 S). All RNA preparations were incubated in the presence of RNase-free DNase (Promega) in order to avoid possible amplification from contaminating genomic DNA. Expression of rat PPARα, PPARγ, and RORα mRNA was assayed using a quantitative multistandard RT-PCR method described in detail elsewhere (28.Khiri H. Reynier P. Peyrol N. Lerique B. Torresani J. Planells R. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1996; 10: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that takes advantage of both interest gene and β-actin sequence conservation between animal species. This protocol allowed us to normalize the amounts of nuclear receptor with regard to that of β-actin mRNA in each sample. Briefly, total RNA samples extracted from rat cells were mixed with a constant amount of total RNA prepared from mouse liver, which brought both competitive mouse β-actin and interest gene sequences and thus acted as a multistandard source. The mixture was reverse-transcribed using hexamer random primers. Separate PCRs for PPARα, PPARγ, RORα, and β-actin amplifications were then undertaken with oligonucleotide primers that are able to hybridize with rat and mouse sequences with the same efficiency. For each gene, preliminary kinetic experiments were performed in order to determine the number of cycles allowing to be in the exponential phase of amplification. To date, the coding sequence for rat RORα is not available in the GenBank data base. Thus, the primers for RORα amplification were chosen thanks to the recent publication of a partial nucleotide sequence of a rat RORα cDNA fragment (29.Koibuchi N. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2335-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PCR primers used were PPARα (419-bp product): sense, 5′-AGAGCATGGTGCCTTCGC-TGATGCE-3′; antisense, 5′-CAGTACATGTCTCTGTAGATCTCTTGC-3′ (31 cycles, annealing temperature (AT) = 60 °C); PPARγ (525-bp product): sense, 5′-ATAAAGTC-CTTCCCGCTGACCAAAGCC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCGGTCTCCACTGAGAATAATGAC-AGC-3′ (31 cycles, AT = 60 °C); PPARγ-2 (593-bp product): sense, 5′-AGAGCATG-GTGCCTTCGCTGATGC-3′; antisense, 5′-AACCTGATGGCATTGTGAGACATCC-3′ (31 cycles, AT = 62 °C); RORα (277-bp product): sense, 5′-CAGTCGGGAATGGA-CATCAATGG-3′; antisense, 5′-ACCTCTCTCTGCTTGTTCTGGTAGT-3′ (31 cycles, AT = 58 °C); β-actin (569-bp product): sense, 5′-CATGCCATCCTGCGTCTGGACC-3′; antisense, 5′-TACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3′ (30 cycles, AT = 62 °C). Each amplification product was then distinguished by restriction site polymorphism between the two species. The rat PPARα product was digested by MspI (Life Technologies, Inc.), while the mouse product remained uncut. In the same way, the mouse PPARγ product was digested by StyI, the mouse PPARγ-2 product was digested by StuI, the mouse RORα product was digested by RsaI, and the mouse β-actin product was digested by XbaI while the product of the other species remained, respectively, uncut. Amplification products were then resolved by electrophoresis in a 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel, stained by ethidium bromide (0.5 μg·ml−1), and photographed under UV light by a computer-assisted camera (Panasonic). Quantification of each band was performed by densitometry analysis software (NIH Image), and results were expressed as the ratio (generat/genemouse) × (β-actinmouse/β-actinrat) in arbitrary units. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's unpairedt test (*, p < 0.05) from the mean ± S.D. of at least three experiments. Immunoblotting analysis of PPARα, PPARγ, and RORα was performed on chondrocytes treated or not with rhIL-1β for 12 h. Briefly, harvested cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 170 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold buffer (25 mm HEPES, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), vigorously mixed and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cell extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and protein concentration was determined in the supernatant. 50 μg of proteins from each sample were mixed with gel loading buffer (50 mmTris, 10% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mg of bromphenol blue) in a volume ratio of 1:1, boiled for 3 min, and electrophoresed on a discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4% stacking gel and 10% separative gel). The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), which was saturated by incubation for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were then incubated either with (1:1000) anti-rabbit PPARα, (1:2500) anti-rabbit PPARγ or (1:1000) anti-goat RORα antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. They were further washed three times with Tris-buffered saline/Tween and then incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-goat immunoglobulins (IgG) coupled to peroxidase (1:20,000; Interchim). The immunocomplexes were visualized by the ECL method (Interchim). Each blot has been re-probed with β-actin in order to assure equal loading of the gel for the control and the corresponding extract of IL-1-treated cells. Cell layers were fixed in 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized in methanol for 20 min at 4 °C. They were then exposed to the primary antibody (diluted 1:500 for anti-PPARα, 1:2000 for anti-PPARγ-2, and 1:250 for anti-RORα antibodies in PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C. After two washes in PBS, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (diluted 1:100 in PBS), either fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (for PPARα and PPARγ-2) or donkey anti-goat IgG (for RORα), for 30 min at 37 °C. Negative controls were performed by replacing the primary antibody with preimmune serum. Cells were then mounted in Vectashield medium and photographed with a Polyvar microscope (Reichert-Jung, Vienna, Austria). The ligands were tested on chondrocytes encapsulated in alginate beads in the presence of rhIL-1β at 25 units·ml−1. This concentration was chosen because we previously found that it corresponded to the middle range of the concentration-response curve for proteoglycan synthesis inhibition and NO production (30.Cipolletta C. Jouzeau J.-Y. Gegout-Pottie P. Presle N. Bordji K. Netter P. Terlain B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 1719-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The ligands were added to cells simultaneously or 1 h before the addition of rhIL-1β (31.Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Van Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 4668-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), as Me2SO solutions with the final concentration of Me2SO never exceeding 0.1%. The following ligands were tested: troglitazone (at 1 and 10 μm), 15d-PGJ2 (at 1 and 10 μm), Wy-14,643 (at 25 and 250 μm), clofibrate (at 50 and 500 μm), and LTB4 (at 1 and 10 μm). To date, no ligand for RORα is commercially available. At the end of the treatment (24 h), the supernatants were collected for the nitrite assay (see below). The alginate beads were incubated in complete DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium containing only 2% fetal calf serum with 10 μCi·ml−1 radiolabeled sodium sulfate (Na235SO4) for 4 h at 37 °C. Alginate beads were washed five times with 0.15 mNaCl and solubilized in a 55 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.8) with 20 mm EDTA. Cells were digested overnight at 60 °C in 0.2 m NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.3) containing 0.01 m EDTA, 0.01 m cysteine and papain at 6.75 units·ml−1. The35SO4-labeled proteoglycan content was measured by liquid scintillation with a LKB 1214 counter (Wallac, France). The concentration of nitrites, the stable end products of cellular NO breakdown, in culture media from chondrocytes was determined by the Griess reaction (32.Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10586) Google Scholar) using NaNO2 as standard. The results were expressed as nanomoles of nitrite/100,000 cells. Recombinant human IL-1β, Wy-14,643, clofibrate, and LTB4 were purchased from Tebu (Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France). 15d-PGJ2 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). RT-PCR products from samples containing a mixture of mRNA from rat chondrocytes and mouse tissues are shown in Fig.1. They were characterized and separated by restriction site polymorphism. RT-PCR led to amplicons of the expected size: 419, 525, 277, and 569 bp for PPARα, PPARγ, RORα, and β-actin, respectively (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the three mRNAs were present in chondrocytes. The quantification of these mRNAs were thereafter performed using a quantitative multistandard RT-PCR method that takes advantage of both interest gene and β-actin sequence conservation between animal species as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Their corresponding levels were compared with those found in hepatic and white adipose tissues from a healthy rat (Fig.2). As expected, PPARα and PPARγ mRNAs were relatively highly expressed in the liver and in the adipose tissue, respectively, in accordance with their physiological roles. The expression level of PPARα in cartilage was much lower than that measured in liver but not significantly different to that of the adipose tissue (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, PPARγ mRNA expression in cartilage was weak, when compared with adipose tissue, but similar to that found in the liver (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to PPARs, no significant difference in expression level of RORα mRNA was observed between the three tissues investigated (Fig. 2 C). Finally, by the use of specific primers, we also detected a band corresponding to PPARγ-2 mRNA (Fig.2 D). However, the signal intensities were too weak to allow any valid quantification, especially after IL-1β or MIA treatments. Western blot analysis clearly showed the presence of the three nuclear receptors in cartilage (Fig. 5). They exhibited molecular masses of 55 kDa for PPARα and PPARγ and of 58 kDa for RORα. This experiment demonstrates that the three proteins coexist in rat chondrocytes. Immunocytology experiments were undertaken on chondrocyte primary cultures in order to investigate the subcellular localization of the nuclear receptors in chondrocytes. Fluorescence signals corresponding to PPARα and PPARγ were principally observed in nuclei (Fig.3), which is in accordance with their site of action. No signal was detected in nucleoles. However, a non-negligible cytoplasmic localization was also evident, especially for PPARα. Despite the fact that the anti-RORα antibody used was recommended for both Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis, in our experimental conditions, no signal was detected in chondrocyte layers. The use of this antibody in immunoblotting analysis (denaturing conditions) allowed us to identify the RORα protein in chondrocytes. However, in native conditions, which is the case in immunocytochemical studies, we hypothesized that the recognized epitope was not accessible to the antibody.Figure 3PPAR α and PPAR γ are predominantly nuclear, but PPAR α is also cytoplasmic localized in rat chondrocyte primary cultures. Immunocytochemical analysis of PPARα and PPARγ expression in rat chondrocyte primary cultures was performed using polyclonal anti-PPARα (panels Aand B) or anti-PPARγ (panels C andD). Negative controls were performed by replacing the primary antibody solution with preimmune serum (panels B and D) (original magnification, ×250).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We investigated the effects of IL-1β and MIA on the expression of the three nuclear receptors at both mRNA and protein levels. Chondrocytes were treated with increasing amounts of IL-1β (2.5, 25, and 250 units·ml−1). By comparison with the control, the lowest dose (2.5 units·ml−1) did not significantly affect the expression of one of the three receptors and was not further used. Stimulation of chondrocytes with IL-1β at 25 or 250 units·ml−1 for one or 12 h did not significantly modify the expression of PPARα mRNA (Fig.4 A). By contrast, the expression of PPARγ mRNA was decreased in a dose-dependent manner after 12 h of treatment (−60%,p < 0.05 with 25 units·ml−1 IL-1β; −70%, p < 0.05 with 250 units·ml−1IL-1β) (Fig. 4 B). This effect was very fast, since it was observed as soon as 1 h of treatment with the highest dose. It was also reversible. When cells were incubated with IL-1β for 1 h and then with fresh medium for the following 11 h, PPARγ returned back to the control level. Interestingly, compared with PPARγ, the opposite effect was observed for RORα mRNA upon stimulation by IL-1β (Fig. 4 C). The cytokine increased by 45% and 100% the mRNA levels at the doses of 25 and 250 units·ml−1 for 12 h, respectively. However, no significant change was observed when IL-1β was added for 1 h (followed or not by incubation with fresh medium), whatever the concentration used. Changes in mRNA levels encoding the three nuclear receptors upon treatment with IL-1β could be related to the variations of the corresponding proteins, as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5). Treatment of chondrocytes with two doses of MIA (1·10−5and 5·10−5m) for 1 h did not change the level in PPARα mRNA (Fig. 4 A). Concerning PPARγ, only the highest dose of MIA induced a significant"

In the studies reported here, we show that endogenous p38 MAPK activity correlates well with breast carcinoma cell invasiveness. Treatment of highly invasive BT549 cells with a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 diminished both uPA/uPAR mRNA and protein expression and abrogated the ability of these cells to invade matrigel, suggesting that p38 MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of uPA/uPAR expression and breast cancer cell invasion. We also demonstrated that SB203580-induced reduction in uPA/uPAR mRNA expression resulted from the de- stabilization of uPA and uPAR mRNA.

Expression of uPA and uPAR can be up-regulated by mitogen, growth factors, oncogenes, and ligation of integrin with extracellular matrix protein (12.Ghiso J.A. Alonso D.F. Farias E.F.

However, the mechanism involved in the maintenance of uPA and uPAR overexpression in cancer cells remains unknown. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been shown to transduce extracellular signals into cellular responses and play important roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, cell migration, and cytoskeleton remodeling (25.Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells express at least three types of MAPKs, ERKs, p38 MAPKs, and JNKs (26.Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The p38 MAPKs include at least four isoforms (α, β, γ, and δ) (27.New L. Han J. Trends Cardiovasc Med. 1999; 8: 220-229Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Despite the structural similarity among the member of p38 MAPK family, differences in the activation profile and substrate specificity have been observed (27.New L. Han J. Trends Cardiovasc Med. 1999; 8: 220-229Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The p38 MAPKs can be activated by a wide spectrum of stimuli, including cellular stress, bacterial lipopolysacchride, the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor α and growth factors such as transforming growth factor β (25.Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 27.New L. Han J. Trends Cardiovasc Med. 1999; 8: 220-229Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recently, p38 MAPK signaling pathway has been shown to be important for the induction of several metalloproteinases by extracellular stimuli. For example, p38 MAPK pathway signals for the expression of collagenase-3 (MMP-13) in human skin fibroblast cultured on three-dimensional collagen gels (28.Ravanti L. Heino J. López-Otı́n C. Kähari V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2446-2455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In squamous carcinoma cells of head and neck, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB203580, was found to inhibit PMA-induced MMP9 expression (29.Simon C. Goepfert H. Boyd D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1135-1139PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, p38 MAPK pathway was also reported to mediate both okadaic acid and tumor-derived extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer-stimulated collagenase-1 (MMP-1) expression in fibroblasts (30.Lim M. Martinez T.J.D. Cameron R. Guo H. Toole B. Li J.D. Basbaum C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 31.Westermarck J. Holmstrom T. Ahonen M. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.M. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that p38 MAPK signaling may be important for cell invasive properties. In this paper, we investigated the role of p38 MAPK in breast cancer cell invasion. We found that the endogenous p38 MAPK activity correlated well with the in vitro invasiveness of breast carcinoma cells. Moreover, the ability of highly invasive BT549 cells to invade matrigel was almost completely abrogated by specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. We also provide substantial evidence that p38α MAPK pathway signals for the stability of uPA and uPAR mRNA and thereby may enhance breast cancer cell invasiveness. SB203580, SB202474, U0126, and actinomycin D were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal antibodies to activated p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182-phophorylated p38 MAPK), p38 MAPK, and MAPKAPK-2 were purchased from BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal antibody to uPA and monoclonal antibody to uPAR were purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). cDNAs for uPA, uPAR, MMP2, and MMP9 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Breast cancer cells SK-BR2, T47D, MDA231, MDA435, MDA436, and BT549 (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with10% fetal calf serum. Cell invasion assay was analyzed using BIOCOAT matrigel invasion chamber (Becton-Dickinson, Bedford, MA) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 2 × 105cells in 300 μl were added to each chamber and allowed to invade matrigel for 20 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. The noninvading cells on the upper surface of membrane were removed from the chamber, and the invading cells on the lower surface of membrane were stained with Quick-Diff stain kit (Becton-Dickinson). After two washes with water, the chambers were allowed to air dry. The number of invading cells were counted using a phase-contrast microscope. To determine the effect of p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 on BT549 invasion, cells were treated with 10 μm SB203580 for 24 h and then added into invasion chambers, and the number of invading cells was subsequently determined after 20 h. To measure cell migration, the undersurfaces of Transwells (Costar, Corning, NY) were coated with 10 μg/ml of laminin (Sigma) or collagen I (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) overnight at 4 °C. Coated wells were then placed into a 24-well plate containing 500 μl of serum-free DMEM containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were detached with 10 mm EDTA and washed several times with serum-free DMEM medium. Cells were then suspended 5 × 105cells/ml in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, added into transwells (200μl of 1 × 106cells/ml cell suspension in each well), and allowed to migrate for 8 h at 37 °C. Cotton swabs were used to remove cells in the upper surface of the transwells, and migratory cells attached on the undersurface were stained with crystal violet solution. Wells were gently rinsed with water and dried in the air. Crystal violet-stained attached cells were solubilized with 100 μl of 10% acetic acid and quantitated on a microplate reader at 600 nm. Cells were cultured in 6-well plates and then washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were boiled in nonreducing SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The activated p38 MAPK (the Thr180/Tyr182-phosphorylated p38 MAPK) and p38 MAPK were detected by phospho-p38 and p38 polyclonal antibodies, respectively. uPA was detected using a uPA polyclonal antibody. BT549 cells were treated with SB203580 for 24 h and then lysed using RIPA buffer. Cells lysates were immunoprecipitated using an anti-MAPKAPK-2 polyclonal antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were used for in vitro kinase assays using recombinant Hsp27 (heat shockprotein 27) as a substrate as described previously (32.Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The expression of uPA, uPAR, MMP2, MMP9 and GAPDH was analyzed by Northern analysis as described previously (33.Huang S. Chakrabarty S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28764-28768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the role of p38 MAPK on protease expression, BT549 cells were treated with 5, 10, and 20 μm SB203580 to inhibit p38 MAPK activity for 24 h, and total RNA was then isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed on a paraformadehyde/MOPS agarose gel (1.2%) and then transferred onto a Nitran membrane (Schleicher & Schull) using 20× SSPE. The membrane was UV cross-linked and hybridized with32P-labeled cDNA probes for uPA, uPAR, MMP2, MMP9, and GAPDH, respectively. The membrane was then washed and exposed to x-ray film. To study the role of p38 MAPK on uPA and uPAR mRNA stability, 1 μg/ml of actinomycin D was added to untreated or SB203580 (10 μm, 1 h)-treated BT549 cells. Total RNAs were isolated from these cells at varying times (1–12 h), and Northern analysis was then performed to detect uPA and uPAR expression. To detect cell surface uPAR expression, BT549 cells were suspended in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum and 0.02% sodium azide and incubated with uPAR mAb for 30 min on ice. The cells were washed twice and further incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min on ice. Following three additional washes with PBS, cells were resuspended in 500 μl and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan; Becton-Dickinson). Data analyses were performed using the CellQuest program (Becton-Dickinson). All dominant negative MAPK mutant-encoding adenovirus constructs have been described elsewhere previously (32.Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34.Nemoto S. Xiang J.

Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of dominant negative MAPK mutants on uPA and uPAR mRNA expression, BT549 cells were infected with each of these adenovirus constructs (10 plaque-forming units/cell) or control Ad·RSV (no insert) for 48 h. The Northern analyses were then performed on the total RNA isolated from these cells to detect the expression of uPA and uPAR. The level of uPA protein expression was detected by immunoblotting using anti-uPA polyclonal antibody, and uPAR was detect by flow cytometry using anti-uPAR mAb. A 2170-base pair fragment containing the human uPA promoter (−2139 to +30 relative to the transcription start site) (36.Verde P. Boast S. Franzè A. Robbiati F. Blasi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10699-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was cloned into the XhoI site of pGL2-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), which contains a luciferase reporter gene. A 1604-base pair fragment containing the human uPAR promoter (−1552 to +51 relative to the transcription start site) (37.Soravia E. Grebe A. De Luca P. Helin K. Suh T.T. Degen J.L. Blasi F. Blood. 1995; 86: 624-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into theXhoI site of the pGL2-basic vector. To analyze uPA or uPAR promoter activity in BT549 cells, 2 μg of reporter gene plasmid, and 0.5 μg of pRSVβ (containing the β-galactosidase gene, Promega) were co-transfected into BT549 cells plated on 6-well plate (5 × 105cells/well seeded overnight) using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 24 h and further cultured in the presence or absence of SB203580 for another 24 h. Cells were then lysed, and the luciferase activity was determined using Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The β-galactosidase activity was determined using O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate, as described previously, and used to standardize uPA and uPAR promoter activity. The uPA coding sequence was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from total RNA isolated from BT549 cells using the primers HUKa (5′- TACCGCTCGAGGCCACCATGAGAGCCCTGCTGGCG-3′, the underlined sequence is an XhoI site) and HUKb (5′-TACGCGTCGACTCAGAGGGCCAGGCCATTATTCTTTTC-3′, the underlined sequence is a SalI site). The amplified uPA cDNA lacks 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences. The primers were designed based on published sequence (GenBankTM accession number X02419) (38.Riccio A. Grimaldi G. Verde P. Sebastio G. Boast S. Blasi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2759-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested with XhoI/SalI and subcloned into pCI/neo mammalian expression vector (Promega) and designated as pCI/uPA. The sequence of uPA in pCI/uPA was confirmed by automated sequence analysis. To generate uPA stable transfectants, BT549 cells were transfected with pCI/uPA using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transfected cells were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 for 3 weeks. Individual stable transfectants were isolated using cloning cylinders, and uPA mRNA expression was then determined by Northern analysis using uPA cDNA as probe. One clone, which expressed high level of uPA (data not shown), was collected and designated as BT549/uPA. Control transfectants were established by transfecting BT549 cells with pCI/neo and designated as BT549/neo. The p38 MAPK signaling pathway has been shown to mediate the expression of several metalloproteinase induced by various extracellular stimuli (28.Ravanti L. Heino J. López-Otı́n C. Kähari V.-M. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2052-2058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We, thus, hypothesized that constitutive p38 MAPK signaling might be important for tumor cell invasiveness. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether a correlation existed between the constitutive activity of p38 MAPK andin vitro invasion of human breast cancer cells. Because p38 MAPK is activated through dual phosphorylation of threonyl and tyrosyl residues at TGY motif by upstream MAPK kinases including MKK3 and MKK6 (27.New L. Han J. Trends Cardiovasc Med. 1999; 8: 220-229Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we used the antibody, which strictly recognizes Thr/Tyr-phophorylated p38 MAPK, to detect the endogenous constitutive activity of p38 MAPK in six breast cancer cell lines. T47D and MDA435 lines, which contained little p38 MAPK activity (Fig.1 A), were unable to invade matrigel (Fig. 1 B), a matrix containing laminin, collagen I, and other matrix proteins (information provided by manufacturer). In contrast, BT549, MDA231, and MDA436 lines, which exhibited high endogenous p38 MAPK activity, showed significant matrigel invasion (Fig. 1). SK-BR2 cells displayed low p38 MAPK activity and were also only slightly invasive (Fig. 1). The low p38 MAPK activity in T47D and MDA435 lines was not due to lack of p38 MAPK protein expression because immunoblotting using anti-p38 antibody showed similar levels of p38 MAPK protein expression in these lines (Fig. 1 A). These results thus showed a good correlation between constitutive p38 MAPK activity and the invasiveness of human breast cancer cells. Several related pyridinyl imidazole compounds have been found to be highly specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK (40.Lee J.C. Kassis S. Kumar S. Badger A. Adams J.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). SB203580, a member of this group, is a highly selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK, which does not alter the activity of other MAPKs including ERKs and JNKs (41.Lisnock J. Tebben A. Frantz B. Neill E.A. Croft G. O'Keefe S.J. Li B. Hacker C. de Laszlo S. Smith A. Libby B. Liverton N. Hermes J. LoGrasso P. Biochem. 1998; 37: 16573-16581Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 42.Wang Z. Canagarajah B.J. Boehm J.C. Kassisa S. Cobb M.H. Young P.R. Abdel-Meguid S. Adams J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Structure. 1998; 15: 1117-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 43.Ben-Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 24: 1049-1057Google Scholar). We thus used this inhibitor to investigate the role of p38 MAPK activity in invasion of BT549 breast cancer cells. We first examined whether SB203580 could inhibit p38 MAPK activity in BT549 cells by analyzing its ability to activate MAPKAPK-2, a kinase that lies immediately downstream of p38 MAPK (43.Ben-Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 24: 1049-1057Google Scholar). Lysates from BT549 cells treated with a increasing amount of SB203580 showed decreased ability to phosphorylate heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), a substrate of MAPKAP-2. SB203580 at 10 μmwas capable of inhibiting over 80% of Hsp27 phosphorylation (Fig.2 A). The reduced Hsp27 phosphorylation was not due to decreased levels of p38 MAPK or MAPKAPK-2 because SB203580 treatment had no effect on the level of either protein (Fig. 2 A). In further experiments, we also examined the effect of U0126, a MEK1 inhibitor, and SB202474, a control compound that lacks the ability to inhibit p38 MAPK activity (40.Lee J.C. Kassis S. Kumar S. Badger A. Adams J.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), on p38 MAPK activity. No inhibition of Hsp27 phosphorylation was observed with these agents (data not shown). These results demonstrate that SB203580 was capable of specifically blocking p38 MAPK activity in BT549 cells. To investigate the effect of SB203580 on BT549 cell invasion, we next treated cells with SB203580 and then added them to matrigel invasion chambers for 20 h. SB203580 at 10 μm blocked BT549 cell invasion by over 90% and at 20 μm completely diminished BT549 cell invasion on matrigel (Fig. 2 B). In a control experiment, we treated cells with the same concentration of control compound SB202474 and did not detect any significant inhibitory effect on BT549 cell invasion (Fig.2 B). To rule out the possibility that SB203580 was toxic to BT549 cells, we examined cell growth of both untreated and SB203580-treated cells. SB203580 up to 20 μm showed little effect on BT549 cell proliferation as determined by MTT assay (data not shown) (33.Huang S. Chakrabarty S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28764-28768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that constitutive p38 MAPK activity is necessary for breast cancer cell in vitroinvasiveness. Cell migration and protease production are the two essential processes of cell invasion. We thus investigated the effect of SB203580 on BT549 cell migration on extracellular matrix laminin and collagen I. Untreated or SB203580-treated BT549 cells were added into transwells and allowed to migrate to laminin or collagen I for 8 h. BT549 cells migrated very well on both collagen and laminin-coated wells. Treatment of cells with SB203580 showed only slight inhibitory effect on migration (Fig. 3). These results suggest that p38 MAPK activity is not essential for BT549 cell migration. We next investigated whether p38 MAPK activity was required for the expression of proteases in BT549 cells. Cells were treated with various concentrations (5, 10, and 20 μm) of SB203580, and then total RNA was isolated and the steady-state levels of uPA, uPAR, MMP2, and MMP9 mRNAs were analyzed by Northern blotting. Expression of MMP2 mRNA was not detected (data not shown), whereas MMP9 mRNA was readily detected and not significantly affected by SB203580 treatment (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, SB203580 significantly inhibited the steady-state levels of uPA and uPAR mRNA in BT549 cells (Fig. 4 A). We also observed a decrease in cell-associated uPA protein (assayed by immunoblotting; Fig. 4 B) and cell surface uPAR expression (assayed by flow cytometry; Fig. 4 C) on BT549 cells upon SB203580 treatment. These results suggested that the constitutive p38 MAPK activity is essential for both uPA and uPAR expression in BT549 cells.Figure 4p38 MAPK is required for uPA and uPAR expression. A, BT549 cells were treated with SB203580 (5, 10, and 20 μm) for 24 h. Total RNA was then prepared and subjected to Northern blot to detect the steady-state levels of MMP9, uPA, uPAR, and GAPDH mRNA using the respective cDNAs as probes. B, BT549 and BT549 cells treated with SB203580 (5, 10, and 20 μm) for 24 h were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-uPA polyclonal antibody to detect uPA. C, BT549 cells were treated with 10 μm SB203580 or SB202474 for 24 h and then subjected to flow cytometry using anti-uPAR mAb to detect cell surface uPAR expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The steady-state level of mRNA can be affected by the level of gene transcription and/or the stability of mRNA. To investigate whether SB203580 inhibited transcription of uPA and uPAR, we constructed the luciferase reporter gene plasmid constructs under the transcriptional control of the uPA and uPAR promoters, respectively. BT549 cells were transfected with either uPA or uPAR promoter reporter gene plasmid construct and then treated with SB203580. The cells were then lysed, and promoter-mediated luciferase activities were determined. There was no significant reduction in either uPA or uPAR promoter activity upon SB203580 treatment (Fig. 5). The lack of inhibition in promoter activity was not cell type-specific, because SB203580 also failed to inhibit uPA or uPAR promoter activity in MDA231 and MDA436 breast cancer cell lines (data not shown). These results suggest that SB203580 does not inhibit the steady-state levels of uPA and uPAR mRNA by suppressing gene transcription. We next investigated whether SB203580 altered the stability of uPA and uPAR mRNA. Actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) was added into BT549 cells cultured in the presence or absence of SB203580, the total RNA was then isolated at varying times (1–12 h), and uPA and uPAR expression was determi"

https://openalex.org/W2007288908,"ABCR is a photoreceptor-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter that has been linked to various retinal diseases, including Stargardt macular dystrophy, and implicated in retinal transport across rod outer segment (ROS) membranes. We have examined the ATPase and GTPase activity of detergent-solubilized and reconstituted ABCR. 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid-solubilized ABCR had ATPase and GTPase activity (K m ∼75 μm;V max ∼ 200 nmol/min/mg) that was stimulated 1.5–2-fold by all-trans-retinal and dependent on phospholipid and dithiothreitol. The K m for ATP decreased to ∼25 μm after reconstitution, whereas theV max was strongly dependent on the lipid used for reconstitution. ABCR reconstituted in ROS phospholipid had aV max for basal and retinal activated ATPase activity that was 4–6 times higher than for ABCR in soybean or brain phospholipid. This enhanced activity was mainly due to the high phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content of ROS membranes. PE was also required for retinoid-stimulated ATPase activity. ATPase activity of ABCR was stimulated by the addition ofN-retinylidene-PE but not the reduced derivative, retinyl-PE. ABCR expressed in COS-1 cells also exhibited retinal-stimulated ATPase activity similar to that of the native protein. These results support the view that ABCR is an active retinoid transporter, the nucleotidase activity of which is strongly influenced by its lipid environment.

ABCR reconstituted in ROS phospholipid had aV max for basal and retinal activated ATPase activity that was 4–6 times higher than for ABCR in soybean or brain phospholipid. This enhanced activity was mainly due to the high phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content of ROS membranes. PE was also required for retinoid-stimulated ATPase activity. ATPase activity of ABCR was stimulated by the addition ofN-retinylidene-PE but not the reduced derivative, retinyl-PE. ABCR expressed in COS-1 cells also exhibited retinal-stimulated ATPase activity similar to that of the native protein. These results support the view that ABCR is an active retinoid transporter, the nucleotidase activity of which is strongly influenced by its lipid environment. phosphatidylethanolamine rod outer segment 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine dioleoylphosphatidylcholine 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoylphosphatidylcholine 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoylphosphatidylethanolamine dithiothreitol phosphatidylcholine phosphate-buffered saline high pressure liquid chromatography ABCR, also known as the rim protein, is an abundant high molecular weight membrane glycoprotein found in photoreceptor outer segment disc membranes (1.Papermaster D.S.

Primary structural analysis indicates that ABCR is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette proteins that typically function in the active transport of various substances across cell membranes (2.Illing M.

Like other eukaryotic ABC transporters, such as P-glycoprotein and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, ABCR is organized in two homologous, tandem-arranged halves, each containing a cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain preceded by a hydrophobic domain consisting of multiple membrane spanning segments. The gene encoding ABCR has been implicated in a variety of retinal degenerative diseases associated with a loss in vision. Over 80 different mutations in ABCR have been found in patients with Stargardt macular dystrophy, a juvenile onset, autosomal recessive disease characterized by decreased visual acuity, bilateral atrophy of the central (macula) retina, accumulation of fluorescent yellow deposits in the retinal pigment epithelium, and delayed dark adaptation (4.Allikmets R.

The substrate(s) transported by ABCR is not yet known. However, localization of ABCR to photoreceptor outer segment disc membranes led to the initial suggestion that ABCR may function to transport retinoids across the disc membrane (2.Illing M.

The putative role of ABCR as a retinal transporter is supported by two recent studies. In one study, purified ABCR reconstituted into brain lipid vesicles displayed ATPase activity that was stimulated up to 5-fold by retinal (14.Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8269-8281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Substrates that are actively transported across cell membranes by P-glycoprotein, histidine permease, multidrug resistance-associated protein, and the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT/multidrug resistance-associated protein 2) also activate the ATPase activity of these proteins (15.Ambudkar S.V.

In a second study, an abcr knockout mouse has been produced that displays delayed dark adaptation, a light-dependent increase in all-trans-retinal and protonatedN-retinylidene-PE1in ROS, and an accumulation of the pyridinium bis-retinoid compound, A2E, in photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells (23.Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M. Tzekov R.T. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Many of these characteristics are observed in individuals with Stargardt disease and are consistent with an accumulation of retinal-PE derivatives in photoreceptor membranes presumably due to defective transport of retinoid compounds across disc membranes. As part of an ongoing study to characterize the structural and functional properties of ABCR, we have investigated the effect of various phospholipids and retinoid compounds on the nucleotidase activity of ABCR from ROS membranes. Here, we report that detergent-solubilized and reconstituted ABCR displays both ATPase and GTPase activity that is strongly influenced by the lipid environment and the presence of retinoid compounds. We also show that ABCR expressed in monkey kidney COS-1 cells exhibits retinal-stimulated ATPase activity comparable to that of the native protein. All-trans-retinal, all-trans-retinol, reduced glutathione, soybean phospholipid, SDPC, CHAPS, and N-ethylmaleimide were purchased from Sigma. Citral, 2,4-all-trans-nonadienal, 2-trans-6-cis-nonadienal, and nonylaldehyde were from Aldrich. 11-cis-Retinal was a generous gift of Dr. Rosalie Crouch. The following phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids: SDPE, DOPE, DOPC, and brain polar lipid extract. The composition of buffers was as follows: homogenization buffer, 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 10 mm taurine, 10 mm glucose, 0.25 mmMgCl2, 20% (w/v) sucrose; column buffer (Buffer C), 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mmCHAPS, 1 mg/ml sonicated soybean phospholipid, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol; Buffer B, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm CHAPS, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol; dialysis buffer (Buffer D1), 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT; Buffer D2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mmDTT, 3 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol; and reconstitution buffer (Buffer E), 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol. Retinoid compounds were dissolved in ethanol and diluted at least 200-fold in Buffer C or Buffer E (final ethanol concentration, <0.5% in reaction). All-trans-retinal, 11-cis-retinal, and all-trans-retinol concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically in ethanol using molar extinction coefficients of 42,880 (λmax = 383 nm), 24,935 (λmax = 380 nm), and 52,770 (λmax = 325 nm), respectively (24.Hubbard R. Brown P.K. Bownds D. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18C: 615-653Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). N-Retinylidene-PE, the Schiff base conjugate of retinal and PE, was prepared by the method of Anderson and Maude (25.Anderson R.E. Maude M.B. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3624-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinal (2.0 μmol) was mixed with 2.0 μmol of DOPE in 1.0 ml of a solvent consisting of chloroform, methanol, and triethylamine (12:6:1, by volume). The reaction was shielded from light and allowed to proceed for at least 30 min at room temperature. For the preparation of the reduction product ofN-retinylidene-PE, N-retinyl-PE, a 1000-fold molar excess of NaBH4 was added following the initial incubation period. The retinal-PE conjugates were purified by HPLC on a Phenomenex Primesphere 5 C18 HC column (150 × 3.2 mm) by a procedure adapted from Parish et al. (26.Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Dillon J. Sparrow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14609-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The samples were eluted using a continuous gradient of 85% methanol in water to 100% methanol over a period of 30 min, followed by isocratic elution with 100% methanol (all solvents also contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (Fig.1). Retinal eluted at approximately 12 min, N-retinylidene-PE at 48 min, andN-retinyl-PE at 60 min. N-Retinylidene-PE eluted from the column as the protonated Schiff base with an absorption maximum of 450 nm. Upon deprotonation of the Schiff base by addition of 5 N NaOH, the absorption maximum shifted to 370 nm, consistent with earlier observations (25.Anderson R.E. Maude M.B. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3624-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The absorption maximum of theN-retinyl-PE peak was 329 nm. The mass of theN-retinyl-DOPE compound was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. ROS membranes were isolated from previously frozen bovine retinas on a continuous sucrose density gradient as described previously (27.Molday R.S. Molday L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and stored in homogenization buffer (4–8 mg protein/ml) at –80 °C. Phospholipids were extracted from ROS membranes by the method of Folch et al. (28.Folch F. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 496-506Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), with precautions to prevent the reaction of endogenous retinal with amine-containing phospholipids and to limit the oxidation of the polyunsaturated acyl chains that are abundant in ROS phospholipids (29.Miljanich G.P. Sklar L.A. White D.L. Dratz E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 552: 294-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30.Nielsen N.C. Fleischer S. McConnell D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ROS membranes (16 mg) were washed three times in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and suspended in 0.8 ml of the same buffer. A solution of 0.8 ml of 1m NH2OH (pH adjusted to 7.0 using NaHCO3) and 4.2 ml of methanol was added to the membranes, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min. NH2OH derivatized retinal to the corresponding oxime. The mixture was extracted with 4 ml of water and 7.5 ml of chloroform containing 50 μg/ml butylated hydroxytoluene as an antioxidant. The organic (lower) phase was separated from the aqueous phase and then washed with 5.6 ml of 0.3 m NaCl and 4.2 ml of methanol. The organic solvent was evaporated under nitrogen, and the lipids were resuspended in 0.2 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1, by volume) and applied to a thin-layer chromatography plate (0.5-mm Silicagel G) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The plate was developed in a tank filled with nitrogen, using solvent system consisting of hexane/ether (1:1, by volume). The retinal oxime migrated near the solvent front, whereas the phospholipids remained at the origin. The phospholipids were scraped with a spatula and eluted from the Silicagel using chloroform/methanol (1:1, by volume) containing butylated hydroxytoluene. The yield of phospholipid (3.6 mg) was determined by analyzing lipid phosphorus using the method of Zhou and Arthur (31.Zhou X. Arthur G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1233-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Rim 3F4 antibody was used to isolate the ABCR protein from CHAPS-solubilized ROS membranes as described previously (2.Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 14.Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8269-8281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out in the dark or under dim red light at 4 °C. ROS membranes (2 mg of protein) were diluted in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 86,000 × g for 10 min in a TLA100.4 rotor (Optima TL Ultracentrifuge, Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). After two more washes in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, the membrane suspension was added to 1 ml of Buffer C containing 18 mm CHAPS and stirred for 20 min. The mixture was centrifuged described as above, and the soluble fraction (supernatant) was mixed for 1 h with 100 μl of Rim3F4-Sepharose 2B preequilibrated in Buffer C. The Sepharose beads were transferred to a 0.45 μm filter Ultrafree-MC spin column (Millipore) and washed with Buffer C (six washes of 0.4 ml each). ABCR was eluted by shaking the beads vigorously for 15 min in 60 μl of Buffer C containing 0.2 mg/ml 3F4 peptide (YDLPLHPRTG). The elution step was repeated, and the beads were washed with an additional 60 μl of Buffer C without peptide to yield a final volume of 180 μl (20–40 ng of ABCR/μl). ABCR was reconstituted into soybean phospholipid vesicles at 4 °C by mixing equal volumes of purified ABCR (in Buffer C) and 20 mg/ml sonicated soybean lipid (∼40% PC) in Buffer B. After stirring for 15 min, the mixture was dialyzed against Buffer D1 for 24 h (3 × 500 ml) and subsequently against 500 ml of Buffer D2. ABCR was reconstituted into brain and ROS phospholipids using the procedure of Sun et al. (14.Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8269-8281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Briefly, 18 μl of 20 mg/ml sonicated brain polar lipid extract (33% PE, 18% phosphatidylserine, 13% PC, 36% other phospholipids) or ROS phospholipid extract (∼ 40% PE, ∼ 40% PC, ∼10% phosphatidylserine, 10% other lipids) were mixed with 6 μl of 15% n-octylglucoside (w/v) in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. Purified ABCR (48 μl) was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. Buffer E (400 μl) was added rapidly, and the vesicles were passed through 400 μl of Extracti-gel resin in a 10 μm pore size filter Mobicol mini-column (MoBiTec, Gottingen, Germany) that had been equilibrated in Buffer E. The flow-through containing reconstituted ABCR was collected at 0.8 ml/min by applying gentle pressure with a syringe, and 5 mm MgCl2 was added prior to measuring ATPase activity. The hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) in a 10-μl reaction volume was detected by thin layer chromatography as described before (32.Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28463-28468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Eight μl (20–40 ng) of CHAPS-solubilized ABCR (diluted in Buffer C) or reconstituted sample (undiluted) were pipetted into 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Retinal and other compounds were added from 10× solutions. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 1 μl of a 10× ATP solution (0.2 μCi). Unless otherwise noted, the final ATP concentration was 1 mm for solubilized ABCR and 50 μm for reconstituted ABCR. After 30 min at 37 °C, 4 μl of 10% SDS were added, and the tube was centrifuged briefly. One μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine cellulose plate (Aldrich) and chromatographed in 0.5 mLiCl/1 m formic acid. The plate was exposed to a storage phosphor screen for 3 h and scanned in a PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Spots corresponding to ATP and ADP were quantified using IPLab Gel Analysis software (Signal Analytics Corp., Vienna, VA). The ratio of the amount of ADP produced to the initial amount of ATP present in the reaction mixture was calculated. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Buffer blanks were included to determine nonenzymatic ATP hydrolysis, which was subtracted from the total. GTPase activity was measured in an identical manner using [α-32P]GTP. The protein concentration of ROS membrane preparations was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). The amount of protein in detergent extracts was determined by comparing the intensity of Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining with that of bovine serum albumin standards after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein content of reconstituted ABCR was estimated by Western blot analysis using known amounts of purified ABCR protein. Gels and film were scanned with an Ultroscan XL laser densitometer (LKB, Bromma, Sweden), and relative peak areas were used to determine protein concentration. Proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore) at 300 mA for 40 min in a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) using a buffer consisting of 25 mmTris, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol, pH 8.3. The membrane was incubated in 1% skim milk, PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 30 min and incubated first with Rim 3F4 monoclonal antibody diluted in 0.1% milk, PBS-T for 1 h and then with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:5000 in 0.1% milk, PBS-T) for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For expression studies, the human ABCR cDNA (4.Allikmets R. Singh N. Sun H. Shroyer N.F. Hutchinson A. Chidambaram A. Gerrard B. Baird L. Stauffer D. Peiffer A. Rattner A. Smallwood P. Li Y.

COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and passaged twice a week. Cells (one 10-cm dish) were transfected at 80% confluency with 30 μg of pcDNA3-ABCR and 60 μl of SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) for 3 h. After 48 h, cells were washed twice in PBS and harvested by scraping in PBS. The cells were centrifuged at 2800 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was solubilized in 0.5 ml of Buffer C containing 18 mm CHAPS and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. ABCR was purified on a Rim3F4-Sepharose 2B column as described above for ABCR from ROS membranes, except that the procedure was carried out under normal laboratory light. Typically, four 10-cm dishes of transfected cells were used for 100 μl of packed Rim3F4 beads. The ATPase activity of CHAPS-solubilized, immunoaffinity-purified ABCR from ROS membranes was measured under various conditions. When the purification and activity measurements were carried out in the presence of soybean phospholipids, DTT, and glycerol, ABCR exhibited a basal ATPase activity that was stimulated up to 2-fold by 11-cis- and all-trans-retinal (Figs. 2 and3 A). All-trans-retinol, reduced glutathione, and four structurally related unsaturated aldehydes (citral, 2,4-nonadienal, 2,6-nonadienal, and nonyl aldehyde) had no significant effect on the basal ATPase activity of ABCR. The activity of CHAPS-solubilized ABCR was dependent on the presence of DTT and lipid. Over 70% of the basal ATPase activity was lost when DTT or soybean phospholipid was omitted during purification and activity determination.N-Ethylmaleimide also inhibited the ATPase activity of ABCR.Figure 3Retinal stimulates the nucleotide triphosphatase activity of CHAPS-solubilized ABCR. A, the ATPase activity of purified ABCR was measured as a function of the all-trans-retinal (●) or all-trans-retinol (▪) concentration. Results shown represent the means ± S.D. of three experiments. B, the stimulation of GTPase activity by all-trans-retinal in a typical experiment (100% activity = 150 nmol/min/mg). In both cases, half-maximal stimulation of ATPase activity was obtained with 10 μmall-trans-retinal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ATPase activity of solubilized ABCR was highly labile. ATPase stimulation by all-trans-retinal was lost when CHAPS-solubilized ABCR was stored overnight at 4 °C. Preincubation of ABCR at 37 °C for 30 min resulted in the loss of over 90% of the ATPase activity of ABCR. Addition of ATP during preincubation diminished this inactivation. Approximately 40% of the basal ATPase activity remained if the preincubation step was carried out in the presence of 1 mm ATP. CHAPS-solubilized ABCR exhibited both ATPase and GTPase activities. As shown in Fig. 3, the basal ATPase and GTPase activities were activated by all-trans-retinal with half-maximal stimulation at 10 μm all-trans-retinal. The specific ATPase and GTPase activities were similar. Previously, Sun et al. (14.Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8269-8281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) reported that ABCR reconstituted into brain polar lipid and brain PE possesses basal and retinal-stimulated ATPase activity. We have now reconstituted purified ABCR into various phospholipid mixtures in order to examine further the effect of the lipid environment on the basal and retinal-stimulated ATPase activity of ABCR. Fig.4 shows the dependence of ATP hydrolysis on ATP concentration for ABCR reconstituted into ROS phospholipid vesicles. The K m and V maxvalues for ATP hydrolysis by detergent-solubilized and reconstituted ABCR are compared in Table I. TheK m values for basal ATPase activity of ABCR reconstituted in soybean, brain, and ROS phospholipid are similar (K m ∼ 25 μm ATP) but generally lower than for CHAPS-solubilized ABCR (K m ∼ 75 μm ATP). The lipid composition had a significant influence on the V max values of the reconstituted enzyme. The V max of ABCR reconstituted into ROS phospholipid (V max = 202 ± 45 nmol/min/mg) is four times higher than ABCR reconstituted into soybean phospholipid and over six times higher than ABCR in brain polar lipid but comparable to that observed for the solubilized protein (Table I). Retinal increased both theV max and K m for ATP hydrolysis by ABCR reconstituted into each type of lipid. Although retinal stimulation was somewhat variable between preparations, in general, retinal increased the V max by 2.5–5-fold for ABCR in ROS and brain lipids but only 1.5–2-fold for ABCR in soybean phospholipids.Table IComparison of ATPase activity of purified ABCR reconstituted in different lipid preparationsLipid extractK m for ATPV maxBasalRetinalBasalRetinalμmnmol/min/mgBefore reconstitution75 ± 18112 ± 8 (2)190 ± 36402 ± 18 (2)Soybean32 ± 256 ± 1450 ± 24110 ± 60Brain polar20 ± 2106 ± 3629 ± 6171 ± 8Rod outer segment25 ± 775 ± 11202 ± 45673 ± 84ATPase activity was measured immediately following purification or after reconstitution in soybean, brain polar, or rod outer segment lipids.

In addition to affecting the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis, the lipid environment also influenced the stability of ABCR. Unlike CHAPS-solubilized ABCR, the basal and retinal-stimulated activity of reconstituted ABCR was unaffected by storage at 4 °C for at least 4 days. The effect of all-trans-retinal and all-trans-retinol concentration on the ATPase activity of ABCR in ROS and brain phospholipids was also measured.

One possible mechanism for steroid specificity is the difference in DNA binding characteristics of the receptors, although they share a high homology in their DNA-binding domains. Indeed, the androgen-specific expression of, for example, the probasin (PB) gene can be explained by the presence of an androgen response element (ARE) in its promoter (PB-ARE-2), specifically recognized by the androgen and not by the glucocorticoid receptor. Three residues in the DNA-binding domain of the AR were identified as main determinants for its high affinity for the PB-ARE-2. In addition, the direct repeat nature of this ARE seems to prohibit high affinity binding by the glucocorticoid receptor. This is confirmed by the fact that several imperfect direct repeats of the 5′-TGTTCT-3′ core recognition sequence are recognized by the androgen receptor and not by the glucocorticoid receptor. Up to now, only differences between the androgen and glucocorticoid receptor in the transcription activation functions were invoked to explain the specificity of their genomic actions. In the present study, we describe the influence of the DNA-binding domain on the specificity of androgen action. The novelty of our working hypothesis resides in the demonstration of the capacity of the AR-DNA-binding domain to recognize elements with a direct repeat structure.

The steroid receptors are a subfamily of the nuclear receptor superfamily, a large group of structurally homologous transcription factors. A problem with the explanation of the specificity of these hormone responses arose when several studies pointed out that the class I receptors (androgen receptor (AR),1 glucocorticoid receptor (GR), progesterone receptor, and mineralocorticoid receptor) have identical consensus response elements (3.Nordeen S.K. Suh B.J. Kuhnel B. Hutchison C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 4.Roche P. Hoare S. Parker M. Mol.

This contrasts with the fact that the in vivo expression of several genes is specifically controlled by only one steroid hormone (6.Truss M. Beato M.

Several possible mechanisms have been described to explain the steroid specificity of transcriptional control, e.g. steroid metabolism, tissue-specific receptor presence (7.Funder J.W. Science. 1993; 259: 1132-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), influence of coactivator complexes (8.Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet.

In addition, more recent reports indicate that the AR on the one hand and the GR, progesterone receptor, and mineralocorticoid receptor on the other exhibit different DNA binding characteristics (11.Rundlett S.E.

Probasin is an androgen-regulated protein exclusively expressed in the dorsolateral epithelium of the prostate (18.Spence A.M. Sheppard P.C. Davie J.R. Matuo Y. Nishi N. Mckeehan W.L. Dodd J.G.

Two cis-acting androgen response elements (PB-ARE-1 and PB-ARE-2) were identified in the promoter and were shown to be necessary for its androgen regulation. The core DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the nuclear receptors is composed of two zinc finger modules (19.Freedman L.P. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The N-terminal zinc finger is involved in specific DNA interaction, whereas the C-terminal zinc finger mainly provides DNA-dependent dimerizations (20.Luisi B. Xu W. Otwinski Z. Freedman L. Yamamoto K. Sigler P. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). Our earlier results indicated that residues in the second zinc finger and a C-terminal extension (CTE) of 12 amino acids determine the difference in the PB-ARE-2 binding between the AR and the GR (21.Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 314: 515-521Crossref Google Scholar). This was the first clear indication of a direct involvement of the CTE residues in the specificity of DNA binding for steroid receptors. The CTE described here overlaps with the T-box described for other members of the nuclear receptor family (e.g. 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXR), thyroid receptor (TR), and nerve growth factor-inducible protein B) (22.Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R. Sigler P. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 23.Lee M. Kliewer S. Provencal J. Wright P. Evans R.

Structural studies showed that in these receptors the T-box residues form an α-helix, which interacts with the DNA phosphate backbone and which is also involved in the DNA-dependent heterodimerization. Structural studies of the estrogen receptor DBD and GR-DBD, however, did not clarify the involvement of this region in DNA binding (20.Luisi B. Xu W. Otwinski Z. Freedman L. Yamamoto K. Sigler P.

The RXR and the TR bind in a “head-to-tail” orientation on a response element with a direct repeat structure (half-site, 5′-AGGTCA-3′), whereas the steroid receptors bind in a “head-to-head” orientation on a response element organized as an inverted repeat (half-site estrogen receptor, 5′-AGGTCA-3′; class I receptors, 5′-TGTTCT-3′). In the present study, the difference in DNA binding between the AR and the GR is analyzed in detail by determining the identity of the amino acids involved and the characteristics of the response element responsible for the exclusion of the GR from binding. All restriction and modifying enzymes were obtained from either Life Technologies, Inc., Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Promega (Madison, WI), Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd. (Shiga, Japan), Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium), or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Biosearch Cyclone DNA synthesizer (Milligen Corp., Bedford, MA) or purchased from Eurogentec. R1881 (methyltrienolone), dexamethasone, aldosterone, and progesterone were purchased from Sigma, [α-32P]dATP from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and X-Omat S x-ray films from Eastman Kodak Co. The cDNA encoding the rat AR was described by Chang et al. (29.Chang C. Kokontis J. Liao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7211-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), and that for the rat GR was described by Hollenberg et al. (30.Hollenberg S. Giguère V. Segui P. Evans R. Cell. 1987; 49: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). fAGA is derived from the full-size rat AR by swapping the AR-DBD for that of the rat GR (AR amino acids 537–619) (21.Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 314: 515-521Crossref Google Scholar). The receptor constructs pCMV5-mAR, pCMV5-rat GR, pCMV5-AGA, and pCMV5-GAG were a kind gift from Dr. D. Robbins (University of Michigan Medical School). In the latter constructs (AGA and GAG), the DBD is exchanged between the AR and the GR (31.Scheller A. Hughes E. Golden K.L. Robins D.M. J. Biol.

Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem.

The pES vector was generated by the cloning of the SalI(blunt)/BglII tk-promoter fragment of pPBARE2luc into the SmaI/BglII site of pGL3-Basic (Promega). The PB-ARE-1 (5′-AGCTTTATGATAGCATCTTGTTCTTAGTGAGCT-3′; the ARE hexamers are underlined) is cloned in the SacI site of pES, generating pPBARE1luc. pPB2-IR1luc, pDRIluc, and pIDRluc are reporter constructs containing response elements derived from PB-ARE-2 or the perfect direct repeat of 5′-TGTTCT-3 (Table II). TheHindIII(blunt)/BamHI PB promoter fragment (–426 to + 28), a kind gift of Dr. R.

For the prokaryotic expression and purification of the steroid receptor DBDs, the corresponding receptor cDNA-fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subsequently cloned in the pGEX-2TK expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fragments were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins in the E. coli BL21 strain. After thrombin cleavage to remove the glutathioneS-transferase fusion partner, the DBDs still contain a short foreign amino acid stretch at the N-terminal end (GSRRASV) as well as at the C-terminal end (IHRD). The AR1 construct consists of rat AR-DBD amino acids 533–637; the GR1 construct comprises the corresponding rat GR-DBD amino acids 432–533. The different mutated GR1 and AR1 constructs generated are described in Fig. 2. The different receptor fragments were purified as described by Schoenmakers et al. (21.Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 314: 515-521Crossref Google Scholar). The protocol for the preparation of nuclear extracts has been described by Andrews and Faller (32.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) and was used with some modifications. Briefly, 106 COS-7 cells were plated in 10 cm Petri dishes and transfected with 2.5 μg of expression plasmid. The cells were incubated (1 h) before harvesting with 10−5m hormone, after which the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were collected in 1.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline per dish, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and pelleted by centrifugation (10 s). The phosphate-buffered saline was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 10 mmHepes·KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 10 min of incubation on ice, the mixture was vortexed (30 s), and the nuclei were collected by a short spin in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was removed, and the nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold high salt buffer: 20 mm Hepes·KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 420 mm KCl, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 20 min of incubation on ice and a short vortexing (10 s), the extracts were cleared by centrifugation (12,000 ×g) at 4 °C for 2 min. The supernatant was then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Western blotting was performed on these extracts as described (33.Alen P. Claessens F. Schoenmakers E. Swinnen J.V. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the ARE sequences (described in Table II) were labeled with [α-32P]dATP by a fill-in reaction by the Klenow fragment of DNA-polymerase to a specific activity of 5000 cpm/fmol. The response elements with a direct repeat sequence organization are derived from the DR element 5′-AGCTTTCATTGTTCTTGATGTTCTGAATGAGCT-3′ (TableII). The dissociation constants were determined by means of gel shift assays as described by Schoenmakers et al. (21.Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 314: 515-521Crossref Google Scholar). In short, a constant amount of labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with increasing amounts of purified receptor fragment until complete retardation of the probe was obtained. The K S value of each construct was calculated from the percentage of retarded probe with the formula of Hill kinetics based on at least three independent assays. For the gel shift assays with the cell extracts containing the full-size receptor, constant amounts (20,000 cpm) of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were incubated (20 min on ice) with equal amounts of nuclear extracts in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes·KOH, pH 7.9, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.05 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.05% Triton X-100, l mm dithiothreitol). Subsequently, free and bound probe were separated by electrophoresis for 120 min at 4 V/cm in a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. In competition gel shift assays, 300-fold excess of cold C3(1) ARE was incubated on ice with the receptor mixture for 10 min prior to the addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. Specific antibodies against the N-terminal part of the AR (34.Marivoet S. Hertogen M. Verhoeven G. Heyns W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 37: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the GR (kindly provided by Prof. Gustafsson, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden) were used as described (35.Gustafsson J.Å. Wikstrom A.C. Denis M. J. Steroid. Biochem. 1989; 34: 1-6Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) to obtain a supershift. COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies) containing 1 g/liter glucose, supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin, 100 IU/ml; streptomycin, 100 μG/ml; Life Technologies) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. For the transient transfection assays, the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 5% dextran-coated, charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (DCC). Reporter plasmids and the expression vectors for the receptor constructs were co-transfected by means of the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A β-galactosidase expression plasmid (CMV-β-galactosidase, Stratagene) was used as internal control of the transfection efficiency. For the transfection assay 15 ng of reporter plasmid, together with 5 ng of receptor expression vector, 20 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase, and 0.1 μg of carrier DNA (pGEM-7), were mixed with 20 μl of DMEM containing 0.2 μl of FuGENE transfection reagent. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then added dropwise onto the cells (96-well culture dish containing 5 × 103 cells in 200 μl of DMEM). After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the medium was replaced by DMEM containing 5% DCC, and the cells were grown in the absence or presence of 1 nm R1881, dexamethasone, aldosterone, or progesterone for 48 h. Luciferase activity was measured with the luciferase assay system from Promega, and β-galactosidase activity was measured with the detection system from CLONTECH. The difference in PB-ARE-2 recognition between the AR and GR was first observed using only their DBDs (named AR1 and GR1) (12.Claessens F. Alen P. Devos A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19013-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21.Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 314: 515-521Crossref Google Scholar). To analyze the influence of the other receptor domains on the difference in DNA binding, chimerical full-size AR and GR constructs with swapped DBDs (AGA, GR-DBD residues 449–533; GAG, AR-DBD residues 551–637) (31.Scheller A. Hughes E. Golden K.L. Robins D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24216-24222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), were used. The DNA binding capacities of these chimerical receptors were compared with these of the AR and GR in gel shift assays with nuclear extracts of transfected COS-7 cells. The C3(1) ARE was recognized by all receptor constructs with similar affinity (Fig. 1 A). The specificity of DNA binding was verified by competition assays using cold C3(1) ARE and by the appearance of a supershifted complex in the presence of a specific anti-AR or anti-GR antibody. The PB-ARE-2 was bound with high affinity by both AR-DBD-containing proteins AR and GAG. In contrast, neither the GR nor the AGA bound this ARE with high affinity, albeit that the antibodies induce a small amount of supershifted binding complexes. In transient cotransfection assays, the pC3AREluc reporter construct is induced 4–5-fold by all the chimerical receptors, indicating the functionality of the receptor proteins (Fig. 1 B). Most remarkable is the transactivation of the PB-ARE-2-containing reporter construct by GAG to a comparable level as the wild type AR, whereas the wild type GR does not enhance the transcription. The AGA chimera is still able to transactivate pPBARE2luc in response to androgens, although the induction factor (2.5) is very low. Western blot analysis of the chimeras (Fig. 1 C) shows a slightly higher level of expression of AGA and GAG compared with respectively AR and GR. In our earlier study, we demonstrated that the first zinc finger of the AR is not involved in the specific recognition of the PB-ARE-2 (21.Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 314: 515-521Crossref Google Scholar). However, experiments with the chimerical DBD constructs G/A and A/G (Fig.2 and Ref. 21.Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 314: 515-521Crossref Google Scholar) demonstrate that for the AR, residues of the hinge region as well as of the N-terminal part of the second zinc finger are involved. We therefore analyzed the importance of all residues that differ between the AR-DBD and the GR-DBD in these two regions. We have already described the necessity of a C-terminal extension of 12 amino acids for specific and high affinity binding of the AR to the PB-ARE-2 (21.Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 314: 515-521Crossref Google Scholar). With the constructs AR28.1 and 28.2 (TableI), we could confirm the involvement of the 12 CTE residues in high affinity DNA binding. These constructs are the result of a deletion of residues forming the nuclear localization signal, which partially overlaps with the CTE (36.Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkman A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Note that AR28.1 and 28.2, kindly provided by Dr. A. O. Brinkmann, are derived from the human AR, which differs from the rat AR at three residues in the extreme C terminus of the receptor fragment. Deletion constructs showed, however, that deletion of this part of the protein had no influence on the DNA binding by the rat AR-DBD (21.Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 314: 515-521Crossref Google Scholar). Six of the 12 CTE amino acids differ between the AR and the GR. Systematic mutations of the AR-specific residues to the GR homologues resulted in a number of AR1 mutants, schematically illustrated in Table I. The apparent dissociation constants of these constructs for the PB-ARE-2 and C3(1) ARE indicate that mainly the mutation of Gly-610 (and to a lower extent, mutation of Leu-617) abrogates the PB-ARE-2 binding.Table IMutations in the CTE and surrounding residues of the AR hinge region fragmentNameAmino acid sequenceK Snm599 CTE 637PB-ARE-2C3(1) AREAR1LRCYEAGMTLGARKLKKLGNLKLQEEGBNSSAGSPTED23 (±5)5 (±1)AR(28.1)*************——*************TT****E>1000120 (±5)AR(28.2)************——–M*********TT****E>1000>1000AR608N*********N*****************************14 (±3)5 (±1)AR610E***********E***************************340 (±60)4 (±1)AR614T***************T***********************16 (±1)4 (±1)AR617K/622Q******************K****Q***************60 (±10)4 (±1)AR618I/622Q*******************I***Q***************19 (±5)5 (±1)AR619K/622Q********************K**Q***************20 (±1)7 (±1)Schematic representation of the AR1 derived constructs with deletions or mutations in the CTE or the NLS with their K S for the PB-ARE-2 and the C3(1) ARE.

AR(28.1) and AR(28.2) are derived from the human AR, which has three different residues in the C-terminal part of the hinge region fragment, compared to the rat AR. In the C-terminal part of the second zinc finger of the GR-DBD, an α-helix (amino acids 492–503) was described (20.Luisi B. Xu W. Otwinski Z. Freedman L. Yamamoto K. Sigler P. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 26.Härd T. Kellenbach E. Boelens R. Maler B. Dahlman K. Freedman L.P. Carlstedt-Duke J. Yamamoto K.R. Gustafsson J.Å. Kaptein R. Science. 1990; 249: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In the ARHm construct, all the nonhomologous residues of the α-helical structure in the C-terminal side in the AR-DBD (amino acids 594–605) were swapped for those of the GR (Fig. 2). This construct had DNA binding capacities similar to those of the wild type AR1, indicating that the putative helix in the C-terminal region of the second zinc finger had no influence on the difference in DNA sequence recognition between the AR and the GR. However, for high affinity DNA binding to PB-ARE-2, a correct conformation of the helix is necessary. This is illustrated by the mutation of Leu-599 of the AR to the GR homologue Tyr-497 (AR599Y) (Fig. 2). In the x-ray structure of the GR-DBD, Tyr-497 and Leu-501 are oriented toward each other. When a tyrosine is present at both places, as in AR599Y, steric hindrance might prevent the correct folding of the helix, influencing the overall DBD-conformation. We tested this hypothesis by combining the Leu-599 to Tyr with the Tyr-603 to Leu mutation in AR1. As expected, the AR599Y/603L regained its affinity for the PB-ARE-2 leading to the conclusion that Tyr-497 and Leu-501 in the GR are two complementary residues. This is in contrast with the mutated AR construct, AR599Y/610E, which has lost its affinity for PB-ARE-2. The exchange of another nonconserved residue in the putative α-helix of AR1, namely Glu-604, for that of the GR homologue glutamine had no effect on the DNA specificity. To identify the other residues in the second zinc finger necessary for the AR-specific PB-ARE-2 binding, we introduced the GR homologues in the AR1. However, none of the mutated AR1 constructs displayed a dramatic decrease in affinity for PB-ARE-2 or C3(1) ARE (data not shown). Therefore, we took an alternative approach based on the observation that the G/A chimera, containing only part of the second zinc finger and the hinge region of the AR, has a low affinity for the PB-ARE-2. In an attempt to restore the binding to the PB-ARE-2, mutations were introduced in G/A (Fig. 2). The apparent dissociation constants of these constructs indicate that Thr-585 (position 483 in GR1) might be involved in high affinity binding of the AR to PB-ARE-2. In TableII, synthetic oligonucleotides containing either inverted or direct repeats of the left or right half-site of the PB-ARE-2 are listed (PB2-IR1, PB2-IR2, and PB2-DR2). The apparent"

FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein that is specifically expressed in cells of the melanocyte lineage, where it localizes to a specialized late endosome-like compartment, the melanosome (6.Orlow S.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Within melanosomes, tyrosinase initiates melanin formation by enzymatic tyrosine hydroxylase and l-3,4-dihyroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) oxidase activities that are associated with its lumenal domain; a 5,6-dihydroxyindole oxidase activity, also a property of the tyrosinase lumenal domain, may contribute to a subsequent step in melanin synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 1.King R.A. Hearing V.J. Creel D.J. Oetting W.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. III. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 4353-4392Google Scholar). Lack of tyrosinase activity results in the absence of melanin formation due to the inability to form the melanin precursors, l-3,4-dihyroxyphenylalanine andl-3,4-dihyroxyphenylalanine quinone. OCA1 is a direct result of the absence or reduction of melanin.Different germline mutations within the tyrosinase coding region underlie OCA1 disorders of varying severity. In one unusual subset of OCA1, OCA1 TS, the mutations render tyrosinase temperature-sensitive (ts). Consequently, melanin synthesis only occurs in cooler areas of the body, such as the arms and legs. The resultant pattern of peripheral pigmentation is analogous to that of the Siamese cat and the Himalayan mouse (7.Kwon B.S. Halaban R. Chintamaneni C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Invest. 1991; 87: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A number of ts variants of tyrosinase have been molecularly cloned. One variant results from a single base missense mutation that alters an arginine at amino acid position 402 to a glutamine (R402Q). The allele encoding the R402Q variant of tyrosinase is extremely prevalent, representing about 15% of the gene pool among Caucasians (8.King R.A. Townsend D. Oetting W. Summers C.G. Olds D.P. White J.G. Spritz R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Studies in cultured transfected cells of the R402Q variant and the similar but less prevalent R422Q variant have shown that they have ts activity; transfected cells grown at 37 °C display none of the described tyrosinase enzymatic activities, whereas transfected cells grown at 31 °C display all three activities, comparable with that of wild-type (9.Giebel L.B.

Both variants contain mutations that affect residues close to a defined copper binding site within the lumenal domain (11.Kwon B.S. Haq A.K. Pomerantz S.H. Halaban R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7473-7477Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which these mutations render the variants ts have not been elucidated.ts enzyme activity is a reflection of a conformational defect at elevated temperatures and stabilization of an active conformation at reduced temperatures. Defects at the restrictive temperature may be subtle such that only specific molecular contacts required for function are lacking, as in the ts mutants of dynamin from Drosophila melanogaster (12.van der Bliek A.M. Meyerowitz E.M. Nature. 1991; 351: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) and humans (13.Damke H. Baba T. van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Alternatively, defects may be dramatic such that the ts protein is grossly misfolded at the restrictive temperature (14.King J. Haase-Pettingell C. Robinson A.S. Speed M. Mitraki A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), as seen in a number of genetic diseases (15.Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The quality control system recognizes misfolded or unassembled polypeptides and either sequesters them or targets them for degradation to prevent large scale protein aggregation and consequent loss of cellular function (19.Doms R.W. Lamb R.A. Rose J.K. Helenius A. Virology. 1993; 193: 545-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 20.Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar).The major site for quality control within the secretory pathway is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (21.Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Within the ER, newly synthesized polypeptides are retained by the activity of resident chaperone proteins until they are fully folded and assembled, at which point they are released for transport to distal secretory compartments (19.Doms R.W. Lamb R.A. Rose J.K. Helenius A. Virology. 1993; 193: 545-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 22.Klausner R.D. Sitia R.

Defective polypeptides that fail to fold and/or assemble are retained within the ER and/or degraded by ER-associated or cytosolic proteolytic systems, particularly the proteasome, after reverse translocation into the cytosol (24.Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Should partially folded or assembled proteins escape ER quality control and progress to distal secretory compartments, they can be recognized at one of several secondary sites for quality control, as evidenced by several examples in yeast (25.Hong E. Davidson A.R. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 26.Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), and targeted to lysosomes/vacuoles for degradation. Finally, specific chaperones may act to prevent unfolding and degradation within late endosomal/lysosomal compartments (27.Denzin L.K. Hammond C. Cresswell P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2153-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 28.Kropshofer H. Arndt S.O. Moldenhauer G. Hämmerling G.J. Vogt A.B. Immunity. 1997; 6: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, quality control can be exerted at multiple sites within the secretory/endosomal system. ts enzymes with gross defects in folding would be expected to be subject to one or all of these quality control checkpoints.For ts gene products that result in human disorders, distinguishing between subtle and dramatic protein folding defects and determining the intracellular site at which the ts phenotype emerges is important in designing therapeutics to allay clinical symptoms. Here, we analyze the localization and processing of the R402Q variant of human tyrosinase and show that the ts phenotype is due to a defect in protein folding that prevents ER exit. The partial ts phenotype of a wild-type (WT) allelic form of tyrosinase and the lack of an apparent significant increase in ER-associated degradation of the R402Q variant suggest that the R402Q variation exaggerates an inefficient folding process inherent in human tyrosinase when expressed in non-melanogenic cells.DISCUSSIONts allelic isoforms of tyrosinase are abundant throughout the animal kingdom (2.Giebel L.B.

Our data demonstrate that the ts enzymatic activities of the common R402Q allele of human tyrosinase (10.Tripathi R.K. Hearing V.J. Urabe K. Aroca P. Spritz R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23707-23712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are explained by nearly absolute and irreversible ER retention at the restrictive temperature. Growth at 31 °C permits ER exit of at least a fraction of newly synthesized tyrosinase and subsequent transport to late endosomes or melanosomes. Ts ER retention is a feature of other known ts protein variants in the mammalian secretory pathway (15.Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virology. 1993; 193: 545-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), and it is likely that other ts allelic forms of tyrosinase share this phenotype. Indeed, ts ER retention of tyrosinase has been observed in metastatic amelanotic melanoma cells (42.Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); these tumor cells may have either accumulated similar mutations during the development of metastases or derived from donors expressing a ts allelic form of tyrosinase. Taken together, our results imply that ER quality control may be a central mechanism for governing variable pigmentation and vision throughout the animal kingdom.The mechanism underlying ER retention of tyrosinase at the restrictive temperature is most likely a defect that prevents competent folding. The quality control machinery of the ER functions to assure that misfolded polypeptides are retained in the ER before ultimate degradation (20.Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar, 23.Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Pathogenic ts mutants of the cystic fibrosis transporter (16.Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J.

A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), causative agents in cystic fibrosis and Wilson's disease, respectively, are similarly misfolded and retained in the ER at the restrictive temperature but fold sufficiently to bypass ER quality control at reduced temperatures. Non-mutant proteins that fold inefficiently, such as the cystic fibrosis transporter (50.Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and peptide-free major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (51.Ljunggren H.-G. Stam N.J. Öhlén C. Neefjes J.J. Höglund P. Heemels M.-T. Bastin J. Schumacher T.N.M. Townsend A. Kärre K. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1990; 346: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), may also escape quality control and be exported from the ER at reduced temperatures, as we have shown here for WT tyrosinase. We have observed similar results for endogenous tyrosinase expressed in a number of highly pigmented melanoma cell lines, 2D. W. Frank and J. F. Berson, unpublished information. suggesting that this is an intrinsic property of human tyrosinase. We suspect that WT tyrosinase enters a partially folded intermediate at 37 °C that can be stabilized at lower temperatures, because soluble WT tyrosinase molecules that had accumulated at 37 °C could be released and secreted by a subsequent shift to 31 °C. In contrast, the R402Q variant could not be released under these conditions. Perhaps the R402Q variation stabilizes or favors a nonproductive intermediate that occurs normally for tyrosinase, eventually leading to entrapment in a stable misfolded state (14.King J. Haase-Pettingell C. Robinson A.S. Speed M. Mitraki A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Stringent kinetic analyses of the ability to rescue misfolded WT or R402Q tyrosinase at 31 °C and of disulfide bond formation may help to test this model. Unfortunately, its inability to be rescued by a post-synthetic reduction in temperature makes R402Q tyrosinase untenable for use as a synchronous marker of biosynthetic transport in the manner that the ts045 variant of the vesicular stomatitus virus glycoprotein has been used (47.Bergmann J.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 85-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Using Western blotting of cell lysates treated for increasing time periods with specific inhibitors, both WT and R402Q isoforms of tyrosinase were shown to be substrates for degradation by the proteasome. Protected fragments similar in size to deglycosylated full-length tyrosinase molecules accumulated in the presence of the inhibitors. These results support earlier studies demonstrating proteasomal degradation of tyrosinase (41.Mosse C.A. Meadows L. Luckey C.J. Kittlesen D.J. Huczko E.L. Slingluff C.L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 42.Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Despite the differences between WT and R402Q in ER retention, there appeared to be little difference in the rate of accumulation of proteasome-protected fragments. Indeed, the persistence of endoH-sensitive tyrosinase up to 4 h of chase indicates that the rate of tyrosinase degradation by this pathway is slow, and thus, only a fraction of ER-retained WT or R402Q tyrosinase is degraded by this pathway at any given time. These results suggest that the ER quality control system distinguishes between different misfolded states of tyrosinase, targeting some molecules (perhaps those more severely misfolded) for rapid retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation while permitting others (perhaps those with more subtle folding defects or partially folded intermediates) to remain in the ER lumen. Our data suggest that similar fractions of WT and R402Q tyrosinase achieve a state recognized as a substrate for proteasomal degradation. The remaining molecules serve as substrates for ER retention, giving the WT tyrosinase an opportunity to properly fold and exit the ER. Eventually, all tyrosinase unable to correctly fold is degraded by the proteasome and/or by additional proteolytic systems.Because the amino acid variation R402Q is positioned within the lumenal domain, it was not surprising that membrane-tethered chimeric proteins containing the R402Q tyrosinase lumenal domain displayed ts ER retention. Perhaps more surprising was the finding that the lumenal domain alone, expressed as a soluble fragment, was also ts for ER retention. This suggests that the mechanisms that operate to retain this variant within the ER are independent of the membrane association of the substrate. Such flexibility poses an interesting conformational problem, since membrane-bound tyrosinase is restrained to move only in the plane of the membrane, whereas soluble tyrosinase should be free to diffuse throughout the ER lumen once translation is completed. Thus, either these proteins are recognized in a manner independent of topological constraints, there are redundant mechanisms to effect ER retention, or retention mechanisms initiate during protein translocation while the soluble form is still tethered to the membrane. Calnexin, an ER membrane-bound lectin-like chaperone protein, is a major participant in ER retention of misfolded, unassembled, and partially folded integral membrane and soluble polypeptides, (reviewed in Ref. 23.Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar; see also Refs. 52.Zhang J.X. Braakman I. Matlack K.E. Helenius A. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and likely contributes to ER retention of membrane-tethered R402Q tyrosinase and of soluble tyrosinase during translation. Calnexin has been reported to be stably associated with a large fraction of tyrosinase in melanocytes and melanoma cells (42.Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M.

J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).WT tyrosinase that exits the ER in HeLa cells appears to be targeted for degradation in late endosomes and lysosomes, as suggested by the loss of endoH-resistant material during long chase times in pulse-chase experiments, the sensitivity of this loss to ammonium chloride and MME, and the localization of tyrosinase to late endosomes and lysosomes in HeLa cells at steady state. By contrast, tyrosinase in cells of the melanocyte lineage is reported to be highly stable (57.Kobayashi T. Imokawa G. Bennett D.C. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31801-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 58.Potterf S.B. Furumura M. Sviderskaya E.V. Santis C. Bennett D.C. Hearing V.J. Exp.

At least two potential explanations may account for this discrepancy. First, tyrosinase may be inappropriately targeted to a degradative compartment in HeLa cells but not in pigmented melanocytic cells. This is supported by the segregation of tyrosinase-positive compartments from the bulk of lamp1-positive late endosomes and lysosomes in melanoma cells but not in HeLa cells (data not shown and Ref. 60.Orlow S.J. Boissy R.E. Moran D.J. Pifko-Hirst S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 55-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, HeLa cells may lack a stabilizing factor for tyrosinase in late endosomal compartments. This is supported by the lower stability of murine tyrosinase in a melanocyte cell line lacking expression of the tyrosinase-related protein TRP1 relative to a melanocyte line from WT mice (57.Kobayashi T. Imokawa G. Bennett D.C. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31801-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Further analyses of the expression of tyrosinase in pigmented versusnonpigmented cells will be necessary to assess these two mechanisms.Curiously, lysosomotropic reagents protected not only endoH-resistant tyrosinase from degradation but also endoH-sensitive tyrosinase in a pulse-chase experiment (see Fig. 3, A and B). This could potentially be explained by autophagic degradation of aggregates of misfolded tyrosinase that had accumulated in regions of the ER, such as “aggresomes” (61.Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Additional experiments would be required to test this hypothesis and to determine whether this reflects a physiological degradation pathway or is merely due to overexpression of misfolded tyrosinase in transfected cells.What do our results imply for the etiology and treatment of OCA1? There are numerous missense mutations within the gene for tyrosinase that result in OCA1, many of them clustering around the coding region for the putative CuB copper binding site near residue 402. Given the inefficient folding of WT tyrosinase and the further defect in folding of the R402Q variant, it is likely that many of these mutations do not affect enzyme activity per se but rather cause the protein to be misfolded and retained and/or degraded in the ER. The accelerated degradation of tyrosinase observed in amelanotic melanoma cells (42.Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) is likely due to a similar phenomenon in which these cells accumulated mutations that further decrease the fidelity of tyrosinase folding. If such speculation is validated, pharmacological intervention targeted toward enhancing productive folding of tyrosinase in the ER may provide a common method to enhance pigmentation in OCA1 patients carrying distinct mutations in tyrosinase. Further analysis of the effects of enhanced chaperone expression, decreased cell temperature, or cell treatment with stabilizing agents such as glycerol (50.Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) on the ability to export various mutants of tyrosinase would help to determine whether our findings extend to other OCA1 mutants. Oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1)1comprises a group of human disorders characterized by reduced or absent skin pigmentation, vision defects due to reduced optical pigmentation and to misrouting of optic nerve fibers, and enhanced sensitivity to skin and optical cancers (1.King R.A.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein that is specifically expressed in cells of the melanocyte lineage, where it localizes to a specialized late endosome-like compartment, the melanosome (6.Orlow S.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Within melanosomes, tyrosinase initiates melanin formation by enzymatic tyrosine hydroxylase and l-3,4-dihyroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) oxidase activities that are associated with its lumenal domain; a 5,6-dihydroxyindole oxidase activity, also a property of the tyrosinase lumenal domain, may contribute to a subsequent step in melanin synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 1.King R.A.

Ten mutant clones showed cytosolic PTS2-green fluorescent protein, indicative of a defect in PTS2 import, and were classified in five complementation groups,i.e. pex1, pex2, pex5,pex14, and group A. One PEX5-deficient mutant, ZPG231, showed a novel phenotype: PTS2 proteins in the cytosol, but PTS1 proteins and catalase in peroxisomes. In ZPG231, two isoforms of the PTS1 receptor Pex5p, a shorter Pex5pS and a longer Pex5pL, were expressed as in wild-type cells, but possessed the missense point mutation S214F in both Pex5p isoforms, termed Pex5pS-S214F and Pex5pL-S214F, respectively. The S214F mutation was located only one amino acid upstream of the Pex5pL-specific 37-amino acid insertion site. Pex5pS-S214F and Pex5pL-S214F interacted with peroxisomal proteins, including PTS1 protein, catalase, and Pex14p, as efficiently as normal Pex5p. In contrast, the S214F mutation severely affected the binding of Pex5pL to the PTS2 receptor Pex7p. Expression of Pex5pL-S214F in pex5 cell mutants defective in PTS1 and PTS2 transport restored peroxisomal import of PTS1, but not PTS2. Together, the results indicate that ZPG231 is the first cell mutant providing evidence that disruption of the Pex5pL-Pex7p interaction completely abolishes PTS2 import in mammals."

Of these sites, AR binding site 2 (from now on referred to as PB-ARE-2) has a highin vitro affinity for the AR-DBD, whereas the affinity of the GR-DBD is low (14.Claessens F. Alen P. Devos A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19013-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our group has recently identified an androgen-specific enhancer located approximately 3.5 kilobase pairs upstream of the human scpromoter (16.Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Haelens A. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1558-1570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The core enhancer consists of four 5′-TGTTCT-3′-like SR monomer interaction sites (in Ref. 16.Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Haelens A. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1558-1570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, called cores 1–4) and a high affinity binding site for nuclear factor I. The enhancer was also shown to specifically confer androgen and not glucocorticoid responsiveness to the sc proximal promoter. A motif composed of the cores 1 and 2 (sc-ARE1.2), in which both half-sites are essentially arranged as a partial direct repeat with a three nucleotide spacer, was found to be the main AR-DBD interaction site. The GR-DBD does not interact with this motif in vitro. The introduction of a point mutation in sc-ARE1.2, essentially changing the nature of the repeat from direct to partially palindromic (the T at position –4 relative to the central nucleotide was changed to an A) allows the GR-DBD to bind the motif and abrogates the specificity of the steroid responsiveness of the sc upstream enhancer. A third androgen-specific enhancer has been described upstream of the mouse sex-limited protein (mouse SLP) promoter (22.Loreni F. Stavenhagen J. Kalff M. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This enhancer was found to respond only to androgen and not glucocorticoid stimulation when inserted in front of the heterologous thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (23.Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Within the enhancer fragment, three putative steroid receptor interaction sites were identified, two of which (HRE2 and HRE3) were found to be necessary but not sufficient for androgen induction because introduction of a mutation, destroying AR binding, in each of the motifs separately abolishes the androgen response of the enhancer (12.Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). HRE3 was found to be a high affinity binding site for the AR. It does not, however, discriminate between binding of the AR and the GR in vitro (12.Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18.Rundlett S.E. Miesfeld R.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 109: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as an isolated element, it confers both androgen and glucocorticoid responsiveness to the heterologous TK promoter (23.Adler A.J. Danielsen M. Robins D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11660-11663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Androgen specificity of theslp enhancer was therefore attributed to the selective action of other factors interacting with distinct regions within the enhancer. An octamer transcription factor, as well as NFκB and, more recently, AML3/CBFα1, has been proposed to play an important role in the androgen specificity of the slp enhancer (11.Ning Y.-M Robins D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30624-30630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13.Scarlett C.O. Scheller A. Thompson E. Robins D.M.

Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). High affinity steroid receptor binding to or transactivation through the slp-HRE2 element could not be demonstrated. Starting from the similarities between the AR-specific binding motifssc-ARE1.2 and PB-ARE2, we examined which characteristics of these DNA motifs would determine AR-specific DNA recognition. We also investigated whether a change in the binding characteristics of AR- and GR-DBDs would be reflected by an altered steroid responsiveness of thesc enhancer, as well as of the isolated elements in transient transfection experiments. We have extended these findings to the slp-HRE2 and its role in the functionality of theslp enhancer. We thus provide evidence that AR binding to specific DNA-elements might be more generally involved in androgen-specific transcriptional regulation than has originally been assumed (7.Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar).

After digestion, the polymerase chain reaction product was cloned in the EcoRI/BamHI-digested pGEM15Zf(−) cloning vector. XbaI/SacI fragments from the resulting plasmids were cloned in the pTK-TATA-Luc vector, resulting in the insertion of the enhancer fragment in the correct orientation immediately in front of the TK-TATA-box. The wild-type and mutantslp enhancer fragments (nucleotides –1984 to –1902) were generated by hybridizing two synthetic oligonucleotides, overlapping each other over 20 base pairs at their 3′-ends and containingEcoRI and BamHI restriction sites at their 5′-ends, followed by a fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The resulting fragments were cloned asEcoRI/BamHI fragments in pGEM15Zf(−) and subsequently as XbaI/SacI fragments in the correct orientation in the pTK-TATA-Luc vector. The pbpromoter driven luciferase reporter plasmid was made by insertion of a 454-base pair HindIII/BamHI fragment containing the pb promoter (from position –426 to position +28) into the SmaI/BglII-digested pGL3 basic vector. Oligonucleotides containing the wild-type and mutantsc-ARE1.2 and slp-HRE2 motifs, as well as the wild-type C3(1) ARE and the PB-ARE2, as they were used in band shift assays and all containing NheI and XhoI 3′-overhanging ends, were cloned in the NheI-digested TK-TATA-Luc, creating the insertion of four copies of the motifs. All reporter plasmids used in this study were checked by sequence analysis on the ALF express sequencer using the cycle sequencing method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, BE). The DNA-binding domains of rat AR and GR (in Ref. 15.Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, called AR1 and GR1) were purified as described. Binding assays were performed essentially as described (16.Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Haelens A. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1558-1570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except for the fact that the amount of poly(dI-dC) used was 2.5 in stead of 50 ng/μl. A constant amount of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated with increasing amounts of receptor DBD. The percentage of radioactivity that was retarded by dimeric SR-DBD in each lane of the gel was plotted against the protein concentration that was used in that lane. Radioactivity was measured in a STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). For the calculation of the apparent dissociation constants (K S values), the data were analyzed using the SigmaPlot software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Best fits were calculated to curves with allosteric Hill kinetics. The amounts of AR- and GR-DBD used in the calculation of K S values ranged from 1 ng (3.4 and 3.5 nm for the AR-DBD and GR-DBD, respectively) to 1600 ng (5.5 and 5.6 μm for the AR- and GR-DBD, respectively). HeLa cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1000 mg/liter glucose, supplemented with penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The first day of each transfection experiment, cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at a density of 60,000 cells/well and grown in the presence of dextran-coated, charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (5%). The second day, cells were transfected using the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Per well, 400 ng of luciferase reporter vector, 50 ng of an expression vector for the appropriate receptor, and 50 ng of an internal control (pCMV-β-galactosidase) was used. After overnight incubation, cells were grown in the presence or absence of either 1 nmsynthetic androgen R1881 (methyltrienolone) or 10 nmsynthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. After 24 h, cells were harvested using Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and luciferase activities of the cell lysates were measured in a Microlumat LB 96P luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wilstadt, Germany) using the Promega luciferase assay reagent. β-Galactosidase activities of the same samples were measured using the Galacto-Light chemiluminescent reporter gene assay system (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). The luciferase value of each sample was normalized to its β-galactosidase activity. Unless indicated otherwise, luciferase activities were always calculated relative to the luciferase value of a reference reporter (either the pSC-TATA-Luc or the pSLP-TATA-Luc vector). The reference vector was included in each transfection experiment, and its activity in the presence of androgens was set to 100. Induction factors (IFs) are the ratios of the adjusted luciferase values of the stimulated samples over the average adjusted luciferase value of the corresponding nonstimulated samples, co-transfected with the same receptor expression plasmid. In the calculation of S.E. values, each experiment, performed in duplicate, is considered a single experiment. The S.E. values reported for the reference constructs (set to 100 in each transfection experiment) are the averages of the standard errors of the duplicate samples within one experiment. All transfections were performed at least three times, independently. The human AR and rat GR expression plasmids are both driven by the same SV40 promoter and were described previously (16.Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Haelens A. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1558-1570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All samples that were stimulated with androgens were co-transfected with the AR expression plasmid; those stimulated with glucocorticoids with the GR expression plasmid. To exclude cell line-specific effects, all transfection experiments were repeated in COS-7 cells, and essentially the same results were obtained (data not shown). Luciferase reporter constructs driven by the TK minimal promoter and containing thesc enhancer (16; pSC-TATA-Luc) or the slpenhancer (pSLP-TATA-Luc) or driven by the pb proximal promoter (pPB-Luc) showed an androgen-specific responsiveness in transfection experiments in HeLa cells (Fig.1). Average IFs upon androgen stimulation were 40, 32, and 29 for the pSC-TATA-Luc, the pSLP-TATA-Luc, and the pPB-Luc vectors, respectively, whereas their glucocorticoid inductions were 6.4, 3.1, and 5.8, respectively. These findings are in agreement with previously reported results (16.Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Haelens A. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Mol.

The sc-ARE1.2, the PB-ARE-2, and theslp-HRE2 have been shown previously to be essential for the functioning of their respective regulatory regions (12.Adler A.J. Scheller A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6326-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16.Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Haelens A. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Mol.

Specific interaction of the AR-DBD with the rat PB-ARE2 is further explored in the accompanying paper (28.Schoenmakers E. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12290-12297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate binding of the rat AR- and GR-DBD to the sc-ARE1.2 and theslp-HRE2 in band shift assays using concentrations of receptor DBD ranging from 3.4 nm to 5.6 μm(Fig. 2). The C3(1) ARE, a high affinity SR binding motif, was used as a positive control for the binding assay (Fig. 2 A). Binding of the AR-DBD showed normal allosteric Hill kinetics for all three oligonucleotides. For AR- and GR-DBD binding to the C3(1) ARE, apparent dissociation constants (K S values) of 20 and 37 nm, respectively, were calculated. For AR-DBD binding to thesc-ARE1.2 and slp-HRE2 motifs,K S values were 251 and 166 nm, respectively. However, no interaction of the GR-DBD to either of the latter motifs could be demonstrated, even at concentrations as high as 5.6 μm. The functional specificity of both elements was investigated in transient transfection assays in HeLa cells using TK-TATA-driven reporter constructs containing four copies of the respective AREs (Fig.2 B). A luciferase reporter construct containing the C3(1) ARE was induced 15.3- and 50-fold by androgens and glucocorticoids, respectively. A reporter construct containing the sc-ARE1.2 was induced 12.9-fold upon androgen stimulation and only 3.6-fold by glucocorticoids. The reporter construct containing theslp-HRE2 was induced 15.9-fold by androgens and was not responsive to glucocorticoid stimulation (IF: 1.6). To investigate whether the sc-ARE1.2 by itself is the predominant factor in the androgen specificity or whether additional mechanisms are required to impose androgen specificity on the enhancer, the element was replaced with either theslp-HRE2, the PB-ARE-2, or the C3(1) ARE motif. None of these mutations had a dramatic effect on the androgen-stimulated transcriptional activity in co-transfected HeLa cells (Fig.3 A). Glucocorticoid-stimulated transcriptional activity remained low when the sc-ARE1.2 motif was replaced by either the PB-ARE-2 or the slp-HRE2. Replacement of the sc-ARE1.2 motif with the C3(1) ARE, however, dramatically increased glucocorticoid-stimulated transcriptional activity: GR-stimulated luciferase activity of the mutant construct was more than 10-fold higher than that of the wild-type construct (Fig. 3 A). The glucocorticoid induction factor was elevated more than 13-fold in the C3(1) ARE mutated reporter construct compared with the wild-type vector (IFs were 6.4 for the wild-type and 95 for the C3(1) ARE substituted construct). Glucocorticoid induction factors remained unaltered when thesc-ARE 1.2 motif was replaced by the PB-ARE-2 (IF, 6.4) or the slp-HRE2 (IF, 6.6). To exclude possible effects of the sequences flanking thesc-ARE1.2 motif in the sc enhancer or its three-nucleotide spacer on receptor binding, we introduced the two hexameric half-sites of the slp-HRE2, the PB-ARE2, and the C3(1) ARE in the context of sc-ARE1.2 and evaluated AR- and GR-DBD binding to these elements in vitro (Fig.3 B). No significant differences could be found inK S values for AR- or GR-DBD binding to the wild-type motifs and the same motifs in the context of sc-ARE1.2 (data not shown). To determine the sequence requirements for AR-specific binding and transcriptional regulation, we have investigated the effects of point mutations in the sc-ARE1.2 on AR- and GR-DBD binding in vitro as well as on the functionality of the sc ARU. In view of the similarities between the three AR-specific motifs described to date, we chose to mutate the sc-ARE1.2 element at positions +2, –2, and –4 relative to the central nucleotide in the three-nucleotide spacer. The mutation of the A at position +2 to a T creates a perfect 5′-TGTTCT-3′ right half-site motif, common to all high affinity steroid receptor binding elements. Both mutations in the left half-site essentially change the nature of the repeat from partially direct to partially palindromic. The introduction of an A at position –4 in the sc-ARE1.2 increases the affinity of the AR-DBD approximately 2-fold relative to the wild-type element (Table I and Fig.4 A). Although the GR-DBD shows no affinity at all for the wild-type sc-ARE1.2, aK S value of 144 nm was calculated for GR-DBD binding to the –4 T-A mutant. The affinity of the AR-DBD for the element is augmented an additional 3-fold by a subsequent T to A mutation at position –2, whereas GR-DBD binding to the element was not influenced by this mutation. The A to T mutation at position +2 in the sc-ARE1.2 dramatically increases the affinity of both the AR-DBD (K S: 33 nm) and GR-DBD"

Mutations in one common type, the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like module (cbEGF), can lead to a variety of genetic disorders. Here, we describe as a model system structural and functional consequences of two typical mutations in cbEGF modules of fibrillin-1 (N548I, E1073K), resulting in the Marfan syndrome. Large (80–120 kDa) wild-type and mutated polypeptides were recombinantly expressed in mammalian cells. Both mutations did not alter synthesis and secretion of the polypeptides into the culture medium. Electron microscopy after rotary shadowing and comparison of circular dichroism spectra exhibited minor structural differences between the wild-type and mutated forms. The mutated polypeptides were significantly more susceptible to proteolytic degradation by a variety of proteases as compared with their wild-type counterparts. Most of the sensitive cleavage sites were mapped close to the mutations, indicating local structural changes within the mutated cbEGF modules. Other cleavage sites, however, were observed at distances beyond the domain containing the mutation, suggesting longer range structural effects within tandemly repeated cbEGF modules. We suggest that proteolytic degradation of mutated fibrillin-1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders.

In this report we focus on the structural and functional effects of two different mutations within cbEGF modules of fibrillin-1 causing varying forms of the Marfan syndrome, a dominantly inherited disorder characterized by cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular abnormalities. Fibrillins are major integral components of supramolecular fibrillar structures called microfibrils. Two highly homologous members, fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, each contain 43 cbEGF modules that are dispersed among other structural motifs in groups of 1–12 units over the entire molecule (19.Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Dietz H.C. Charbonneau N.L. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 20.Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). From the 137 mutations in fibrillin-1 published in the Marfan data base (13.Collod-Beroud G. Beroud C. Ades L. Black C. Boxer M. Brock D.J. Holman K.J., de, P.A Francke U. Grau U. Hayward C. Klein H.G. Liu W. Nuytinck L. Peltonen L. Alvarez P.A.B. Rantamaki T. Junien C. Boileau C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), 102 occur within cbEGF modules. 26 of these mutations are predicted to cause major disruptions of the fibrillin-1 molecule by introducing frameshifts or by creating stop codons, and 64 different mutations (47% of total number, 12 redundant mutations on the protein level) cause a change of a single amino acid residue in cbEGF modules. These data underscore the importance of cbEGF modules for the biological integrity of fibrillin-1. The point mutations in cbEGF modules can be classified into three groups: (i) mutations eliminating or generating cysteine residues, (ii) mutations of residues directly involved in calcium binding, and (iii) mutations of other residues. The effects of these mutations are believed to alter either the natural folding and/or calcium binding of these modules. For a few fibrillin-1 mutations, the structural/functional effects of small recombinant or synthetic peptides have been reported. For instance, G1127S and R1137P led to misfolding of cbEGF13 (21.Whiteman P. Downing A.K. Smallridge R. Winship P.R. Handford P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7807-7813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22.Wu Y.-S. Bevilacqua V.L.H. Berg J.M. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 91-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas N2144S did not cause an observable structural change of cbEGF32 or the adjacent cbEGF33, but resulted in a reduced affinity for calcium in cbEGF32 (23.Kettle S. Yuan X. Grundy G. Knott V. Downing A.K. Handford P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). How a protein phenotype, “misfolded cbEGF” or “reduced calcium affinity,” can consequently result in the clinical phenotype of Marfan syndrome is not known. In this study, we demonstrate that two Marfan mutations N548I and E1073K in cbEGF modules render recombinantly expressed polypeptides susceptible to proteolysis. Sensitive sites are mapped in detail close to the site of the mutations. Structural analyses demonstrated small changes introduced by the mutations. These results indicate that subtle conformational changes in fibrillin-1 are sufficient to precipitate the cascade of biological events leading to disease. The construction of an episomal plasmid to express wild-type rF18 (Asp910-Val1527; rF18-wt) was described in detail previously (pCEPSP-rF18H (6.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E.

A new plasmid coding for Asp451-Lys1027 of fibrillin-1 (rF45-wt) was generated by subcloning a 3261-bpNheI-NotI fragment from pCEPSP-rF20 (6.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E.

A 222-bpBsu36I-SacI fragment generated from a polymerase chain reaction amplification product with template HFBN8 (19.Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Dietz H.C. Charbonneau N.L. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and primers 8FS (5′-TCAAGAATTAAAGGAACACA-3′) and DR126 (5′-TCGTAGAGCTCGCGGCCGCTTACTATTTGAAGAAAGGCTTTCCA-3′) were ligated with the Bsu36I-SacI restricted pBS-rF20a, resulting in plasmid pBS-rF45. Finally, the 1745-bpNheI-NotI fragment from pBS-rF45 was subcloned into pCEP4/γ2III4 vector (pCEPSP-rF45). To introduce the mutation A1643T (27.Dietz H.C. McIntosh I. Sakai L.Y. Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Pyeritz R.E. Francomano C.A. Genomics. 1993; 17: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) into pCEPSP-rF45, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using pBS-rF45 and the complementary primer pair DR135 (5′-GGACGCTGCATCATCACAGATGGCAGTTTTC-3′) and DR136 (5′-GAAAACTGCCATCTGTGATGATGCAGCGTCC-3′) by the QuikChange procedure as suggested by the supplier (Stratagene). The region between restriction sites NheI and NsiI (721 bp) including the mutation was verified by DNA sequencing and then subcloned into wild-type pBS-rF45. The entire 1745-bpNheI-NotI insert was then subcloned into pCEP4/γ2III4 resulting in pCEPSP-rF45-N548I. Transfection of 293-EBNA cells with the expression plasmids and selection with hygromycin B was performed as described in detail previously (6.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Production of conditioned medium, and purification of rF18-wt and rF18-E1073K was performed as described previously for rF18 (6.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). For purification of rF45 and rF45-N548I, about 2–3 liters of serum-free medium were concentrated by ultrafiltration (30 kDa cutoff) to ∼80–100 ml, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, and passed over HiTrapQ (5 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 1 mm NaCl/ml. Fractions containing rF45 or rF45-N548I were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (10 kDa cutoff) to ∼1.5 ml and passed over a Superose 12 gel filtration column (100 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TBS). Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled and stored at −80 °C. All recombinant polypeptides were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing (Applied Biosystems 475A or 494) resulting in the correct sequence for rF18-E1073K (APLADIDEXEV), rF45-wt (APLADYXQLVXYL), and rF45-N548I (APLADYXQLVRYLXQ). rF18-wt was sequenced previously (6.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Production, purification, and characterization of constructs rF11 and rF6trunc were performed as described in detail previously (6.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To test for correct folding, purified wild-type and mutated polypeptides were analyzed by standard Western blotting techniques as described in detail (28.Keene D.R. Jordan C.D. Reinhardt D.P. Ridgway C.C. Ono R.N. Corson G.M. Fairhurst M. Sussman M.D. Memoli V.A. Sakai L.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Equal aliquots (4.2 μg) of each protein were subjected to SDS electrophoresis in the presence or absence of 5 mm dithiothreitol, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated either with ∼10 μg/ml monoclonal antibody 201 (rF45-wt, rF45-N548I), or a 1:200 dilution of polyclonal antiserum B9543 (rF18-wt, rF18-E1073K). These mono- and polyclonal antibodies are specific for authentic fibrillin-1 and do not react with reduced material. Confluent layers of recombinant cells were incubated in 80-cm2 flasks with 10 ml of serum-free culture medium for 48 h. The medium was harvested and after washing the cell layer twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were solubilized in 1 ml of SDS sample buffer. Equal relative amounts of the serum-free medium (0.25 ml after precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid) and the cell layer (25 μl) were analyzed by standard Western blotting techniques as described in detail (28.Keene D.R. Jordan C.D. Reinhardt D.P. Ridgway C.C. Ono R.N. Corson G.M. Fairhurst M. Sussman M.D. Memoli V.A. Sakai L.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Blotted proteins were incubated with ∼10 μg/ml monoclonal antibody 201 (rF45-wt, rF45-N548I), or 1:1000 diluted monoclonal antibody anti-His (C-term) (Invitrogen), which recognizes the histidine tag at the C-terminal end of rF18-wt and rF18-E1073K. Recombinant polypeptides were dialyzed against TBS, adjusted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml (rF18-wt, rF18-E1073K), 1.4 mg/ml (rF45-wt, rF45-N548I), or 0.93 mg/ml (rF11, rF6trunc), and supplemented with 5 mmCaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA (10 mmCaCl2 or 10 mm EDTA for rF11 and rF6trunc). After a 10-min equilibration period, an aliquot was removed for a zero time control. Enzymes were added at a concentration of 1:20–1:100 (w/w) (plasmin, EC 3.4.21.7, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or 1:100–1:500 (w/w) (trypsin, EC 3.4.21.4, treated with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone; α-chymotrypsin, EC3.4.21.1, treated withN α-p-tosyl-l-lysyl chloromethyl ketone; Sigma; endoproteinase Glu-C, EC 3.4.21.19, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for incubation periods of 0–22 h (plasmin) or 0–60 min (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and endoproteinase Glu-C). The reaction was stopped by adding 2-fold concentrated reducing SDS sample buffer to equal aliquots of the samples and heating at 95 °C for 3 min. Degradation products were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis with homogenous gels containing 7.5–12% (w/v) acrylamide and visualized by Coomassie staining. For N-terminal sequence analysis, the degradation products were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore or ProBlott, Applied Biosystems), stained by Coomassie Blue, excised, and analyzed on a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems Model 475 or 494). The purified recombinant polypeptides were dialyzed against TBS, supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2 or 0.2 mmEDTA, and diluted to concentrations of 0.375 mg/ml. Spectra from 190 to 260 nm were recorded in a 1-mm quartz cuvette at 20 °C on a Jasco J-715 instrument. Purified polypeptides were adjusted to a concentration of 0.15 mg/ml, supplemented with 5 mmCaCl2, and dialyzed against H2O. The samples were diluted to a final concentration of 70% (v/v) glycerol, sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, and dried under vacuum (Edwards Auto 306). Rotary shadowing was performed basically as described with minor modifications (29.Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Replicas were examined at 80 kV in a transmission electron microscope (Zeiss TEM 109). We investigated the structural and functional consequences of two mutations in fibrillin-1, leading to the classical form (N548I) and the “neonatal” form (E1073K) of Marfan syndrome. Both mutations alter critical residues within cbEGF modules that have been shown to be directly involved in calcium binding (30.Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The N548I mutation was introduced into a new fibrillin-1 wild-type construct (rF45-wt, Asp451-Lys1027, Fig.1) spanning the fourth generic EGF-like module to the third 8-Cys module. The E1073K mutation was introduced into the previously described rF18 construct (rF18-wt, Asp910-Val1527, Fig. 1) spanning cbEGF10 to cbEGF22 (6.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutated polypeptides were expressed and efficiently secreted from human embryonic kidney cells in amounts of ∼10–20 μg/ml/day into the culture medium. Each recombinant construct was exclusively detected after a 48-h incubation period in the cell culture medium and virtually no recombinant protein was retained within the cells (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Immunochemical tests for secretion and folding of recombinant polypeptides. A, analysis of wild-type (rF18-wt, rF45-wt) and mutated (rF18-mut, rF45-mut) polypeptides in the serum-free culture medium (M) and the cell layer (C) by Western blotting with specific antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Note that no recombinant protein has been observed in the cell layer. B,analysis of purified recombinant wt and mutated (mut) polypeptides by Western blotting under nonreducing and reducing conditions. Polyclonal antiserum B9543 was used for the rF18 polypeptides and monoclonal antibody 201 was used for the rF45 polypeptides. Note that these antibodies only react with the nonreduced but not with the reduced forms of the recombinant polypeptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Western blotting experiments, the wild-type and mutated polypeptides bound strongly either to monoclonal antibody 201 (rF45-wt and rF45-N548I) or to polyclonal antibodies B9543 (rF18 and rF18-E1073K), whereas reduced material did not bind (rF45-wt, rF45-N548I) or bound only very weakly (rF18-wt, rF18-E1073K) to the corresponding antibodies (Fig. 2 B). These immunochemical tests clearly indicated that the recombinant polypeptides are folded correctly, since epitope recognition of these antibodies depends on intact disulfide bonds. For subsequent structural and functional analyses, the wild-type and mutated polypeptides were purified from conditioned medium to homogeneity. Electron microscopy after rotary shadowing demonstrated, as expected from the shape of full-length fibrillin-1, long extended molecules for the wild-type polypeptides (Fig.3 A). This typical extended shape is another good indicator for correct folding, since this shape is dependent on calcium binding and correct disulfide bonds (31.Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 32.Reinhardt D.P. Mechling D.E. Boswell B.A. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7368-7373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). No differences of the overall shape between the wild-type and the mutated forms were apparent (Fig. 3 A). Measurements of the lengths of well resolved individual particles revealed a small but significant longer shape for rF18-wt (35.4 nm ± 1.6 S.D.;n = 60) as compared with rF18-E1073K (33.7 nm ± 2.1 S.D.; n = 60), and virtually identical lengths for rF45-wt (27.9 nm ± 1.8 S.D.; n = 50) and rF45-N548I (27.5 nm ± 2.3 S.D.; n = 50) (Fig.3 B). Analyses of the constructs by far UV circular dichroism revealed slightly different spectra for the wild-type and the mutated polypeptides (Fig. 4). In the presence of calcium, minima were observed for rF18-wt (θ = −7169 degree cm2 dmol−1) at 212 nm and rF18-E1073K (θ = −6385 degree cm2 dmol−1) at 210 nm (Fig. 4 A), and for rF45-wt (θ = −6908 degree cm2 dmol−1) at 209 nm and rF45-N548I (θ = −5649 degree cm2 dmol−1) at 208 nm (Fig.4 B). In the presence of EDTA, the minima decreased to θ = −10409 degree cm2 dmol−1 (rF18) and θ = −9659 degree cm2 dmol−1(rF18-E1073K) at 206 nm (Fig. 4 C), and to θ = −8542 degree cm2 dmol−1 (rF45), and θ = −8978 degree cm2 dmol−1 (rF45-N548I) at 208 nm (Fig. 4 D). These data indicate that small changes in the secondary structures occur upon introduction of N548I or E1073K into the corresponding constructs. Additional analyses by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated for both wild-type and mutated polypeptides identical gel retention of ∼120 kDa for the rF18 polypeptides (Fig.5, left panels) and ∼80 kDa for the rF45 polypeptides (Fig. 6,left panel).Figure 6Degradation of rF45-wt ( wt ) and rF45-N548I (mut) by various proteases. The recombinant polypeptides were treated in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 with trypsin or chymotrypsin (enzyme:substrate = 1:100 (w/w), 2 min), or plasmin (enzyme:substrate = 1:20 (w/w), 22 h), and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Proteolytic degradation products which were further analyzed by N-terminal sequencing are marked with an arrow and a letter(see Table I and Fig. 7). Positions of reduced marker proteins are indicated in kDa (M).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The recombinant polypeptides were extensively analyzed for their susceptibility to a variety of proteases. rF18 and rF18-E1073K were incubated with trypsin, chymotrypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, and plasmin (Fig. 5). In the presence of calcium, rF18-wt was resistant to proteolytic cleavage. rF18-E1073K showed degradation products of about 70–80 and 20 kDa even after very short incubation times (e.g. 2 min for incubation with chymotrypsin), indicating that rF18-E1073K is much more susceptible to proteolytic degradation as compared with rF18-wt (Fig. 5 A). When rF18-wt and rF18-E1073K were incubated with proteases in the presence of EDTA, no differences in degradation patterns have been observed (Fig.5 B). Both constructs were degraded significantly faster in the absence of calcium as observed previously with other fibrillin-1 subdomains (11.Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1231-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Proteolytic degradation products of rF18-E1073K which were absent in rF18-wt (marked by arrows andletters in Fig. 5) were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing (Table I). All three tryptic sites were within the mutated cbEGF12 either close to the mutation (at position 1076) or somewhat more C-terminal (at positions 1084 and 1110). Although the E1073K substitution introduced a new residue for potential tryptic attack, no cleavage site were observed at position 1073. Sensitive sites produced with chymotrypsin were observed in the last loop of the preceding cbEGF11 at position 1060 or within the last loop of the mutated cbEGF12 at positions 1107 and 1109. The ∼20–25-kDa fragments were identified as the N termini of the respective polypeptides. Degradation with plasmin revealed a sensitive site N-terminal of the preceding cbEGF11 at position 1028, indicating that a structural change must be conveyed beyond the length of one cbEGF module.Table IDegradation products of mutant polypeptidesProteaseCodeN-terminal sequencePositionrowrF18-E1073KTrypsinaISPDLXGR(G)(Q)1076GQXVN(T)PGX(F)1084NXMDIXE1110bAPLADIDEXEN terminusChymotrypsincALDSEER1060dMMKNX(M)DI(D)E1107KNXMDIDEXQ1109eAPLADIDEN terminusfAPLADN terminusPlasmingDINEXKMIP(S)LX(T)1028rowrF45-N548ITrypsinhDGKNXEDMD(E)566TEXRDIDEXL526iAP(L)ADYXQLVN terminusChymotrypsinjTRTEXRDIDE524(H)VTXDGKNXE562kAPLADYXQLVN terminusDegraded protein fragments indicated in Figs. 5 and 6 (code) were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing.

Incubation of this polypeptide with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and plasmin in the presence of calcium demonstrated significantly enhanced susceptibility to proteolytic degradation as compared with the wild-type form (Fig. 6). In all cases, the full-length rF45-N548I (∼80 kDa) is rapidly degraded into 60–65- and 15–20-kDa fragments. In the absence of calcium, degradation progressed much faster and no differences in protease susceptibility between wild-type and mutated forms were observed (data not shown). Sequence analyses of the larger proteolytic fragments generated with trypsin and chymotrypsin resulted in identification of sites at positions 526 and 566 (trypsin) and 524 and 562 (chymotrypsin) (Table I). These cleavage sites are located relatively close to the altered amino acid residue in the last loops of cbEGF3 and the mutated cbEGF4. The intensities of"

Here we report that cell death of thymocytes can be induced after stimulation of β-adrenergic receptor, or by addition of exogenous cAMP. Apoptotic cell death in both cases was observed with the appearance of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP end labeling reactivity and the activation of caspase-3 in S49 T cells. Using thymocytes deficient in either Gαs or PKA, we find that engagement of β-adrenergic receptors initiated a Gαs-dependent, PKA-independent pathway leading to apoptosis. This alternative pathway involves Src family tyrosine kinase Lck. Furthermore, we show that Lck protein kinase activity can be directly stimulated by purified Gαs. Our data reveal a new signaling pathway for Gαs, distinct from the classical PKA pathway, that accounts for the apoptotic action of β-adrenergic receptors.

These receptors relay the signals to heterotrimeric G proteins, which directly modulate the activity of enzymes or ion channels (1.Gilman A. Annu. Rev.

Variant cell lines deficient in responses to agents that elevate intracellular cAMP levels or exogenous cAMP proved to be instrumental in deciphering the components that mediated cAMP production and function (5.Coffino P. Bourne H.R. Tomkins G.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1975; 85: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6.Bourne H.R. Coffino P. Tomkins G.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1975; 85: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The mutant cell lines were identified by their ability to be resistant to cAMP treatment, which normally lead to growth arrest and cytotoxicity. One of the resistant cell lines,kin −, displayed a complete lack of PKA activity, as well as binding of cAMP (7.Insel P.A. Bourne H.R. Coffino P. Tomkins G.M. Science. 1975; 190: 896-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8.Steinberg R.A. Wetters T.V.D. Coffino P. Cell. 1978; 15: 1351-1361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol was also used to select for cell lines (such as cyc − and UNC) that were defective in Gαs and were not capable of generating cAMP (9.Bourne H.R. Coffino P. Tomkins G.M. Science. 1975; 187: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10.Haga T. Ross E. Anderson H.J. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2016-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The purification of Gs was assayed by reconstitution with membranes prepared from cyc − cells since these cells contained normal levels of β-adrenergic receptors and adenylyl cyclase activity, but lacked Gαs (11.Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3715-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12.Northup J.K. Sternweis P.C. Smigel M.D. Schleifer L.S. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl.

The effects of cAMP and isoproterenol upon S49 cell viability suggested that activation of β-adrenergic receptors leads to cytolytic signaling possibly through a PKA-dependent mechanism. Here we have examined β-adrenergic receptor initiation of cell death in thymocytes. Using mutant cell lines deficient for particular gene activities, we provide genetic evidence that β-adrenergic receptor initiates an apoptotic pathway in thymocytes that is not dependent upon PKA. Significantly, we further demonstrate that this novel PKA-independent pathway requires the action of a Src family tyrosine kinase, Lck. A potential mechanism of activation is proposed based upon the ability of purified Gαs to regulate the kinase activity of purified Lck protein. This mechanism may help to explain physiological effects of β-adrenergic receptors and other Gs-coupled receptors that give an apoptotic cell outcome. S49 mouse lymphoma T cells (and their mutant derivatives cyc −, kin −, UNC, and H21a cells) were obtained from the Cell Culture Facility at the University of California at San Francisco, and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum. The Jurkat and Lck-deficient T cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. In situ detection of apoptotic cells was performed by using TUNEL assay (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP end labeling), as described previously (13.Gu C. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Srivanian A. Chao M.V. J. Neuroscience. 1999; 19: 3043-3049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells treated with or without 1 mm cAMP (adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate, N6, O2′-dibutyryl, and sodium salt were from Calbiochem), or 100 μm isoproterenol (Sigma) for 24 h were plated on microscope slides (Fisher) at 500 rpm for 2 min in cytospin machine (Shandon). The air dried cell samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldyhyde solution for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice. The slides were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline several times and the samples were then processed for TUNEL using the in Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline for 3 times, mounted, and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope. Cells were plated in each well of the 96-well plates and treated in triplicate with 1 mmcAMP, 1, 10, 100, or 300 μm isoproterenol, 100, 300, or 1000 μm terbutaline, or untreated for 24, 48, or 72 h. The addition of inhibitors or other compounds was carried out concomitantly with treatment. Viability was measured by quantitative colorimetric assay with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) in triplicate in 96-well plates using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Viability was expressed as the ratio of the signal obtained from treated cells and the signal from untreated control cells. Preparation of cell extracts, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot were performed as described (13.Gu C. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Srivanian A. Chao M.V. J. Neuroscience. 1999; 19: 3043-3049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells treated with or without isoproterenol and cAMP were harvested from 60-mm plates. Pellets were then resuspended in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Resuspended pellets were kept on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected as the whole cell lysate. 50 μg of cell lysate proteins were run on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membranes were incubated in 1 × TBST (Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20) plus 5% milk for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibody (anti-caspase-3 antibody CSP-3B and CM1 from IDUN Pharmaceuticals, or anti-actin monoclonal antibody) diluted in 1 × TBST and 1% milk for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were washed 3 times with TBST buffer and then incubated with secondary antibody (horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The blots were washed again and processed by Supersignal Chemiluminescence (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film. Single-cell suspension of thymocytes were prepared by mechanical disruption of thymic lobes in Hanks' buffered saline solution (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and passage through a 100-μm nylon cell strainer. Cells were resuspended at 2 × 107/ml and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD8α and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD4 (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Double positive thymocytes were sorted and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin, and streptomycin,l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). Events within a pre-defined forward- and side-scatter gate were collected and stored in list mode files using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) and analyzed using CellQuest Software. An immunocomplex kinase assay was performed as described previously (14.Wan Y. Kurosaki T. Huang X.-Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 15.Wan Y. Huang X.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14533-14537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Membrane extracts were made after stimulation with isoproterenol (100 μm for 1 min). Lck immunoprecipitation was carried out with an antibody to Lck (Santa Cruz). Lck kinase assay was done with 5 μg of acid-denatured enolase as substrate. The kinase buffer included 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmMnCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 30 min at 30 °C, samples were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE. Gels were then exposed for autoradiography. Recombinant Gαs was purified from Escherichia coli as described (16.Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The pQE-Gαs plasmid (from Drs. T. Kozasa and A.G. Gilman) was transformed into BL21. One liter of bacterial culture was grown at room temperature until the absorbance at 600 nm was ∼1.4. Then the culture was split into 2 liters and G protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Research Products International) for 18 h at room temperature. The bacterial pellet was resuspended into lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.7% CHAPS, 20 mm GDP, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) on ice. Lysozyme (1 mg/ml) was added and the sample incubated on ice for 30 min. After cell lysis by sonication, the lysate was spun down at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Ni-NTA agarose resin (5 ml, from Qiagen) was added into the supernatant after pre-equilibration of the resin with lysis buffer. The mixture was gently agitated overnight at 4 °C and packed into a C16/20 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed with lysis buffer plus 100 mm NaCl, and eluted with lysis buffer plus a linear gradient of imidazole (10–500 mm). Gαs was in the 200 mm imidazole fraction. Gαselutions were pooled for further chromatography on hydroxylapatite column. Gαs elute fractions were changed to HPHT buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm K2HPO4) and purified by using a Bio-Rad ChT-II cartridge with a linear gradient of phosphate (20–500 mm). Gαs was activated with GTPγS at 30 °C for an hour. Control experiments showed no effect of GTPγS (up to 1 μm) alone on Lck kinase activity. Purified Lck was from Upstate Biotechnology. Recombinant Csk was purified fromE. coli as described (18.Sondhi D. Xu W. Songyang Z. Eck M.J. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Lck by Csk and removal of Csk by chromatography was done as described (17.Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Protein concentration, purity, and identity were analyzed by silver stain and Western blot. An in vitro kinase assay was performed as described previously (19.Bence K. Ma W. Kozasa T. Huang X.-Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20.Jiang Y. Ma W. Wan Y. Kozasa T. Hattori S. Huang X.-Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Purified Lck was phosphorylated using purified Csk as described previously (17.Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Lck protein (10 ng) in kinase buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2) was combined with 2 μg of Src substrate peptide (KVRKIGEGTYGVVKK). The appropriate amount of purified G-protein subunits was added and kinase buffer was used to bring the total reaction volume to 20 μl. [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi; 3,000 Ci/mmol) was added and the mixture incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer. After 90 °C for 5 min, the substrate peptide was separated on 20% SDS-PAGE gel, dried, autoradiographed, and quantified with a PhosphorImager. Bands were cut out of the gel and counted in a scintillation counter. Even though cytolysis of S49 cells by exogenous cAMP and isoproterenol was observed over two decades ago, the mechanism leading to this form of cell death has not been thoroughly investigated. To study the nature of cell death imposed by exogenous cAMP and isoproterenol, we used TUNEL assay to detect DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, apoptotic cells stained with green fluorescence were readily identified as TUNEL-positive among S49 cells treated for 24 h with isoproterenol (Fig. 1 A, panel d). A similar profile of TUNEL positive cells was observed 24 h after treatment with cAMP (Fig. 1 A, panel f). To quantitate the effects of isoproterenol and cAMP on S49 cell death, uptake of MTT was used as an independent measure of cell viability. Wild type S49 cells displayed a loss of viability after treatment with isoproterenol or exogenous cAMP in a time- and dosage-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). S49 cells were treated with 1, 10, 100, or 300 μm isoproterenol or 1 mm cAMP and then assayed after 24, 48, and 72 h. The selection of concentrations of isoproterenol and cAMP used here was based on previous studies with S49 cells (5.Coffino P. Bourne H.R. Tomkins G.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1975; 85: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6.Bourne H.R. Coffino P. Tomkins G.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1975; 85: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Treatment with cAMP (1 mm) induced ∼30% cell death after 24 h, ∼80% after 48 h, and ∼90% after 72 h, compared with untreated cells. Increasing concentrations of isoproterenol induced an increased level of S49 cell death in a time-dependent manner. After 3 days of treatment with 100 μm isoproterenol, only ∼20% of the cells remained alive (Fig. 1 B). The mode of cell death in S49 cells was further verified by an increase in caspase activity following cAMP and isoproterenol treatment. Activation of caspases is required for the execution of apoptosis. Caspases exist as proenzymes that require proteolytic cleavage for their activation and have been divided into two main groups, initiator and effector caspases (21.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). Caspase-3, one of the major downstream effector caspases, is cleaved at consensus sequences into p20 and p10 subunits upon activation (22.Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using polyclonal antibodies against the cleaved peptides (p10 and p20) of caspase-3 (CPP32) in immunoblotting analysis, we observed that both p20 and p10 subunits were produced when S49 cells were treated with isoproterenol or cAMP for 18 h (Fig. 1 C). Pretreatment of S49 cells with the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked isoproterenol-induced caspase-3 cleavage (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors and exposure to exogenous cAMP can trigger apoptosis in S49 cells. To understand how β-adrenergic receptors and exogenous cAMP initiate apoptosis, we have employed well characterized mutant S49 cell lines that are deficient in specific signaling activities. kin − cells which lack PKA activity were selected as a result of the sensitivity of S49 cells to cytolysis by cAMP (7.Insel P.A. Bourne H.R. Coffino P. Tomkins G.M. Science. 1975; 190: 896-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8.Steinberg R.A. Wetters T.V.D. Coffino P. Cell. 1978; 15: 1351-1361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A cyc − mutant variant, which lacks Gαs, was also isolated as a result of treatment of viable cells in the presence of isoproterenol (9.Bourne H.R. Coffino P. Tomkins G.M. Science. 1975; 187: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PKA in cAMP and β-adrenergic receptor-induced cytolysis, we employed thekin − cells. With 1 mm cAMP, even after 3 days of treatment, nearly all kin −cells were still viable, as measured by three different assays: TUNEL immunoreactivity (Fig. 2 A), MTT cell viability (Fig. 2 B), and caspase-3 cleavage (Fig.2 C). Therefore, the absence of PKA activity in S49 cells prevented apoptosis initiated by exogenous cAMP. Thus, PKA activity controls cAMP-induced death signaling. In contrast, isoproterenol still induced apoptosis inkin − cells as effectively as observed in the parental S49 cells. Apoptosis of kin − cells was verified by TUNEL, MTT measurements, and caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2 A (panel d), TUNEL positive cells (as indicated by green fluorescence) could still be clearly identified when kin − cells were treated with isoproterenol. The dose and time dependence of isoproterenol-induced cell death of kin − cells, as monitored by MTT assay, were similar to those of wild type S49 cells (compare Fig.2 B with Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, addition of adenylyl cyclase inhibitors (2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine and MDL-12, 330A) did not block isoproterenol-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi proteins, had no effect on isoproterenol or cAMP-initiated apoptosis (data not shown). Stimulation of endogenous Gi-coupled somatostatin receptors did not induce apoptosis in S49 cells (data not shown). The induction of caspase-3 cleavage products by isoproterenol treatment ofkin − cells (Fig. 2 C) further indicated that isoproterenol caused cell death in the absence of PKA activity. To confirm these findings and to rule out the possibility that the effects of isoproterenol are due to its oxidative degradation, we tested another β-adrenergic receptor agonist, terbutaline, which is resistant to oxidative degradation (10.Haga T. Ross E. Anderson H.J. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2016-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 D, increasing concentrations of terbutaline (100 μm, 300 μm, or 1 mm) induced an increased level of S49 cell death in a time-dependent manner. The concentrations of terbutaline used here were similar to those used in previous studies (10.Haga T. Ross E. Anderson H.J. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2016-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The response ofkin − cells to terbutaline was similar to that of the parental S49 cells (Fig. 2 E). In the absence of PKA, terbutaline still induced cell death, similar to the treatment with isoproterenol. These results strongly suggest that β-adrenergic receptors could use a PKA-independent route leading to apoptosis. We next investigated the role of Gαs in β-adrenergic receptor-induced apoptotic signaling by examining a S49 cell line lacking Gαs (cyc −). Exogenous cAMP was found to induce apoptosis incyc − cells, similar to wild-type S49 cells (Fig. 3 A). However, in contrast with wild-type S49 cells, cyc − cells were resistant to isoproterenol-induced cell death. Treatment with 1 or 10 μm isoproterenol for 3 days did not induce an apoptotic response (Fig. 3 A). 100 or 300 μmisoproterenol caused some cell death, which was significantly delayed and reduced compared with the data from wild-type S49 cells. Incyc − cells, 100 μm isoproterenol, after 2 days of treatment, induced only ∼5% cell death (Fig.3 A), compared with ∼60% in wild-type S49 cells (Fig.1 B). After 3 days of treatment with 100 μmisoproterenol, a significant (∼70%) fraction ofcyc − cells still remained alive, compared with ∼20% of wild-type S49 cells. Thus, the β-adrenergic receptor-initiated apoptotic pathway requires Gαs. The small fraction of dead cells after 3 days of isoproterenol treatment may indicate a Gαs-independent signaling pathway(s) (23.Abramson S.N. Martin M.W. Hughes A.R. Harden T.K. Neve K.A.

Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with two other Gαs mutated S49 cells, UNC and H21a (10.Haga T. Ross E. Anderson H.J. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2016-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26.Miller R.T. Masters S.B. Sullivan K.A. Beiderman B. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Furthermore, these results were also confirmed with the β-adrenergic receptor agonist terbutaline (Fig. 3 B). After 3 days of treatment, 100 or 300 μm terbutaline did not induce cell death, similar to isoproterenol treatment. Taken together with the above data, these results demonstrate that β-adrenergic receptors use Gαs to initiate a PKA-independent pathway that results in apoptosis. To demonstrate the physiological relevance and the generality of the findings in S49 cells, we next assessed the effects of isoproterenol and exogenous cAMP on primary thymocytes isolated from mice. Primary double positive (CD4+CD8+) immature thymocytes were isolated and analyzed for TUNEL reactivity with a FACScan flow cytometer. As shown in Fig. 4 A, both isoproterenol and exogenous cAMP treatment caused an increase in the percentage of TUNEL positive cells in CD4+CD8+thymocytes. After treatment for 40 h, 10 μmisoproterenol induced ∼18% cell death and 100 μmisoproterenol caused 55% cell death (Fig. 4 A). Primary thymocytes were also very sensitive to cAMP treatment (Fig.4 A). These results were consistent with the effects of isoproterenol and cAMP on S49 cells. In mature T cells, apoptosis is frequently the result of induction of FasL or TNF-α ligands, which act through their cognate death receptors, Fas or p55 TNF receptor. Signaling from these death receptors activate caspases through adapter proteins, leading to apoptosis (27.Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar). We have investigated the possible involvement of these death receptors in β-adrenergic or exogenous cAMP initiated apoptotic signaling pathways. We did not detect any changes of FasL or TNF-α mRNA levels after treatment of thymocytes with either isoproterenol or cAMP (data not shown). Furthermore, isoproterenol or cAMP still induced apoptosis in thymocytes isolated from Fas-deficient lpr mice (data not shown). A neutralizing anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody (MP6-XT22) did not block isoproterenol or cAMP initiated apoptosis of thymocytes (data not shown). Thus, neither FasL/Fas nor TNF-α/TNFR appeared to be essential for β-adrenergic receptor or cAMP-initiated apoptotic pathways in thymocytes. Most developing thymocytes are destined to undergo apoptosis during selection. During negative selection, a strong signal through ligation of the T cell antigen receptor induces cell death, which is most likely independent of Fas or TNF signaling (28.Herron L.R. Eisenberg R.A. Roper E. Kakkanaiah V.N. Cohen P.L. Kotzin B.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3450-3459PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Singer G.G. Abbas A.K. Immunity. 1994; 1: 365-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Since T cell antigen receptor signaling is initiated by the activation of Src family tyrosine kinases (30.Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), we explored whether inhibition of Src tyrosine kinases would attenuate isoproterenol-initiated apoptosis. We therefore employed PP1, a specific inhibitor for the Src family tyrosine kinases (31.Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Werriger E.J. Pollak B.A. Cownolly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of primary thymocytes with 5 μm PP1 reduced the isoproterenol-induced apoptosis by ∼50% (Fig. 4 B), while it had no effect on exogenous cAMP-induced apoptosis (Fig.4 B). PP1 treatment also reduced isoproterenol-induced apoptosis in S49 cells and tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins as assayed by Western blot with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (data not shown). On the other hand, pretreatment with a PKA inhibitor (KT5720) blocked exogenous cAMP initiated apoptosis (by ∼80%), but not apoptosis initiated by isoproterenol (Fig.4 C). Thus, in primary thymocytes isolated from mice, β-adrenergic receptor and exogenous cAMP use distinct apoptotic pathways. Cell death induced by β-adrenergic receptor appeared to require the action of Src family tyrosine kinases, but not PKA. Since Lck is the major Src family tyrosine kinase in T cells, we analyzed the role of Lck tyrosine kinase in β-adrenergic receptor-initiated apoptosis. Lck-deficient Jurkat T cells have been established (32.Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Treatment of wild-type Jurkat T cells with 100 μm isoproterenol resulted in ∼60% cell death (Fig.5 A). Significantly, Lck-deficient Jurkat cells were resistant to isoproterenol-induced apoptosis, which was delayed and reduced compared with wild-type Jurkat cells (Fig. 5 B). The PKA inhibitor KT5720 did not have any effect on isoproterenol-induced apoptosis in wild-type and Lck-deficient Jurkat cells (Fig. 5, A and B). A residual apoptotic effect of isoproterenol in Lck-deficient cells may indicate a functional compensation of other Src family tyrosine kinases in T cells, or the effect of a Lck-independent pathway. Furthermore, isoproterenol induced similar cAMP production in wild-type and Lck-deficient Jurkat cells (data not shown). Together with the above tyrosine kinase inhibitor data, these results suggest that Src family tyrosine kinases represent a potential signaling component of the β-adrenergic receptor-initiated apoptotic pathway in T cells. Since the Src family tyrosine kinase Lck partly mediates β-adrenergic receptor initiated apoptosis in T cells, we next examined the activation of Lck by β-adrenergic receptors. As shown in Fig. 6 A, isoproterenol stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors in S49 cells could increase the kinase activity of Lck, as assayed by both its autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate enolase. This activation could be blocked by pretreatment with the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (Fig. 6 A). β-Adrenergic receptor activation of Lck is Gαs-dependent (assayed in cyc − cells), but PKA-independent (assayed inkin − cells) (data not sho"
https://openalex.org/W2032372303,"During limb development, epithelial cells in the apical ectodermal ridge keep the underlying mesenchymal cells in a proliferative state preventing differentiation by secreting signaling molecules such as epidermal growth factor (EGF). We investigated the molecular mechanism of the EGF effect on the regulation of micromass culture-induced chondrogenesis of chick limb bud mesenchymal cells as a model system. We found that expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor was increased transiently during chondrogenesis. Exogenous EGF inhibited chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells, and this effect was reversed by the EGF receptor inhibitor AG1478. EGF treatment also inhibited the expression and activation of protein kinase C-α, whereas it activated Erk-1 and inhibited p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, all of which appeared to be involved in the EGF-induced inhibition of chondrogenesis. Stimulation of the EGF receptor blocked precartilage condensation and altered the expression of cell adhesion molecules such as N-cadherin and integrins α5 and β1. All these EGF effects were reversible by AG1478. The data indicate that EGF negatively regulate chondrogenesis of chick limb bud mesenchymal cells by inhibiting precartilage condensation and by modulating signaling pathways including those of protein kinase C-α, Erk-1, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase."

The mature NCX1 is a glycosylated protein (12.Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys.

The original membrane topography model based on hydropathy analysis predicted 11 transmembrane domains, separated by small loops and by a large intracellular loop (>500 amino acids) between transmembrane domains 5 and 6. A more recent model based on cysteine accessibility studies has revised the number of predicted transmembrane domains down to 9 (16.Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), eliminating 2 from the C-terminal half of the exchanger. Although the large intracellular loop is not strictly necessary for the activity of the exchanger, it contains important regulatory elements (17.Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen.

The amount of the major variant present in neurons (the AD isoform) is altered by protein kinase A (24.He S. Ruknudin A. Bambrick L.L. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4833-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although α-adrenergic stimulation led to the increase of NCX1 mRNA in cultured cardiac myocytes (25.Menick D.R. Barnes K.V. Dawson M.M. Kent R.L. Cooper G.T. J. Cardiovasc. Fail. 1996; 2: S69-S76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), glucocorticoids and protein kinase A down-regulated it in vascular smooth muscle cells. Protein kinase C had the same effect in endothelial cells (26.Smith L. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27527-27531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Smith L. Porzig H. Lee H.W. Smith J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C457-C463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in the expression of theNCX1 gene have also been observed during cardiac development (28.Boerth S. Zimmer D. Artman M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 354-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pressure overload (29.Kent R. Rozich J. McCollam P. McDermott D. Thacker U. Menick D. McDermott P. Cooper G.t. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1024-H1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two additional exchanger genes encoding proteins with high homology to NCX1 have also been cloned: NCX2 (30.Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lipton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and NCX3(31.Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Whereas NCX1 is expressed at high levels in heart, and is thus normally referred to as the “cardiac form” of the protein even if also present in other tissues, significant amounts ofNCX2 and NCX3 mRNAs have only been detected by Northern blots in brain and skeletal muscles. However, minor amounts were detected also in other tissues using more sensitive RT-PCR methods. Some splice variants have been detected for NCX3but none so far for NCX2. Although the exchanger proteins have not been satisfactorily purified, comparisons of the biochemical properties of the NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 exchangers have been made on membrane preparations and on overexpressing cells. Because no significant differences were detected (32.Linck B. Qiu Z. He Z. Tong Q. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C415-C423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the rationale for the existence of three separate NCXgenes is obscure. Brain cells, in particular neurons, contain large amounts of all three basic NCX isoforms and of their splice variants and are thus good models for study. In this research, their expression was investigated during the development of rat cerebellum and of cultured cerebellar granule neurons. The work has shown that Ca2+ and calcineurin are critical to the expression of the exchanger genes, supporting the idea that one of the major differences among the NCX genes is the regulation of their transcription. The pTM3 vector and the vvT7 virus were gifts from Dr. B. Moss (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cyclosporin A and FK506 were a kind gift of Dr. Mauro Zurini (Novartis, Basle, Switzerland). Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM or DME/F12) and other tissue culture supplements were from Sigma or Life Technologies. Poly-l-lysine and 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide were from Sigma. 45Ca2+, [α-32P]dCTP, and [14C]ATP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Nitrocellulose filters for Western blotting and Nytran for Northern blotting were from Schleicher & Schuell. Nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate were from Promega (Madison, WI). Chemiluminescence substrates CDP-starTM and NitroblockII were from Tropix (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides were purchased from MGW-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Ampli-Taq Gold polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 5–10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin in 5.5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient expression of NCX1 was achieved by infecting cells with t7 polymerase containing vaccinia virus at a multiplicity of infection of 20 followed by transfection of the plasmid DNA (33.Iwata T. Galli C. Dainese P. Guerini D. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Granule cells were dissociated from the cerebella of 7-day-old Wistar rats as described (34.Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balázs R. Jørgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Hepes modification, Sigma) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 7 μm p-aminobenzoic acid, 100 μg/ml pyruvate, and 100 microunits/ml insulin on poly-l-lysine-treated plates at a density of 2–3 × 105 cells/cm2 in the presence of 5.3 or 25 mm KCl. After 24 h, 10 μm cytosine arabinofuranoside was added to inhibit mitotic cell growth. Neuronal survival was estimated by measuring the amount of colored formazan in the cells by the reduction of 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (35.Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 943-946PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of contaminating astrocytes was estimated by immunocytochemistry using a monoclonal antibody specific for the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunocytochemistry was performed as described earlier (36.Foletti D. Guerini D. Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 670-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from granule cells according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (37.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized using a random primer (First-strand cDNA synthesis kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed using the following oligonucleotides: NCX1-F (rat NCX1, 1760–1782), atgttatcattccctataaaacc; NCX1-R (rat NCX1, 2117–2136), ctcctctttgctggtcagtg; NCX2-F (rat NCX2; 1453–1472), ctgcgtgtgggcgatgctc; NCX2-R (rat NCX2; 1965–1983), gacctcgaggcgacagttc; NCX3-F (rat NCX3, 2534–2555), gacagtagaaggaacagccaag; NCX3-R (rat NCX3; 2808–2828), tttagggtgttcacccaatac; G3PDH-F (rat G3PDH, 371–391), ccaaaaggggtcatcatctcc; G3PDH-R (rat G3PDH, 994–1015), gtaggccatgaggtccaccac; Fos-F (rat fos, 660–680), aagtctgcgttgcagaccgag; Fos-R (rat fos, 1040–1020), gtctgctgcatagaaggaacc; PMCA4CII (rat PMCA4CII, 3622–3647), gaggaggtgtaacggcagaag. The conditions for the PCR reactions were as suggested by Perkin-Elmer for the Taq Gold polymerase. The identity of the PCR-generated fragments was verified by sequencing. The G3PDH fragment encompassed cDNA nucleotides 371–1015 (38.Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). RNA was denatured by formaldehyde and formamide and fractionated on a 1% agarose gel containing 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, 8 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and 6% formaldehyde. After separation, RNA was transferred to Nytran filters by capillary elution in 10× SSC buffer, prehybridized, and hybridized in 5× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSPE, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 0.2–1 × 106 cpm/ml labeled DNA, and 50% formamide at 42 °C overnight. Nytran filters were washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS twice at room temperature for 15 min, once at 55 °C for 30 min, and once at 65 °C for 20 min prior to the exposure to x-ray films or to PhosphorImager screens. The gel sample buffer contained 6m urea, 5% SDS, 4% dithiothreitol, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mm EDTA. After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose sheet (39.Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44841) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl) with 3% gelatin and then incubated for 60–90 min with exchanger polyclonal antibodies (diluted 1/500 or as indicated) in TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% gelatin). After three washes with TBST, the membrane was incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega) for 1 h followed by washing. The staining reaction was carried out either with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate according to the ProtoBlot System (Promega) or with chemiluminiscence substrate CDP-starTM (Tropix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Granule cells were cultured under different conditions for 4 days at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate. The medium was replaced with methionine-free minimum essential medium supplemented with [35S]methionine (150 μCi/ml) and incubated overnight. The cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and crude membrane proteins were prepared. The labeled cells (corresponding to about 5,000,000 cpm) were solubilized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS. NET buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% gelatin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) was added to dilute SDS to a final concentration of 0.2%. Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate were added to final concentrations of 0.3 and 0.5%, respectively. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 15,000 ×g, the supernatant was incubated with the primary antibody (5 μl of serum) at 4 °C on a rocking plate for at least 1 h. To recover the immunoprecipitates, protein A-coupled Sepharose CL-4B (20 μl pre-equilibrated in NET buffer) was added to the mixture and incubated at 4 °C for at least 30 min under gentle rocking. The protein A-Sepharose-primary antibody complex was recovered by centrifugation (1–2 min in a microcentrifuge) and washed four times with 20 volumes of NET buffer, twice with NPT buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The material bound to protein A-Sepharose was released by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate or x-ray films. Cells were resuspended at a density of 5–10 × 106 cells/ml in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 75 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and subjected to three cycles of freeze-thaw. The particulate fraction was sedimented at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting protein pellet was resuspended in 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% sucrose and frozen at −70 °C. Cerebella were dissected from rat brains and homogenized in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 320 mmsucrose, 5 μg/ml each pepstatin, antipain, and leupeptin with a loose Potter homogenizer. A crude synaptosomal membrane fraction was obtained by centrifuging the post-nuclear supernatant at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The material precipitated at 100,000 × g was defined as the microsomal fraction. Granule cells (1.25 × 106/well) were plated on poly-lysine-coated, 12-well plates and cultured in the presence of 25 mm KCl or 25 mm KCl and 100 nm FK506 for 7 days. The cells were washed twice with 140 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ouabain, 25 μmnystatin, 20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.4, and incubated for 15 min in the same buffer at 37 °C. After two washes with 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, Ca2+ uptake was initiated by overlaying the cells with a buffer containing 140 mmKCl, 50 μm CaCl2(45Ca2+ 2–4.106 cpm/ml), 1 mm ouabain, 20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.4 (uptake buffer). Control experiments were carried out by substituting 140 mm NaCl for KCl in the uptake buffer. The reaction was stopped at different time intervals with a buffer containing 10 mm LaCl3, 100 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.4. The amount of Ca2+taken up by the cells was determined after their lysis in 2% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Portions of the NCX1 (amino acids 566–691 (3.Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar)) and the NCX2 (amino acids 486–661 (30.Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lipton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) sequences located in the large cytosolic loop were chosen to raise isoform-specific antibodies (a portion of the sequence of NCX3 located in this region was also chosen). The corresponding cDNA fragments were amplified from rat brain RNA by RT-PCR using the following oligonucleotides: NCX1-F (1760–1782), atgttatcattccctataaaacc; NCX1-R (2117–2136), ctcctctttgctggtcagtg; NCX2-F (1453–1472), ctgcgtgtgggcgatgctc; NCX2-R (1965–1983), gacctcgaggcgacagttc. The fragments were cloned into the expression vector pRSET. The expression of the Histidine-tagged fusion peptides was performed according to the procedure suggested by Invitrogen (Leek, The Netherlands). The fusion proteins encompassed 36 amino acid residues deriving from the vector. The NCX1 and NCX2 peptides were purified on a nitrilo-triacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) column under denaturing conditions, yielding highly purified products (>95% according to Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels). The polypeptides were utilized to immunize rabbits, using standard procedures (40.Stauffer T. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The antibodies were affinity-purified on an antigen-coupled Sepharose column as described earlier (40.Stauffer T. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for the NCX1 and NCX2 isoforms were prepared using peptides encompassing the region subjected to alternative splicing (Fig.1 A) as epitopes, because this region shows a low degree of sequence conservation in the three isoforms: The identity of the peptides was below 44% (Fig.1 B). Fig. 1 B also lists a peptide derived from the main loop of NCX3. It had been planned originally to generate antibodies specific for NCX3 as well, choosing for this purpose a domain of low sequence conservation; however, none of the injected rabbits produced an adequate NCX3 antiserum. The NCX1-specific antiserum recognized the exchanger in dog cardiac sarcolemma (bands at about 110, 160, and 70 kDa) or the NCX1 expressed in HeLa cells (Fig.1 C). These three bands are typical for NCX1; the 70-kDa band is a proteolytic product (33.Iwata T. Galli C. Dainese P. Guerini D. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the 110-kDa band is the full-length protein, and the 160-kDa band is an internally locked variant of the exchanger that migrates with abnormal mobility (41.Santacruz-Tolosa L. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The amount of the internally locked version of the exchanger varies with the preparation and cell type and was not visible in overexpressing cells; this may have been a consequence of a different membrane composition of Hela as compared with muscle cells. No exchanger-specific bands were recognized by the NCX2 antiserum in these membranes. The NCX2 affinity-purified antibodies recognized instead a strong band at 102 kDa, which was the expected mass of NCX2 in brain membranes. Further experiments showed a very good correlation between the amount of NCX2-specific mRNA and the 102-kDa immunoreactive band. Blots with the NCX1 and NCX2 peptides used to immunize the rabbits and with the peptide derived from NCX3 indicated that the reaction of the NCX1 and NCX2 antibodies was isoform-specific (not shown), i.e. none of them recognized NCX3. Analysis of the cerebellum from developing rats showed that the expression of NCX2 increased markedly during post-natal development, whereas only slight changes were observed for NCX1 (Fig.2 A). To simplify the study, experiments were then performed on cultured granule cells. Under appropriate conditions, these cells survive for a relatively long time, and their cultures contain more than 95% neurons (Fig. 2 B). In the presence of physiological concentrations of KCl (5.3 mm), the cells matured to full neurons, but their numbers steadily decreased during the first days of culture, with only a few surviving after 7 days (Fig. 2 B, top). The experiment in Fig. 2 C shows that, in analogy to what was observed in whole cerebellum, the NCX2 protein became strongly up-regulated during the first days in culture in the 5.3 mm KCl medium. By contrast, as had been the case for the cerebellum, no evident changes were observed in the expression of NCX1. The long-term survival of granule cells in culture requires the chronic depolarization of the plasma membrane by higher concentrations of KCl (Fig. 2 B, bottom) (34.Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balázs R. Jørgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Guerini D. Garcia Martin E. Zecca A. Guidi F. Carafoli E. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 265-273PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that under these conditions the expression of some of the Ca2+ transporting proteins, specifically, plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps and plasma membrane and internal Ca2+ channels, underwent significant changes (43.Bessho Y. Nawa H. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 44.Genazzani A.A. Carafoli E. Guerini D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5797-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 45.Guerini D. Garcia Martin E. Gerber A. Volbracht C. Leist M. Merino C.G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1667-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As preliminarily indicated in a recent review (46.Carafoli E. Genazzani A. Guerini D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266 (623): 624Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was also affected by these conditions. Fig. 2D shows that a drastic reduction of the NCX2 protein occurred; After 5 days in 25 mm KCl, hardly any of the protein could be detected (Fig. 2 D), whereas only marginal effects were observed for NCX1. The expression of NCX2 was very sensitive to the depolarizing treatment; an increase of KCl in the medium from 5.3 to 15 mm was sufficient to almost completely down-regulate it (Fig. 2 E). RT-PCR with isoform-specific oligonucleotides was used to detect NCXtranscripts, in particular their alternatively spliced variants (20.Kofuji P. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5145-5149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,47.Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1250-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of NCX1, sequencing demonstrated that seven different splice isoforms were present after 3 days of culturing in non-depolarizing KCl concentrations (Fig.3 A, lane M). In the case ofNCX1, up to four different PCR fragments were visible in gels (Fig. 3, lane 1). In both the cerebellum and the cells, the AD spliced variant was predominant (Fig. 3 A, comparelanes 1–4 with lanes 5 and 6). In cells cultured in 25 mm KCl for 3 to 5 days, the amounts of the AD and ADF isoforms increased, and this increase was accompanied by the disappearance of the larger variants (Fig. 3 A). At variance with NCX1, the RT-PCR experiment revealed a large, depolarization-dependent down-regulation of theNCX2 transcript (Fig. 3 B1), which was confirmed by Northern blotting (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, the NCX3transcript became up-regulated by the depolarizing conditions (Fig. 3 B2). The depolarization of granule cells by 25 mm KCl causes a sustained, albeit limited, increase of intracellular Ca2+ (45.Guerini D. Garcia Martin E. Gerber A. Volbracht C. Leist M. Merino C.G. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1667-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This is because of the increased potential across the neuronal plasma membrane (from −70 to −40 mV) and the consequent opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. After 5 days in culture, the increase was about 3-fold (from about 50 to about 150 nm). Two experiments were carried out to verify whether the depolarization effects on NCX2 expression were the direct results of the increased Ca2+ influx. Cells were incubated in the presence of the L-type channel agonist BayK 8644 (Fig.4 A), or the influx of Ca2+ was increased by manipulating the extracellular calcium concentration (Fig. 4 B). The agonist failed to influence the level of NCX2 protein at the physiological concentration of KCl (5.3 mm) but reproducibly reduced its level when the KCl concentration in the culturing medium was raised to 10 mm (Fig. 4 A). Under these conditions, no effect on the level of NCX1 protein was observed. Similarly, increasing the extracellular concentration of Ca2+ had a dramatic effect on the expression of NCX2 even at non-depolarizing KCl concentrations. When the extracellular Ca2+ concentration was raised to 3.6 mm, the level of NCX2 protein decreased very markedly, even in 5.3 m KCl, and disappeared almost completely at 5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 4 B). Again, the effect was specific for NCX2, i.e. it was not observed with NCX1. Prior to investigating the role of calcineurin, attempts were made to establish whether the Ca2+ effects on NCX2 expression could be mediated by calmodulin kinases. Unfortunately, the most widely used inhibitors of these enzymes, among them KN-92 and KN-93, proved highly toxic to granule cells, i.e. the great majority of the cells died after a few hours of incubation with these inhibitors. The time of survival was too short to reliably explore a possible function of calmodulin kinases. To investigate the possible involvement of the Ca2+-calmodulin-stimulated phosphatase, calcineurin experiments were carried o"

Here, we demonstrate that the mutant enzyme exhibits an aberrant double-stranded DNA exonuclease activity, intrinsically producing a 3′-terminal single-stranded DNA overhang that is an ideal substrate for RecA protein-promoted strand invasion. Thus, the mutant enzyme constitutively processes double-stranded DNA in the same manner as the χ-modified wild-type RecBCD enzyme.

This nuclease modification allows the production of a long 3′-terminal ssDNA1 tail, which is the preferred substrate for RecA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange (13.Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1991; 66: 361-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14.Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol.

Upon modification of nuclease activity, RecBCD enzyme also promotes the loading of RecA protein onto this ssDNA tail (16.Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The RecA protein-ssDNA complex, or presynaptic filament, can then initiate strand invasion into a homologous duplex DNA molecule (17.Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although the majority of homologous recombination in wild-type E. coli is initiated at χ by the combined actions of RecBCD enzyme and RecA protein (18.Smith G.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19.Dower N.A. Stahl F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7033-7037Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), there are recBCD mutants that promote wild-type levels of recombination, and yet are χ-insensitive. For example, E. coli strains that lack a functional RecD subunit are recombination-proficient, but recombination is completely independent of χ (20.Biek D.P. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 594-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Chaudhury A.M. Smith G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genome. 1989; 31: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of the RecBC(D−) enzyme revealed that it is nuclease-deficient, but retains helicase activity, and can unwind dsDNA molecules to produce long tracts of ssDNA. Like the RecBCD enzyme after χ recognition, RecBC enzyme also coordinates the loading of RecA protein onto the 3′-terminal ssDNA it produces, further defining the way in which this enzyme promotes χ-independent recombination (23.Churchill J.J. Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast to the nuclease-deficient RecBC enzyme, an inability of the nuclease-proficient mutants to respond properly to χ can also manifest itself in vivo as a drastic reduction in homologous recombination, as well as a heightened sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Strains bearing the recB2109 mutation are phenotypically similar to a recB null strain; both display a severe reduction in conjugal recombination, sensitivity to mitomycin C, and a lack of χ-mediated recombinational hotspot activity (24.Amundsen S.K. Neiman A.M. Thibodeaux S.M. Smith G.R. Genetics. 1990; 126: 25-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike a recB null strain, however, recB2109cells do not facilitate plaque formation by phage T4 gene2 −, demonstrating that the RecB2109CD enzyme is functional in vivo and that it retains a significant amount of helicase or nuclease activity. Biochemical characterization of the RecB2109CD enzyme demonstrated that it possesses all the biochemical activities of the wild-type enzyme as follows: ATPase, helicase, and ds- and ssDNA nuclease (25.Eggleston A.K. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 605-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The only significant defect of the RecB2109CD enzyme observed in vitro was an absence of nuclease modification at χ. This discovery offered a possible explanation for the failure to promote χ-stimulated recombination; this enzyme was unable to modify 3′ to 5′ nuclease activity and so proceeded through a dsDNA molecule degrading the potentially recombinogenic 3′-terminal ssDNA. However, here we show that the RecB2109CD enzyme displays an asymmetry of dsDNA degradation that is uncharacteristic of the wild-type enzyme but is, instead, characteristic of the χ-activated RecBCD enzyme. The mutant enzyme degrades dsDNA primarily in the 5′ to 3′ direction, producing processed dsDNA with a 3′-terminal overhang. Although the RecB2109CD nuclease activity produces a substrate suitable for RecA protein action, the RecB2109CD enzyme is unable to facilitate the loading of RecA protein onto these ssDNA products. We conclude that RecA protein loading is an essential function of the RecBCD enzyme and that the generation of a recombinogenic 3′-terminal ssDNA, although necessary, is not sufficient for initiation of recombination by the RecBCD enzyme. All solutions were made using reagent grade chemicals and Barnstead NANOpure water. Radiolabel was purchased from NEN Life Science Products.

All concentrations of DNA are given in nucleotides, unless otherwise indicated. The strain containing the recB2109 gene that was sequenced, V1000 (27.Ponticelli A.S. Schultz D.W. Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Cell. 1985; 41: 145-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), is the same as that used to purify the RecB2109CD enzyme (25.Eggleston A.K. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 605-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The recB2109 gene was sequenced from both a plasmid template purified using a Qiagen midi-prep (Qiagen) and a PCR-amplified 3649-base pair fragment containing the recB2109 gene. The PCR product was separated from the primers and nonspecific PCR products by electrophoresis through a 1% SeaPlaque gel (FMC BioProducts) and further purified using a Wizard PCR Prep kit (Promega Corp.). The primers for both PCR-amplifying and -sequencing the recB2109 gene were purchased from Operon Technologies, Inc. The substrates for these reactions were constructed as follows (Fig. 1 A). The pBR322 plasmid devoid of χ was linearized with HindIII restriction endonuclease and subsequently subjected to degradation by exonuclease III to yield a dsDNA molecule bearing 5′-terminal overhangs (12.Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The DNA was either 3′- or 5′-end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP or [γ-32P]ATP, respectively, as described previously (26.Arnold D.A. Bianco P.R. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16476-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The tailed, labeled DNA was then treated with AseI restriction endonuclease to produce an unlabeled, nearly blunt (two nucleotide overhang) dsDNA end appropriate for RecBCD or RecB2109CD enzyme loading. Thus, both substrates contain radiolabel only at the end distal from the point of entry of the RecBCD or RecB2109CD enzyme (Fig.1 A). A portion of each labeling reaction was not cleaved with AseI as a control to ensure that the tailed ends would block degradation of the substrate by either the wild-type or mutant enzyme. The reaction buffer contained 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm nucleotides of tailed, labeled DNA, 2 μmSSB protein, and magnesium acetate ranging from 0.25 to 10 mm. The reactions were performed at 37 °C and initiated by addition of 0.46 nm RecBCD or RecB2109CD enzyme (one enzyme per 2.5 accessible dsDNA ends). The 30-μl reactions were stopped after 4 min with 10 μl of 5× stop mix and 14 μg of proteinase K, as described previously (26.Arnold D.A. Bianco P.R. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16476-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The reactions were separated by native gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose in TAE buffer for 550 V-h. The gels were exposed to PhosphorImager screens that were later scanned by a Molecular Dynamics STORM 840 PhosphorImager; the gel images were analyzed using ImageQuaNT version 4.1a software. These reactions were performed as described previously in reaction buffer containing 8 mm magnesium acetate and 5 mm ATP (16.Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). 40 μm nucleotides of plasmid DNA was treated with 0.92 nm functional RecBCD or RecB2109CD enzyme in the presence of 4 μM SSB and 20 μm RecA proteins for 3 min prior to addition of 11 units of exonuclease I. The tailed plasmid was created as described for the dsDNA exonuclease asymmetry assays; the plasmid containing the χ site was linearized with AvaI restriction endonuclease and 5′-end-labeled as previously reported (26.Arnold D.A. Bianco P.R. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16476-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The recB2109gene was sequenced from both a plasmid encoding recB2109 as well as a pool of PCR fragments (equivalent of 12 individual PCR reactions) amplified from this plasmid. Primer walking was performed on both strands of these dsDNA substrates, and all samples were submitted for sequencing to the Division of Biological Science Automated DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of California, Davis. The dsDNA exonuclease activity of the wild-type RecBCD enzyme is asymmetric; the 3′ to 5′ nuclease activity is more vigorous than the 5′ to 3′ nuclease activity, which results in a more extensive degradation of the 3′-terminal strand at the entry site of the enzyme (11.Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 87-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To determine if the RecB2109CD enzyme retained the same asymmetry of dsDNA exonuclease as that displayed by the wild-type enzyme, we constructed a linear, asymmetric dsDNA substrate that allowed us to independently monitor the degradation of each strand (Fig.1 A). First, linearized plasmid DNA was digested with exonuclease III to produce long (∼300 nucleotides), 5′-terminal ssDNA tails that block entry of RecBCD and RecB2109CD enzymes at both ends. Next, the substrate was either 3′- or 5′-end-radiolabeled and subsequently digested withAseI restriction endonuclease to provide an unlabeled, blunt dsDNA where the RecBCD or RecB2109CD enzyme can enter. Thus, the resultant asymmetric DNA substrates have both a blunt end that does not contain a radioactive label and a tailed end that carries a radioactive label on either the 5′ or 3′ terminus (Fig.1 A). For simplicity, the strand corresponding to the 5′-terminal overhang is defined as the “top strand,” and its complement is defined as the “bottom strand.” This construct allowed determination of the asymmetry of dsDNA exonuclease activity by revealing whether the 5′-end-labeled top strand or the 3′-end-labeled bottom strand was preferentially degraded by the enzyme. Neither enzyme is able to act on an exonuclease III-tailed, dsDNA substrate that was not digested with AseI restriction endonuclease, demonstrating that the 5′-terminal tails block entry of both the wild-type and mutant enzymes (Fig. 1 B, lanes 12–14, and26–28). A smaller dsDNA fragment is also produced by theAseI digest, which is referred to as the “AseI fragment” in Fig. 1. This molecule is also tailed and labeled in the same orientation as the large fragment, but its degradation was not followed quantitatively. The nuclease activities of RecBCD enzyme are sensitive to the concentration of free magnesium ions in solution, and this sensitivity is reflected in the frequency of endonucleolytic cleavage on each DNA strand during unwinding. If the magnesium ion concentration is very low, the frequency of nucleolytic cleavages on both strands is infrequent; if the magnesium ion concentration is very high, degradation of both strands is quite extensive. As a result, the ability to detect an asymmetry of dsDNA degradation is affected by the magnesium ion concentration. Therefore, reactions were carried out over a range of magnesium ion concentrations, which was achieved by varying the ratio of magnesium acetate to ATP in the reaction buffer. The magnesium acetate concentration in these experiments ranged from 0.25 to 10 mm, whereas the ATP concentration remained at 1 mm (Fig. 1 B). As expected, when the 5′-end-labeled substrate is processed by wild-type RecBCD enzyme, there is sufficient degradation (3′ to 5′) of the top strand to limit detection of a full-length ssDNA over this range of magnesium acetate concentrations (Fig. 1 B, lanes 15–19). However, when the 3′-end-labeled substrate is processed under low magnesium ion conditions, full-length ssDNA is produced due to the low frequency of nucleolytic cleavage (5′ to 3′) on the bottom strand (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). As the magnesium acetate concentration increases, less full-length bottom strand ssDNA is produced due to the increased frequency of endonucleolytic cleavage (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–5). The RecB2109CD enzyme displays a different behavior. When the mutant enzyme processes the 5′-end-labeled substrate, full-length top strand ssDNA is produced under all conditions tested (Fig.1 B, lanes 21–25), demonstrating a markedly reduced 3′ to 5′ nuclease activity. In contrast, when the 3′-end-labeled DNA is tested (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7–11), essentially no full-length ssDNA is produced, indicating the presence of a vigorous 5′ to 3′ nuclease activity. The disparate amounts of full-length ssDNA products inlanes 21–25 versus lanes 7–11 clearly demonstrate that the 5′ to 3′ nuclease activity is significantly more active than the 3′ to 5′ nuclease activity. These results show that RecB2109CD enzyme behaves in a manner opposite that of the wild-type enzyme, by preferentially degrading the bottom strand during unwinding. Due to the low processivity of the RecB2109CD enzyme under these conditions (28.Eggleston A.K. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 621-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), partial duplexes are observed as a smear visible on the gel between the full-length dsDNA substrate and the full-length ssDNA product. These partial duplexes are not detectable in reactions performed at higher concentrations of ATP, which allows the RecB2109CD enzyme to display a higher processivity (Fig. 2). The RecB2109CD enzyme possesses a significantly more active 5′ to 3′ than 3′ to 5′ nuclease activity; thus, processing of a linear, duplex DNA molecule will produce a 3′-ssDNA tailed duplex, which is the appropriate substrate for RecA protein-mediated homologous pairing (29.Konforti B.B. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,30.Konforti B.B. Davis R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6916-6920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the genetic data clearly demonstrate that therecB2109 strain is severely deficient for homologous recombination (24.Amundsen S.K. Neiman A.M. Thibodeaux S.M. Smith G.R. Genetics. 1990; 126: 25-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that merely producing a 3′-terminal ssDNA tail is not sufficient to promote recombination in vivo. A second function of the χ-modified RecBCD enzyme is to facilitate the loading of RecA strand exchange protein onto the 3′-terminal χ-containing ssDNA (16.Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Since the RecB2109CD enzyme can produce a 3′-terminal ssDNA tail, the ability of this enzyme to load RecA protein onto this ssDNA was tested. The loading of RecA protein onto ssDNA by RecBCD enzyme was demonstrated previously by exploiting the ability of RecA protein to protect ssDNA from degradation by exonuclease I (16.Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). When the RecBCD enzyme processes χ-containing dsDNA, three ssDNA products are produced as follows: full-length ssDNA, downstream χ-specific fragments, and upstream χ-specific fragments, all of which are susceptible to degradation by exonuclease I. SSB protein, which binds specifically to ssDNA, cannot protect ssDNA from exonuclease I. On the contrary, if RecA protein is present during processing of the duplex DNA substrate, the downstream χ-specific fragment is specifically bound by RecA protein and protected from degradation. However, this coordinated loading of RecA protein is dependent on neither 3′ to 5′ nuclease activity nor χ recognition. The nuclease-deficient, recombination-proficient RecBC enzyme (31.Lovett S.T. Luisi-DeLuca C. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1988; 120: 37-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Palas K.M. Kushner S.R. J. Biol.

Churchill J.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) constitutively loads RecA protein on to the 3′-terminal ssDNA (top strand) produced during unwinding, irrespective of the presence or absence of χ (23.Churchill J.J. Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since RecB2109CD enzyme processes duplex DNA to yield a 3′-terminal ssDNA tail, it was of interest to test whether it could also facilitate RecA protein loading like the RecBC and RecBCD enzymes. Tailed dsDNA substrates that were radioactively labeled at only the 5′ terminus of the top strand were used to test the ability of RecB2109CD enzyme to facilitate the loading of RecA protein (Fig. 2). When the ssDNA products of RecB2109CD enzyme are treated with exonuclease I, the top strand ssDNA fragments are fully degraded, regardless of the presence (Fig. 2, lanes 1–5) or absence (Fig. 2, lanes 7–9) of RecA protein during processing of the DNA substrate. As a control, coupled reactions (i.e. RecA protein present during RecBCD processing of the duplex DNA substrate) using wild-type enzyme with χ-containing dsDNA were performed and, as expected, both full-length ssDNA and upstream χ-specific fragment are quickly degraded upon addition of exonuclease I, whereas the downstream χ-specific fragment is not (Fig. 2,lanes 13–18). It was previously shown that RecB2109CD enzyme does not stimulate RecA protein-mediated joint molecule formation in the presence of χ (28.Eggleston A.K. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 621-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To verify that the RecB2109CD enzyme does not load RecA protein at χ, the exonuclease I-protection assays were performed with the same χ-containing dsDNA as was used with the RecBCD enzyme; no protection was observed. 2D. A. Arnold and S. C. Kowalczykowski, unpublished observations. These results show that the RecB2109CD enzyme is incapable of facilitating the loading of RecA protein onto the 3′-terminal ssDNA produced during processing of a duplex DNA substrate. We propose that the inability of the RecB2109CD enzyme to facilitate loading of RecA protein is responsible for the recB2109recombination defect observed in vivo. TherecB2109 gene was sequenced, and a single missense mutation was found. The base pair at position 2420 was changed from C/G to T/A, resulting in a threonine to isoleucine change at amino acid position 807, 121 amino acids upstream of the “hinge region” separating the N-terminal region from the C-terminal region of the RecB subunit (35.Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence for the recB2109 gene has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base with the accession number AF179304. The ability of RecBCD enzyme to initiate recombination is attributed to two consequences of its interaction with the χ recombination hot spot, nuclease modification and facilitated RecA protein loading (Fig. 3). Prior to χ recognition, the RecBCD enzyme preferentially degrades a dsDNA substrate in the 3′ to 5′ direction. Interaction with χ serves to attenuate this 3′ to 5′ nuclease activity, such that a 3′-terminal ssDNA tail is produced onto which the RecBCD enzyme facilitates the loading of RecA protein (11.Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 87-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 12.Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C.

Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Although the modification of RecBCD nuclease activity is necessary to preserve a 3′-terminal ssDNA for RecA protein-promoted strand invasion, it was previously unclear whether directed RecA protein loading by RecBCD enzyme is also an essential function of RecBCD enzyme in vivo. Here we establish that a recombination-defective mutant RecBCD enzyme, which appropriately processes DNA, fails to load RecA protein onto this 3′-terminal ssDNA strand. Thus, we conclude that RecA protein loading is essential for the initiation of recombination by RecBCD enzyme. recB2109 cells are severely defective in homologous recombination. Prior analysis of the RecB2109CD enzyme revealed that this mutant does not attenuate 3′ to 5′ nuclease activity at χ, and it was proposed this defect was responsible for its failure to promote recombination in vivo (25.Eggleston A.K.

Biol. 1993; 231: 621-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Despite the sensibility of this conclusion, the work presented here demonstrates that the recombination defect of the RecB2109CD enzyme is not so simple. Even though the RecB2109CD enzyme fails to recognize χ, it displays an unexpected pattern of nuclease behavior that essentially mimics that of the χ-activated RecBCD enzyme. This behavior results in the χ-independent generation of a 3′-ssDNA overhang. Thus, if the processing of dsDNA to produce a 3′-terminal ssDNA species were sufficient to promote recombination, then the RecB2109CD enzyme should be recombination-proficient. However, we demonstrate that the RecB2109CD enzyme is also unable to facilitate the loading of RecA protein onto these 3′-terminal tails, perhaps as a consequence of its inability to recognize χ. This finding suggests that the RecBCD recombination pathway is absolutely dependent on the ability of RecBCD enzyme to coordinate the loading of RecA protein onto ssDNA. The corollary to this hypothesis is that enzymes that load RecA onto a 3′-terminal ssDNA, regardless of the presence of χ, would be recombination-proficient. In fact, the RecBC enzyme (lacking the RecD subunit) is a nuclease-free helicase that constitutively loads RecA onto the 3′-terminal ssDNA produced by unwinding (23.Churchill J.J. Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and strains expressing functional RecBC enzyme (recD −) are recombination-proficient (22.Thaler D.S. Sampson E. Siddiqi I. Rosenberg S.M. Thomason L.C. Stahl F.W. Stahl M.M. Genome. 1989; 31: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31.Lovett S.T. Luisi-DeLuca C. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1988; 120: 37-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,32.Palas K.M. Kushner S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3447-3454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings and our current data, we propose that the inability to coordinate the loading of RecA protein is the biochemical defect directly responsible for the severe recombination deficiency of the recB2109 strain. Sequencing of the recB2109 gene revealed a point mutation that results in a single amino acid change at position 807, 121 amino acids upstream of the flexible linker segment (928–933) separating the C-terminal domain from the N-terminal domain of the RecB subunit (35.Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The 30-kDa C-terminal domain is required for all of the nuclease activities of RecBCD enzyme (35.Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and although the recB2109mutation is not a part of the C-terminal domain, it does affect both 3′ to 5′ and 5′ to 3′ nuclease activities of the RecBCD enzyme, supporting the assertion that RecB plays an important role in the regulation of nuclease activity. Recent work from our laboratory (23.Churchill J.J. Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) also showed that the C-terminal domain of the RecB subunit is required for RecA protein loading. When the RecB subunit lacking the C-terminal domain is complexed with a wild-type RecC subunit, the truncated RecBC enzyme does not stimulate the loading of RecA protein. 3J. J. Churchill and S. C. Kowalczykowski, submitted for publication. These findings, together with the data reported here, further contend that the RecB subunit is intimately involved in both RecBCD nuclease activity and the directed loading of RecA protein. Interaction of RecBCD enzyme with χ mediates two classes of biochemical events, modification of nuclease activity and the commencement of RecA loading. The RecB2109CD enzyme allowed the examination of one consequence of χ recognition, nuclease modification, in the absence of the other. The model shown in Fig. 3illustrates the consequences of processing χ-containing duplex DNA by RecBCD, RecBC, and RecB2109CD enzymes. The RecBCD enzyme generates a 3′-terminal ssDNA tail through specific interaction with a χ site, which mediates the attenuation of 3′ to 5′ nuclease activity. The RecBC enzyme lacks nuclease activity, so 3′-terminal (and 5′-terminal) ssDNA is produced by unwinding of any duplex DNA substrate. The altered asymmetry of nuclease activity of the RecB2109CD enzyme also allows preservation of the 3′-terminal ssDNA, since this enzyme preferentially degrades the 5′-terminal strand rather than the 3′-terminal strand. However, only the recombination-proficient enzymes, RecBCD and RecBC, facilitate the loading of RecA protein, allowing preferential invasion of the 3′-terminal ssDNA tail into a homologous supercoiled DNA molecule. RecB2109CD enzyme does not perform this function and does not stimulate the incorporation of the 3′-terminal ssDNA tail into RecA protein-mediated joint molecules (28.Eggleston A.K. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 621-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The fact that RecB2109CD enzyme produces a 3′-terminal ssDNA tail, but does not promote recombination, supports the conclusion that nuclease modification is necessary, but not sufficient, for initiation of recombination by RecBCD enzyme. The fact that the RecB2109CD enzyme does not mediate the loading of RecA protein strongly suggests that this is a function that is essential for the initiation of homologous recombination by the wild-type RecBCD enzyme.

In a previous transgenic mouse analysis, the expression pattern of the endogenous amelogenin gene was recapitulated by a reporter gene driven by a 2.2-kilobase mouse amelogenin proximal promoter. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the spatiotemporal expression of the amelogenin gene during odontogenesis, the mouse amelogenin promoter was systematically analyzed in mouse ameloblast-like LS8 cells. Deletion analysis identified a minimal promoter (−70/+52) containing a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-binding site upstream of the TATA box. In transient transfection assays, C/EBPα up-regulated the promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. The C/EBP-binding site was necessary for both C/EBPα-mediated transactivation and basal promoter activity. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrated that C/EBPα bound to its cognate site in the amelogenin promoter and that the binding was specific. Endogenous C/EBPα was detected in LS8 cells, and overexpression of exogenous C/EBPα in LS8 cells was able to increase the expression level of the endogenous amelogenin protein. The activity of the amelogenin promoter in rat parotid Pa-4 cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was minimal, ranging from 20 to 30% of the activity in ameloblast-like cells. Transient transfection experiments showed that C/EBPα transactivated the mouse amelogenin reporter gene in Pa-4 cells, but not in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Taken together, these data indicate that C/EBPα is a bona fide transcriptional activator of the mouse amelogenin gene in a cell type-specific manner.

Enamel, the only epithelially derived calcified tissue in vertebrates, is synthesized by ameloblasts. Amelogenins are essential to the proper regulation of enamel mineralization.

A 2263-nucleotide proximal promoter element from the mouse X-chromosomal amelogenin gene has been demonstrated by transgenic mouse analysis to direct the expression of a reporter gene in a temporal and spatial pattern that is essentially identical to that of the endogenous amelogenin gene (5.Snead M.L.

During organogenesis, a programmed differentiation of embryonic epithelial cells is often characterized by the highly regulated expression of tissue-specific genes activated in response to inductive interactions with embryonic mesenchyme. The biochemical identities of the inductive signals that direct mammalian epithelial determination and differentiation have been elusive; however, studies of the regulated expression of tissue-specific gene products in developing epithelia may facilitate the molecular dissection of these interactions. The regulated expression of the ameloblast-specific amelogenin gene in the developing mouse tooth organ is an excellent model for studying developmentally regulated gene expression. We hypothesize that the regulated transcription of amelogenin by specific activator(s) and repressor(s) in ameloblast cell lineage results in the spatiotemporal expression of amelogenin required for proper enamel formation. Gene expression is regulated at several levels, including activation of gene structure, transcription initiation, termination of transcription, nuclear RNA processing, mRNA translation, and mRNA stability. Unlike several other developmentally regulated genes (9.Cedar H. Cell. 1988; 53: 3-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), the methylation pattern of CpG islands in the promoter region is not associated with the regulated transcription of the amelogenin gene (10.Couwenhoven R.I. Snead M.L. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 290-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Extensive homologies exist in the promoter regions of the bovine, human, and murine X-chromosomal amelogenin genes. There is a 70% identity within the 300-base pair region upstream of the transcription initiation site, suggesting that transcriptional regulation is likely to play an important role in the spatiotemporal expression of amelogenin. For a TATA box-containing promoter, the preinitiation complex is assembled in a highly regulated and defined order (11.Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The assembly of the preinitiation complex on a core promoter is sufficient to initiate transcription at a minimal level. However, the rate of transcription can be increased by an activator or turned off by a repressor. The CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs)1 are a family of related basic region leucine zipper transcription factors involved in the regulation of various aspects of cellular differentiation and function in multiple tissues. Six different members of the family (C/EBPα, -β, -γ, -δ, -ε, and -ζ) have been isolated and characterized. The expression of C/EBPs is tissue- and stage-specific during development. C/EBPs have been shown to play a key role in regulating cellular differentiation, terminal function, and response to inflammatory insults (12.Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol.

To investigate the role of C/EBPα in the regulation of amelogenin gene expression, the 2.2-kilobase mouse amelogenin promoter has been systematically analyzed in mouse ameloblast-like LS8 cells. Our experimental strategy includes the following four analyses. First, the potential of C/EBPα to serve as a transcriptional activator of the amelogenin gene is tested in LS8, Pa-4, and MDCK cells using cotransfection assays. Second, the putative C/EBP-binding site on the amelogenin promoter is resolved using deletion and mutation analysis. Third, the specific binding to the putative site by C/EBPα is examined by electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA). Fourth, the effect of C/EBPα overexpression on the endogenous amelogenin gene in LS8 cells is determined by Western blot analysis. To generate reporter construct p2207, the 5′ to 3′ SmaI-XhoI fragment from p83 containing 2263 nucleotides of the mouse amelogenin promoter (5.Snead M.L. Paine M.L. Chen L.S. Luo B.Y. Zhou D.H. Lei Y.P. Liu Y.H. Maxson Jr., R.E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the 5′ to 3′ SmaI-XhoI site of pGL3-Basic (Promega). To generate p454, p2207 was digested withKpnI and SmaI, treated with exonuclease III followed by blunt ending, ligated, and sequenced. For reporters p349, p194, p70, p51, and p70mut, the promoter regions were generated by polymerase chain reaction with p2207 as the template using a common 3′-primer (SN244, 5′-TATTCTCGAG TGTATGCT CAGTGAG-3′; theXhoI site is underlined) and respective 5′-primers (SN181, 5′-CGTGCTAGC TGGAGAAA CTTGACC ATTCAC-3′; SN180, 5′-CGTGCTAGC AACCTATTA TTGCCTG TAATG-3′; SN182, 5′-CGTGCTAGC TTCAGAA CCTGAT TGGCTG-3′; SN259, 5′-CGTGCTAGC GTTCAAAG TGCCCTG CATGAT-3′; and SN258, 5′-CGTGCTAGC TTTTTCATTCAG TCTAGAGA TTGGCT GTTCAAA-3′; the NheI sites are underlined and the mutated site is in boldface), digested with NheI andXhoI, ligated into the 5′ to 3′NheI-XhoI site of pGL3-Basic, and verified by sequence analysis. Reporter p2207mut was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using SN263 (5′-AACACA TTTTTCATTC AGTCTAGAG ATTGGCTG TTCAAAGTG-3′; the mutated site is in boldface) as the mutant primer and p2207 as the template and verified by DNA sequencing. A mouse ameloblast cell line (LS8) established by immortalizing primary cultures of enamel organ epithelium with SV40 large T antigen was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The rat parotid epithelial cell line Pa-4, also known as the parotid C5 cell line (17.Quissell D.O. Barzen K.A. Redman R.S. Camden J.M. Turner J.T. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1998; 34: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was provided by Dr. D. Ann (University of Southern California) and maintained as described (18.Lin H.H. Tu Z.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27637-27644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The MDCK cells were provided by Dr. C. Okamoto (University of Southern California) and maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (5%), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Test DNA (750 ng) was used for transient transfection of 2 × 105cells/well in 12-well plates. To monitor transfection efficiency, 75 ng of pCMV-lacZ/well was cotransfected as an internal control. Two hours before the addition of the DNA-liposome complex, cells was washed twice with Hanks' solution and subsequently cultured in serum- and antibiotic-free medium. The plasmid DNA was mixed with 50 μl of medium in a 5-ml VWR culture tube. Five microliters of LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added, mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Two microliters of LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was diluted into 50 μl of medium in a second tube. The contents of these two tubes were combined, mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The DNA-PLUS-LipofectAMINE complex was diluted with 0.5 ml of medium, mixed, and layered gently on top of the cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 h. After removal of the DNA-PLUS-LipofectAMINE complex, cells were incubated in 1 ml of complemented medium for an additional 22 h and then subjected to luciferase assay with a Dual-Light kit (Tropix Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Briefly, cells were washed twice with Hanks' solution and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 0.2% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were transferred into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and cleared by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 2 min. Luciferase activity was measured by mixing 10 μl of extract with 25 μl of Buffer A and 100 μl of Buffer B sequentially. After a 45-min incubation at room temperature, β-galactosidase activity was measured by adding 100 μl of Buffer C in a luminometer (Lumat, Berthold). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the GeneEditorTM in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenesis primer was synthesized at the Microchemical Core Facility (University of Southern California/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center). To ascertain the mutations, the plasmids were analyzed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. LS8 cells (80% confluent) in a 100-mm Falcon dish were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and scraped off in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 20 % glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaCl). Cell lysates were Dounce-homogenized for 10 strokes with a type A pestle on ice, transferred to a 15-ml Falcon tube, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended at 1 × 107 nuclei/ml in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 500 mm NaCl) with a final concentration of 0.5 m NaCl and mixed on a rotator at 4 °C for 1 h. Nuclear debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin standards. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were generated by annealing an antisense strand to a 10-fold excess of sense strand and filling in with [α-32P]dATP (NEN Life Science Products) and Klenow (exo−). The GelShift buffer kit (Stratagene) was used for the binding reaction, which was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. The reaction mixtures were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel provided in the kit. The gel was dried, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows: wild-type antisense strand, 5′-GAACAGC CAATCAGGT TTCTGAATGAA-3′; wild-type sense strand, 5′-TTTTTCATTCAGAAACCTG ATTGGCT GTTC-3′; mutant antisense strand, 5′-GAACAGCCAATCTCTAGA CTGAATGAA-3′; and mutant sense strand, 5′-TTTTTCATTCAGTCTAGA GATTGG CTGTTC-3′ (mutated sites are boldface). Whole cell lysates were prepared from untreated LS8 cells, LS8 cells transfected with pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and LS8 cells transfected with pcrC/EBPα (a C/EBPα expression vector in pcDNA3), respectively. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay with a bovine serum albumin standard curve. Equal amounts of protein (10–20 μg) were subject to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins on the gel were electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.), and the membrane was incubated with a primary antibody (anti-C/EBPα, anti-C/EBPβ, or anti-amelogenin). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to detect the bound antibodies. To identify the cis-element(s) required for the promoter activity of the mouse amelogenin gene, a series of 5′-deletion reporter constructs were tested in LS8 cells with transient transfection assays. Consistent with the transgenic analysis (5.Snead M.L. Paine M.L. Chen L.S. Luo B.Y. Zhou D.H. Lei Y.P. Liu Y.H. Maxson Jr., R.E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the 2263-base pair region from the mouse amelogenin promoter in the reporter construct p2207 was sufficient to direct the expression of the reporter gene in LS8 cells, a mouse ameloblast-like cell line. Sequential deletion of the region between −2207 and −71 in the mouse amelogenin promoter gave rise to a modest increase (<2-fold) in promoter activity. However, further deletion of a 19-nucleotide stretch (−70 to −52) resulted in a nearly complete ablation of reporter gene activity in LS8 cells, with p51 exhibiting a background level of activity similar to the promoterless construct pGL3-Basic (Fig.1). Therefore, the −70/+51 region of the mouse amelogenin promoter included in the p70 construct functioned as a minimal promoter in LS8 cells, whereas the −70/−52 region was requisite to promoter activity. In ameloblast-like LS8 cells, the −2207/−71 region appeared to have a limited effect on the promoter activity of the mouse amelogenin gene. To determine whether a cis-element(s) responsible for tissue specificity of the amelogenin promoter is located in the −2207/−52 region, the same set of reporter constructs was transiently transfected into non-ameloblast cells. Rat parotid Pa-4 and MDCK cells were used since they represent terminal differentiated oral and non-oral epithelial cells, respectively. The reporter gene activity of p2207 in Pa-4 and MDCK cells was 3–5-fold above that of the promoterless construct pGL3-Basic, in comparison with 15-fold observed in LS8 cells. Progressive deletion to −70 led only to a modest increase in reporter gene activity: <2-fold in Pa-4 cells and 2–3-fold in MDCK cells. However, the reporter gene activities of p51 were comparable in Pa-4, MDCK, and LS8 cells (Fig. 1). The transfection studies confirmed that the mouse amelogenin promoter is ameloblast-specific as demonstrated in a previous transgenic animal analysis (5.Snead M.L. Paine M.L. Chen L.S. Luo B.Y. Zhou D.H. Lei Y.P. Liu Y.H. Maxson Jr., R.E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Given the fact that the corresponding amelogenin reporter constructs (p2207 versusp70) exhibited comparable promoter activities in Pa-4 and MDCK cells that were consistently between 20 and 30% of the activity in LS8 cells, the −2207/−71 region appeared to contribute little to the tissue specificity of the mouse amelogenin promoter. However, similar to that in LS8 cells, the −70/−52 region was necessary for promoter activity in both Pa-4 and MDCK cells. A putative C/EBP transcription factor-binding site was found in the −70/−52 region of the mouse amelogenin promoter. To test whether C/EBPα could function as a transcriptional activator of the mouse amelogenin promoter, a C/EBPα expression vector was cotransfected into LS8 cells with either the amelogenin promoter-reporter construct p2207 or p70. In response to increasing amounts of C/EBPα, the reporter gene activity was increased up to 11-fold for p2207 (Fig. 2 A) and up to 27-fold for p70 (Fig. 2 B). These data indicate that C/EBPα transactivates the mouse amelogenin promoter in a dose-dependent manner in LS8 cells. To determine whether C/EBPα alone is sufficient to activate the mouse amelogenin promoter in non-ameloblast cells, similar cotransfection studies were performed in Pa-4 and MDCK cells. Cotransfection of C/EBPα had little effect on the promoter activity of both p2207 and p70 in MDCK cells. However, in Pa-4 cells, the reporter gene activity was increased up to 4-fold for p2207 (Fig. 2 A) and up to 6-fold for p70 (Fig. 2 B) in response to increasing amounts of C/EBPα. In the absence of exogenous C/EBPα, the reporter gene activity of p2207 in Pa-4 cells was 30% of the basal level in LS8 cells; cotransfection of C/EBPα was able to increase the level to 140%. A similar result was obtained for p70. In the absence of exogenous C/EBPα, the reporter gene activity of p70 in Pa-4 cells was 24% of the basal level in LS8 cells; cotransfection of C/EBPα was able to increase the level to 140%. Taken together, these data indicate that C/EBPα functions as a transcriptional activator of the mouse amelogenin gene in a cell type-specific manner. To understand the function of the putative C/EBP-binding site, a mutation was introduced into the core sequence of the C/EBP site in the context of p2207 (p2207mut) and p70 (p70mut) (Fig. 3 A); the responsiveness to C/EBPα was then determined in LS8 cells with transient cotransfection assays. Mutation or deletion of the C/EBP site consistently abolished the basal promoter activity of these reporter constructs (p2207mut, p70mut, and p51). Furthermore, C/EBPα-mediated transactivation of these constructs was reduced to the background level, similar to that of promoterless pGL3-Basic, whereas the reporter gene activity of the wild-type constructs was increased an order of magnitude by cotransfection with C/EBPα (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these data indicate that the putative C/EBP-binding site in the −70/−52 region of the mouse amelogenin promoter is required not only for C/EBPα-mediated transactivation, but also for basal promoter activity in LS8 cells. Interestingly, the putative C/EBP-binding site identified in the −70/−52 region of the mouse amelogenin promoter is conserved between species, as shown in the alignment of murine, bovine, and human X-chromosomal amelogenin promoter nucleotide sequences (Fig.3 C). The results described above provide functional evidence of a role for C/EBPα as a positive regulator of mouse amelogenin gene expression. To determine whether C/EBPα can bind to the mouse amelogenin promoter, a gel mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed using the double-stranded mouse amelogenin C/EBP oligonucleotide, 5′-TTTTTCATTCAGAAACCTGATTGGCTGTTC-3′ (C/EBP-binding site is in boldface). A protein-DNA complex was formed using nuclear extract prepared from LS8 cells as evidenced by the shifted band (Fig.4 A, lane 2). The intensity of the band was increased when nuclear extract prepared from C/EBPα-transfected LS8 cells was used (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). In addition, an antibody specific to C/EBPα was able to supershift the protein-DNA complex (Fig. 4 A, lane 4), whereas the antibody alone did not bind to the probe (lane 5). The addition of a 10-, 50-, or 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled C/EBP oligonucleotide inhibited the binding of C/EBPα to the labeled probe (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3–5). However, no inhibition was observed (Fig. 4 B,lanes 6–8) with a molar excess of an oligonucleotide encoding a mutated C/EBP-binding site, 5′-TTTTTC ATTCAGtctaga GATTGGCTGTTC-3′ (mutated site is in lowercase letters). These data demonstrate that C/EBPα is able to bind to the mouse amelogenin promoter and that the binding is specific. As shown in Fig. 4 D, the C/EBP consensus sequence within the mouse amelogenin promoter does not include a CCAAT box. Furthermore, a32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a mutated C/EBP-binding site (Fig. 4 D, MUT) was unable to form a detectable protein-DNA complex, even though the CCAAT box remained intact (Fig. 4 C, lanes 7–10). In contrast, the wild-type probe (Fig. 4 D, WT) formed a protein-DNA complex in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2–5). These data indicate that the C/EBP-binding site, independent of the CCAAT box, is required for the binding of C/EBPα to the mouse amelogenin promoter. To ascertain that C/EBPα is a bona fidepositive regulator of mouse amelogenin gene expression, two additional questions were asked. First, what is the expression status of C/EBPα in ameloblasts? Second, is C/EBPα able to regulate the expression of the endogenous amelogenin gene in the context of chromatin? The expression status of C/EBPα was analyzed in an ameloblast-like cell line (LS8) by Western blotting. An antibody specific to C/EBPα recognized a 42-kDa protein, which could be specifically competed off with a blocking peptide to the antibody (Fig.5 A), indicating that authentic C/EBPα is expressed in LS8 cells. Furthermore, the overexpression of exogenous C/EBPα in LS8 cells was achieved by transiently transfecting 2 μg of C/EBPα expression vector. Exogenous C/EBPα was readily detected, whereas the endogenous protein required a 40 times longer exposure for detection (Fig. 5 B, C/EBP alpha panel, compare lane 3 with lanes 1 and2, respectively). The expression level of the endogenous amelogenin protein in LS8 cells was then determined. A >2-fold increase in the amelogenin protein level was observed in LS8 cells overexpressing C/EBPα (Fig. 5 B, histogram,third bar versus first bar), whereas the level of amelogenin expression in empty vector-transfected LS8 cells remained essentially the same as that in untransfected control LS8 cells (Fig.5 B, histogram, second bar versus first bar). With a typical 20–30% transfection efficiency in our transient transfection experiments, the observed 2.5-fold overall increase (Fig. 5 B, histogram, third bar) in the amelogenin protein level upon C/EBPα activation actually represented a 6–9-fold increase in the cells that overexpressed exogenous C/EBPα. Therefore, the existence of C/EBPα and its capability of activating the endogenous amelogenin gene in the ameloblast-like LS8 cells clearly indicate that C/EBPα is a genuine regulator of amelogenin gene expression. As a first step to determine whether other C/EBP family members play a role in mouse amelogenin gene expression, C/EBPβ was studied. The expression status of C/EBPβ was analyzed in LS8 cells by Western blotting. An antibody specific to C/EBPβ recognized a 32-kDa protein, which could be specifically competed off with a blocking peptide to the antibody (Fig.6 A), indicating that C/EBPβ is expressed in LS8 cells. To test whether C/EBPβ can function as a transcriptional activator of the mouse amelogenin promoter, a C/EBPβ expression vector was cotransfected into LS8 cells with either amelogenin promoter-reporter construct p2207 or p70. C/EBPβ was much less potent than C/EBPα in activating amelogenin reporter gene activity: 2–3-fold for C/EBPβ versus 8–15-fold for C/EBPα (Fig. 6 B). The transfection data indicate that the capability of C/EBPβ in transactivating the mouse amelogenin gene is very limited. To further determine whether endogenous C/EBPβ in LS8 cells can bind to the amelogenin promoter, a gel mobility shift analysis was performed using the wild-type oligonucleotides (Fig.4 D) as a labeled probe. A protein-DNA complex was formed using nuclear extract prepared from LS8 cells as evidenced by the shifted band (Fig. 6 C, lane 2). However, an antibody specific to C/EBPβ was not able either to supershift or to disrupt the protein-DNA complex (Fig. 6 C, lane 3), and the antibody alone was not able to bind to the probe (lane 4). This EMSA data argued that there was no detectable level of C/EBPβ present in the protein-DNA complex. Taken together, the results indicate that C/EBPβ has only a marginal effect, if any, on the transcriptional regulation of the mouse amelogenin gene. The proximal regulatory region of the mouse amelogenin promoter is the region immediately upstream of the TATA box. This region includes nucleotides −70 to −33 together with the TATA box and drives ∼190% of the promoter activity in ameloblast-like LS8 cells relative to the 2.2-kilobase promoter tested in transgenic animals (5.Snead M.L.

The slight increase in promoter activity suggests that a silencer element(s) may be located in the region between −2207 and −70, which is consistent with a previous report in which an upstream fragment from the bovine amelogenin promoter decreased the activity of a heterologous hamster sarcoma virus-thymidine kinase minimal promoter by ∼50% in Chinese hamster ovary cells (19.Chen E.

In the mouse amelogenin promoter, the −70/−52 region contains the binding site for C/EBP. Deletion of the C/EBP-binding site results in the loss of promoter activity. Taking advantage of the ameloblast-like LS8 cells, we have identified the mouse amelogenin minimal promoter, consisting of the −70/+51 region, in which the C/EBP-binding site-containing −70/−52 region is essential to pr"

(1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 24342–24348). The transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor by angiotensin II, a process required for the activation of ERK, was inhibited by N-acetylcysteine but not by nitric oxide. The transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor by angiotensin II was shown to be independent of intracellular calcium increases.

Neither nitric oxide nor N-acetylcysteine inhibited either phospholipase C activation or inositol triphosphate generation in response to angiotensin II.

Most studies have focused on either the vascular smooth muscle cell or the cardiac fibroblast to dilineate the intracellular steps involved in the activation of the MAP kinase system, a characteristic response now associated with hypertrophy, proliferation, or apoptosis (1.Dorn G.W.

This kinase cascade has been shown to be under complex regulation, and its activation by Ang II has been used as a model for the study of how G protein-linked receptors can influence systems normally activated by tyrosine kinase-linked receptors (4.Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar, 5.Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ.

Nephrol. 1999; 10: S57-S61PubMed Google Scholar). One suggested mechanism for this response was proposed to be the transactivation of the EGF receptor by Ang II and the requirement for that receptor tyrosine kinase in the ultimate activation of MAP kinases (7.Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33027-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we have characterized the acute activation of MAP kinases in quiescent cardiac fibroblasts by Ang II, and shown that nitric oxide (NO), a substance known to functionally oppose the physiological effects of Ang II in several organ systems, including the heart (10.Raij L. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 189-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can attenuate the activation of ERK by Ang II. This effect of NO on ERK activation also occurred in the same cell type when either of the other major MAP kinases (JNK or p38) were activated by Ang II, suggesting regulation at a site, or sites, upstream of Ras or proteins within the Ras superfamily (9.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33027-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A subsequent study (11.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24342-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) showed that NO inhibits the activation by Ang II of the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in signaling cascades involving both receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-linked receptors (12.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NO had no effect on either the transactivation of the EGF receptor by Ang II, nor did NO influence the autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor. Thus these studies suggested that NO affects PYK2 and subsequently ERK activation, although the specific mechanism by which PYK2 phophorylation was inhibited by NO remains to be defined. We also showed previously (9.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33027-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a reducing agent known to alter the redox state of the cell (13.Faruqi R.M. Poptic E.J. Faruqi T.R. De La Motte C. DiCorleto P.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H817-H826PubMed Google Scholar), also inhibited ERK activation by Ang II and other agonists, and when cells were pretreated with both NO and NAC, inhibition of ERK was greater than when either agent was added alone. Superoxide anion or other free radicals have also been implicated as potential mediators of signaling systems initiated by Ang II (14); thus the possibility that NAC could affect ERK activation by altering the redox state in a manner that would selectively change steady state levels of free radicals offered a possible explanation for the effect. In the current manuscript, we have evaluated the role of NAC on the transactivation of the EGF receptor by Ang II and have shown that it acts at sites distinct from that of NO. We also have further defined the site of action for NO in the signaling cascade by assessing phospholipase C activation and inositol triphosphate generation, measuring changes in intracellular Ca2+ and for the activation of both PYK2 and another Ca2+-dependent, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Src. Our findings offer a possible explanation for how both NAC and NO, acting in a concerted manner but at different sites, might have an additive effect on specific hormonal responses. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, Ca2+ free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc.S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and ionophore A23187 were from Alexis Corp (San Diego, CA); tyrphostin AG1478 and BAPTA-acetoxymethyl ester were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were from Sigma. The ECL detection system were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Ang II, dl-cysteine,N-acetylcysteine,l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Grb2 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-Shc, anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20), and anti-PYK2 antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); anti-EGF receptor antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and anti-phospho ERK antibody was purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-phosphoSrc antibody, specific against Tyr416, was a generous gift from Dr. Xiqiang Hong at New England BioLabs. Rat cardiac fibroblasts were obtained and prepared for experiments exactly as described previously by us (15.Fariver R.S. Chobanian A.V. Brecher P. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 759-768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fresh medium without fetal calf serum was routinely added 3–5 h before the experiment unless designated otherwise. Ang II was routinely added to the cells at a final concentration of 0.1 μm. NAC (10 mm) was routinely added 12 h prior to treatment of cells with Ang II or other agonists. 1 h prior to addition of agonist, the medium was changed to fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium lacking NAC, and cells were equilibrated with that medium prior to Ang II addition. SNAP was routinely added with equimolar amounts ofdl-cysteine 15 min prior to addition of agonists.dl-Cysteine, when added without SNAP, had no effect on any of the parameters measured. All experiments shown are representative of multiple experiments using separate cell preparations. Following treatment of the cells with hormones or drugs, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then cell lysis was performed. ERK phosphorylation was measured directly by immunoblotting of the cell extract with the anti-phospho ERK antibody. Immunoprecipitation of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins from the cell lysates and subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting procedures were exactly as described previously (11.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24342-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Images were obtained using a PDI scanner (model 420oe). Following exposure to agonists, the incubation was terminated by the addition of 1.5 ml of ice-cold 1 m trichloroacetic acid. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the cells were harvested by scraping and transferred to a polypropylene tube. The cell extract was sonicated briefly on ice and then centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 ×g. The supernatant was removed and warmed to room temperature for 15 min. IP3 was extracted with a solution of trichlorotrifluoroethane-triocytlamine (3:1) and measured using a radioreceptor assay kit from NEN Life Science Products following the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Results were calculated from a standard curve prepared by using the purified IP3included in the kit. Data are normalized to total cell number, and each experiment typically included duplicate or triplicate determinations for each parameter measured. Intracellular free Ca2+ levels were determined with the Ca2+dye fura-2 essentially as described (16.Weisbrod R.M. Griswold M.C. Yaghoubi M. Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. Cohen R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1695-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to subconfluency on coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 with 10% fetal calf serum and treated with 5 μm fura-2 for 45 min at 37 °C in physiological salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 119 mmNaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.15 mmNa2HPO4, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, and 5 mm NaHCO3supplemented with 0.01% glucose and 0.01% albumin. Subsequently, the cells were gently washed three times and then suspended in physiological salt solution. The glass coverslip was placed in a cuvette containing the same buffer with continuous stirring. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured in a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter and calculated from the ratio of the 340/380-nm fluorescence values as described (16.Weisbrod R.M. Griswold M.C. Yaghoubi M. Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. Cohen R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1695-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Data are presented as the means ± S.E. of at least three experiments unless designated otherwise. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance and Student'st test as appropriate. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor following addition of Ang II is shown in Fig.1 A. As we showed previously (11.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24342-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) this phenomenon, referred to as transactivation, was not influenced by the nitric oxide donor SNAP using experimental conditions that attenuate Ang II activation of MAP kinases. However, preincubation with 10 mm NAC, which by itself had no effect on receptor phosphorylation, markedly suppressed the Ang II-activated EGF receptor phosphorylation. The ability of NAC to inhibit EGF receptor phosphorylation by Ang II was dose-dependent with respect to NAC, with almost complete inhibition occurring between 5 and 10 mm NAC (Fig. 1 B). This was confirmed statistically in triplicate experiments where significant differences between NAC-treated or untreated cells were found at concentrations of 5 and 10 mm NAC. In all cases, the total content of EGF receptor was also measured and remained unchanged. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of NAC on Ang II-induced activation of the EGF receptor, NAC had no inhibitory effect on EGF-induced activation of the same receptor over a broad range of ligand concentrations (Fig.1 C). As we had indicated previously (11.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24342-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the extent of EGF receptor phosphorylation in response to about 1 ng/ml EGF was equivalant to that found with the maximal transactivation in response to Ang II. Fig. 1 D shows that the formation of the Shc-Grb2 complex, an event occurring downstream of the activated EGF receptor, was initiated by the addition of either Ang II or EGF, but NAC pretreatment only inhibited the Ang II-induced effect and was without effect on the EGF-induced formation of the Shc-Grb2 complex. Statistical evaluation of triplicate experiments confirmed the selective inhibition by NAC of the effect of Ang II on the Shc-Grb2 complex. Thus, NAC, but not SNAP, inhibited Ang II-induced transactivation of the EGF receptor and the subsequent association of Grb2 and Shc. The lack of effect of SNAP was reported by us previously (11.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24342-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Another protein associated with tyrosine kinase receptors following activation is phospholipase C-γ, which becomes phosphorylated when activated by certain agonists. In the cardiac fibroblast, PLC-γ was not significantly phosphorylated by either Ang II or EGF but was strongly phosphorylated by 20 ng/ml of PDGF-BB within 2 min (Fig.2 A). Ang II did not phosphorylate the PLC-γ isoform throughout a 10-min time period, ruling out a delayed activation of PLC-γ by Ang II that had been reported previously in vascular smooth muscle cells (17.Ushio-Fukai M. Griendling K.K. Akers M. Lyons P.R. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19772-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Both SNAP and NAC were without effect on the activation of phospholipase C-γ by PDGF over a wide concentration range (Fig. 2, B andC). Triplicate determinations of the experiments in Fig. 2(B and C) showed no significant effect of either NAC or SNAP on PLC-γ phosphorylation by PDGF (Fig.2 D). The inability of Ang II to activate phospholipase C-γ suggested that the β isoform was activated in response to Ang II. To determine whether Ang II did indeed activate phospholipase C in the cardiac fibroblast, IP3 levels were determined. Preliminary studies had established that Ang II increased IP3 levels 5–8-fold with an apparent maximal response between 10–20 s, and then IP3 levels decreased progressively to control levels by 1 min (data not shown). Fig. 2 E shows that Ang II addition caused a dose-dependent increase in IP3 by 20 s, and pretreatment with either NAC or SNAP has little effect on stimulated levels of IP3, although there was a slight reduction when cells were pretreated with both NAC and SNAP. In separate experiments (data not shown) neither NAC nor SNAP pretreatment affected basal levels of IP3, and addition of EGF (20 ng/ml) did not increase IP3 over basal levels. To determine whether NAC might influence changes in intracellular free Ca2+ induced by Ang II, we measured such changes by using the fluorescent indicator fura-2 (Fig. 3). The data show that Ang II clearly increased intracellular Ca2+ with a characteristic pattern (Fig. 3 A). This increase was unaffected by NAC pretreatment (Fig. 3 B) but clearly was significantly reduced with SNAP/cysteine pretreatment (Fig. 3 C). Combined treatment with both SNAP and NAC (Fig. 3 D) caused a slightly greater inhibition than that seen with SNAP addition alone. The addition of cysteine alone had no effect on Ang II-induced Ca2+ changes (Fig. 3 E). Statistical analysis of four experiments performed separately showed that the Ang II-induced Ca2+ increase was significantly reduced by either SNAP alone or SNAP + NAC, whereas there was no statistical difference between Ang II treatment versus Ang II + NAC or Ang II + cysteine (Fig. 3 F). Our previous study showed that Ang II activated and SNAP inhibited the Ang II-induced phosphorylation of PYK2, a Ca2+ -dependent, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (11.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24342-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of SNAP and NAC on another important signaling intermediate, we characterized the phosphorylation of Src in response to Ang II. Fig.4 A shows that Src is rapidly phosphorylated in response to 0.1 μm Ang II, and this occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B). The phosphorylation of Src by Ang II in the cardiac fibroblast was a Ca2+-dependent process that was progressively eliminated when cells were pretreated with 1–50 μm BAPTA (Fig. 4 C), a characteristic shared with PYK2, as we described previously (11.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24342-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A relatively high concentration of EGF (20 ng/ml) did not phosphorylate Src within a 30-min period, in contrast to the marked effect of Ang II (Fig. 4 D). This relative difference between the response to Ang II and EGF also was reported with regard to PYK2, which was readily phosphorylated by Ang II but not by EGF (11.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24342-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 5 characterize in more detail the response of the cells to Ang II with regard to PYK2 and Src. In Fig. 5 A data are presented showing that a selective inhibitor of Src activation, PP2, blocks the Ang II-induced phosphorylation of Src in a dose-dependent manner, with almost complete inhibition observed at 10 μm PP2. That dose-dependent inhibition of Src by PP2 also was found when the phosphorylation of either PYK2 or ERK was determined. The effects of SNAP pretreatment on Src activation are shown in Fig. 5 Bwhere SNAP (1–500 μm) was added 15 min prior to Ang II addition, and phosphorylated Src was measured 3 min following Ang II addition. Inhibition of Src phosphorylation by SNAP was dose-dependent, an effect comparable with the inhibition of Ang II-induced phosphorylation of PYK2 by SNAP (11.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24342-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). NAC inhibited Src phosphorylation by Ang II in a dose-dependent manner and also reduced PYK2 phosphorylation in a manner comparable with that observed for Src (Fig. 5 C). The activation of Src and PYK2 by Ang II led to complex formation between Src and PYK2, and both NAC and SNAP pretreatment significantly attenuated the Src-PYK2 complex formation as indicated both in the representative immunoblot and the bar graph summarizing several separate experiments below (Fig.5 D). Fig.6 A shows the effect of BAPTA pretreatment on phosphorylated EGF receptor in response to Ang II and indicates the transactivation of the EGF receptor was not markedly influenced by BAPTA preincubation between 1–20 μm, whereas BAPTA had a clear inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of Src using the identical cell extracts for analysis. The bar graph summarizes data based on four separate determinations showing the selective effect of BAPTA pretreatment on both the EGF receptor and Src phosphorylation in response to Ang II. There was a slight decrease in phosphorylation with 1 μm BAPTA that was not seen at the more conventionally used higher concentrations. Further data suggesting that Ca2+ was not required for EGF receptor phosphorylation were obtained in experiments where cells were exposed to the calcium ionophore A23187. A23187 did not change EGF receptor phosphorylation, whereas ERK activation was observed in the same extracts (Fig.6 B). Thus, studies to this point show that 1) both Src and PYK2 phosphorylation are inhibited by either SNAP or NAC pretreatment; 2) NAC but not SNAP inhibited EGF receptor transactivation; 3) only SNAP lowered Ang II-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+; and 4) the transactivation of the EGF receptor appeared to be independent of intracellular Ca2+. It was necessary to pretreat the cells with NAC to show an inhibition of Ang II-induced effects such as EGF receptor phosphorylation (Fig.7 A). Because the pretreatment time was increased from 6 min to 12 h, there was a progressive decrease in the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by Ang II. In these experiments the medium was routinely changed, removing NAC 1 h prior to treating the cells acutely with agonists, suggesting the effect of NAC was occurring within the cell. In separate experiments, NAC was maintained in the medium during the time Ang II was added, and the results were comparable with those shown in Fig. 7 A(data not shown). To gain additional insight into the mechanism by which NAC was having an effect on signaling in the cardiac fibroblast, we focused on its inhibitory effect on EGF receptor phosphorylation. Fig. 7 B shows that NAC inhibited transactivation of the EGF receptor by a mechanism independent of changes in intracellular glutathione. In a previous study we established that pretreatment with NAC increased glutathione levels, whereas BSO, an inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis, produced a marked reduction in intracellular total glutathione when added alone or in combination with NAC (9.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33027-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). NAC pretreatment inhibited EGF receptor phosphorylation in the absence or presence of BSO, whereas BSO treatment alone had no effect on Ang II-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation. Fig. 7 C summarizes three separate experiments where Ang II-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation was determined following pretreatment for 12 h with either 1 mm ascorbate, 10 mm NAC, 10 mmdl-cysteine, or 10 mmd-cysteine. The inhibitory effect documented above for NAC also was found for either the DL or d-isomers of cysteine, and in separate experiments (not shown) a similar inhibition of transactivation of the EGF receptor was found when onlyl-cysteine was added. With any form of cysteine, it was necessary to pretreat the cells for more than 6 h, in contrast to the more rapid effect of NAC. Fig. 7 D shows that the effect of NAC could be mimicked by pretreatment with dithiothreitol, a thiol-containing reducing agent, whereas the antioxidant ascorbic acid, which lacks a thiol moiety, had no effect on EGF receptor phosphorylation. Fig. 7 E shows that the inability of ascorbate to influence EGF receptor phosphorylation was consistent even when cells were pretreated for periods between 1 and 16 h. Hydrogen peroxide addition to cells often is used as a model to induce oxidative stress and hydrogen peroxide addition to the cardiac fibroblasts did increase EGF receptor phosphorylation, PYK2, or Src phosphorylation rapidly. However, the time course of the increase in EGF receptor phosphorylation was not as rapid as that for either Src, PYK2, or EGF receptor phosphorylation (Fig.8 A). Src, PYK2, or EGF receptor phosphorylation induced by hydrogen peroxide addition were reduced in a dose-dependent manner by NAC pretreatment (Fig. 8 B). The peroxide-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation was inhibited by NAC pretreatment, with more effective inhibition occurring when pretreatment times exceeded 3 h (Fig.8 C), a temporal relationship somewhat longer than that found for the effect of NAC pretreatment on Ang II-induced transactivation of the EGF receptor as was shown in Fig. 7 A. These studies document several unique effects of NAC on the signaling pathways initiated by Ang II in cardiac fibroblasts and contrast its effects with those of NO. The biochemical steps examined include the transactivation of the EGF receptor by Ang II, the activation of phospholipase C and subsequent increase in IP3 and intracellular Ca2+, and the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of PYK2 and Src. All the above changes are part of the multiple pathways leading to ERK activation by Ang II, and the distinct effects of NAC and NO on these cellular reactions provide an explanation for the additive effects of both NAC and NO on ERK activation we reported previously (9.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33027-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have reported two unique findings related to the Ang II-induced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor: that the effect is apparently independent of acute increases in intracellular Ca2+ and that NAC inhibits the response. With regard to the lack of a dependence on Ca2+, it should be noted that transactivation of the EGF receptor by Ang II has been described in both vascular smooth muscle cells and neonatal cardiac fibroblasts to be dependent on Ca2+ as indicated by its sensitivity to BAPTA treatment, A23187, or calmodulin sensitivity to calmodulin antagonists (7.Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol.

Shibazaki Y. Tanaka Y. Iwasaka T. Inada M. Matsubara H. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In contrast, the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by Ang II in our experimental system was marginally affected by low concentrations (1 μm) of BAPTA and was unaffected by pretreatment with more conventional doses (10–20 μm) of BAPTA. The absence of an essential role for Ca2+ in the EGF receptor transactivation is further supported by the demonstration that the calcium ionophore A23187 failed to induce the phosphorylation of EGF receptor for 1–30 min, whereas it clearly was effective in inducing other Ca2+-dependent processes, such as ERK phosphorylation, within this time frame. Further evidence that the transactivation between Ang II and the EGF receptor was Ca2+-independent in our experimental model included the observation that the NO donor SNAP, which clearly reduced the acute increase in Ang II-induced intracellular Ca2+, did not affect EGF activation of ERK or transactivation of the EGF receptor by Ang II and the subsequent dependent downstream association of Shc and Grb2 (11.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24342-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Consistent with our findings, Zwick et al. (18.Zwick E. Wallasch C. Daub H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20989-20996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) recently reported that bradykinin-induced EGF receptor transactivation, a G protein-coupled receptor-mediated event, was mediated through a Ca2+/calmodulin-independent signaling pathway in PC12 cells, whereas Ca2+ was implicated when EGF transactivation was induced by potassium. In rat liver epithelial cells, the role of Ca2+ in the activation ERK by both Ang II and EGF was independent of both BAPTA treatment and protein kinase C inhibition (19.Yang L.J. Guo Y.L. Trygankova O. Li Q.Y Maloney J.A. Steinhauer M. Williamson J.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In our experimental model, we reported EGF activation of ERK to be independent of acute increases in intracellular Ca2+ and PKC inhibition, whereas Ang II activation of ERK, although independent of protein kinase C inhibition, was dependent upon intracellular Ca2+, whereas transactivation of the EGF receptor clearly was not (11.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24342-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It may be that differences in cell type, cell phenotype, or the multiple systems that maintain basal or agonist stimulated levels of intracellular Ca2+ will vary among the protocols reported, thereby making Ca2+ sensitivity a variable, rather than an absolute, requirement for EGF receptor transactivation. NAC inhibited the Ang II-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation, whereas the EGF-stimulated response was unaffected. The ability of NAC to inhibit the transactivation of the EGF receptor represents a unique effect of NAC and could provide insight into the mechanisms involved in G protein receptor-linked transactivation. It is known that the transactivation of the EGF receptor plays a key role in the G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinases (4.Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar) and has been implicated for several hormones and in several cell types (7.Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol.

Res. 1998; 82: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) have shown that blockade of EGF receptor phosphorylation by the specific tyrphostin AG 1478 also blocked Ang II activation of ERK, thus NAC presumably can influence an intracellular site or sites required for the transactivation process. The inhibition of EGF receptor transactivation by NAC was independent of absolute changes in glutathione based on the lack of effect of BSO and could be mimicked by dithiothreitol pretreatment but not by the antioxidant ascorbate. Those methods were essentially the same as we used previously to demonstrate inhibition of Ang II-mediated ERK activation by NAC (9.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33027-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), implicating the transactivation of the EGF receptor as one potential target site to explain the inhibition of ERK by NAC. Importantly, our protocol involves pretreatment of cells with NAC, followed by removal of exogenous NAC, thus the changes reported represent effects of NAC occurring within the cells. NAC also inhibited the association of Shc and Grb2 with the EGF receptor, an event known to couple membrane receptors to downstream cascades. However, NAC did not affect the Ang II-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+, clearly distinguishing its effects from that of SNAP, which, although it lowered intracellular Ca2+, did not influence the association of Shc and Grb2. This provides further support for the independent activation by Ang II of either Src or PYK2, contrasted with the transactivation of the EGF receptor and the subsequent Shc-Grb2 association. Interestingly, neither SNAP nor NAC affected the G protein-linked events leading to phospholipase C activation and increased levels of IP3, In other studies it was suggested that Ang II affected vascular smooth muscle cells through an association of the Ang II receptor with PLC-γ (22.Venema R.C. Ju H. Venema V.J. Schieffer B. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7703-7708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and that both PLC-β1 and PLC-γ were activated by Ang II in vascular smooth muscle cells (17.Ushio-Fukai M. Griendling K.K. Akers M. Lyons P.R. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19772-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and EGF was shown to activate PLC-γ in NR6 mouse fibroblasts (23.Haugh J.M. Schooler K. Wells A. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8958-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our data implicate Ca2+ regulation as a key site for NO action. NO has been studied extensively with regard to its effects on calcium homeostasis, and the topic has been reviewed recently (24.Clementi E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). SNAP (e.g. NO) may attenuate the activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases examined in the present study through its supressive effect on Ang II-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+. Because there was no effect on IP3levels, the possibility that NO may regulate either the intracellular response to IP3 or processes of Ca2+ influx and reuptake should be considered. In smooth muscle cells, NO was recently shown to influence the uptake of Ca2+ by its effect on sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase (25.Cohen R.A. Weisbrod R.M. Gericke M. Yaghoubi M. Bierl C. Bolotina V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It is noted that concentrations of Ang II (10−8m) that produce submaximal increases in IP3 levels at the time point we used (20 s) did produce a maximal response with regard to ERK activation (9.Wang D., Yu, X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33027-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This could be due to the differential sensitivity of signaling cascade components upstream of ERK, combined with the known observations that ERK activation can be caused by diverse signaling pathways initiated by Ang II, including some that are less dependent upon changes in intracellular Ca2+. The possibility that nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as PYK2 and Src are responsible for ERK activation has been proposed (12.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, both NAC and NO prevented the Ang II-induced phosphorylation of both PYK2 and Src, tyrosine kinases that were sensitive to BAPTA pretreatment in this study. It is not yet clear how NAC pretreatment might influence Ang II-induced Src and PYK2 activation, although it seems reasonable to assume that changes in the cellular redox state are involved. Many studies have implicated alterations in the redox state or, alternatively, oxidative stress as factors that regulate signaling pathways, and these topics have been reviewed recently (26.Kamata H. Hirata H. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Our data comparing NAC pretreatment with the reducing agent, dithriothreitol, suggest that the inhibition of transactivation may mediated by altering the redox state of the cell, presumably by affecting a critical sulfhydryl group in a regulatory site (27.Yun C.Y.I. Ferrari G. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We also induced oxidative stress, a complex condition often produced by exposing the cells to hydrogen peroxide. This treatment did activate both Src and PYK2 in the cardiac fibroblast, and NAC pretreatment clearly attenuated those responses, consistent with the possibility that NAC or a metabolite, after entering the cell, could either directly react with reactive oxygen species produced by peroxide, such as the hydroxyl radical, or by changing the redox state could lead to changes in the production or disappearance of other free radicals such as superoxide anion. The ability of NAC to attenuate the transactivation of the EGF receptor is a novel finding as well, suggesting that reactive oxygen species may be implicated in the transactivation process as well. NAC has been used both experimentally and clinically to affect pathophysiological responses thought to be due to free radicals (28.Sen C.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 29.Cotgreave I.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 38: 205-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which transactivation of the EGF receptor by Ang II or other agonists occurs remains unresolved, but our finding with NAC may provide an approach to elucidating these mechanism and influencing them pharmacologically."

As the GnRH receptor exclusively interacts with Gq/11 proteins and as receptor expression is regulated in a β-arrestin-independent fashion, it represents a good model to systematically dissect underlying signaling pathways. In αT3-1 gonadotropes endogenously expressing the GnRH receptor, GnRH challenge resulted in a rapid increase in ERK activity which was attenuated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478. In COS-7 cells transiently expressing the human GnRH receptor, agonist-induced ERK activation was independent of free Gβγ subunits but could be mimicked by short-term phorbol ester treatment. Most notably, Gq/11-induced ERK activation was sensitive to N17-Ras and to expression of the C-terminal Src kinase but also to other dominant negative mutants of signaling components localized upstream of Ras, like Shc and the EGFR. GnRH as well as phorbol esters led to Ras activation in COS-7 and αT3-1 cells, which was dependent on Src and EGFR tyrosine kinases, indicating that both tyrosine kinases act downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) and upstream of Ras. However, Src did not contribute to Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. GnRH or phorbol ester challenge resulted in PKC-dependent EGFR autophosphorylation. Furthermore, a 5-min phorbol ester treatment was sufficient to trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of the platelet-derived growth factor-β receptor in L cells. Thus, in several cell systems PKC is able to stimulate Ras via activation of receptor tyrosine kinases.

ERKs represent distal members of a three-component kinase module through which extracellular stimuli are transmitted into the cell (1.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar). The best studied signaling cascade is initiated by ligand-bound receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which upon autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of adaptor proteins like Shc and Grb2 recruit guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the monomeric GTPase Ras. Activated, i.e. GTP-loaded, Ras subsequently engages the ERK-MAPK cascade involving Raf, MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), and finally ERKs. It has only recently been appreciated that besides classical growth factors like EGF and PDGF, agonists acting at G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) also play a role in differentiation, proliferation, and even cellular transformation (2.Dhanasekaran N. Tsim S.T. Dermott J.M. Onesime D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3.Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Both pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive and -insensitive heterotrimeric G-proteins mediate ERK activation, and distinct signaling pathways are ascribed to GTP-bound α and free βγ G-protein subunits. In many cells, Ras-dependent ERK activation via GPCRs appears to be mediated by Gβγ dimers released from PTX-sensitive G-proteins (4.van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). However, Gβγ subunits derived from PTX-insensitive Gαq proteins have also been implicated in Ras-dependent ERK activation (5.Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). While Gi-coupled receptors are unanimously viewed as coupling to ERKs in a Ras-dependent manner, previous studies have produced contradictory results as to Ras-dependent or -independent ERK activation via Gq-coupled receptors in COS cells (5.Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 6.Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In many cases, interpretation of results is complicated by the fact that many Gq-coupled receptors have the propensity to concurrently activate Gq and Gi proteins, particularly when expressed in heterologous cell systems (8.Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In a variety of cellular systems GPCRs mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc adaptor proteins and their subsequent association with Grb2-SOS, thus initiating Ras-dependent stimulation of ERK activity (3.Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 4.van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Apart from non-receptor tyrosine kinases, RTKs like the PDGF and EGF receptors have also been invoked to participate in the signal transmission from GPCRs to ERKs (9.Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 10.Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), and we have provided evidence that the receptor cross-talk is realized in a cell-specific manner (11.Herrlich A. Daub H. Knebel A. Herrlich P. Ullrich A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Most probably, the molecular mechanisms underlying ligand-independent activation (transactivation) of RTKs via GPCRs differ between Gi- and Gq-coupled receptors (11.Herrlich A. Daub H. Knebel A. Herrlich P. Ullrich A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and are far from being understood. ERK activation by Gq-coupled receptors mediated by transactivation of RTKs naturally depends on Ras activation. However, it has recently been reported that in COS cells the agonist-bound m1 muscarinic receptor activates Ras via PKC by a novel mechanism clearly set apart from that initiated by activation of RTKs (7.Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The termination of GPCR signaling involves Gβγ-directed receptor phosphorylation by receptor kinases and subsequent binding of β-arrestins which inhibits further G-protein activation (12.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Besides terminating receptor/G-protein coupling, β-arrestins have also been implicated in Src recruitment to the agonist-occupied receptor, thereby initiating Ras-dependent ERK activation in a second wave of signal transduction emanating from various GPCRs (13.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the cellular mechanisms of ERK activation by Gq-coupled receptors, we resorted to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor because of several noteworthy receptor characteristics. In the pituitary gland GnRH interacts with a membranous receptor to regulate the synthesis and secretion of gonadotropic glycoprotein hormones and to secure the long-term maintenance of the gonadotropic phenotype (14.Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In pituitary gonadotropes expression of differentiation markers like glycoprotein hormone α- and β-subunits and the GnRH receptor require activation of the MAP kinase cascade (15.Roberson M.S.

Cloning of cDNAs coding for mammalian GnRH receptors of various species demonstrated that GnRH interacts with a serpentine G-protein-coupled receptor (14.Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) completely lacking a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. In terms of receptor function this structural peculiarity results in the absence of GRK-mediated phosphorylation (20.Willars G.B. Heding A. Vrecl M. Sellar R. Blomenröhr M. Nahorski S.R. Eidne K.A.

A systematic comparison with the pituitary thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor, furthermore, revealed that expression of the mammalian GnRH receptor at the plasma membrane is regulated in a β-arrestin-independent fashion (22.Vrecl M.

Finally, we demonstrated that the recombinant human receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells as well as the mouse receptor in gonadotropic αT3-1 cells initiate multiple signaling pathways by exclusively coupling to Gq/11 proteins. 2Grosse, R., Schmid, A., Schöneberg, T., Herrlich, A., Muhn, P., Schultz, G., and Gudermann, T. (2000)275, 9193–9200. Thus, in the case of the GnRH receptor various paradigms explaining ERK activation by GPCRs have to be challenged, and an unequivocal interpretation of functional data is not impeded by Gi-mediated effects as observed for various other primarily Gq-coupled receptors (8.Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the present paper we dissect the signaling pathway underlying Gq-mediated ERK activation in pituitary αT3-1 and transfected COS-7 cells. We provide direct evidence for PKC-mediated ERK activation subsequent to N17-Ras-sensitive Ras activation in response to GnRH receptor/Gq/11 coupling. GTP loading of Ras critically depends on PKC-induced activity of RTKs. In agonist-treated COS-7 and αT3-1 cells expressing the GnRH receptor, Src kinases contribute to Ras activation in concert with RTKs independently of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. PKC-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in COS-7 and αT3-1 cells and of the PDGF-β receptor in L cells supports the concept that cross-talk between Gq-coupling GPCRs and RTKs via PKC represents a general coupling mechanism. COS-7 cells were from ATCC, and αT3-1 cells were a gift of P. L. Mellon (23.Windle J.J. Weiner R.I. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Culture media and trypsin are from Biochrom. Fetal calf serum and phosphate-buffered saline were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. GnRH, AG1478, AG1296, PP2, PD98059, staurosporin, GF109203X, and TPA were from Calbiochem. BAPTA/AM was purchased from Molecular Probes. [γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products Inc. The enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Prestained protein marker (broad range) was obtained from New England Biolabs. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. COS-7 and αT3-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, L cells in α-modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. Cells were cultured at 37 °C gassed with 7% (COS-7 cells) or 5% (αT3-1 and L cells) CO2. For transient transfections of COS-7 cells, a calcium phosphate co-precipitation method was applied. Twenty μg of total plasmid DNA were used for transfections of 100-mm dishes of subconfluent cells. The transfection mixture contained constant amounts of GnRH receptor cDNA (24.Grosse R. Schöneberg T. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (5 μg/100-mm dish) and of other expression constructs supplemented with expression vector to keep the total amount of plasmid DNA constant. Cells were assayed 48 h after transfection. Under these controlled conditions co-transfection of COS-7 cells with different plasmids did not impair GnRH-induced phospholipase C activation (data not shown). Gonadotropic αT3-1 cells were transiently transfected by lipofection (FuGENE, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturers suggestions. Prior to stimulation, cells were serum-starved for 18 h (COS-7 and L cells) or 8 h (αT3-1 cells). Cells were challenged by incubation with serum-free culture medium containing the concentrations of various substances as indicated. Basal values were determined in serum-free medium. Stimulation of cells was carried out for 5 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium in 100-mm dishes as described in the respective figure legends. Reactions were stopped by washing cells once with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were then lysed for 15 min in 600 μl of cold lysis buffer per dish (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mmNa4P2O7, 500 μmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 0.1 μm aprotinin). Lysates were precleared by centrifugation, supernatants diluted with 600 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and subjected to immunoprecipitation at 4 °C overnight by using the appropriate antibodies. Subsequently, 100 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads (12.5%, w/v) (Sigma) were added, incubated at 4 °C on a rotor for 3–4 h, and precipitated by centrifugation. Precipitates were washed three times with cold lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). HA-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal 12CA5 anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Endogenously expressed ERK in αT3-1 cells was immunoprecipitated by a rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK2 antiserum C-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Shc immunoprecipitations were performed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-SHC antibody (Transduction Laboratories), EGFR immunoprecipitations with the monoclonal 108.1 antibody (25.Lax I. Bellot F. Howk R. Ullrich A. Givol D. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) generously provided by A. Ullrich. PDGF-β-R was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-PDGF-β-R antiserum (Santa Cruz). For Western blotting, the protein samples were transferred onto Biotrace polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pall), and tyrosine phosphorylation was determined with the monoclonal 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Thereafter, blots were reprobed with the anti-Shc (Transduction Laboratories) and anti-EGFR antibody (Santa Cruz) to control for the amounts of immunoprecipitated Shc and EGFR proteins, respectively. The appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (Fc specific) or anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma) were used at a 1:2,000 dilution and were visualized on x-ray film (Eastman Kodak) by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HA-ERK2 and endogenously expressed ERK was immunoprecipitated from COS-7 and αT3-1 cells by incubating precleared lysates with the appropriate antibody (see above). Immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mmmagnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEGTA, and 200 μm Na3VO4). Immune complexes were resuspended in kinase buffer, and kinase reactions were performed in a 50-μl volume supplemented with 250 μg/ml myelin basic protein (Sigma) and 2 μm protein kinase A inhibitor, fragment 6-22 amide (Sigma). The kinase assay was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of a 500 μm ATP solution containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). Incubations were carried out at room temperature for 20 min and were terminated by the addition of 6 μl of 88% formic acid. Reaction mixtures were then spotted onto Whatman P81 chromatography paper squares and washed four times in 150 mm phosphoric acid. Incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Basal counts of independently performed experiments ranged from 3,000 to 7,000 cpm/reaction. The radioactivity of samples incubated without immune complex was between 150 and 250 cpm. All assays were performed in duplicates. GST fusion proteins containing the minimal Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf1 (amino acids 51–131) were prepared with minor modifications as described (26.Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures of E. coli (DH5α) transformed with the plasmid pGEX-2T/GST-RBD (26.Herrmann C.

Wittinghofer were grown to anA 600 of 0.8, and fusion protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside (Sigma). After 2 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing 1.2 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μm aprotinin, and 1 μm leupeptin. After sonification of lysates, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were then centrifuged (12,000 ×g, 10 min at 4 °C), and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10%. The fusion protein preparations were stored in aliquots at −80 °C for up to 4 weeks. Activation of Ras was measured by a modification of the procedure described by de Rooij and Bos (27.de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). After stimulation of COS-7 cells in 100-mm dishes, monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed for 15 min by the addition of 600 μl of Ras-RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 μmaprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with GST-RBD precoupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation (5,000 rpm, 1 min at 4 °C), washed three times with RIPA buffer, and proteins were denatured in SDS sample buffer. Precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 15 or 12.5% acrylamide gels, and proteins were subsequently transferred to Biotrace polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pall). Ras proteins were probed with the monoclonal pan-Ras antibody (Oncogene) followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) antiserum and visualized as described above. We recently demonstrated that in several different cell lines agonist-bound human and murine GnRH receptors exclusively interact with Gq/11 proteins.2 Accordingly, GnRH-mediated ERK activation in the gonadotropic cell line αT3-1 is PTX-insensitive, however, inhibited after pharmacological blockade or down-regulation of PKC (18.Sundaresan S. Colin I.M. Pestell R.G. Jameson J.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19.Reiss N. Llevi L.N. Shacham S. Harris D. Seger R. Naor Z. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To further study signaling components involved in rapid ERK activation by GnRH challenge of αT3-1 cells, endogenous ERK isoforms were immunoprecipitated and subsequently analyzed in an in vitro kinase assay. When cells were stimulated with GnRH for 5 min, a 2-fold increase in ERK activity was observed (basal: 3292 ± 104 cpm; 200 nm GnRH: 6008 ± 390 cpm; mean ± S.D., n = 3) which could be suppressed to about 35% by a 20-min preincubation with the EGFR selective tyrphostine AG1478 (27.de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) (200 nm GnRH + 100 nm AG1478, 4268 ± 170 cpm). A partial inhibition of EGF-induced ERK activity by AG1478 was observed as well (10 ng/ml EGF, 5972 ± 150 cpm; 10 ng/ml EGF + 100 nm AG1478, 4390 ± 160 cpm). These findings lend support to the idea that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity may be an intermediate in rapid GnRH-induced ERK activation in gonadotropes. To gain further insight into the contribution of the EGFR tyrosine kinase to GnRH-induced ERK activation in αT3-1 cells, time course experiments were performed (Fig. 1). GnRH-dependent ERK activity was detectable 1 min after agonist addition and reached a peak value after 5 min. ERK activity remained elevated for up to 30 min and declined to basal values 1 h after GnRH challenge (see Fig. 1). Inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity by 100 nm of the specific tyrphostine AG1478 did not completely abolish GnRH-induced ERK activation, but significantly retarded the onset of agonist-dependent ERK activity (see Fig. 1) allowing maximal values to be reached only after 10 min. These results indicate that in αT3-1 gonadotropes EGFR tyrosine kinase activity is required for the rapid development of GnRH induced ERK activity. To be able to dissect the sigaling process leading to rapid GnRH-induced ERK activation in gonadotropes, we initially resorted to a pharmacological approach. As expected, incubation of cells with 5 μm of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 abrogated signal transmission from the GnRH receptor to ERK-MAPKs (Fig.2). In keeping with earlier reports (18.Sundaresan S. Colin I.M. Pestell R.G. Jameson J.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,19.Reiss N. Llevi L.N. Shacham S. Harris D. Seger R. Naor Z. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) we showed by means of treating cells with the specific inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (GF109203X) that PKC activity is required for rapid GnRH-dependent ERK activation (see Fig. 2). The pronounced effect of the specific Src inhibitor PP2 (1 μm) (see Fig. 2) suggested an involvement of Src tyrosine kinase in GnRH signaling to ERK as well. Since in neuroendocrine PC12 cells elevations of [Ca2+]i can substitute for receptor activation to stimulate ERK activity (28.Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23110-23117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we investigated the functional consequences of treating αT3-1 cells with the Ca2+-ionophore ionomycin. In accord with findings by Reisset al. (19.Reiss N. Llevi L.N. Shacham S. Harris D. Seger R. Naor Z. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we observed that a global [Ca2+]i elevation had only a marginal stimulatory effect compared with untreated controls and was not different from the dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1%) solvent control (see Fig. 2). In cells loaded with the fluorescent dye fura-2, 1 μm ionomycin led to a 5-fold increase in [Ca2+]i (data not shown). When increases in [Ca2+]i were precluded by preincubation of cells with the cell permeable Ca2+chelator BAPTA/AM, GnRH-mediated ERK activity was essentially unaffected (see Fig. 2). Collectively, our data indicate a substantial contribution of PKC as well as EGFR and Src tyrosine kinases to GnRH-mediated ERK activation in αT3-1 cells. Global increases in [Ca2+], however, are neither sufficient nor necessary for rapid GnRH-dependent ERK activation in these gonadotropic cells. To be able to effectively manipulate distinct signaling components of the GnRH receptor/ERK pathway, we resorted to easily transfectable COS-7 cells transiently expressing the human GnRH receptor, HA-tagged ERK2 and various dominant negative proteins as indicated. HA-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated after stimulation of cells, and kinase activity was measured in an in vitro kinase assay as described above. To assess a potential contribution of Gβγ released from activated Gq/11 proteins to receptor-mediated ERK activation, GnRH receptor-expressing COS-7 cells were additionally transfected with a cDNA construct coding for a fusion protein between the extracellular and transmembrane domain of CD8 and the C-terminal domain of βARK (29.Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) in order to sequester free βγ subunits. We had previously demonstrated the ability of the βARK-Ct construct to inhibit Gβγ-mediated PLCβ activation by LPA (30.Herrlich A. Kühn B. Grosse R. Schmid A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16764-16772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and to ablate LPA-induced ERK activation (11.Herrlich A. Daub H. Knebel A. Herrlich P. Ullrich A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, expression of CD8-βARK-Ct had no effect on basal or GnRH stimulated ERK2 activity. Collectively, these data suggest that signaling from the GnRH receptor to ERK-MAP kinases is mediated by αq/11 subunits without a measurable contribution of Gβγ. The role of PKC in ERK activation via Gq-coupled receptors is discussed controversially and may be defined by the type of cell under study (3.Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that PKC directly phosphorylates and activates Raf in a Ras-independent manner (31.Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). In keeping with the latter hypothesis overexpression of a dominant negative Raf-1 mutant, ΔRaf lacking potential regulatory phosphorylation sites (32.Cai H. Erhardt P. Troppmair J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Sithanandam G. Rapp U.R. Moscat J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7645-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), resulted in substantial suppression of GnRH-ev"

All mammalian PDEs have a similar structural organization with a conserved catalytic domain in the C-terminal half of the molecules and divergent N-terminal regulatory domains.

Recently, we showed that activities of full-length PDE3A and PDE3B mutants were recovered predominantly in particulate fractions of NIH-3006 fibroblasts and Sf9 insect cells, whereas N-terminal-truncated PDE3A mutants were cytosolic, suggesting that the N-terminal portion of PDE3 isoforms might be important in their association with cellular membranes (21.Leroy M.J.

This study was designed to define the role of the N-terminal hydrophobic domains in the targeting of PDE3 isoforms to membrane structures and to characterize other possible effects of those regions on the self-association of PDE3 isoforms and their sensitivity to specific PDE3 inhibitors. An ∼3.6-kb cDNA fragment that had been cloned into theXhoI site of pBluescript and contained the full-length open reading frame of mouse (M)PDE3B 2J.-R. Tang, M. Napolitano, M. Taira, S. Hockman, E. Degerman, and V. C. Manganiello, manuscript in preparation. was used as template to generate mutants lacking different amounts of N-terminal sequence. The presence of unique AlwnI and DraIII restriction sites in MPDE3B cDNA was utilized in production of the N-terminal truncations. To prepare M3B-Δ196 and M3B-Δ302 constructs (lacking, respectively, 196 and 302 aa), a common reverse primer, 5′-ACATTACCGCTCGAGAGAGAGCCAGCAGACACTGGTACA (corresponding to nt 1523–1500), was used. This primer contains the unique AlwnI restriction site (underlined) in MPDE3B. (In this report, nt 1 is A of the translation initiation codons of HPDE3A or MPDE3B.) The sense primers for M3B-Δ196 (5′-AATATACCGCTCGAGCCACCATGGGCGTCCTGGTGCTGCTCTTCGCC) and M3B-Δ302 (5′-AACAGACCGCTCGAGCCACCATGGAACAGATGATCCTCTGGGACTGG) contained a 5′-XhoI restriction site (underlined), consensus sequences for eukaryotic translation initiation and an ATG initiation codon (underlined) followed by specific MPDE3B sequences, corresponding to nt 589–612 in M3B-Δ196 and nt 907–930 in M3B-Δ302. To prepare M3B-Δ604 (lacking 604 aa), the sense primer (5′-CTAGATGACTCGAGCCCGCCACCATGAAGAAAGCCTGCAGGGAG) contained an XhoI site (underlined), Kozak sequence and the MPDE3B ATG-codon (corresponding to nt 1813), followed by MPDE3B-specific downstream sequence (corresponding to nt 1813–1833). For M3B-Δ604, the antisense primer, 5′-CACAGGGGGCCCACAATGTGGGTGATAAAAG (corresponding to nt 2927 to 2897), contained the unique DraIII site (underlined). Fragments were amplified by PCR with 100 ng of template,pfu DNA polymerase, and 7.7 pmol of primer for 30 cycles of 95 °C/1 min, 55 °C/30 s, 72 °C/1 min, followed by final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products contained anXhoI restriction site just upstream of the ATG and anAlwnI site near the C terminus in M3B-Δ196 and M3B-Δ302 or a DraIII site near the C terminus in M3B-Δ604. The PCR products were ligated into pCR (TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen) and subclones (pCR3B-Δ196, pCR3B-Δ302, and pCR3B-Δ604) were sequenced with ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin Elmer) followed by fluorescence detection on an Applied Biosystem model 373A sequencer. To generate N-terminal deletion mutants with a C-terminal FLAG epitope, a full-length MPDE3B clone that encoded a C-terminal FLAG sequence, ATTATAAAGATGATGATGATAAA, 3Y. Shakur, K. Takeda, Y. Kenan, Z.-X. Yu, E. Degerman, V. Ferrans, and V. C. Manganiello, submitted for publication. was digested with AlwnI/XhoI orDraIII/XhoI to produce ∼1.8 kbAlwnI-XhoI (nt 1505–3304) or ∼0.4 kbDraIII/XhoI (nt 2907–3304) FLAG-tagged cassettes, respectively. pCR3B-Δ196 and pCR3B-Δ302 were digested with XhoI/AlwnI, and pCR3B-Δ604 withXhoI/DraIII; N-terminal fragments were separated by electrophoresis (1.5% low melting point agarose) and purified using Wizard PCR Preps (Promega). The N-terminalXhoI-AlwnI fragments of pCR3B-Δ196 (934 base pairs) and pCR3B-Δ302 (598 base pairs) were ligated with the C-terminal MPDE3B AlwnI-XhoI FLAG cassette into pBluescript(SK). For M3B-Δ604, the N-terminalXhoI-DraIII fragment of pCR3BΔ604 was ligated with the C-terminal DraIII-XhoI FLAG cassette into pBluescript (SK). FLAG-tagged MPDE3B, M3B-Δ196, M3B-Δ302, and M3B-Δ604 cDNAs were excised from pBluescript and subcloned into the XhoI restriction site of the Baculovirus transfer vector pAcSG2 (Pharmingen). The 5′-3′ orientation of the MPDE3B cDNA fragments was verified by restriction with StuI andDraIII. Dr. John Colicelli (UCLA) kindly provided HPDE3A N-terminal deletion mutants H3A-Δ189, H3A-Δ397, H3A-Δ510, H3A-Δ607, and H3A-Δ721 in the modified yeast expression pADNA54 vector (22.Pillai R. Staub S.F. Colicelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30676-30681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mutants were generated from the ∼4-kb HPDE3A cDNA previously cloned into theEcoRI site of pBluescript (KS) (11.Meacci E. Taira M. Moos Jr., M. Smith C.J. Movsesian M.A. Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3721-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). HPDE3A cDNA contains a unique NcoI site at the initiation ATG codon (11.Meacci E. Taira M. Moos Jr., M. Smith C.J. Movsesian M.A. Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3721-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The mutants in pADNA54 had been constructed (22.Pillai R. Staub S.F. Colicelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30676-30681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to include anNcoI site followed by appropriate downstream HPDE3A sequences encoding the initiation ATG plus aa 190–1141 (H3A-Δ189), aa 398–1141 (H3A-Δ397), aa 511–1141 (H3A-Δ510), aa 608–1141 (H3A-Δ607), or aa 722–1141 (H3A-Δ721). To transfer H3A-Δ189, H3A-Δ397, and H3A-Δ510 recombinants into pVL1393, theNcoI-NotI fragment was first removed from the ∼4-kb HPDE3A cDNA in pBluescript (KS) (11.Meacci E. Taira M. Moos Jr., M. Smith C.J. Movsesian M.A. Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3721-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Since HPDE3A cDNA contains a unique NcoI site at the initiation ATG codon and the NotI site is not in HPDE3A cDNA but in the pBluescript multiple cloning site downstream from the 3′ end of HPDE3A cDNA, digestion with NcoI-NotI yielded pKS containing the intact 5′ end of HPDE3A cDNA, i.e. theEcoRI cloning/restriction site, ∼30 nt of upstream 5′-untranslated region and the initiation ATG codon. H3A-Δ189, H3A-Δ397, and H3A-Δ510 cDNAs were excised from pADNA54 vectors with NcoI-NotI and ligated to pBluescript (KS) HPDE3A that had been restricted with NcoI-NotI. The products were transformed into DH5α, amplified, and purified. H3A-Δ189, H3A-Δ397, and H3A-Δ510 recombinants were excised from pBluescript (KS) with EcoRI and ligated to PVL1393 (Pharmingen), which had been digested with EcoRI.NcoI-NotI fragments of H3A-Δ607 and H3A-Δ721 constructs were excised from the pADNA54 vector and ligated directly to pACSG2 (Pharmingen) previously digested withNcoI/NotI; the products were transformed into XL-Blue2 (Stratagene). The 5′-3′ orientation of the cDNA fragments was determined by restriction analysis with SalI (pVL1393/H3A-Δ189, H3A-Δ397, and H3A-Δ510) or withXhoI-NotI (pAcSG2/H3A-Δ607 and H3A-Δ721). Sequence analysis (Sequenase version 2.0) confirmed the 5′-EcoRI-NcoI(ATG) sequence in HPDE3A recombinants that had been generated by PCR in construction of the deletion recombinants (22.Pillai R. Staub S.F. Colicelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30676-30681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare H3A-Δ321 and H3A-Δ457 constructs (lacking, respectively, 321 and 457 aa), a common reverse primer, 5′-GAACCTAGGCTTTGTTTGGC (corresponding to nt 1660–1682), was used. This primer contains the unique AvrII restriction site (underlined) in HPDE3A. The sense primers for H3A-Δ321 (5′-ATATCGCCATGGGGCATTCAGAATGGGACCACAAA CGAGGGCC) and H3A-Δ457 (5′-ATATCGCCATGGTACGGAGAGACCGCAGCACC) contained a 5′-NcoI restriction site encoding an initiation ATG codon (underlined) followed by specific HPDE3A sequences corresponding to nt 964–998 in H3A-Δ321 and nt 1372–1392 in H3A-Δ457. Fragments which contained NcoI-AvrII restriction sites were amplified by PCR with 100 ng of HPDE3A template, pfu DNA polymerase, and 7.7 pmol of primer for 30 cycles of 95 °C/1 min, 55 °C/30 s, 72 °C/1 min, followed by final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The NcoI-AvrII fragment of H3A-Δ397 in PVL1393 was excised and replaced by ligation with purified restricted NcoI-AvrII PCR fragments of H3A-Δ321 and H3A-Δ457. Subclones were sequenced to verify sequence that had been generated by PCR. Sf9 cells (CRL 1711, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained and propagated at 27 °C in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine fetal serum. Transfer of H3A-Δ607, H3A-Δ721, MPDE3B, M3B-Δ196, M3B-Δ302, or M3B-Δ604 from pAcSG2 and H3A-Δ189, H3A-Δ321, H3A-Δ397, H3A-Δ457, or H3A-Δ510 from pVL1393 to Autographa california nuclear polyhedrin virus was accomplished by homologous recombination using calcium phosphate transfection (ABaculogold Transfection Kit, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Supernatant containing recombinant virus was collected after 5 days and amplified 2–4 times. A standard infection was carried out for 60 h with 1 × 107Sf9 cells per 75-cm2 tissue culture flask and 1 ml of supernatant containing virus. PDE activities of untagged and FLAG-tagged MPDE3B mutants were similar, indicating that addition of the C-terminal FLAG sequence did not affect PDE activity (data not shown). Proteins in Sf9 cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% gels (120 min, 100 V) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (90 min, 100 V) which were incubated overnight with TNA buffer (0.15m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 50 mg/ml BSA and 5 mg/ml ovalbumin. Membranes were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in TNA buffer containing 10 mg/ml BSA and anti-platelet cGI-PDE antibodies (10.Degerman E. Moos Jr., M. Rascon A. Vasta V. Meacci E. Smith C.J. Lindgren S. Andersson K.E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for HPDE3A mutants, or, for MPDE3B mutants, either anti-rat PDE3B C terminus antibodies (21.Leroy M.J. Degerman E. Taira M. Murata T. Wang L.H. Movsesian M.A. Meacci E. Manganiello V.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10194-10202Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies (IB13010, Kodak). Membranes were washed once with TNA containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and three times (5 min each) with phosphate-buffered saline. Membranes were incubated for 1 h with TNA buffer containing 10 mg/ml BSA and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Promega), then washed twice with TNA plus 0.05% Nonidet P-40, three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and evaluated by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sf9 cells (107 cells per 75 cm2 flask) were harvested 60 h after infection. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation (800 rpm, 5 min), suspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (100 mm TES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, and 0.5 mm Pefabloc), sonicated on ice (40% duty cycle, 20 s pulses, twice), and centrifuged (100,000 ×g, 60 min, 4 °C) to separate particulate and cytosolic fractions. For solubilization, cells were incubated for 60 min on ice in homogenization buffer containing 0.5 m NaBr without or with 1% C13E12 (non-ionic detergent) followed by sonication and centrifugation. Particulate fractions were dispersed in 1 ml of homogenization buffer and sonicated (on ice, 20 s, twice). PDE activities and protein content were measured in particulate and cytosolic fractions. H3A-Δ397, H3A-Δ607, H3A-Δ721, M3B-Δ196, M3B-Δ302, and M3B-Δ604 recombinants were subjected to gel filtration chromatography. Sf9 cells (3 × 107 cells per 75-cm2 flask) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline as described above, suspended in homogenization buffer containing 0.5 m NaBr, sonicated, and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). Samples were applied directly to an Ultrogel AcA 34 or, after partial purification of PDE3 mutants by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, to a TSK-G3000SW HPLC column. Supernatant fractions (0.4 ml containing 4–5 mg of total protein) were applied to an Ultrogel AcA 34 (IBF Biotechnics) column (53.6 × 0.9 cm) which was equilibrated and eluted with glycerol-free homogenization buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Samples of fractions (0.5 ml) were assayed for PDE activity and protein content. Molecular mass markers (Pharmacia) were thyroglobulin (670 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (220 kDa), BSA (67 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). Other samples were desalted on PD-10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (equilibrated and eluted with glycerol- and salt-free homogenization buffer), and partially purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel columns (1 ml) equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted successively with buffer containing 50, 150, 300, and 500 mm NaCl. The 300 mm NaCl eluates, which contained at least 90% of recovered PDE activity, were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a TSK-G3000SW HPLC column (60 × 7.5-mm inner diameter) (TosoHaas) that was equilibrated and eluted (1 ml/min, 40 bar pressure) with glycerol-free homogenization buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) were thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B-12 (1.3 kDa). For assay of cAMP PDE activity (23.Kincaid R.L. Manganiello V.C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), samples were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in a total volume of 0.3 ml containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 8.3 mm MgCl, 0.1 μm [3H]cAMP (24,000 cpm). PDE3 activity (picomoles of cAMP hydrolyzed per min) is that cAMP-PDE activity inhibited by 1 μm cilostamide (a specific PDE3 inhibitor). For IC50 determinations, lysates of Sf9 cells containing different recombinant proteins were assayed as described above (with 0.1 μm[3H]cAMP) without or with 5–6 concentrations of the indicated inhibitors, including lixazinone, cilostamide, trequinsin, and rolipram (final concentration of 0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v) in all samples). For some experiments, 1% Nonidet P-40 was added to the Sf9 cell lysates for 30 min before homogenization and centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 rpm). Activity in the absence of inhibitors was taken as 100%, and IC50 values were calculated from graphical analysis of inhibition curves. Protein content was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit or the bicinchoninic acid Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce) for experiments in which detergents were present, with BSA as standard. The N-terminal portions of HPDE3A and MPDE3B were arbitrarily divided into two regions, region 1 (aa 1–300) and region 2 (aa 301–500). Region 1 contains a large hydrophobic domain, encompassing aa ∼60–255 and 68–250 in HPDE3A and MPDE3B, respectively (Fig. 1). Hydrophobicity/hydrophilicty plots (24.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) predict six membrane-spanning segments in the large N-terminal hydrophobic domain of region 1, and a smaller downstream hydrophobic domain between aa 340–390 and 320–370 in region 2 of HPDE3A and MPDE3B, respectively (Figs. 1 and 2). To determine the function(s) of regions 1 and 2, a series of recombinants containing progressive deletions of the N-terminal sequences of HPDE3A and MPDE3B were constructed and expressed in Sf9 cells (Fig.2). On Western immunoblots, full-length HPDE3A (21.Leroy M.J. Degerman E. Taira M. Murata T. Wang L.H. Movsesian M.A. Meacci E. Manganiello V.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10194-10202Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), HPDE3A N-terminal deletion mutants (H3A-Δ189, H3A-Δ397, H3A-Δ510, H3A-Δ607, and H3A-Δ721, lacking 189, 397, 510, 607, and 721 aa, respectively (Fig.3 A)), full-length MPDE3B and MPDE3B N-terminal deletion mutants (M3B-Δ196, M3B-Δ302, and M3B-Δ604, lacking 196, 302, and 604 aa, respectively (Fig.3 B)) exhibited molecular masses slightly greater than those predicted from their deduced aa sequences, perhaps reflecting post-translation modification(s). PDE activities of the smaller recombinants, H3A-Δ397, H3A-Δ510, or M3B-Δ604, were generally higher than activities of full-length HPDE3A or MPDE3B. Although others have reported that H3A-Δ721 was catalytically inactive in a yeast expression system (22.Pillai R. Staub S.F. Colicelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30676-30681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that in Sf9 cells lysates this construct was catalytically active.Figure 2PDE3A, PDE3B, and N-terminal deletion mutants. The N-terminal portions of PDE3A and B were arbitrarily divided into region 1 (aa 1–300) and region 2 (aa 301–500). Deduced aa sequences predict helical transmembrane segments in the large N-terminal hydrophobic domain (striped box) of region 1 which includes aa 60–255 in HPDE3A and aa 68–250 in MPDE3B, a smaller hydrophobic region (light dotted box) in region 2 between aa 340–390 HPDE3A and aa 320–370 in MPDE3B, and the conserved C-terminal catalytic domain (black box). In MPDE3B recombinants, a C-terminal flag epitope tag (heavier dotted box) was added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Western blots of N-terminal deletion mutants of HPDE3A and MPDE3B. Samples of Sf9 cell lysates containing 2-5 pmol/min PDE3 activity/lane were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and Western immunoblots, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HPDE3A and MPDE3B recombinants were detected with anti-platelet PDE3A antibodies (panel A) or with anti-flag M2-monoclonal antibodies (panel B), respectively.

Activities of H3A-Δ321 and M3B-Δ302,which lack the transmembrane segments of the large N-terminal hydrophobic domain in region 1 but retain the second hydrophobic domain in region 2 (Fig. 2), were found almost equally in particulate and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 4, A and D). Activities of H3A-Δ397 and H3A-Δ457, which lack all of region 1 and the smaller hydrophobic domain in region 2 (Figs. 1 and 2), were found predominantly (70–80% of total H3A-Δ397 and H3A-Δ457 activities) in the cytosol (Fig. 4, A and D). Activities of H3A-Δ510 and M3B-Δ604, which lack both region 1 and region 2 (Figs.1 and 2), were virtually completely recovered in cytosolic fractions (Fig. 4, A and D).

https://openalex.org/W1994707452,"Interleukin (IL)-1β signals through various adapter proteins and kinases that lead to activation of numerous downstream targets, including the transcription factors including NF-κB. In this study, we analyzed and characterized the effect of the differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells on IL-1β-mediated NF-κB activation and IL-8 gene expression. We report that IL-8 mRNA accumulation and protein secretion were down-regulated in IL-1β- and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated differentiated HT-29 cells (HT-29/MTX, where MTX is methotrexate) compared with undifferentiated cells (HT-29/p), whereas no differential effects were found following tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or phorbol myristate acetate stimulation. Cross-linking and affinity binding studies reveal that IL-1β exclusively binds the type I receptor (IL-1RI) and not IL-1RII in both HT-29/p and HT-29/MTX cells. IL-1β-mediated IκB kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity were both diminished in differentiated HT-29 cells. DNA binding activity in differentiated HT-29 cells relative to HT-29/p cells was strongly reduced following IL-1β exposure but not after TNF-α stimulation. The proximal IL-1 signaling molecule IL-1 receptor-associated kinase was not degraded in IL-1β-stimulated HT-29 cells, in contrast to Caco-2 cells. κB-luciferase reporter gene activity was 16-fold higher following TNF receptor-associated factor-6 transfection after IL-1β stimulation in HT-29/MTX cells. We conclude that cellular differentiation of HT-29 cells selectively impairs the IL-1β signaling pathway inhibiting both NF-κB and JNK activity in response to IL-1β. This relative unresponsiveness to IL-1β may represent an important regulatory mechanism of differentiated intestinal epithelial cells. Interleukin (IL)-1β signals through various adapter proteins and kinases that lead to activation of numerous downstream targets, including the transcription factors including NF-κB. In this study, we analyzed and characterized the effect of the differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells on IL-1β-mediated NF-κB activation and IL-8 gene expression. We report that IL-8 mRNA accumulation and protein secretion were down-regulated in IL-1β- and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated differentiated HT-29 cells (HT-29/MTX, where MTX is methotrexate) compared with undifferentiated cells (HT-29/p), whereas no differential effects were found following tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or phorbol myristate acetate stimulation. Cross-linking and affinity binding studies reveal that IL-1β exclusively binds the type I receptor (IL-1RI) and not IL-1RII in both HT-29/p and HT-29/MTX cells. IL-1β-mediated IκB kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity were both diminished in differentiated HT-29 cells. DNA binding activity in differentiated HT-29 cells relative to HT-29/p cells was strongly reduced following IL-1β exposure but not after TNF-α stimulation.

The migration from the crypt base to the surface of the colon is accompanied by cellular differentiation that leads to important morphological and functional changes. Although several studies have shown that this process involves substantial changes of cellular morphology, growth, proliferation, and expression of biochemical markers (1.Louvard D. Kedinger M. Hauri H.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 157-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 2.Zweibaum A. Laburthe M. Grasset E. Louvard D. Frizell R.F.H. Handbook of Physiology: The Gastrointestinal System IV. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1991: 223-255Google Scholar), little is known about the alteration of immunological functions during epithelial differentiation. It has been reported that spontaneous or sodium butyrate-induced epithelial cell differentiation inhibits IL1-1β-induced IL-8 gene expression in Caco-2 cells (3.Huang N. Katz J.P. Martin D.R. Wu G.D. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4.Huang N. Wu G.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 427: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism for this down-regulation is unclear. Moreover, the effect of epithelial cell differentiation on the NF-κB signaling pathway is unknown. We have shown that cytokine-induced IL-8 gene expression in IEC requires activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (5.Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Jobin C.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 3474-3483PubMed Google Scholar). Cytokine-induced NF-κB activation is a complex phenomenon involving the participation of multiple coordinated kinases, some of them dedicated to a particular cytokine pathway. For example, following TNF-α stimulation, the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF-2) and the adapter receptor-interacting protein are recruited to the cytoplasmic portion of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR-1) via the intermediate action of TNFR-1 receptor-associated death domain (9.Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar, 10.Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). In contrast IL-1β signaling requires coordinated participation of the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), MyD88, and the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) which associates/activates TRAF-6 which in turn activates the TAK1 kinase (11.Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.-L. Di Marco F. Frech L. Tschopp J. J. Biol.

At this point both TRAF-2/receptor-interacting protein and TRAF-6/TAK1-transmitted signals converge upon either the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), which activates the IKK protein complex (16.Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham E.T. Marcu K.B. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moretti F. Fulco M. Balsano C. Levrero M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26079-26082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). NIK associates with TRAF-2 or TRAF-6 following TNF-α and IL-1β stimulation, respectively, and is thought to be a cytokine-integrating signal dedicated to NF-κB activation (18.Natoli G. Costanzo A. Moretti F. Fulco M. Balsano C. Levrero M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26079-26082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). NIK-activated IKK then phosphorylates IκBα at serine residues 32 and 36 which triggers its ubiquitination/degradation with subsequent release of NF-κB (19.Verma I.M. Stevenson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11758-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Exposure of HT-29 cells, which are transformed colonic epithelial cell line, to increasing doses of methotrexate results in the elimination of undifferentiated cells and favors the emergence of a stable differentiated epithelial cell population (20.Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Zweibaum A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6334-6343PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Lesuffleur T. Violette S. Vasile-Pandrea I. Dussaulx E. Barbat A. Muleris M. Zweibaum A. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Many laboratories have used these cells to study the effect of cellular differentiation on epithelial cell gene regulation. In this study, we characterize the effect of cellular differentiation on the IL-1β signaling pathway. We report that colonic cell differentiation is associated with a strong decrease of IL-1β-mediated JNK and IKK activity that correlates with reduced NF-κB DNA binding activity. However, TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activity was unaffected by cellular differentiation. Similarly, IL-8 gene expression was strongly inhibited in IL-1β- and LPS- but not in TNF-α- or PMA-stimulated differentiated cells, suggesting a selective effect of differentiation on IL-1 signaling pathway. The proximal IL-1β kinase IRAK steady-state level was lower in differentiated compared with undifferentiated HT-29 cells and was not degraded following IL-1β stimulation as opposed to the relatively undifferentiated Caco-2 cells. TRAF-6 overexpression triggered a strong increase in κB-luciferase activity in HT-29/MTX. Therefore, IEC differentiation down-regulates the responsiveness of the IL-1β signaling pathway downstream of IL-1R but upstream of NIK. The human colonic epithelial cells HT-29 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA; ATCC HTB 38), methotrexate-differentiated HT-29 cells (HT-29/MTX, provided by Dr. Lesuffleur, INSERM, Villejuif, France) (20.Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Zweibaum A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6334-6343PubMed Google Scholar), and Caco-2 cells were cultured as described previously (5.Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with human recombinant interleukin-1β (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), human recombinant TNF-α (R & D Systems), or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Sigma). Human recombinant intracellular IL-1R antagonist type I was a kind gift of Dr. S. Haskill (Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). Polymorphonuclear cells were obtained and isolated from healthy volunteers as described previously (22.Jobin C. Gauthier J. Inflammation. 1997; 21: 235-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Polymorphonuclear and HT-29 cells were stimulated overnight with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Salmonella typhimurium wild type, Ribi Immunochem, Hamilton, MT) at 100 ng/ml and 5 μg/ml, respectively, or IL-1β (2 ng/ml). For the IL-1 receptor type II (IL-1RII) blockade, cells were preincubated for 15 min with a monoclonal anti-IL-1RII antibody (10 μg/ml; genzyme, Cambridge, MA). Cell viability before and after plating was >95% by trypan blue dye exclusion. RNA was isolated using Trizol® (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA (5 μg/lane) was electrophoresed through 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and immobilized on Nytran nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by capillary action. Blots were prehybridized in 6× SSPE, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, 200 μg/ml single-stranded DNA, and 50% formamide at 42 °C for at least 2 h before the addition of the probe. cDNA probes for IL-8 and β-actin were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming as described previously (6.Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were sequentially washed in 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at room temperature and 42 °C and once in 0.2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 56 °C. Blots were exposed to autoradiography film (XAR-5, Eastman Kodak, Co.) with intensifying screens at −70 °C for 1–5 days. HT-29/MTX and HT-29 cells were stimulated for various times (0–90 min) with IL-1β or TNF-α (both at 2 ng/ml), and then nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (5.Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts (5 μg) were incubated with radiolabeled double-stranded class I major histocompatibility complex κB sites (GGCTGGGGATTCCCCATCT), separated by nondenaturating electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography as described previously (5.Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated (2 × 106 cells) in 100-mm dishes. At approximately 80% confluency, cells were stimulated with IL-1β (2 ng/ml) for 0–20 min. The cells were scraped, washed with ice-cold PBS, and then lysed in Triton buffer (23.Raingeaud J. Gupta S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (5.Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay. IKK assay was performed as described previously (8.Jobin C. Bradham C.A. Russo M.P. Juma B. Narula A.S. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3474-3483PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the IKK complex was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-human IKKα antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Immunoprecipitates were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase reactions containing [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biochemicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) and recombinant substrate GST-IκBα (amino acid 1–54) immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. Substrate protein was resolved by gel electrophoresis, and phosphate incorporation was assessed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). JNK activity was assessed in cells using anin vitro kinase assay as described previously (24.Jobin C. Hellerbrand C. Licato L.L. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. Gut. 1998; 42: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-c-Jun protein (amino acids 1–79), containing the activation domain of c-Jun protein, was utilized as substrate. 25 μg of whole cell extracts was incubated with 5 μg of substrate protein linked to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After extensive washing of the complexes, the kinase reaction was performed with [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol). The proteins were fractionated using 12.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized/quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Coomassie staining was used to demonstrate equal protein loading. A mutated GST-c-Jun (Ser-63 and Ser-73 substitution to Ala; GST-c-JunAA) was used as this substituted protein cannot be phosphorylated by colonic epithelial cells (25.Licato L.L. Brenner D.A. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1998; 43: 1454-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Kinase assays were performed in duplicates using whole cell extracts from two independent experiments. Cells were stimulated with IL-1β (2 ng/ml) for 0–60 min. The cells were lysed in 1× Laemmli buffer, and 20 μg of protein was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Anti-IRAK (generous gift of Dr. D. K. Miller, Merck) diluted 1:5000, anti-IKKα (PharMingen) diluted 1:1000, or anti-IκBα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA) were used to detect immunoreactive IRAK, IKKα or IκBα, respectively, using the enhanced chemiluminescence light (ECL) detecting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (5.Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar). HT-29/MTX cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (5.Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar). The (κB)3-luciferase motif consists of three consensus NF-κB sites linked to luciferase (26.Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing TRAF-6 (2 μg; generous gift of Dr. Jun-ichiro Inoue, University of Tokyo, Japan) or (κB)3-luciferase were transfected in combination or alone as described under “Results,” and the total amount of DNA was equalized with empty vector. Transfected cells were incubated overnight after which the DNA/LipofectAMINE media were replaced with the serum-containing media and then the cells were incubated for an additional 12 h. Cells were treated with or without IL-1β (2 ng/ml) for 12 h after which extracts were prepared using enhanced luciferase assay reagents (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA). Luciferase assays were performed on a Monolight 2010 luminometer for 20 s (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA), and results were normalized for extract protein concentrations measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. HT-29/p and HT-29/MTX cells were grown to confluency in 24-well plates. Cells were incubated with 10−11m125I-IL-1β (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) alone or in the presence of a 500–1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled IL-1β or TNF-α, respectively, for 3 h at 4 °C in CO2-independent medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were washed three times in binding medium and once in 1× PBS, trypsinized, and then transferred to borosilicate tubes and counted for 1 min in a γ-counter. Cell viability and number was assessed by trypan blue staining. HT-29/p and HT-29/MTX cells were grown to confluency in 12-well plates. Cells were incubated with 10−10m125I-IL-1β (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) alone or in the presence of either 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled IL-1β, 1000-fold molar excess anti-IL-1RI, or anti-IL-1RII antibodies for 4 h at room temperature in CO2-independent medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) on an orbital shaker. Cells were washed three times with cold 1× PBS, and the cross-linking reagent bis(succinimidyl)suberate (1.3 mg/ml, Pierce) was added, and the cells were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature as described above. The cells were washed twice with cold 1× PBS and then lysed in 1× Laemmli buffer. 40 μg of protein was electrophoresed on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then visualized by autoradiography and by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Human IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) of cell culture supernatants from HT-29 cells was performed in duplicate according to the manufacturer's specifications (R & D Systems). Differentiation of Caco-2 cells has been reported to decrease IL-1β-mediated IL-8 secretion (3.Huang N. Katz J.P. Martin D.R. Wu G.D. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4.Huang N. Wu G.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 427: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether differentiation of HT-29 cells would lead to a similar alteration of IL-1β responsiveness. The effect of cell differentiation on IL-8 gene expression was investigated using methotrexate-differentiated HT-29 cells (HT-29/MTX) and the undifferentiated parental HT-29 cells (HT-29/p) as contrasts. Cells were stimulated (1–3 h) with IL-1β (2 ng/ml), and then IL-8 mRNA accumulation was determined by Northern blotting. As previously shown (5.Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Jobin C.

In contrast, this IL-1β-mediated IL-8 induction was severely impaired in HT-29/MTX cells where maximal induction reached only 15% of the level found in HT-29/p and exhibited peak expression at 1 h rather than 3 h upon IL-1β stimulation (Fig. 1). To define further the relative lack of IL-8 expression in differentiated cells, HT-29/p and HT-29/MTX cells were stimulated with various doses of IL-1β (0.001–10 ng/ml), TNF-α (0.01–100 ng/ml), or PMA (0.01–100 ng/ml) for 12 h, then IL-8 concentration was assessed by ELISA in cell-free supernatants. TNF-α increased IL-8 secretion in both HT-29/MTX and HT-29/p cells in a dose-dependent manner with no marked difference in the response between the cell lines (Fig.2 A). IL-8 secretion was also stimulated by PMA in both HT-29/MTX and HT-29/p cells in a dose-dependent manner with a consistently higher response in HT-29/MTX cells at each dose of PMA (Fig. 2 B). In accordance with the RNA results, IL-1β-mediated IL-8 secretion was strongly reduced in HT-29/MTX compared with HT-29/p cells with a blunted dose response (Fig. 2 C). These data demonstrate that HT-29/MTX cells have the capacity to produce high levels of IL-8 in response to certain stimuli. However, as described in Caco-2 cells (3.Huang N. Katz J.P. Martin D.R. Wu G.D. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,4.Huang N. Wu G.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 427: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), cellular differentiation specifically inhibits IL-1β-mediated IL-8 gene expression in HT-29 cells.Figure 2Lack of IL-8 secretion in IL-1β- but not PMA or TNF -α-stimulated HT-29/MTX cells.Undifferentiated parental HT-29 cells (HT-29/p) and methotrexate-differentiated HT-29 cells (HT-29/MTX 10−3) were stimulated with various concentrations of TNF-α (A), PMA (B), or IL-1β (C) for 12 h after which immunoreactive IL-8 concentrations were measured in cell supernatants using an ELISA technique. These results are expressed as means of triplicate determinations and are representative of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The IL-1β signaling cascade is initiated by its binding to the IL-1 receptor type 1 (28.Ohno Y. Lee J. MacDermott R.P. Sanderson I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10279-10284Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both HT-29/p and HT-29/MTX cells express intracellular IL-1R antagonist I (icIL-1RA) protein that binds to the type I IL-1R with pure antagonistic activity (29.Böcker U. Damião A. Holt L. Han D.S.

Han D.S. Jobin C. Panja A. Mayer L. Sartor R.B. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 1426-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We wanted to exclude the possibility that icIL-1RA I secreted into the supernatant caused the observed differences of IL-1β-induced IL-8 secretion. Analysis of the cell-free supernatant after a culture period of 24 h revealed an icIL-1RA I concentration of less than 0.2 ng/ml for both cell lines (data not shown). However, IL-1β-induced IL-8 secretion was inhibited (65%) only by much higher exogenous doses of icIL-1RA (10 ng/ml), with almost no inhibition by 1 ng/ml, which is over 5-fold more than measured levels of secreted icIL-1RA in our cells (Fig.3). Furthermore, neutralization of IL-1RA by pretreatment of HT-29/p and HT-29/MTX cells with antiserum to IL-1RA did not enhance the IL-1β-induced IL-8 secretion (data not shown). Finally, IL-1β binding to its receptor was not blocked by cellular expression of icIL-1RA (see below). Receptor-ligand interaction triggers the activation of various kinases that transmit cytokine-activated signals toward different effector molecules that ultimately modulate cellular gene expression. Because NF-κB activation is critical in IL-1β-mediated IL-8 expression in HT-29 cells (5.Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Jobin C.

Immunology. 1998; 95: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we next determined the effect of cellular differentiation on the IL-1β signaling cascade by dissecting the signaling cascade leading to NF-κB activation. First, IL-1β binding to its receptor was compared in differentiated and undifferentiated cells. Expression of IL-1β receptors on the surface of HT-29/p and HT-29/MTX cells was demonstrated using a competitive ligand binding assay. Interestingly, 125I-IL-1β binding was higher in HT-29/MTX than HT-29/p (Fig.4 A), suggesting that impaired IL-8 secretion in HT-29/MTX was not due to absent or reduced IL-1β binding. Binding of 125I-IL-1β was specific since a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled IL-1β reduced 125I-IL-1β binding by more than 80% in both cell lines (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, unlabeled TNF-α did not significantly inhibit125I-IL-1β binding in either cell line (data not shown). IL-1RII has been shown to act as a decoy receptor for IL-1 cytokine (32.Colotta F.

However, an 125I-IL-1β cross-link affinity study revealed that IL-1β exclusively binds the IL-1RI in both HT-29/p and HT-29/MTX cells (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and7). The binding of 125I-IL-1β was specific since either unlabeled IL-1β or IL-1RI antibody reduced125I-IL-1β binding in both cell lines with no effect of IL-1RII antibody (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and 8). In addition, functional studies using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against the IL-1RII demonstrated that IL-1β-mediated IL-8 secretion is not augmented by IL-1R blockade in HT-29/MTX cells (TableI). In contrast, IL-8 secretion in response to IL-β, but not LPS, was increased 2-fold by blockade of IL-1RII in control PMN, a level similar to a previous report (34.Sims J.E. Gayle M.A. Slack J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2079036036,"In the Drosophila visual cascade, the transient receptor potential (TRP) calcium channel, phospholipase Cβ (no-receptor-potential A), and an eye-specific isoform of protein kinase C (eye-PKC) comprise a multimolecular signaling complex via their interaction with the scaffold protein INAD. Previously, we showed that the interaction between INAD and eye-PKC is a prerequisite for deactivation of a light response, suggesting eye-PKC phosphorylates proteins in the complex. To identify substrates of eye-PKC, we immunoprecipitated the complex from head lysates using anti-INAD antibodies and performed in vitro kinase assays. Wild-type immunocomplexes incubated with [32P]ATP revealed phosphorylation of TRP and INAD. In contrast, immunocomplexes frominaC mutants missing eye-PKC, displayed no phosphorylation of TRP or INAD. We also investigated protein phosphatases that may be involved in the dephosphorylation of proteins in the complex. Dephosphorylation of TRP and INAD was partially suppressed by the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid, microcystin, and protein phosphatase inhibitor-2. These phosphatase activities were enriched in the cytosol of wild-type heads, but drastically reduced in extracts prepared from glass mutants, which lack photoreceptors. Our findings indicate that INAD functions as RACK (receptor for activated PKC), allowing eye-PKC to phosphorylate INAD and TRP. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of INAD and TRP is catalyzed by PP1/PP2A-like enzymes preferentially expressed in photoreceptor cells.

This selective distribution of the kinase directs its catalytic activity toward restricted groups of substrates localized proximal to the enzyme. The Drosophila visual cascade is a Gq-coupled phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)-mediated pathway (see Ref. 2.Ranganathan R. Malicki D.M. Zuker C.S. Annu. Rev.

Proteins containing PDZ domains have been implicated in clustering signaling molecules, including enzymes, receptors, and channels (9.Fanning A.S. Andersone J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). PDZ domains mediate at least three types of protein-protein associations. The most common interaction is the binding of a PDZ domain to a tetrapeptide motif, X-S/T-X-φ-COOH (X, any amino acid; φ, hydrophobic residues), at the carboxyl terminus of target proteins (9.Fanning A.S. Andersone J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 10.Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). The second type of interaction is exemplified by the association between α-syntrophin and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). The crystal structure of the α-syntrophin/nNOS complex revealed that the PDZ domain of α-syntrophin interacts with an internal β-hairpin finger that is formed by two β-strands flanking the PDZ domain of nNOS (11.Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Breadt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The third type of interaction by a PDZ domain is the binding to an internal S/T-X-V motif. The association between the third PDZ domain of INAD and transient receptor potential (TRP) (12.Shieh B.-H.

In Drosophila photoreceptors, INAD acts as a scaffold and interacts with eye-PKC (5.Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S.

We previously reported that eye-PKC via its carboxyl terminus interacts with the second PDZ domain of INAD (8.Adamski F.M. Zhu M.-Y. Bahiraei F. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17713-17719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To reveal the in vivofunction of the INAD-PKC interaction, we generated transgenic flies expressing a modified eye-PKC containing a point mutation in the PDZ binding motif. Notably, these transgenic flies exhibit an abnormal deactivation phenotype identical to the eye-PKC null, indicating that a functional interaction between eye-PKC and INAD is essential for normal visual signaling (8.Adamski F.M. Zhu M.-Y. Bahiraei F. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17713-17719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the in vivo role of the INAD scaffold protein is to promote selective targeting of eye-PKC. The close proximity of the proteins in the INAD complex suggested to us that INAD, NORPA, and TRP could be potential substrates of eye-PKC in vivo. Indeed, all three proteins contain multiple consensus phosphorylation sites for PKC (16.Bloomquist B. Shortridge R. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L.

To investigate how eye-PKC regulates visual transduction, we investigated phosphorylation of the proteins in the INAD complex isolated from wild-type flies and several mutants having defects in visual transduction. Results indicate that both INAD and TRP are phosphorylated by eye-PKC in a complex-dependent manner. We also examined phosphatases involved in the dephosphorylation of TRP and INAD. Inhibitor studies indicate that dephosphorylation of INAD and TRP may be regulated by serine/threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A)-like enzymes expressed in wild-type but not inglass heads. Triton X-100, Tween 20, and protein A-Sepharose were obtained from Sigma. Dithiothreitol (DTT) and protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were purchased from United States Biochemicals (Cleveland, OH). Benzamide and benzamidine were from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI). Okadaic acid was from LC laboratories (Woburn, WA). Microcystin LR, protein phosphatase inhibitor-2 (PPI-2), and cypermethrin were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and other secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory (West Grove, PA). Nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate were purchased from Research Organics (Cleveland, OH). [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. Polyclonal antibodies against INAD and TRP were prepared as described previously (12.Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Fly heads were either isolated in mass by the use of screens or dissected manually under CO2 anesthesia. Approximately 100 wild-type heads were homogenized with 0.3 ml of extraction buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and a mixture of protease inhibitors containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/μl leupeptin and pepstatin A, 5 μg/μl aprotinin, 0.01 mm benzamide, and 1 mm benzamidine) with or without detergents (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) as indicated. Head homogenates were incubated at 4 °C with constant agitation for 1 h for extraction of the INAD complex. The mixture was then centrifuged for 10 min (12,000 × g), and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (12.Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were incubated with 50 μl of phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.4 mm EGTA, 0.7 mmCaCl2, and 3 μCi of carrier-free [γ-32P]ATP) at 30 °C for various lengths of time. Phosphorylation reactions were terminated by addition of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) loading buffer. Proteins eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5%), transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, and analyzed by immunoblotting (12.Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography or analysis (PhosphorImager 445SI, Molecular Dynamics). Incorporated 32P was quantitated by ImageQuaNTTM, or counting in a β-scintillation counter (Beckman LS6000IC). Phosphorylated proteins were normalized by protein levels (see below) and expressed as arbitrary units (counts per minute per unit of protein, see Fig. 1 B) or as relative levels in reference to a control (e.g. Fig. 3 B). At least three independent assays were performed, and one was selected for representation in the figures.Figure 3Absence of protein phosphatases in the INAD signaling complex. Top panel autoradiogram depicts levels of phosphorylated INAD and TRP following incubation with a phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.4 mm EGTA, and 0.7 mmCaCl2) for 5–45 min as indicated. A histogram below indicates changes in phosphorylated TRP and INAD (per unit protein).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phosphorylated INAD-associated proteins (bound to protein A-Sepharose beads) were incubated with 100 μL of Triton X-100 extracts (2.5–3.0 μg/μl of protein) at 30 °C for various lengths of time as indicated. In some experiments, Triton X-100 extracts were preincubated with desired inhibitors (okadaic acid, microcystin, or PPI-2) for 10 min at 4 °C prior to the assay of phosphatase activity. Dephosphorylation reactions were centrifuged and washed twice with wash buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm EDTA) followed by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Protein dephosphorylation was monitored by autoradiography or PhosphorImager analysis following SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For each experiment, at least three independent assays were carried out and one representative result was shown in the figures. Western analysis was performed as described previously (12.Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The level of proteins in the blots was quantitated by image analysis software (ImageQuaNT) following scanning. Protein concentrations of extracts were routinely determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Fly stocks were maintained at 25 °C in a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle. In Drosophila photoreceptors, the association between INAD and eye-PKC is essential for the in vivo kinase activity, which regulates deactivation of visual signaling (8.Adamski F.M. Zhu M.-Y. Bahiraei F. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17713-17719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). INAD forms a signaling complex by tethering eye-PKC, TRP, and NORPA. As a result of the close proximity of NORPA, TRP, and INAD to eye-PKC, these proteins could be eye-PKC substrates. Therefore, we investigated protein phosphorylation of the INAD-associated proteins isolated by immunoprecipitation. We found that TRP (12.Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), NORPA (13.Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Lee J.K. Kelly I.M. Bahiraei F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12682-12687Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and eye-PKC (data not shown) were immunopurified from wild-type fly head extracts using anti-INAD antibodies. However, we did not detect rhodopsin, Gq, or TRPL in the complex (data not shown) as observed by others (14.Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Analysis of the kinase activity in the immunocomplexes revealed phosphorylation of both INAD and TRP (Fig.1 A). Phosphorylation of NORPA was not readily detected under the same conditions, perhaps due to the sensitivity of the assay. Maximum phosphorylation of TRP and INAD occurred following 30 min of incubation at 30 °C (Fig.1 B). To investigate how complex-specific phosphorylation may be regulated, immunoprecipitation and kinase assays were carried out on several mutant extracts lacking specific components of the visual cascade. Importantly, the observed phosphorylation of INAD and TRP was dependent on the presence of eye-PKC; INAD complexes isolated frominaC flies missing eye-PKC were incapable of promoting phosphorylation of these two proteins (Fig.2 A, lane 4). In contrast, phosphorylation of INAD and TRP was detected in extracts obtained from ninaE (Fig. 2 A, lane 6) and norpA flies (lane 8). ninaE flies are deficient of the major rhodopsin, Rh1 (22.O'Tousa J.E. Baehr W. Martin R.L. Hirsh J. Pak W.L. Applebury M.L. Cell. 1985; 40: 839-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), whereasnorpA flies are missing PLCβ (NORPA) (16.Bloomquist B.

Shortridge R.D. Burg M.N. Pak W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4937-4945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). BothninaE and norpA mutants lack light-dependent activation of visual transduction. These findings support the apparent constitutive association of eye-PKC with the INAD complex, independent of functional visual transductionin vivo. Phosphorylation of TRP was not observed in complexes isolated from InaDP215 (Fig.2 A, lane 10) and trpP301 head lysates (Fig. 2 A, lane 12).InaDP215 expresses a mutant INAD lacking the TRP interaction (12.Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B, lane 10), andtrpP301 represents a loss of function allele oftrp (18.Montell C. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B, lane 12). The co-localization of eye-PKC with proteins in the INAD complex targets the kinase to its substrates. Because the complementary actions of kinases and phosphatases regulate signaling events in most systems, we investigated whether any protein phosphatase activity toward INAD or TRP was present in the complex. To measure phosphatase activities, we incubated phosphorylated INAD complexes in a phosphatase assay buffer and followed dephosphorylation. As shown in Fig.3, we observed no decline of phosphorylated TRP or INAD for up to 45 min of incubation. Thus, it appears that there are no protein phosphatases tightly associated with the complex capable of dephosphorylating TRP or INAD. To further investigate the protein phosphatases responsible for reversing phosphorylation of INAD or TRP, we performed in vitro dephosphorylation assays. Phosphorylated complexes were incubated with Triton X-100-soluble extracts from wild-type fly heads. The time course of dephosphorylation was determined by monitoring the decline of incorporated radioactivity in INAD and TRP. Dephosphorylation of INAD occurred rapidly with a half-life of about 6.6 min. Dephosphorylation of TRP proceeded at a slower rate (half-life = 44.6 min), and some phosphorylated TRP remained even after 60 min of incubation (Fig.4 A). The four major enzyme classes responsible for phospho-serine and phospho-threonine dephosphorylation are PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C. These enzymes can be distinguished from one another by their divalent cation dependence and their sensitivities to inhibitors (22.O'Tousa J.E. Baehr W. Martin R.L. Hirsh J. Pak W.L. Applebury M.L. Cell. 1985; 40: 839-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). PP2B and PP2C exhibit a strict requirement for Ca2+and Mg2+ respectively, whereas PP1 and PP2A do not require divalent cations for enzymatic activity. To gain insight into which class of protein phosphatases is potentially involved in the dephosphorylation event, we first determined the requirement of divalent cations for dephosphorylation of INAD and TRP. As shown in Fig. 4 B, we did not observe any enhancement of dephosphorylation upon addition of Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+ (20 mm) to the detergent-soluble extracts of wild-type fly heads. These results suggest that members of the PP1 and PP2A families are involved in dephosphorylation of TRP and INAD, because the enzymatic activities of these protein serine/threonine phosphatases are independent of divalent cations (23.Cohen P.

We further investigated which class of phosphatases is involved in dephosphorylation of INAD and TRP by the use of four phosphatase inhibitors, including okadaic acid, microcystin, inhibitor-2 (PPI-2), and cypermethrin. Cypermethrin (40 pm), a potent inhibitor of PP2B (24.Enan E. Matsumura F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1777-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), failed to prevent dephosphorylation of INAD and TRP (data not shown). Both okadaic acid and microcystin, on the other hand, inhibit PP2A at low concentrations (IC50 = 0.1 nm for okadaic acid, IC50 = 0.04 nmfor microcystin), and PP1 at higher concentrations (IC50 = 10 nm for okadaic acid, IC50 = 1.7 nm for microcystin) (25.Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 26.Craig M. Luu H.A. McCready T.L. Williams D. Andersen R.J. Holmes C.F.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, 0.1 nm okadaic acid partially suppressed the dephosphorylation of TRP and INAD in Triton X-100 extracts, indicating that these proteins are potential targets for PP2A-like enzymes. At 10 nm, okadaic acid displayed a slightly greater inhibitory effect, suggesting the phosphatases have some properties of PP1 as well. This interpretation is supported by the observation that PPI-2, a selective PP1 inhibitor, suppressed dephosphorylation of INAD and TRP (see below, Fig.4 C). Moreover, results obtained from studies using microcystin (Fig. 5 B) also suggested a role for PP2A/PP1-like enzymes in the dephosphorylation. The combination of okadaic acid (10 nm) and PPI-2 (2 nm) that inhibits both PP1 and PP2A exerted an additive effect (Fig.5 C). Taken together, our results strongly support the notion that PP1/PP2A-like enzymes regulate the dephosphorylation of TRP and INAD. To investigate the subcellular distribution of the INAD/TRP phosphatases, we analyzed both cytosolic and membrane extracts of wild-type fly heads for phosphatase activity. These two extracts were prepared by sequential solubilization of fly head proteins first with a buffer containing no detergents (“cytosolic extracts”), followed by a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (“membrane extracts”) (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig.6, cytosolic extracts from wild-type fly heads possessed most of the phosphatase activity, whereas membrane extracts exhibited little activity. Dephosphorylation of TRP and INAD could be mediated by photoreceptor-specific phosphatases or by ubiquitously expressed enzymes present in many cell types. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we examined phosphatase activities from glassflies that lack photoreceptors (27.Moses K. Ellis M.C. Rubin G.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, both cytosolic and membrane extracts from glass mutant fly heads showed little phosphatase activity as compared with cytosolic extracts from wild-type heads. These findings indicate that dephosphorylation of INAD and TRP are regulated by photoreceptor-specific phosphatases. The reversible phosphorylation of proteins regulates a vast array of biological processes. Protein phosphorylation mediated by members of the protein kinase C family is involved in both cell growth and receptor-mediated signal transduction (28.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In Drosophilaphotoreceptor cells, eye-PKC serves to modulate visual transduction;inaC mutants that lack the kinase display abnormal deactivation and light adaptation (3.Hardie R.C. Peretz A. Suss-Toby E. Rom-Glas A. Bishop S.A. Selinger Z. Minke B. Nature. 1993; 363: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, photoreceptors ininaC mutants undergo light-dependent degeneration (4.Smith D.P. Ranganathan R. Hardy R.W. Marx J. Tsuchida T. Zuker C.S. Science. 1991; 254: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Insights into the identity of eye-PKC substrates, as well as the protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate these substrates, should lead to a better understanding of regulation of the visual cascade. Recent evidence indicates that eye-PKC, via its association with INAD, is tethered to a signaling complex consisting of INAD, NORPA, and TRP (5.Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7036-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We previously showed that a lack of interaction between eye-PKC and INAD leads to a complete loss of the in vivo activity of eye-PKC (8.Adamski F.M. Zhu M.-Y. Bahiraei F. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17713-17719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that proper subcellular localization of eye-PKC, via its interaction with INAD, targets the kinase to its substrates. Although INAD and TRP have been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo and in vitroin the blowfly Calliphora (29.Huber A. Sander P. Paulsen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31.Huber A. Sander P. Bahner M. Paulsen R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the identity of the kinase was not known. In this report, we combined an in vitro kinase assay with immunoprecipitation to identify substrates of eye-PKC. We show that both INAD and TRP become phosphorylated and that phosphorylation of these two proteins is dependent on the presence of eye-PKC in the complex. These results demonstrate that both INAD and TRP are substrates of eye-PKC in vitro and probably in vivo. NORPA (PLCβ), another member of the signaling complex, is responsible for catalyzing the hydrolysis of phospholipids to generate diacylglycerol, which leads to activation of eye-PKC. Although NORPA is an ideal candidate for eye-PKC-mediated feedback regulation, it was not phosphorylated under the experimental conditions described in this report. It remains a possibility that a limited number of phosphorylation sites on NORPA eluded detection by our assays or that there is a different kinase, not associated with INAD, responsible for phosphorylation of NORPA. Phosphorylation of the scaffold protein INAD may have functional implications in modulating protein-protein interactions. For example, the interaction between PSD95 and the inward rectifying K+channel Kir2.3 appears to be regulated by phosphorylation (32.Cohen N.A. Brenman J.E. Snyders S.H. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 759-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of INAD in the PDZ domain anchoring eye-PKC may promote dissociation of the kinase from the complex. There are seven putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites in INAD, including two in the second PDZ domain (21.Shieh B.-H. Niemeyer B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) which tethers eye-PKC. On the other hand, phosphorylation of TRP, the major ion carrier underlying light-induced depolarization (20.Hardie R.C. Minke B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 643-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), may affect the kinetics of the calcium channel. For example, a lack of eye-PKC-mediated phosphorylation of TRP may result in abnormal deactivation similar to that observed in InaDP215 . At present, the mechanism by which TRP operates remains under intense investigation. Knowledge of the eye-PKC phosphorylation sites should help elucidate the gating mechanisms of TRP. Efficient and timely phosphorylation of TRP and INAD is dependent upon the close proximity of eye-PKC to these substrates. It is equally important that dephosphorylation is carried out in a timely manner to speed up recovery from a light response. The co-localization of protein phosphatases and protein kinases by scaffold proteins (33.Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 34.Westphal R.S. Travalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), or the tight association of kinases and phosphatases (35.Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), may facilitate fast dephosphorylation, thus reversing the action of protein kinases. However, we find that protein phosphatases do not appear to be tightly associated with the INAD signaling complexes in Drosophilaphotoreceptors. Indeed, phosphatases that are involved in dephosphorylation of INAD and TRP are present in the cytosol. Moreover, only cytosolic extracts prepared from wild-type but not fromglass heads contain the desired phosphatase activities. It is noteworthy that in vitro phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions proceed at a much slower rate than those likely to occur in vivo for regulating visual signaling. The reduced rate of these in vitro assays may result from partial inactivation of eye-PKC and protein phosphatases in the extract following homogenization and dilution. Moreover, differences in the kinetics of phosphorylation may be due to the fact that eye-PKC in isolated complexes are not subject to negative regulation by phosphatases in our in vitro phosphorylation assays, because of the absence of phosphatases in the complex. Based on their requirement for divalent cations and sensitivity to inhibitors (23.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar), protein serine/threonine phosphatases are subdivided into four major classes: PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C. PP1 and PP2A are sensitive to okadaic acid and microcystin and do not require divalent cations for enzymatic activity (23.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). These protein phosphatases consist of multiple subunits; both PP1 and PP2A catalytic subunits form complexes with tissue-specific targeting subunits that are important for substrate recognition (36.Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). To date, the catalytic subunits of PP1 and PP2A identified in Drosophila appear to be expressed ubiquitously (37.Orgad S. Dudai Y. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, dephosphorylation of INAD and TRP was involved with photoreceptor-specific PP1/PP2A-like phosphatases absent in glass extracts. The glass gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that switches on gene expression of rhodopsin and proteins involved in the visual cascade. Knowledge of photoreceptor-specific protein phosphatases may lead to a better understanding of the regulation of visual signal transduction by protein phosphatases. In summary, we show that both INAD and TRP are phosphorylated in a complex-specific manner. Furthermore, this phosphorylation is dependent on the presence of eye-PKC in the complex, supporting the notion that INAD acts as RACK. Dephosphorylation of INAD and TRP is regulated by PP1/PP2A-like enzymes, which are enriched in the cytosol of photoreceptor cells. Future studies on the molecular characterization of these phosphatases, and the identification of phosphorylation sites in INAD and TRP, will lead to a better understanding of the visual transduction process.

The family 10 enzyme, Cex, fromCellulomonas fimi, hydrolyzes aryl-β-cellobiosides more efficiently than does Xyl10A, and the movements of two residues in the –1 and –2 subsites are implicated in this relaxed substrate specificity (Notenboom, V., Birsan, C., Warren, R. A. J., Withers, S. G., and Rose, D. R. (1998)Biochemistry 37, 4751–4758). The three-dimensional structure of Xyl10A suggests that Tyr-87 reduces the affinity of the enzyme for glucose-derived substrates by steric hindrance with the C6-OH in the –2 subsite of the enzyme. Furthermore, Leu-314 impedes the movement of Trp-313 that is necessary to accommodate glucose-derived substrates in the –1 subsite. We have evaluated the catalytic activities of the mutants Y87A, Y87F, L314A, L314A/Y87F, and W313A of Xyl10A. Mutations to Tyr-87 increased and decreased the catalytic efficiency against 4-nitrophenyl-β-cellobioside and 4-nitrophenyl-β-xylobioside, respectively. The L314A mutation caused a 200-fold decrease in 4-nitrophenyl-β-xylobioside activity but did not significantly reduce 4-nitrophenyl-β-cellobioside hydrolysis. The mutation L314A/Y87A gave a 6500-fold improvement in the hydrolysis of glucose-derived substrates compared with xylose-derived equivalents. These data show that substantial improvements in the ability of Xyl10A to accommodate the C6-OH of glucose-derived substrates are achieved when steric hindrance is removed.

Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Using a combination of primary structure homology and hydrophobic cluster analysis, these enzymes have been grouped into more than 80 families (2Coutinho P. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1999: 3-12Google Scholar, 3Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). A feature of this sequence-based classification is that enzymes in a given family catalyze glycosidic bond cleavage with the same mechanism, display a common protein fold, and are therefore believed to have evolved from a common ancestor (4Davies G.J. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). As more three-dimensional structures become available and sequence-similarity programs become more sensitive, a number of “clans” of distantly related glycoside hydrolases have also been discovered, which, in the case of retaining enzyme families, have their catalytic nucleophile and acid-base residues in the same relative positions (4Davies G.J. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 5Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.P. Davies G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Within any given glycoside hydrolase family, the substrate specificity of individual members may be quite different. Family 5, for example, contains endo-β1,4-glucanases, exo-β1,3-glucanases, and endo-β1,4-mannanases (6Hall J. Black G.W. Ferreira L.M.A. Millward-Sadler S.J. Ali B.R. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J.

Biochem. 1987; 166: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Family 10 contains endo-β1,4-xylanases (xylanases), which catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in β-1,4 linked xylans (11Withers S.G. Dombroski D. Berven L.A. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although family 10 enzymes are also capable of hydrolyzing aryl-β-cellobiosides, the catalytic efficiency against these substrates varies greatly between the different members of this family. For example, the catalytic efficiency (as measured by k cat/Km) of two family 10 xylanases, Cex from Cellulomonas fimi and Xyl10A fromPseudomonas cellulosa, against 4-nitrophenyl-β-cellobioside (PNPG2)1 differ by 400-fold, the ratio of activities toward PNPX2 and PNPG2 is 3000 for Xyl10A and 225 for Cex (12Charnock S.J.

Despite the recent resolution of the three-dimensional structures of glycoside hydrolases complexed with either substrate or mechanism-based inhibitors (13Harris E. Jenkins J.A. Connerton I.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4751-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the structural basis for the different substrate specificities of these enzymes remains poorly understood. The three-dimensional structures of Cex and Xyl10A are (α/β)8 barrel proteins in which the two catalytic residues involved in the retaining mechanism are situated at the end of β-strands 4 and 7 (13Harris E.

Inspection of the –2 and –1 subsites of Xyl10A and Cex reveals differences that could explain the higher efficiency of the Cellulomonas enzyme against PNPG2 compared with the Pseudomonas xylanase. In Cex Gln-87, located in the –2 subsite, becomes disordered when glucose enters this site in the enzyme, suggesting that the amino acid impedes access of the C-5 hydroxymethyl group of the hexose sugar (14White A. Tull D. Johns K. Withers S.G. Rose D.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The corresponding residue in Xyl10A, Tyr-87, is both more bulky and potentially less flexible than Gln-87 and is likely to hinder access of the C-5 hydroxymethyl group of glucose to the active site of Xyl10A (Figs. 1 and2). In the –1 subsite of Cex, Trp-281 is repositioned when the enzyme binds a glucose moiety at the –1 subsite, indicating that this residue is making unfavorable contacts with the C-5 hydroxymethyl group of the sugar (14White A. Tull D. Johns K. Withers S.G. Rose D.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Xyl10A has a direct equivalent, Trp-313, but this is involved in a close hydrophobic interaction with a leucine residue, Leu-314 (Figs. 1 and 2). It is likely that this residue reduces the flexibility of Trp-313 such that the binding of glucose-derived substrates is incurred at greater energetic penalty, as is also seen for the Streptomyces lividans Xyl10A (SlXyl10A), in the accompanying paper by Ducros et al. (16Ducros V. Charnock S.J. Derewenda U. Derewenda Z.S. Dauter Z. Dupont C. Shareck F. Morosoli R. Kluepfel D. Davies G.J. J. Biol.

The data obtained showed that removal of Tyr-87 from Xyl10A increased the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme against PNPG2 and decreased the efficiency of hydrolysis of the corresponding xylobioside (PNPX2), whereas the L314A mutation reduced the catalytic efficiency of the xylanase against PNPX2 but not against PNPG2. We also propose that the unusually high catalytic efficiency of Cex toward aryl-β-glycosides may merely reflect the favored binding of aromatic aglycones in the +1 subsite. In light of the activities of these enzymes toward a range of substrates, the description of some family 10 enzymes as “multifunctional” should perhaps be reevaluated. The Escherichia coli strains used to express Xyl10A and its derivatives, and Cex were JM83 (17Norrander J. Kempe T. Messing J.

Recombinant E. coli strains were grown in Luria broth supplemented with either 50 μg/ml ampicillin or 50 μg/ml kanamycin, at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm), unless otherwise stated. The plasmids used in this study were pRS16 (ampicillin-resistant) and pETcex (kanamycin-resistant), which contain the regions of the Xyl10A (xyl10A) and Cex (cex) genes, respectively, encoding the catalytic domains of the two enzymes, cloned intoSmaI/EcoRI-restricted pUC19 (19Hall J. Hazlewood G.P. Huskisson N.S. Durrant A.J. Gilbert H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and NcoI/XhoI-restricted pET28a (20Kaneko S. Kuno A. Jujimoto Z.

Derivatives of Xyl10A were generated by mutation of the xylanase gene (xyl10A) using the Transformer mutagenesis kit supplied byCLONTECH. The mutagenic primers (antisense strand of xyl10A) employed were as follows: Y87A, 5′-CCAGTTAGGTAATTGAGCGCTGGGGTGCCAG-3′; Y87F, 5′-CCAGTTAGGTAATTGAAAGCTGGGGTGCCAG-3′; L314A, 5′-GTTTTGATGGGTATAGGCCCAGCTATCCGGGTC-3′; and W313A, 5′-GTTTTGATGGGTATAGAGCGCGCTATCCGGGTC-3′. The nucleotides in boldface are the mutations incorporated intoxyl10A. The Xyl10A derivative that encoded the double mutant L314A/Y87F was generated by digesting pCM1 (encodes L314A) with ClaI and HindII, removing the 300-base pair sequence that makes up the 5′ region of Xyl10A and inserting the correspondingClaI/HindIII restriction fragment from pCM2 (encoding Y87F) into pCM1. The complete sequences of the Xyl10A mutants were determined using an ABI 373 DNA sequenator using the M13 forward and reverse primers, to ensure that only the desired mutations had been introduced into the xylanase gene. Xyl10A and its derivatives were purified essentially as described previously (19Hall J. Hazlewood G.P. Huskisson N.S. Durrant A.J. Gilbert H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Appropriate recombinant strains of E. coli JM83 were grown to stationary phase, and the periplasm was prepared by the osmotic shock method (19Hall J. Hazlewood G.P. Huskisson N.S. Durrant A.J. Gilbert H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Xyl10A was prepared from the periplasm by ion exchange chromatography using a DEAE-TrisAcryl Plus M column, and a linear 400 ml of 0–200 mm NaCl gradient in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, was used to elute the enzyme. The purity of Xyl10A in fractions containing xylanase activity was evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). To purify Cex, cultures of BL21 (DE3):pLysS containing pETcex were grown to mid-exponential phase (A 550 0.5) at 25 °C, after which, isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the bacterial cells were incubated, without shaking, at 25 °C for a further 6 h. Cex contained an N-terminal His10 tag, and was therefore purified, from cell-free extracts, by nickel ion affinity chromatography, using a TalonTM metal affinity column as described previously (22Bolam D.N.

Xylopentaose and cellohexaose were obtained from Megazyme and AMS Biotechnology, respectively. PNPX2 was synthesized by the method of Kitaoka et al. (23Kitaoka M. Haga K. Kashiwagi Y. Sasaki T.

The enzymic release of 4-nitrophenol from 4-nitrophenyl-β-glycosides was monitored at 400 nm, whereas the enzyme cleavage of 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-glycosides to generate 4-methylumbelliferone was monitored at 340 nm. The molar extinction coefficients of 4-nitrophenol and 4-methylumbelliferone at pH 7.2 were 10,300 and 3400m−1 cm−1, respectively. The enzymic hydrolysis of xylan and cellulose were determined by measuring the release of reducing sugars (25Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22579) Google Scholar).

Modeling indicated that two residues in particular, Tyr-87 and Trp-313 in the –2 and –1 subsites of the enzyme, respectively, would hinder binding ofd-glucose-derived substrates though steric clashes with the C6-OH of d-glucose (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the equivalent of Trp-313 in the C. fimi enzyme Cex (Trp-281) undergoes a conformational change in order to accommodate the C6-OH ofd-glucose (14White A. Tull D. Johns K. Withers S.G. Rose D.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), but in Xyl10A, this movement seemed likely to be restricted due to a tight hydrophobic interaction with Leu-314. A similar restriction is imposed by an arginine in SlXyl10A described in the accompanying paper by Ducros et al. (16Ducros V. Charnock S.J. Derewenda U. Derewenda Z.S. Dauter Z. Dupont C. Shareck F.

Mutant enzymes were purified to homogeneity (Fig.3), and their global structural integrity was evaluated by CD spectroscopy (Fig.4). The spectra of all mutants analyzed in this study were indistinguishable from that of wild type Xyl10A, indicating that the mutations had not caused a significant perturbation to the secondary structure of these proteins.Figure 4CD spectroscopy of native and mutant forms of Xyl10A.

On Xyl10A, the side chain of Tyr-87 is structurally equivalent to that of Gln-87 in Cex. The greater bulk and reduced conformational freedom of a tyrosine in this position could decrease the catalytic efficiency of the P. cellulosa enzyme on thesed-glucose-derived substrates. In order to test this hypothesis, we created a Y87A mutant of Xyl10A and evaluated the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme against aryl-β-glycosides. The Y87A mutation indeed caused an approximately 3-fold increasein the catalytic efficiency (k cat/Km) of PNPG2 hydrolysis and a 6-fold reduction in PNPX2 cleavage (Table I). Interestingly, the decrease in catalytic efficiency against PNPX2 was primarily due to a reduction in k cat, whereas the increase in efficiency against PNPG2 was mainly the result of a smallerKm value. The decrease in k cat for PNPX2 hydrolysis suggests that modification of Tyr-87 did not influence the capacity of the substrate to bind the enzyme but had a direct affect on the actual rate of catalysis. A possible explanation for these data is that the interaction of the substrate with the –2 subsite of the xylanase is different in the mutant and wild type xylanase. Although the mutation to Tyr-87 does not influence the affinity of the aryl-glycoside for the enzyme, it does have a negative affect on the capacity of the substrate to form a productive complex with the enzyme. This could be due to the substrate adopting a slightly different position in the active site of the mutant enzyme (compared with wild type Xyn10A), such that the xylose moiety at the –1 subsite is farther away from the critical catalytic nucleophile and acid base residues. Alternatively, the position of the xylose at the –1 subsite diminishes the interactions with the enzyme that are critical for the sugar to adopt its semi-chair/skew boat transition state conformation. In addition to influencing the –2 subsite, the mutations to Tyr-87 could affect the catalytic efficiency of PNPX2 hydrolysis by causing a subtle distortion in the crucial –1 subsite. To evaluate this latter possibility, the activities of wild type and mutant forms of the enzyme against MUX, a substrate that does not occupy the –2 subsite, were evaluated. The data showed that Y87A was 2-fold less active than the wild type enzyme against MUX. These results indicate that the decrease in activity against PNPX2, on removal of Tyr-87, could partly be explained by a subtle distortion at the active site, resulting in a general reduction in catalytic efficiency.Table IActivity of native and mutants of Xyl10A against aryl-β-glycosidesXyl10ASubstratekcatKmk cat/Kmmin−1mmmin−1mm−1NativePNPX24725 ± 4650.53 ± 0.0458915NativePNPG2125 ± 1541 ± 5.23.0NativeMUG2146 ± 1345 ± 3.83.2NativeMUX24236 ± 4760.401 ± 0.06210332NativeMUXG2561 ± 2731.1 ± 0.132328NativeMUX337 ± 57262 ± 381.3Y87FPNPX21188 ± 750.46 ± 0.0652583Y87FPNPG2154 ± 1317 ± 2.19.1Y87FMUX21095 ± 1240.43 ± 0.0482547Y87FMUG2173 ± 1721 ± 2.98.3Y87FMUX309 ± 57254 ± 421.2Y87APNPX2441 ± 1.70.31 ± 0.0021423Y87APNPG2217 ± 1925 ± 2.78.4Y87AMUX21245 ± 1340.52 ± 0.0612394Y87AMUG2198 ± 2121 ± 2.39.4Y87AMUX194 ± 36271 ± 560.7L314APNPX248 ± 4.91.1 ± 0.1444L314APNPG291 ± 1333 ± 4.22.8L314AMUX241 ± 5.71.2 ± 0.234L314AMUG2101 ± 1228 ± 2.93.6L314AMUXND1-aND, no activity detected.W313APNPX240 ± 4.35.0 ± 0.618.1W313APNPG22.8 ± 0.43139±0.02W313AMUXNDL314A/Y87FPNPX210 ± 0.651.5 ± 0.216.7L314A/Y87FPNPG2205 ± 1313 ± 1.215.7L314A/Y87FMUX29 ± 0.541.6 ± 0.145.6L314A/Y87FMUG2185 ± 1615 ± 1.812.3L314A/Y87FMUXNDThe values of the kinetic parameters are given ± S.D.1-a ND, no activity detected. Open table in a new tab The values of the kinetic parameters are given ± S.D. The increase in PNPG2 hydrolysis in the two Tyr-87 mutants was primarily a result of a decrease in Km, rather than an increase in k cat. These data indicate that removal of the aromatic amino acid increased the capacity of glucose to bind at the –2 subsite, hence the reduction in Km.The increased affinity of the hexose moiety for Xyl10A is likely to be the result of a decrease in steric hindrance between the C5 hydroxymethyl group of the sugar and the phenolic side chain of Tyr-87. To investigate whether removal of the OH group of Tyr-87 improved the accessibility of glucopyranoside units to the –2 subsite of Xyl10A, the catalytic efficiency of Y87F was compared with native Xyl10A. The mutant enzyme displayed similar catalytic activities as Y87A against PNPX2 and PNPG2, with a 3-fold decrease and 4-fold increase in catalytic efficiency, respectively, against the two substrates. The observation that the Y87F mutation did not diminish the activity of the enzyme against MUX indicated that substitution of Tyr for Phe did not significantly perturb the –1 subsite. Collectively, these results suggest that Tyr-87, and in particular its OH group impedes the access of glucopyranoside units to the –2 subsite of Xyl10A, and hence removal of this group increases the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme against aryl-β-cellobiosides. The loss of activity of Y87F against PNPX2 presumably reflects a change in the position of xylose at the –2 subsite, such that the location of the substrate in the critical –1 subsite is not optimal for efficient catalysis.

An overlay of the Xyl10A structure with that of Cex suggests that Tyr-87 in the P. cellulosaxylanase is in an appropriate position to form a similar bond between the tyrosine hydroxyl group and the ring oxygen of the sugar in the –2 subsite (Fig. 2). In the C. fimi and S. lividans family 10 enzyme complexes containing covalent cellobiosyl enzyme intermediates, it is clear that a tryptophan that forms a lid over the –1 subsite must have undergone conformational change in order to accommodate the extra bulk of a glucose residue in this position (14White A.

Here we show that a cis-linked RBD can strongly and specifically repress trans-activation by the EAD. Fusion proteins containing the RBD are expressed at normal levels, are nuclear-localized, and can bind to DNA both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that the RBD represses trans-activation directly at the promoter. The RNA recognition motif within the RBD is not required for repression, whereas regions of the RBD containing multiple RGG motifs play a critical role. The finding that the RBD can antagonize transcriptional activation by EWS provides the first direct evidence of a role for the RBD in transcription.

In contrast to understanding of EFPs, the normal function of EWS remains poorly characterized. EWS together with the related genes TLS/FUS and hTAFII68 encode a sub-group (the TET family (15Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar)) within the RNP family of RNA-binding proteins that are probably involved in several aspects of RNA biogenesis and function (16Haynes S.R. New Biol. 1992; 4: 421-429PubMed Google Scholar). TET proteins (TETs) bind to RNA (17Ohno T. Ouchida M. Lee L. Gatalica Z. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3087-3097PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zinszner H. Sok J. Immanuel D. Yin Y. Ron D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1741-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but sequence-specific RNA binding by TETs has yet to be demonstrated, and the relatively high abundance of EWS and TLS suggests that TETs might interact with many RNA targets (3Ron D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 220: 131-142PubMed Google Scholar). TLS rapidly shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus suggesting a role in RNA transport (18Zinszner H. Sok J. Immanuel D. Yin Y. Ron D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1741-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zinszner H. Immanuel D. Yin Y. Liang F.-X. Ron D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Other evidence for a cytoplasmic role for TETs is that EWS interacts with a protein tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) and relocates from the cytosol to ribosomes upon Pyk2 activation (20Felsch J.S. Lane W.S. Peralta E.G. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 485-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The evidence that TETs are involved in transcription is, for the most part, indirect or circumstantial. First, as mentioned above, the EAD functions as a potent activation domain in EFPs (4Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C.T. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar, 5Fujimura Y. Ohno T. Siddique H. Lee L. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P.

Second, a TBP-associated factor (hTAFII68) (15Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) is a member of the TET family. Third, TETs directly interact with several transcription factors including components of the general transcriptional machinery (14Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and activator proteins (22Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4838-4842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Powers C.A. Mathur M. Raaka B.M. Ron D. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 4-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). TETs are present in sub-stoichiometric amounts in TFIID complexes (15Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and different TETs are present in distinct TFIID subpopulations (15Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) indicating that TETs are not general transcription factors. A major question concerns the potential role of the RBD in transcription. EWS binds to the polymerase II subunit hsRPB3 but not to hsRPB5 or hsRPB7, whereas the isolated EAD binds hsRPB5 and hsRPB7 but not hsRPB3 (21Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus the RBD might play a pivotal role in differentiating the transcriptional properties of EFPs and EWS. It is also significant that EFPs, without exception, lack the RBD, strongly suggesting that loss of the RBD is necessary for EFP-induced oncogenesis and that, in turn, the RBD may block trans-activation by the EAD. Here we describe a functional approach for elucidating the role of the RBD in transcription. We show that a cis-linked RBD can strongly and specifically repress trans-activation by the EAD. Further studies of the repression phenomenon should help to illuminate the key molecular interactions that distinguish EFPs and EWS/TETs and provide insights into the normal cellular function of EWS/TETs. pΔ(−71)SomCAT contains the somatostatin promoter to position −71, fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)-coding sequences (24Montminy M.R.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5005-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) are as described previously. pRTU15 contains the c-jun TRE cloned into the BglI1 site of pMCAT2. pΔ78 (4Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C.T. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar), pΔ87C, pΔ167C, pΔ287, pΔ87CD (12Pan S. Koh Y.M. Dunn T.A. Li K.K.C. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1625-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and pSVZATF1 (27Ribeiro A. Brown A.D. Lee K.A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31124-31128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are as described previously. pNC contains the entire EWS sequence (residues 1–656) fused to ATF1 (residues 66–271) and was obtained by ligation of a KpnI/BglII fragment from pΔ287, a KpnI/ApaI fragment from EWS (residues 173–623), and an oligonucleotide encoding EWS residues 623–656. p167R was derived from pNC by inserting an oligonucleotide between the KpnI (residue 173) and BglII (residue 345) sites of EWS. p167R is therefore missing the C-terminal region of the EAD and RGG1 from the RBD. p87R and p87DR were obtained from pΔ87CD by insertion of a BamHI/XhoI fragment from p167R (containing the RBD) into pΔ87CD digested with XhoI and partially digested with BglII. p78R was obtained by digestion of pΔ78 with KpnI and XhoI and insertion of a KpnI/XhoI fragment from pNC (containing the RBD). pRM0 was obtained by digestion of pNC with BglII to remove the RBD (EWS residues 346–656) and insertion of an oligonucleotide containing sites for construction of additional mutants. pRMO contains RGG1 and is equivalent to the normal EWS/ATF1 protein except for the addition of EWS residues 326–345. pRM1 and pRM2 were obtained by digestion of pRM0 with BglII/EcoRI and insertion of BglII/EcoRI-ended polymerase chain reaction fragments containing the RRM region (residues 348–469, pRM1) and RGG3 (residues 545–656, pRM2). pRM3 lacks RGG1 and was obtained by insertion of a BamHI/XhoI fragment from p167R (containing the remainder of the RBD) into pΔ287 digested with XhoI and BglII. pRM4 lacks the RRM and was obtained by digestion of pNC with NcoI and in-frame religation to remove residues 340–484 of EWS. pRM5 lacks RGG3 and was obtained by digestion of pNC with ApaI, partial digestion with XbaI, and insertion of an oligonucleotide to recreate the reading frame and delete EWS residues 558–623. pRM6 lacks EWS residues 502–558 between RGG2 and RGG3 and was obtained by digestion of pNC with XmaI and insertion of an oligonucleotide to recreate the reading frame. pSVERZA was obtained by insertion of anHindII sticky/BglII-blunted fragment from pNC (EWS residues 1–656) into pSVZATF1 (27Ribeiro A. Brown A.D. Lee K.A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31124-31128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) digested with HindIII (sticky) and SacI blunt. pSVERZA expresses a protein containing intact EWS sequence, all of ATF (except residues 1–21 and the bZIP domain), and the bZIP domain (ZbZIP) from the Zta protein. pSVEZA was obtained from pSVERZA by ApaI digestion, BamHI partial digestion, blunting, and religation. pSVEZA expresses a protein corresponding to SVERZA but lacking the RBD (EWS residues 246–623). pSVEZΔA was obtained by inserting an Xcm1/XbaI fragment from pERZA intoXcm1/XbaI-digested pΔ287. pSVEZΔA expresses a protein similar to pΔ287 with the ATF1 bZIP domain replaced by the Zta bZIP domain. pMtc is as described previously (28Mellon P. Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4887-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). pSVG4/245 expresses a protein containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (residues 1–147) fused to the EAD (residues 1–245). pSVG4vec was obtained by inserting a SalI/BamHI-ended oligonucleotide containing a multiple cloning site into pSVG4/245 digested with SalI/BamHI. pG4NC was obtained by cloning aSalI/BglII fragment from pNC into pSVG4vec digested with SalI and BglII. pG4NC expresses a protein containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain at the N terminus and the entire EWS sequence at the C terminus. JEG-3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections (12Pan S. Koh Y.M. Dunn T.A. Li K.K.C. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1625-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), CAT assays (29Li K.K.C. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and Western blotting (4Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C.T. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar) were carried out as described previously. For quantitation, percent conversion of unacetylated to acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol under linear assay conditions was determined by excision of spots from the TLC plate and quantitation of radioactivity using a liquid scintillation counter. Preparation of nuclear extracts and sequence-specific DNA-affinity purification were carried out as described previously (30Hurst H.C. Masson N. Jones N.C. Lee K.A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6192-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To test the effect of a cis-linked RBD on trans-activation (Fig.2) by EWS/ATF1, we used a previously described transient assay (4Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C.T. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pan S. Koh Y.M. Dunn T.A. Li K.K.C. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1625-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An expression vector for the test protein and an ATF-dependent reporter (pΔ(−71)SomCAT) were introduced into JEG3 cells, and trans-activation was monitored by CAT assay (Fig. 2 B). A protein called Δ287C (Fig.2 A), which closely resembles EWS/ATF1, strongly activates transcription as previously shown (4Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C.T. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pan S. Koh Y.M. Dunn T.A. Li K.K.C. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1625-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and a protein called NC containing the RBD (Fig. 2 A) has much reduced activity (1.4% of Δ287C or 70-fold repression). Δ287C and NC are expressed at similar levels as shown by Western blot analysis of epitope-tagged proteins (Fig. 2 B). To verify that repression is due to a cis-effect of the RBD, we co-expressed Δ287C and a protein (G4NC, Fig. 2 A) in which the ATF1 portion of NC is replaced by the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Fig. 2 B). G4NC is unable to bind to the ATF reporter and has no effect on trans-activation by Δ287C. We conclude that the RBD can strongly repress the EAD but only when linked in cis. We tested several ATF-dependent promoters and all were sensitive to repression (Fig. 2 C), although repression varied from 7-fold for E3CAT to 70-fold for Δ(−71)SomCAT. To ask whether the ATF1 portion of EWS/ATF1 plays a direct role in repression, we replaced ATF1 with the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (Fig.2 A) and tested for repression using a Gal4 reporter (Fig.2 D). As previously shown (10Kim J. Lee K.A.W. Pelletier J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Denny C.T. May W.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar) G4/245 gives high levels of trans-activation, and inclusion of the RBD (G4NC) effectively represses trans-activation (41-fold repression). We conclude that the ATF1 portion of NC has no direct role in repression and that a specific DNA-binding domain is not required. To determine the requirements for repression, we performed deletion analysis of the RBD (Fig. 3 A). The RBD contains a number of structural features (notably the RRM and RGG boxes) that are characteristic of other RNA-binding proteins (Ref. 31Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, see Fig. 1). The RRM together with the RGG boxes cover the entire RBD except for a single C2/C2 zinc finger (Fig. 1). Deletion of the zinc finger (RM6) has no effect on repression indicating that the known RBD elements are sufficient for repression. In addition, deletion of the RRM (RM4) also has no effect, and addition of the RRM in the presence of RGG1 (compare RM1 with RM0) has only a minimal repressive effect (∼2-fold repression). The above results demonstrate that the zinc finger and the RRM play no obvious role in repression. In contrast, deletion of RGG1 alone (RM3) reduces repression slightly (∼5-fold more active than NC) and deletion of RGG3 alone (RM5) results in substantial loss of repression (17-fold more active than NC). Deletion of residues 345–545 (RM2) also results in significant loss of repression (∼20-fold more active than NC). Since this latter region contains RGG2 and only two other elements (RRM and the zinc finger) that are not required for repression, the RGG2 region may also contribute to repression. However, RM2 suffers a large deletion (∼200 amino acids), and loss of repression might be explained by dislocation of RGG3 relative to the EAD. In summary the above results indicate that regions RGG1–3 are necessary and sufficient for repression. Three elements within the EAD (binding sites for hsRPB7 (14Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), ZFM1/SF1 (32Zhang D. Paley A.J. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18086-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the IQ domain (33Deloulme J.C. Prichard L. Delattre O. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27369-27377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), see Fig. 1) might be required for repression, and we tested previously characterized mutants lacking these elements (4Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C.T. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pan S. Koh Y.M. Dunn T.A. Li K.K.C. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1625-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) for sensitivity to repression (Fig.3 B). Results are presented as fold repression (−RBD/+ RBD). For the CAT assay shown, different amounts of extract were used for each pair of proteins, and levels of trans-activation in the absence of the RBD are not the same (4Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C.T. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pan S. Koh Y.M. Dunn T.A. Li K.K.C. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1625-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). C-terminal deletion of the EAD leaving residues 1–167 (compare Δ167C with 167R) or residues 1–87 (compare Δ87C with 87R) has a small effect (5-fold less repression) or no obvious effect on repression, respectively. The reason that 167R is somewhat less susceptible to repression than 87R is not clear. However, the strong repression observed for 87R indicates that both the IQ domain and the ZFM1-binding site are not critical for repression but that the hsRPB7 binding region alone is sensitive to repression. In contrast, removal of the hsRPB7 binding region almost completely abolishes repression (compare Δ78 with 78R). Although the activity of both Δ78 and Δ87C is ∼20-fold lower than that of EWS/ATF1 (4Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C.T. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pan S. Koh Y.M. Dunn T.A. Li K.K.C. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1625-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), this residual activity is, nonetheless, highly significant (∼100-fold activation). A protein containing a duplicated hsRPB7-binding site (Δ87CD) is a very potent activator (the activity of Δ87CD is only ∼3-fold lower than EWS/ATF1 (12Pan S. Koh Y.M. Dunn T.A. Li K.K.C. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1625-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) and is still efficiently repressed by the RBD (compare Δ87CD with 87DR). Analysis of the above deletion mutants demonstrates that the region of the EAD coincident with the hsRPB7-binding site is highly sensitive to repression. To gain insight into the mechanism of repression, we examined the effect of the RBD on nuclear accumulation (Fig. 4 A). Cells were transfected with pΔ87C (− RBD , see Fig. 3 B) and p87R (+ RBD) followed by Western blot analysis of whole cell (T) and nuclear extracts (N). The proportion of Δ87C and 87R proteins present in the nuclear fraction is comparable. We next tested in vitro DNA binding by Δ87C and 87R present in nuclear extracts from transfected cells. Δ87C and 87R proteins were purified using an ATF-DNA affinity resin as described previously (4Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C.T. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar) and were detected by Western blotting (Fig.4 A). Δ87C and 87R bind specifically to the ATF-DNA affinity resin as indicated by competition by an oligonucleotide containing a consensus ATF1-binding site (4Brown A.D. Lopez-Terrada D. Denny C.T. Lee K.A.W. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1749-1756PubMed Google Scholar), and the amount of binding is comparable for Δ87C and 87R. Together, the above results show that the RBD has no effect on nuclear accumulation or DNA binding in vitro. The above findings suggested that RBD-mediated repression might occur directly at the promoter. To test this possibility and, at the same time, to ask whether the RBD can repress another activator, we examined the properties of a novel hybrid protein (ERZA). ERZA essentially contains intact EWS and intact ATF1 and therefore has the potential to act as a constitutive activator (via the EAD) or as a PKA-inducible activator (via ATF1). We could not use native ATF1 for this experiment because endogenous ATF1/CREB activate ATF-dependent reporters (24Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar), and to circumvent this, we used a previously described bZIP swap approach (27Ribeiro A. Brown A.D. Lee K.A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31124-31128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) employing the heterologous bZIP domain of the Zta protein (ZbZIP) together with a reporter containing Zta-binding sites. ZATF1 corresponds to ATF1 except with the bZIP domain of Zta and activates the Zta reporter in a PKA-inducible manner (Fig.4 B) as previously shown (27Ribeiro A. Brown A.D. Lee K.A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31124-31128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Significantly, ERZA behaves like ZATF1, giving a low basal activity that is stimulated by PKA. This result demonstrates that the presence of the RBD does not prevent DNA binding in vivo and does not repress PKA-inducible activation by ATF1. To assess further the activity of ERZA, we tested two additional fusion proteins. EZΔA corresponds to pΔ287C and constitutively activates the Zta reporter to extremely high levels, demonstrating that the EAD is functional on the Zta reporter. Different amounts of extract are used for the CAT assays shown (Fig.4 B), and quantitatively, EZΔA gives ∼200-fold more activation than PKA-induced activation by ZATF1 or ERZA. EZA is identical to EZΔA except for the presence of intact ATF1 and, like EZΔA, gives strong constitutive activation. Thus the PKA-regulated region of ATF1 has no effect on activation by the EAD. Apparent lack of a PKA response by EZA is probably explained by the much higher (∼200-fold, see above) constitutive activation by the EAD that would likely mask PKA inducibility. Together, the above results demonstrate that RBD-mediated repression exhibits a degree of specificity for the EAD (since ATF1 is not repressed) and does not involve a block to DNA binding in vivo. Thus we conclude that the RBD can directly and selectively repress trans-activation by the EAD, at the promoter. We have established several characteristics of repression as described under “Results.” A major issue concerns whether binding of the RBD to nascent mRNA transcripts might be involved in repression. Although the RRM is dispensable for repression, the RGG3 region is important, and this region is sufficient for binding to poly(G) and poly(U) substratesin vitro (17Ohno T. Ouchida M. Lee L. Gatalica Z. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3087-3097PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the RGG boxes of TLS (8Prasad D.D.K. Ouchida M. Lee L. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3717-3729PubMed Google Scholar) and the Fmrp protein (35Brown V. Small K. Lakkis L. Feng Y. Gunter C. Wilkinson K.D. Warren S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15521-15527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) may be sufficient for ribopolymer binding and poly(G) binding, respectively. Thus, we cannot completely exclude a role for RNA binding in repression. However, we feel that such a role is unlikely for two reasons. Lack of involvement of the RRM indicates that high affinity RNA binding is not involved in repression (31Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar), and selective repression of the EAD demonstrates that the RBD does not act via a transcript-dependent shut down of the promoter. Considering the above, we favor a model whereby repression results from the RBD directly interfering with trans-activation by the EAD. This view is also prompted by several other indications that the EAD and RBD functionally interact. First, for both TLS (8Prasad D.D.K. Ouchida M. Lee L. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3717-3729PubMed Google Scholar) and EWS (17Ohno T. Ouchida M. Lee L. Gatalica Z. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3087-3097PubMed Google Scholar) the EAD alters the RNA binding specificity of the RBD in vitro. Second, phosphorylation of the IQ domain of the EAD inhibits RNA binding by EWS (33Deloulme J.C. Prichard L. Delattre O. Storm D.R. J. Biol.

Third, the RBD prevents interaction of the EAD with at least two transcriptional components (hsRPB7 and hsRPB5) (21Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the ability to bind hsRPB7 is required for EAD-mediated trans-activation (14Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In light of the above and our finding that the N-terminal region of the EAD (residues 1–86) is highly sensitive to repression and binds to hsRPB7 (14Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we propose that repression results from steric hindrance of EAD binding to RPB7. This might be achieved by direct contacts between the RBD and the EAD or via additional factors that participate in a ternary complex. Further analysis using the repression assay to correlate more precisely hsRPB7/EAD binding with trans-activation will enable a rigorous test of the role of hsRPB7 in trans-activation by EFPs. Although it is clear that EFPs are transcription factors, it has not been definitively established that EWS/TETs normally function in transcription. Since transcriptional activation domains can be generated at a surprisingly high frequency by fusion of random sequences to a DNA-binding domain (36Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 113-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), it remains possible that the normal function of EWS has nothing to do with transcription. In this event, the effect of the RBD that we score as cis-repression of EFPs might normally be to prevent aberrant association of EWS (via the EAD) with transcriptional components. The presence of TETs in polymerase II complexes is not inconsistent with this suggestion (15Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 21Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) because this characteristic might reflect a role for TETs in coupling transcription with RNA processing or transport rather than transcription, as previously suggested (3Ron D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 220: 131-142PubMed Google Scholar). If EWS does function in transcription then how does it work? The finding that the RBD can antagonize the EAD on a broad range of promoters or (viewed another way) that “promoter-bound” EWS does not activate transcription suggests that EWS might normally function as a repressor. In this regard, it is pertinent that several proteins that share characteristics with EWS act as transcriptional repressors. Examples include the yeast protein Nrd1 (37Steinmetz E.J. Brow D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6699-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), hnRNP-U (38Kim M.K. Nikodem V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6833-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and NELF (39Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) all of which have an RNA-binding component and repress transcriptional elongation. We cannot exclude that lack of activation by promoter-bound EWS might reflect “imprisoning” of EWS in the promoter region thereby preventing a positive role in elongation, but previous findings for other activators suggest that this is unlikely. Specifically, tethering a normally RNA-dependent activator (TAT) (40Southgate C.D. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2496-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) or components of polymerase II (41Seipel K. Georgiev O. Gerber H.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5609-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to the promoter via a DNA-binding domain or, alternatively, recruiting a normally promoter-bound activator via an RNA ligand (42Tiley L.S. Madore S.J. Malim M.H. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2077-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in both cases preserves the capacity to activate transcription. The flexibility observed for other activators suggests that the inability of promoter-bound EWS to activate transcription means that EWS is normally not an activator. In this case EWS would differ from some other hnRNP proteins (including hnRNP D (43Dempsey L.A. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29224-29229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), hnRNP K (44Lee M.-H. Mori S. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3420-3427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and hnRNP DOB 45Tolnay M. Vereshchagina L. Tsokos G.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 417-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) that play positive roles in transcription. Our findings are of significance for evaluating the possible effects of recruitment of TETs to the promoter via interactions with other transcription factors. Such interactions have recently been identified, including high affinity binding of TLS to nuclear hormone receptors (23Powers C.A. Mathur M. Raaka B.M. Ron D. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 4-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this latter case the functional consequences have not been determined, but our experiments with EWS suggest that recruitment of TETs to the promoter is unlikely to play a role in transcriptional activation. Our finding that a cis-linked RBD can repress trans-activation by the EAD and the fact that oncogenic EFFs never contain the RBD strongly supports the role of trans-activation in oncogenesis. Furthermore, our results provide a rationale, in molecular terms, for obligatory loss of the RBD during oncogenesis. Although the fusion proteins that we have studied are contrived, it is possible (and even likely) that such proteins naturally occur due to somatic mutation but escape discovery because they are not oncogenic. For example, a fusion protein containing EWS exons 1–16 (including the entire RBD) fused to ATF1 (residues 66–271) would be in frame (34Plougastel B. Zucman J. Peter M. Thomas G. Delattre O. Genomics. 1993; 18: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and almost identical to the NC protein. Thus the proteins that we have characterized correspond to alternative EWS/ATF1 hybrids that can contribute to understanding of the molecular mechanism of oncogenesis. We have shown that repression can occur on a variety of promoters and in the context of a heterologous DNA-binding domain (Gal4) suggesting that repression is likely to be operative for all EFPs. The recent finding that promoter-bound hTAFII68 does not activate transcription (46Bertolotti A. Bell B. Tora L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8000-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) supports this suggestion. To date there is no transformation assay for EWS/ATF1, but for hTAFII68 inclusion of C-terminal sequences (including a major part of the RBD) blocks both trans-activation and transformation (46Bertolotti A. Bell B. Tora L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8000-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to test the effect of the RBD using the established transformation assays for other EFPs (47Kim J. Lee K.A.W. Pelletier J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1973-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 48May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L. Lunsford L.B. Lewis B.C. Delattre O. Zucman J. Thomas G. Denny C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The work of several groups has revealed that EFPs are involved in tumor maintenance (50Kovar H. Aryee D.N.T. Jug G. Henockl C. Schemper M. Delattre O. Thomas G. Gadner H. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 429-437PubMed Google Scholar, 51Ouchida M. Ohno T. Fujimura Y. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1049-1054PubMed Google Scholar, 52Tanaka K. Iwakuma T.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that EFP inhibitors will have therapeutic potential. The absolute tumor specificity of EFPs together with the clear functional distinctions between EFPs and TETs further suggests that EFPs may be attractive therapeutic targets. Our results suggest that the RGG boxes (and hence possibly the tri-peptide RGG motif) might represent potent and selective EAD inhibitors. By using the repression assay, it will be of interest to test this possibility further with a view to creating RGG-related compounds that might serve as useful leads for drug development.

https://openalex.org/W1992236985,"Initiation of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcription requires formation of a complex containing the viral RNA (vRNA), tRNA3Lys and reverse transcriptase ( RT ). The vRNA and the primer tRNA3Lys form several intermolecular interactions in addition to annealing of the primer 3′ end to the primer binding site (PBS). These interactions are crucial for the efficiency and the specificity of the initiation of reverse transcription. However, as they are located upstream of the PBS, they must unwind as DNA synthesis proceeds. Here, the dynamics of the complex during initiation of reverse transcription was followed by enzymatic probing. Our data revealed reciprocal effects of the tertiary structure of the vRNA·tRNA3Lyscomplex and reverse transcriptase (RT) at a distance from the polymerization site. The structure of the initiation complex allowed RT to interact with the template strand up to 20 nucleotides upstream from the polymerization site. Conversely, nucleotide addition by RT modified the tertiary structure of the complex at 10–14 nucleotides from the catalytic site. The viral sequences became exposed at the surface of the complex as they dissociated from the tRNA following primer extension. However, the counterpart tRNA sequences became buried inside the complex. Surprisingly, they became exposed when mutations prevented the intermolecular interactions in the initial complex, indicating that the fate of the tRNA depended on the tertiary structure of the initial complex."

We have previously shown that loss of TGFβ sensitivity is due to decreased expression of the transforming growth factor receptor type II (TβRII) and is associated with increased tumorigenicity in nude mice. Reduced TβRII expression in MCF-7L cells is caused by decreased TβRII promoter activity in this cell line. Our previous studies using 5′ deletion constructs of this promoter revealed that MCF-7L cells were unable to support transcription of the minimal promoter (−47 to +2) to the same levels as the MCF-7E cells. This region of the promoter contains an Sp1 element at position −25 from the major transcription start site. In this study, we investigated the role of Sp1 in TβRII transcription. Mutation of the Sp1 site resulted in decreased transcription of TβRII in MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells, indicating that this site played a role in transcription of this promoter. Gel shift assays using the proximal Sp1 site from the TβRII promoter showed enhanced DNA:protein complex formation with nuclear proteins isolated from MCF-7E cells compared with MCF-7L cells. Supershift analysis identified this binding activity as Sp1. Western blot analysis of Sp1 levels demonstrated that MCF-7E cells contain increased Sp1 protein compared with MCF-7L cells, paralleling the increased binding activity. Differential Sp1 activity was also demonstrated by higher levels of transcription of an Sp1-dependent insulin-like growth factor II promoter construct in MCF-7E cells compared with MCF-7L cells. Co-transfection of an Sp1 expression vector with a TβRII promoter construct in MCF-7L cells induced the expression from the promoter-CAT constructs and resulted in an increase of endogenous TβRII protein levels. These results demonstrate that the transcriptional repression of TβRII in MCF-7L cells is caused, in part, by lower Sp1 levels.

Activities of TGFβ include the regulation of cell adhesion through modulation of extracellular matrix composition, guidance of the morphogenic events of embryogenesis, immunosuppression, and the lengthening or arresting of cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle (1.Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar, 2.Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 593: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Of special interest is TGFβ's function as a growth inhibitor of epithelial cells. TGFβ elicits its effects by binding to specific cell surface receptors. Three major types of receptors, denoted receptor type I, type II, and type III have been identified and cloned (3.Wang X.-F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A.

Type III receptor (TβRIII), alternately known as betaglycan, is a large 280–330-kDa transmembrane proteoglycan with no known signaling motif. TβRIII is thought to play a role in presenting the ligand to the other receptors (6.Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Receptor type I (TβRI), a 50–60-kDa glycoprotein, and receptor type II (TβRII), a 75–85-kDa glycoprotein, belong to a superfamily of receptor serine/threonine kinases. The presence of both TβRI and TβRII is necessary to effect a TGFβ response, and both kinase activities must be functional for proper signal transduction (7.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F.

Therefore, cells defective in one or the other receptor are refractory to the effects of TGFβ and escape its autocrine-negative effects on growth. The loss of TGFβ sensitivity has been correlated to tumor progression. This loss has been most often associated with a loss of TβRII expression (11.Brattain M.G. Markowitz S.D. Willson J.K.V.

In addition, the transfectants showed decreased anchorage-independent growth, and a decreased tumorigenicity in nude mice compared with vector-transfected cells. These results suggest that TβRII behaves as a tumor suppressor in the MCF-7 cells. Due to the significant role of TβRII in determining tumorigenicity, it is likely that defects of TβRII expression can lead to malignant progression. MCF-7 cells represent a well established model system for studying the biology of breast cancer cells. Our earlier work using MCF-7 early passage (MCF-7E) and MCF-7 late passage (MCF-7L) cells demonstrated that MCF-7L cells' resistance to exogenous TGFβ correlated with the low, or undetectable level of TβRII in this cell line (18.Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Liu Y. Li W.H. Liang J.R. Soule H.D. Pauley R.J. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Phys. 1998; 176: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These cells were tumorigenic in athymic nude mice, whereas the TGFβ-sensitive MCF-7E cells were not. Thus, the MCF-7 system can be viewed as a model system for progression. The early passage MCF-7 cells are nontumorigenic and have changed through time in culture to become a more tumorigenic cell line. This progression is accompanied by the loss of TβRII. We have shown that the differential levels of TβRII in the MCF-7E versus MCF-7L cells were due to the difference of TβRII promoter activities in MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells (18.Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Liu Y. Li W.H. Liang J.R. Soule H.D. Pauley R.J. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Phys. 1998; 176: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The minimal promoter, as well as other promoter constructs studied, were expressed at very low levels in the late passage cells compared with the early passage cells. In this study, we use this MCF-7 system to understand the underlying mechanism of TβRII transcriptional regulation of the minimal TβRII promoter. We find that the transcription of the TβRII minimal promoter in the MCF-7E and MCF-7L system is dependent on an Sp1 element at −25. The Sp1 DNA binding activity is decreased in MCF-7L cells compared with the MCF-7E cells. This decreased binding activity correlates with decreased levels of Sp1 protein. In addition, transfection with an Sp1 expression plasmid results in the induced transcription of a co-transfected TβRII promoter construct and increased endogenous TβRII protein levels. MCF-7E cells (<200 passages) were originally obtained from Michigan Cancer Foundation (Drs. Pauley and Soule). MCF-7L cells (>500 passages) were from American Type Culture Collection. These cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, vitamins, amino acids, antibiotics, and phenol red (21.Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The −47TβRII-CAT, −274TβRII-CAT, and −47(Sp1M)TβRII-CAT constructs were prepared as described (22.Bae H.W. Geiser A.G.

MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells were transiently transfected with 30 μg of RII promoter-CAT constructs and 10 μg of β-galactosidase by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 250 V and 960 microfarads. The electroporated cells were plated onto 100-mm culture dishes. Sp1 co-transfection experiments were conducted using Transfast (Promega) at a ratio of 1.5:1 lipid to DNA. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h following transfection by three cycles of freeze-thaw in 0.25 m Tris, pH 8. Transfection efficiencies of either condition was measured by overnight staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactopyranoside. The percentage of blue colonies for both electroporation and Transfast reagent was approximately 15–20%. Protein assays (Bio-Rad) and β-galactosidase activity assays were performed to normalize the amounts of extracts to use for the CAT assays. Lysates representing equal transfection equivalents were incubated with [14C]chloramphenicol (0.25 μCi) and acetyl coenzyme A (40 mm) overnight at 37 °C, extracted with ethyl acetate, and separated by thin layer chromatography. The radioactivity in the acetylated products were directly quantified using the Ambis system (San Diego, CA), or were analyzed by autoradiography. MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes and grown to confluence. Nuclear proteins of MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells were isolated at 4 °C as described with minor modifications (23.Dignam J.D. Leibowitz R.M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by scraping, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in 2 packed cell volumes of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KC1, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml amounts of both leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclei were collected by microcentrifugation for 5 min at 3,000 rpm, rinsed once in buffer A, then resuspended in two-thirds packed cell volume of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 2.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.0 μg/ml amounts of both leupeptin and aprotinin). Nuclei were incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 30 min and clarified by microcentrifugation for 5 min at 3,000 rpm. The resulting supernatants were dialyzed versus buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 2.9, 100 mm KCI, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml amounts of both leupeptin and aprotinin) and frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. Gel shift assays were conducted as described previously (18.Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Liu Y. Li W.H. Liang J.R. Soule H.D. Pauley R.J. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Brattain M.G. J.

Double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the two Sp1 sites on RII promoter (−25 sense strand, GAGAAGGCTCTTCCGGGCGGAGAGAGGTCCTG; −143 sense strand, AGTGGTGTGGGAGGGCGGTGAGGGGCAGCAGCT) and a mutant Sp1 oligonucleotide (sense strand, GAGAAGGCTCTTCCGGGCccAGAGAGGTCCTG) were prepared (Genosys). Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide and recombinant human Sp1 protein were obtained from Promega. Oligonucleotides were annealed to their corresponding strand and labeled by end labeling using [γ-32P]ATP (950 μCi, 3,000 Ci/mol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The labeled oligonucleotides were then purified by using probe quant G-50 microcolumns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding reactions were conducted in a 20-μl volume that contained 10 μl of nuclear protein in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 20,000 cpm of labeled oligonucleotides. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Competition reactions were performed by adding 100-fold excess, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide to the reaction mixture, prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. Reactions were separated by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 150 V for 2 h in a 100 mmTris borate-EDTA buffer at 4 °C. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. For the supershift assay, the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide and nuclear protein reaction mixture were incubated for an additional 30 min with 2 μg of Sp1-specific peptide antibody (Santa Cruz) at room temperature, prior to electrophoresis and autoradiography. Thirty micrograms of total cellular protein or five micrograms of nuclear protein were separated by electrophoresis on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was blocked in blocking buffer (920 mmTris-HC1, pH 2.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% milk) at room temperature for 1 h, then the membrane was subjected to anti-Sp1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C overnight, followed by 1 h incubation of secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Proteins were visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Our previous results demonstrated that MCF-7E cells and MCF-7L cells represent TGFβ-sensitive and -insensitive strains, respectively, of this well studied cell line (18.Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Liu Y. Li W.H. Liang J.R. Soule H.D. Pauley R.J. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Phys. 1998; 176: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This differential sensitivity corresponded to a differential expression of TβRII due to differences in TβRII transcriptional activity. Use of TβRII promoter-CAT constructs revealed that the differential expression in MCF-7L and MCF-7E cells occurred in all deletion constructs including the minimal promoter. This construct, −47TβRII-CAT, contains an Sp1 site at −25 and the initiator sequence. It has been shown that mutation of this Sp1 site within the TβRII minimal promoter decreased TβRII promoter activity in the high TβRII-expressing HepG2 cells (22.Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We questioned whether Sp1 also played a role in regulating TβRII transcription in the MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells. A TβRII-CAT construct in which the Sp1 site at −25 was mutated was used in our transient transfection studies and compared its activity to that of the wild type −47TβRII-CAT. Consistent with our previous results, MCF-7E cells displayed higher CAT activity when transfected with the wild-type construct than similarly transfected MCF-7L cells (Fig. 1). Transfection with the Sp1 mutated construct resulted in a decreased promoter activity in both MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells. The level of transcription of the Sp1 mutated TβRII construct was essentially identical in both the cells lines, indicating that the Sp1 was responsible for the differential expression. Notably, the reduction of RII promoter activity in MCF-7E cells is more dramatic than in MCF-7L cells since its original activity is higher. This result demonstrates that the Sp1 element is an important determinant in the activity of the TβRII promoter activity in both MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells. Since the Sp1 element was found to participate in the regulation of the TβRII promoter, the Sp1 element in this promoter should bind Sp1. Gel shift assays were performed to address whether the MCF-7 cells contained binding activities for these regions. Results using nuclear protein of MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells and a probe corresponding to the Sp1 element at position −25, show a DNA:protein complex with a mobility identical to that of the recombinant human Sp1-bound probe (Fig. 2). Nuclear protein from MCF-7E cells contains greater amounts of these binding activities than the nuclear protein from MCF-7L cells. These bands represent specific binding of protein to the Sp1 sequence element, since complex formation was diminished by the addition of 100 m excess of unlabeled identical competitor, but not by addition of the identical oligonucleotide in which the Sp1 site was mutated. As an additional control, the mutant oligonucleotide was used as the probe. This resulted in no shifted species using either MCF-7E or MCF-7L extracts, indicating that the protein binding was dependent on the intact SP1 sequence. Gel shift assays using the labeled Sp1 consensus sequence also resulted in increased complex formation using MCF-7E-derived nuclear extract compared with MCF-7L-derived extracts (Fig.2 B), identical to our results with the Sp1 sequence from the TβRII minimal promoter. To confirm that the enhanced protein-DNA complex in MCF-7E cells contains Sp1, “supershift” assays were carried out using an antibody specific for Sp1. Addition of this antibody in the binding reactions decreased the mobility of the DNA:protein complex, indicating that this complex contained Sp1 (Fig. 3). Nuclear protein from both MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells contained Sp1 protein; however, MCF-7E cells contain higher levels than the MCF-7L cells. Similar results were obtained using the Sp1 element found at −143 of the TβRII promoter as a probe for the gel shift assays (data not shown). These results suggest that the higher TβRII minimal promoter activity in MCF-7E cells correlates with enhanced Sp1 activity in these cells. MCF-7E cells differentially regulate the TβRII promoter construct containing the Sp1 binding site and contain increased levels of Sp1 binding activity compared with MCF-7L cells. We reasoned that the differential levels of the Sp1 binding activity in these two cell lines may result in the differential regulation of other Sp1-dependent promoters. A promoter construct representing the −58 to +124 of the IGF-II Sp1 gene was used in transient transfection of the MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells. This promoter-CAT fusion construct contains two Sp1 sites and a TATA box sequence. The activity of this promoter has been shown to be Sp1-dependent (25.Kim S.J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Botchan M.R. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). MCF-7E cells supported a dramatically higher IGF-II promoter activity than MCF-7L cells consistent with our results with the TβRII promoter activity (Fig. 4). Increased Sp1 binding activity could result from modification of an existing form of the protein rendering it more active or from increased protein levels. We performed Western blot analyses to investigate whether enhanced Sp1 DNA binding activity is paralleled by increased levels of Sp1 in MCF-7E cells compared with the MCF-7L cells. Proteins from MCF-7E and MCF-7L nuclei were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose for the immunoblot assay. The immunoblot results showed significant levels of the 95- and 105-kDa forms of Sp1 in the nuclear extracts from MCF-7E cells compared with lower levels from the MCF-7L cells (Fig.5 A). In contrast, no differences for c-Jun levels are seen in MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells. These results suggest that enhanced Sp1 binding activity is a result of increased levels of Sp1 protein in the nucleus. One mechanism for increasing the levels of a specific protein in the nucleus is to import existing protein from the cytoplasm. If this were the case, then it is possible that the MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells contain equivalent amounts of Sp1 protein, but it is preferentially located in the nucleus of the MCF-7E cell. To test this, we repeated our immunoblot assays using whole cell lysates from MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells. Immunoblot assays reveal that the total Sp1 protein is higher in the MCF-7E then the MCF-7L cells, indicating that the regulation of Sp1 activity is at the level of protein rather than the level of nuclear localization (Fig. 5 B). The differential level of Sp1 in MCF-7L and MCF-7E cells appears to contribute to the differential regulation of the TβRII minimal promoter and other Sp1-dependent constructs. We examined whether re-expression of Sp1 in the MCF-7L cells would lead to increased expression of the TβRII promoter. We obtained an Sp1-expressing plasmid, CMVSp1, from the laboratory of Dr. Sophia Tsai (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) (26.Shen W. Kim H.S. Tsai S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20525-20529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). MCF-7L cells were co-transfected with CMVSp1 and the TβRII constructs used above. In addition, the construct −274TβRII-CAT was also used. This construct represents 274 base pairs of the proximal portion of the TβRII promoter, which contains a putative AP1/CREB site at −195, and two Sp1 sites, one at position −143 and the other at −25. This construct had been previously shown to support high levels of transcription of a fused reporter gene (18.Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Liu Y. Li W.H. Liang J.R. Soule H.D. Pauley R.J. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Phys. 1998; 176: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22.Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Results show that co-transfection with the Sp1 expression plasmid supports a higher transcriptional activity of the TβRII-CAT constructs compared with cells co-transfected with TβRII-CAT and the empty vector (Fig.6). Co-transfection of CMVSP1 had no effect on the transcription of the Sp1 mutant TβRII-CAT, confirming the necessity of the Sp1 binding site. The increased Sp1 levels following transfection of the CMVSP1 could support higher transcription of the TβRII-CAT constructs, we hypothesized that the endogenous gene would be expressed as well. Increasing amounts of CMVSP1 was transiently transfected into MCF-7L cells, and cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis 48 h following the transfection. As expected, increasing amounts of SP1 protein were detected in the cells correlating with increasing amounts of CMVSp1 transfected (Fig. 7). In addition, increased amounts of TβRII was also detected in the CMVSp1-transfected cells, indicating that Sp1 expression positively effects endogenous TβRII expression. Direct involvement of TβRII in TGFβ signal transduction suggests that loss of TβRII expression contributes to the loss of TGFβ response resulting in a growth advantage. Estrogen receptor-containing breast cancer cells (ER+) acquire resistance to TGFβ due to lack or insufficient expression of TβRII (18.Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Liu Y. Li W.H. Liang J.R. Soule H.D.

Our earlier work demonstrated that progression from MCF-7 early passage to late passage correlates with a decreased RII expression and increased tumorigenicity. Re-expression RII in MCF-7L cells restored the cell response to exogenous TGFβ and reversed the tumorigenicity (19.Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J.H. Rajkarunanyake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This correlation between TβRII expression and malignant progression demonstrates the significant tumor suppressing function of TβRII in ER+ breast cancers. Our previous work demonstrated that the loss of TβRII expression in MCF-7L cells is due to decreased activity of the TβRII promoter (18.Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Liu Y. Li W.H. Liang J.R. Soule H.D. Pauley R.J. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Phys. 1998; 176: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells were used to determine the mechanism of TβRII transcriptional repression in MCF-7L cells. The results from transient transfecton of TβRII promoter-CAT constructs which contained mutated Sp1 site showed Sp1 was responsible for the differential regulation of the TβRII promoter in MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells. Mobility shift assays and supershift assays, utilizing oligonucleotides representing the TβRII Sp1 DNA binding element and nuclear protein from MCF-7E or MCF-7L cells, indicated that MCF-7E contained enhanced Sp1 activity. This enhanced Sp1 binding activity was found to be due to higher levels of Sp1 protein in MCF-7E cells. These results demonstrate that suboptimal levels of Sp1 activity in MCF-7L cells contribute to the reduced TβRII expression, leading to resistance to TGFβ and lower tumorigenicity of MCF-7L cells. Transfection of the MCF-7L cells with an Sp1 expression plasmid resulted in increased expression of the co-transfected TβRII-CAT constructs. One of the constructs used in this assay contained two Sp1 sites as well as a AP1/CRE site necessary for maximal TβRII transcription. While this construct is also transcribed to levels lower in MCF-7L cells compared with early cells, re-expression of the Sp1 site up-regulated expression of this larger promoter construct. This result suggests that levels of Sp1 can affect the transcription of larger segments of the promoter in addition to its effects on an Sp1-dependent minimal promoter, which contains no other transcriptional elements. Indeed, the expression of the endogenous TβRII was also increased. Therefore, Sp1 may be a possible target for manipulation of TβRII expression in TβRII-deficient cells. In support of this suggestion, it had been shown that the DNA demethylating reagent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine results in an induction of TβRII expression in MCF-7L breast cancer cells and other ER+ breast cancer cell lines, leading to the re-establishment of the TGFβ response. This restoration of TβRII expression occurs through the stabilization of Sp1 protein and not through the demethylation of the TβRII promoter (24.Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition to the SP1 motifs in the TβRII promoter, the region from −271 to −137 is necessary for maximal transcription of TβRII in MCF-7 cells (18.Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Liu Y. Li W.H. Liang J.R. Soule H.D. Pauley R.J. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Phys. 1998; 176: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This region has been shown to contain an AP1/CRE site (22.Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which is an important determinant during the differentiation of EC cells (27.Kelly D. Kim S.-J. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21115-21124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Of related interest is the fact that some breast cancer cells have been shown to be deficient in the activity of AP1 (28.Smith L.M. Birrer M.J. Stampfer M.R. Brown P.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3046-3054PubMed Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the contribution of the AP1 site on the TβRII promoter in MFC-7E and MCF-7L cells. The increased Sp1 levels in MCF-7E nuclei correlated with increased transcription of the TβRII gene in these cells compared with MCF-7L cells. This higher expression of Sp1 may be caused by increased transcription of the Sp1 gene, or by translational or post-translational mechanisms. Post-translational modifications of Sp1 can influence its activity or stability. Sp1 has been shown to be phosphorylated and O-glycosylated (29.Jackson S.P. Macdonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 30.Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The addition ofN-acetylglucosamine residues has been shown to influence the transport of Sp1 into the nucleus, and reducedO-glycosylation of Sp1 has been shown to be associated with proteasome degradation during glucose starvation (31.Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). MCF-7L cells treated with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine show an increased half-life of Sp1 nuclear protein (24.Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Current work is under way to investigate whether changes in Sp1 stability is responsible for the differences in Sp1 levels in MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells or whether other mechanisms result in the differential Sp1 levels in these cells. Sp1 is necessary for the transcription of TATA-less genes through its interaction with the TFIID to direct the start site of transcription (32.Pugh B.F. Tijian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). In addition, Sp1 regulates the transcription of a number of TATA-containing genes, often coordinating with other cellular factors to regulate gene-specific transcription. A model has been proposed wherein the functional interaction between pRb and Sp1 in vivo results in the “superactivation” of Sp1-mediated transcription (33.Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Sp1 has also been shown to interact with Ets family of transcription factors (34.Block K.L. Shou Y. Poncz M. Blood. 1996; 88: 2071-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Nuchprayoon I. Shang J. Simkevich C.P. Luo M. Rosmarin A.G. Friedman A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1085-1091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the estrogen receptor (36.Sun G. Porter W. Safe S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 882-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Xie W. Duan R. Safe S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The specificity of the genes regulated by Sp1 is most probably determined by co-factors or activators that interact with Sp1 or the combinatorial effects of other regulating elements. A member of the Ets family of transcription factors has been found to bind to a region of the TβRII promoter downstream from the start of transcription (+13 to +24) (38.Choi S.-G. Yi Y. Kim Y.-S. Kato M. Chang J. Chung H.-W. Hahm K.-B. Yang H.-K. Rhee H.H. Bang Y.-J. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 110-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our constructs did not contain this site; therefore, it is not known what the interaction of this member of the Ets family has on TβRII transcription in our system. Other putative Ets-like sites do exist in the minimal promoter region. These sites may participate in the transcription of this promoter in MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells. Of interest is the fact that the promoters of other TGFβ family members contain Sp1 sites. The TGFβ1 and TβRI genes have been shown to contain functionally significant Sp1 motifs in their promoters (39.Geiser A.G. Busam K.J. Kim S.-J. Lafyatis R. O'Reilly M.A. Webbink R. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 129: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,40.Ji C. Casinghino S. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21260-21267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since Sp1 is a general transcription factor, it is likely that other factors are involved to direct the specificity of its actions to certain promoters. We have previously shown that the RNA levels for TGFβ1 and TβRI are similar in both the MCF-7L and MCF-7E cells (18.Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Liu Y. Li W.H. Liang J.R. Soule H.D. Pauley R.J. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Phys. 1998; 176: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, other factors must participate in specifying transcription of these genes when Sp1 is deficient. It is possible that the transcription of TβRII may be more dependent on Sp1 than the other family members. Several TGFβ-responsive genes contain Sp1 motifs. TGFβ itself signals through various cytoplasmic signal transducers, including those of the Smad family (41.Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 21-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The p21/Waf/Cip1 promoter has been shown to be regulated by TGFβ through Sp1 via an interaction with Smad proteins (42.Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). TβRII has been shown in some cases to be induced by its own ligand (43.Menke A. Geerling I. Giehl K. Vogelmann R. Reinshagen M. Adler G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1449: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 44.Kim Y. Ratziu V. Choi S.-G. Lalazar A. Theiss G. Dang Q. Kim S.-J. Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33750-33758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Since Sp1 is an important determinant in TβRII transcription, it is possible that TβRII is regulated in an autocrine fashion via Sp1 and Smad interactions. Our earlier work demonstrated that the reduced autocrine-negative regulation by TGFβ is a result of decreased TβRII expression in MCF-7L cells and is associated with increased tumorigenicity. Cells that express TβRII, the early passage MCF-7 and TβRII transfectants, show a reduced tumorigenicity, suggesting that this loss of this receptor is involved in tumor progression. Our understanding of the mechanisms that control TβRII expression could lead to therapeutics that target the expression of this gene. Reduced expression of TβRII in the MCF-7L cells is due to suboptimal Sp1 levels. Manipulation of Sp1 activity may be a possible mechanism by which to induce TβRII expression, leading to restored sensitivity to the negative growth effects of TGFβ.

These microtubule asters accurately reflect the noncentrosomal aspects of mitotic spindle pole formation. We show here that colonic-hepatictumor-overexpressed gene (ch-TOGp) is an abundant component of these asters. We have prepared ch-TOGp-specific antibodies and show by immunodepletion that ch-TOGp is required for microtubule aster assembly. Microtubule polymerization is severely inhibited in the absence of ch-TOGp, and silver stain analysis of the ch-TOGp immunoprecipitate indicates that it is not present in a preformed complex and is the only protein removed from the extract during immunodepletion. Furthermore, the reduction in microtubule polymerization efficiency in the absence of ch-TOGp is dependent on ATP. These results demonstrate that ch-TOGp is a major constituent of microtubule asters assembled in a mammalian mitotic extract and that it is required for robust microtubule polymerization in an ATP-dependent manner in this system even though taxol is present. These data, coupled with biochemical and genetic data derived from analysis of ch-TOGp-related proteins in other organisms, indicate that ch-TOGp is a key factor regulating microtubule dynamics during mitosis."

The ATPase cycles of the two motor domains appear to become kinetically uncoupled, causing them to work more independently rather than in the strict, coordinated fashion that is typical of kinesin. kinesin heavy chain Drosophila kinesin heavy chain gene KHC fragment containing the N-terminal 401 amino acids wild type K401 K401 with T291M amino acid substitution 5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate microtubule microtubule-K401 complex 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-adenosine 5′-triphosphate 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-adenosine 5′-diphosphate Structural analyses of kinesin (2.Kull F.J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have revealed that the topography of the nucleotide-binding pocket is quite similar to that of myosins and the G proteins (9.Vale R.D.

Biol. 1999; 290: 797-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The results suggest further that these proteins may share a common mechanism to sense the state of the nucleotide bound at the active site and to respond through structural transitions to communicate with protein partners. For dimeric kinesin, coordination of the motor domains is controlled in part by the nucleotide state at the active sites (11.Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 12.Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and is required for the cyclic interaction with the microtubule lattice for unidirectional, processive movement. Through pre-steady-state kinetic analysis, it has been determined that ATP binding by the microtubule-bound motor domain allows the partner motor domain to bind to the microtubule and quickly release its ADP (12.Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 724-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13.Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Other points of coordination are also evident. Thus, the two motor domains of the kinesin heavy chain (KHC)1 dimer are at different stages in their ATPase cycles at any given time, keeping the heads out of phase and allowing for processive movement (reviewed in Refs. 14.Block S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and15.Mandelkow E. Johnson K.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 429-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Much has been learned about kinesin through structural studies. The first motor domain structural intermediate to be determined was the KHC·ADP intermediate (3.Kozielski F. Sack S. Marx A. Thormählen M. Schönbrunn E. Biou V. Thompson A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 91: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 4.Sack S. Müller A. Marx M. Thormählen M. Mandelkow E.-M. Brady S.T. Mandelkow E.

Nature. 1996; 380: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Recently, the structures of KHC under conditions that mimic different nucleotide states were solved (16.Müller J. Marx A. Sack S. Song Y.-H. Mandelkow E. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 981-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This work revealed that in the absence of microtubules there is little change in KHC structure regardless of the nucleotide present. Thus, with no existing structures of microtubule·kinesin intermediates, the transition states important for efficient ATP hydrolysis remain enigmatic. Because it is difficult to integrate mechanistic models with the available information, alternative approaches are required to understand the structural requirements for motor coordination and processive movement. Site-directed mutagenesis has already identified structural elements that are important for certain aspects of KHC function. Studies by Woehlke et al. (17.Woehlke G. Ruby A.K. Hart C.L. Ly B. Hom-Booher N. Vale R.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) highlighted charged surface residues necessary for the interaction of KHC with microtubules. Romberget al. (18.Romberg L. Pierce D.W. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) showed that the neck region of KHC is important for efficiency but is not essential for processive movement. They proposed a model in which interactions between the β-sheet region of the neck (β9 and β10) and the catalytic domain are disrupted such that the neck region could adopt a more extended conformation to allow head separation during times when both heads are bound to the microtubule. This hypothesis is supported by the cryo-EM diffraction studies of microtubule·kinesin complexes by Hoenger et al.(19.Hoenger A. Sack S. Thormählen M. Marx A. Müller J. Gross H. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Studies of mutant KHCs may help us understand both the ATPase mechanism of kinesin and associated structural rearrangements that allow for efficient utilization of the energy generated through ATP hydrolysis. Moore et al. (20.Moore J.D. Song H. Endow S.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3306-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) determined that a point mutation in β6 of Ncd greatly reduces the affinity of the motor for microtubules and reduces the velocity of microtubule-based movement. Song and Endow (21.Song H.B. Endow S.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have shown that a point mutation in α4 of both Kar3 and Ncd uncouple the nucleotide and microtubule-binding sites, perhaps due to a break in Loop11-mediated communication between the two sites. Recent studies by Rice et al. (22.Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) have provided insight into structural changes that may allow for force generation and plus end-directed movement of KHC. They have shown that ATP binding promotes a large conformational change in the kinesin neck linker that is directed toward the plus end of the microtubule. These results with monomeric kinesin K349 emphasize that there are conformational transitions in the microtubule-bound kinesin dimer during ATP turnover that are beyond the view of current crystallography efforts. To gain insight into the mechanisms of kinesin mechanochemistryin vivo, we screened for recessive lethal mutations in the kinesin heavy chain (Khc) that disrupt axonal transport (1.Brendza K.M. Rose D.J. Gilbert S.P. Saxton W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31506-31514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,23.Saxton W.M. Hicks J. Goldstein L.S.B. Raff E.C. Cell. 1991; 64: 1093-1102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). One of the mutations found, Khc 4, causesin vivo phenotypes that suggest a nearly complete loss of function. Sequencing revealed that there is a threonine to methionine substitution at amino acid position 291, an almost completely conserved residue in the kinesin superfamily. 2Greene, E. A., and Henikoff, S., The kinesin home page. 2000.http://www.blocks.fhcrc.org/∼kinesin/. Thr291 is located in α-helix 5, which lies on the microtubule-binding surface of the motor domain. The steady-state ATPase kinetics showed that this mutation causes defects in both ATP and microtubule binding. The k cat is very similar to wild type, yet there is a 3-fold increase in bothK m, ATP andK 0.5, Mt (1.Brendza K.M. Rose D.J. Gilbert S.P. Saxton W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31506-31514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In an effort to determine more precisely how this mutation alters the ATPase cycle and consequently how Thr291 contributes to KHC mechanochemistry, we have pursued a mechanistic analysis of K401-4. The results provide direct evidence that ATP binding is significantly weakened by the T291M mutation and that the binding pocket has lost the ability to distinguish ATP from ADP. These data suggest that structural arrangements important for sensing the γ-phosphate have been disrupted. Furthermore, the kinetics indicate that the two motor domains of the mutant dimer are defective in their head-head communication. Thus, the T291M substitution allows the motor domains to work more independently rather than in the strictly coordinated fashion that is characteristic of kinesin. [α-32P]ATP (>3000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products; polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates (EM Science of Merck, 20 × 20 cm, plastic-backed) were from VWR Scientific (Bridgeport, NJ); Taxol (Taxus brevifolia) was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem; ATP, GTP, AMP-PNP, and S-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden); Bio-Rad Protein Assay, ovalbumin, IgG, and DEAE-Sephacel were from Bio-Rad. K401-4 was bacterially expressed, purified, and characterized as described previously (1.Brendza K.M. Rose D.J. Gilbert S.P. Saxton W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31506-31514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Six preparations of K401-4 were used in the experiments reported, and each was evaluated to determine the steady state parameters:k cat = 18 ± 0.6 s−1, K m, ATP = 224 ± 4.9 μm, and K 0.5, Mt= 3.6 ± 0.01 μm. All experiments reported were performed in ATPase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm potassium acetate) at 25 °C. Experiments were conducted at 42,000 rpm in a Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an An60Ti rotor. ATPase buffer was used at 24.7 °C. Velocity data were analyzed using DCDT+, version 1.12 (25.Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The reported weight average sedimentation coefficient values ( s20,w) obtained from DCDT+ are corrected for the solution density and viscosity (26.Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and are calculated by a weighted integration over the entire range of sedimentation coefficients covered by the g(s) distribution. To verify these results, the data were also analyzed with DCDT (27.Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) and, where appropriate, SVEDBERG, version 6.37 (28.Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Purified tubulin was cold-depolymerized and clarified the morning of each experiment. Microtubules were assembled by the addition of taxol to 20 μm. The microtubules were collected by centrifugation, and the microtubule pellet was resuspended in ATPase buffer plus 20 μm taxol to stabilize the microtubules (29.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For all of the experiments in which microtubules were present, 20 μm taxol was included to maintain the polymer state. The pre-steady-state kinetics of mantATP binding, mantADP release, K401 binding to microtubules, and detachment of K401 from microtubules were measured using a KinTek StopFlow Instrument (SF-2001, KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) at 25 °C in ATPase buffer. N-methylanthraniloyl fluorescence (mantATP and mantADP) was excited at 360 nm (mercury arc lamp) and detected after being passed through a 400-nm cut-off filter. mantATP binding data in Fig. 1 B were fit to the equation, kobs=k+1[mantATP]+k−1Equation 1 where k obs is the rate constant obtained from the exponential phase of the fluorescence change,k +1 defines the second order rate constant for mantATP binding, and k −1 corresponds to the observed rate constant of mantATP release as determined by they intercept. The dissociation kinetics of Mt·K401 complex and association kinetics of K401 with microtubules were determined by the change in turbidity monitored at 340 nm. All concentrations reported are final after mixing. For Fig. 3 B, the observed rate constants of microtubule association were fit to the equation, kobs=k+5[tubulin]+k−5Equation 2 where k obs is the rate constant obtained from the fast, exponential phase, k +5 defines the second order rate constant for microtubule association, andk −5 corresponds to the observed rate constant of motor dissociation as determined by the y intercept.Figure 3Kinetics of microtubule binding. 4 μm K401-4·ADP was rapidly mixed with varying concentrations of microtubules (2.5–12 μm), and turbidity was monitored in the stopped-flow apparatus. A, a representative stopped-flow record at 7 μm microtubules, which is the average of seven traces. The smooth line is the best fit of the data to a single exponential plus a linear term. The rate constant of the initial exponential phase is 70 ± 1.6 s−1. The second phase at a rate of 0.07 ± 0.001 s−1 is too slow to be considered on the pathway and is attributed to a conformational change after microtubule association. B, the rate constant from the initial fast phase of each transient was plotted as a function of microtubule concentration. The data were fit to Equation 2, the slope providing the apparent second order rate constant for microtubule association, k +5 = 8.2 ± 0.5 μm−1s−1, and the y intercept providingk −5 = 14.3 ± 3.7 s−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The pre-steady-state experiments to determine the rate constant of ATP hydrolysis were performed with a rapid chemical quenched-flow instrument (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) at 25 °C in ATPase buffer as described previously (30.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For each time point, a preformed Mt·K401 complex (10 μm K401, 25 μm tubulin, 20 μm taxol; final concentrations after mixing) was reacted with [α-32P]ATP for times ranging from 5 to 400 ms. The reaction mixture was then quenched with 4 n HCl and expelled from the instrument. Chloroform (100 μl) was added immediately to the reaction mix to denature the protein, followed by neutralization (pH 7–7.8) by the addition of 2 m Tris, 3m NaOH. The acid quench stops the reaction and denatures the protein; therefore, the product formed is the sum of three intermediates:K·[α-32P]ADP·Pi,K·[α-32P]ADP, and [α-32P]ADP released from the active site. The concentration of product ([α-32P]ADP) was plotted as a function of time, and the data were fit to the burst equation, Product=A∗[1−exp(−kbt)]+ksstEquation 3 where A is the amplitude of the burst, representing the formation of [α-32P]ADP·Pi at the active site; k b is the rate constant of the pre-steady-state burst; k ss is the rate constant of the linear phase, corresponding to steady-state turnover; andt is the time in seconds. All molecular modeling was performed on a Silicon Graphics workstation using UCSF MidasPlus Molecular Interactive Display and Simulation software (Computer Graphics Laboratory, University of California, San Francisco, CA). To explore the apparent weak binding of ATP by K401-4 revealed by the steady-stateK m, ATP (1.Brendza K.M. Rose D.J. Gilbert S.P. Saxton W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31506-31514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we began the pre-steady-state kinetic analysis by measuring the kinetics of ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis (Figs. 1 and2). For the ATP binding studies, the fluorescent ATP analog mantATP was used (Fig. 1). This analog has been used in previous characterizations of kinesin motors and has been shown experimentally to be a good ATP analog because of the fluorescence enhancement and similarity to ATP (31.Sadhu A. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11352-11359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). For K401-wt, the microtubule-activated steady-state k cat reported was 19 s−1 for both ATP and mantATP with the K m, ATP = 62 μm andK m, mantATP = 150 μm(32.Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The preformed Mt·K401-4 complex (30 μmmicrotubules, 10 μm K401-4) was rapidly mixed with varying concentrations of mantATP in the stopped-flow apparatus, and the change in fluorescence was monitored. A representative stopped-flow record is shown in Fig. 1 A. Binding of mantATP causes a biphasic fluorescence transient with a rapid exponential increase in fluorescence (associated with mantATP binding) followed by a significantly slower exponential decrease in fluorescence. The observed decrease in fluorescence is independent of substrate concentration (k obs = 3.1–3.8 s−1) and is not fast enough to be attributed to ATP hydrolysis. This biphasic fluorescence transient is characteristic of kinesin and has been observed by others (34.Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 800-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 36.Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The smooth line is the best fit of the data to a double exponential, providing k obsof the initial, fast reaction at 135 s−1. The rate of the fast exponential phase increased as a function of ATP concentration, and the data were fit to Equation 1 (Fig.1 B). The slope of the line provided the second order rate constant for mantATP binding, k +1 = 1 μm−1s−1, which is similar to the observed rate constant for K401-wt at 2 μm−1s−1 (30.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34.Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 800-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The y intercept predicts an off rate for mantATP with k −1 = 157 s−1. We next measured the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis for K401-4 through a series of acid quench experiments (Fig. 2). The preformed Mt·K401-4 complex (25 μm microtubules, 10 μm K401-4) was rapidly mixed with [α-32P]MgATP in the chemical quench instrument. Fig. 2 A shows the time course of ATP hydrolysis by K401-4 at six different ATP concentrations. Each transient was biphasic with an initial exponential rate of ADP·Piformation (the burst), followed by a slower rate of product formation (the linear phase) corresponding to steady-state turnover. The exponential burst of product formation at the active site indicates that a step after ATP hydrolysis is rate-limiting for K401-4 as observed for K401-wt (30.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). At high ATP concentrations, ATP binding becomes faster than ATP hydrolysis. Because substrate binding is no longer limiting, the maximum rate constant for the exponential burst phase is the rate constant of ATP hydrolysis. The rate constant for ATP hydrolysis (k +2 = 257 s−1) was determined by plotting the burst rates as a function of ATP concentration (Fig. 2 B) and fitting the data to a hyperbola. Note that the K401-4 rate constant (257 s−1) is significantly faster than the 100 s−1 rate constant observed for dimeric K401-wt ATP hydrolysis (30.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is interesting that a monomeric KHC motor domain (K341) also shows a rapid rate of ATP hydrolysis at >300 s−1 (35.Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For K401-4, theK d,ATP is 236 μm (Fig.2 B), which is equivalent to the steady-stateK m, ATP at 236 μm (1.Brendza K.M. Rose D.J. Gilbert S.P. Saxton W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31506-31514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Comparison of the K d, ATP for K401-wt at 60 μm (30.Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with theK d, ATP for K401-4 indicates that the mutant motor binds ATP much more weakly. The acid quench experiments provide direct evidence that the T291M mutation significantly weakens ATP binding and increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. We next looked at the rate of K401-4·ADP binding to the microtubule (Fig.3) to determine if a microtubule binding defect was indeed contributing to the abnormally highK 0.5, Mt measured through steady-state analysis (1.Brendza K.M. Rose D.J. Gilbert S.P. Saxton W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31506-31514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The rate of formation of the Mt·K401-4 complex was monitored by turbidity measurements in the stopped-flow instrument. K401-4·ADP (4 μm) was rapidly mixed with taxol-stabilized microtubules (7 μm), and the change in turbidity was recorded. In this experiment, an increase in turbidity was interpreted as binding of K401 to the microtubule. A representative stopped-flow record is shown in Fig. 3 A. The solid line is the best fit of the data to a single exponential function and a linear term, providing the k obs of the fast exponential phase at 70 s−1. Fig. 3 B shows that the observed rates of microtubule association increased linearly as a function of microtubule concentration. These data were fit to Equation2, the slope of which provides the apparent second order rate constant for binding k +5 = 8 μm−1s−1; this constant is somewhat less than K401-wt measured at 11–15 μm−1s−1 (15.Mandelkow E. Johnson K.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 429-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32.Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The y intercept predicts a significant off-rate (k −5 = 14 s−1), which was not seen for K401-wt (32.Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, the T291M mutation appears to weaken the binding between the KHC motor domains and the microtubule. We also measured the kinetics of ADP release from the Mt·K401-4·ADP intermediate (Fig.4) using mantADP. K401-4 was incubated with mantADP at a ratio of 4:1 to allow for exchange of ADP resident at the active site with mantADP. A preformed K401-4·mantADP complex (3 μm K401-4, 12 μm mantADP) was rapidly mixed with microtubules plus MgATP in the stopped-flow apparatus. As mantADP was released from the more hydrophobic environment of the active site into the aqueous buffer, its fluorescence was quenched. The MgATP (1 mm) present in solution blocked the subsequent rebinding of any mantADP to K401. Fig. 4 A shows a representative stopped-flow record. The solid line is the fit of the data to a single exponential function and a linear term, providing the k obs of the fast exponential reaction at 31 s−1. Fig. 4 B shows that the exponential rate constant associated with the fluorescence change upon mantADP release increased with increasing microtubule concentration. The fit of the data to a hyperbola provides a maximum rate constant of mantADP release, k +6 = 234 s−1 with a K 0.5, Mt at 34 μm. The rate constant of mantADP release is consistent with the fast ADP dissociation kinetics reported for K401-wt at 200–300 s−1 (32.Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), yet theK 0.5, Mt for K401-4 is larger than that for K401-wt (15 μm). These results are consistent with the interpretation that the T291M mutant protein requires a higher concentration of microtubules both for half-maximal activation of steady-state turnover at 3.6 versus 1 μm for K401-wt (1.Brendza K.M. Rose D.J. Gilbert S.P. Saxton W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31506-31514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and for mantADP release (34 versus 15 μm for K401-wt). The effects of the T291M mutation on ATP-promoted detachment of K401·ADP from the microtubule were examined by following changes in turbidity (Fig. 5). The preformed Mt·K401-4 complex (2.9 μm microtubules, 3 μm K401-4) was rapidly mixed with MgATP plus 100 mm KCl in the stopped-flow apparatus. In this experiment, a decrease in turbidity was interpreted as release of the motor from the microtubule. The addition of 100 mm KCl weakens rebinding of the motor to the microtubule after detachment to allow for accurate measurement of the dissociation kinetics (32.Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 A shows a representative stopped-flow record. The solid line is the best fit of the data to a double exponential, providing a k obs of the initial fast exponential phase at 49 s−1. Thek obs increased as a function of ATP concentration, and the fit of the data to a hyperbola provides a maximum rate constant of detachment, k +3 = 60 s−1 with a K 0.5, ATPof 280 μm (Fig. 5 B). ThisK 0.5, ATP is in agreement with both theK m, ATP at steady-state conditions (1.Brendza K.M. Rose D.J. Gilbert S.P. Saxton W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31506-31514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the K d,ATP determined by acid quench experiments (Fig. 2 B), reinforcing the interpretation that K401-4 binds ATP weakly. It is striking that for both K401-wt and a dimeric human KHC construct K379 (36.Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), this ATP-promoted dissociation step was observed at rates of 12–14 s−1, substantially slower than the 60 s−1 observed for K401-4. The motor domains of wild type dimeric KHC are coupled at this step such that ATP binding by the microtubule-attached motor domain stimulates microtubule binding of the partner motor domain and rapid release of its ADP (11.Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 12.Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 724-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166)"
https://openalex.org/W2068666227,"The HCMV IE2 protein negatively autoregulates its own expression as well as represses the transactivation activity of p53. Using the repression domain of IE2 as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, Nrf1 and Nrf2, members of the CNC-bZIP family, were found to be IE2-interacting proteins. Residues 331-448 encompassing the DNA-binding and the dimerization domains of Nrf1 are sufficient for the interaction. The interaction was further confirmed in vitro by a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay and in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation. In transient transfection studies, transcription driven by six copies of an NF-E2 site or by chimeric proteins between the DNA-binding domain of LexA and members of the CNC-bZIP family is repressed by IE2. Importantly, the DNA binding activity of the Nrf1/MafK heterodimer is not impeded by IE2. In a parallel study, CNC-bZIP factors attenuate the negative autoregulation of IE2. The attenuation could be explained by the finding that Nrf1 functions alone and synergistically with its heterodimerization partner, MafK, in inhibiting the DNA binding activity of IE2. Taken together, these results demonstrate the existence of antagonism between members of the CNC-bZIP family and IE2."
https://openalex.org/W2158152313,"Polycystic kidney disease is characterized by abnormal morphological development. Mechanisms that regulate cyst development may involve multiple signaling pathways. Cyst formation by Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in three-dimensional culture is assumed to be cyclic AMP-dependent and due to cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) activation based on pharmacological responsiveness. To determine if different cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathways are associated with morphological development, the role of cAMP in regulating morphological change was examined in MDCK clones that form tumor-like or tubular structures under basal conditions. Pharmacological cAMP pathway activators induce cyst formation and diminish formation of other structures in three clones, whereas one clone is unaffected. Tyrosine kinase-mediated morphogens have little effect. Although all clones have intact cAMP signaling pathways, each has a unique subcellular distribution of cAPK regulatory subunits. This may reflect distinct mechanisms for cAPK anchoring, allowing cAPK subtype regulation of the unique phenotypic character of each clone through preferential access to substrates. These observations suggest a molecular basis for differential cAMP responsiveness in cells that develop distinct morphological phenotypes. This evidence establishes these MDCK clones as models for understanding the mechanism and functional significance of cAPK subunit localization and may have broader implications for cystogenesis in polycystic kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W2076445655,"The mitochondrial respiratory chain inevitably produces reactive oxygen species as byproducts of aerobic ATP synthesis. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is located close to the respiratory chain, is reported to contain much more 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), an oxidatively modified guanine base, than nuclear DNA. Despite such a high amount of 8-oxoG in mtDNA (1–2 8-oxoG/10<sup>4</sup> G), mtDNA is barely cleaved by an 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase or MutM, which specifically excises 8-oxoG from a C:8-oxoG pair. We find here that about half of human mtDNA molecules are cleaved by another 8-oxoG-recognizing enzyme, an adenine DNA glycosylase or MutY, which excises adenine from an A:8-oxoG pair. The cleavage sites are mapped to adenines. The calculated number of MutY-sensitive sites in mtDNA is approximately 1.4/10<sup>4</sup> G. This value roughly corresponds with the electrochemically measured amount of 8-oxoG in mtDNA (2.2/10<sup>4</sup> G), raising the possibility that 8-oxoG mainly accumulates as an A:8-oxoG pair."
