https://openalex.org/W2012929970,"RNA isolated from the spleens of B(6)AF(1) mice immunized to sheep red blood cells was incubated with the spleen cells of nonimmunized mice. The number of antibody-forming cells detected by the Jerne plaque technique was significantly higher among the cells incubated with the RNA from immune animals than among cells incubated without RNA, or with RNA from nonimmune animals."

Inhibitor was detected as early as 3 hours after inoculation of brucellae and reached a peak between 6 and 12 hours."

https://openalex.org/W2056328021,"THE synthesis of hyaluronate and of collagen are two specialized functions of connective tissue cells. Hyaluronate has been shown to be produced by populations of cultured fibroblasts by Grossfeld et al.1, Morris2, Castor et al.3, and Davidson et al.4, and collagen synthesis has been examined in cultured explants containing fibroblasts by Fitton-Jackson and Smith5, Porter and Pappas6 and Yardley et al.7. Both products have been shown to be synthesized in embryo heart explants by Gaines8. It has not been possible to decide, however, whether individual fibroblasts exist as distinct fixed cell types10 specialized to form either polysaccharide or collagen9, or if the same fibroblast type may make both products, perhaps under different environmental conditions9."

https://openalex.org/W2022155921,"A diet deficient in iron causes a rapid, marked increase in iron absorption in rats. The increased absorption occurs in the absence of a significant change in iron stores as judged by the effect of an equivalent change in stores produced by phlebotomy, and in the absence of increased erythropoietic activity as judged by the rate of removal of iron-59 from the plasma."

https://openalex.org/W2044833493,"IN a recent paper1 comparative test results were presented regarding the antifungal and antibacterial activities of a series of fourth main group organometallic acetates. It was reported that Mycobacterium phlei is highly sensitive to several trialkylgermanium acetates of the general structure R3GeOOCCH3, wherein R is butyl, isobutyl, pentyl or isopentyl. A concentration of 2–5 µg/ml. caused complete suppression of visible growth."

These findings suggest that configurational differences or the absence of alpha chain dimers was responsible for the lack of binding of hemoglobins H and Bart's."

The inhibition by actinomycin D is blocked. Higher doses cause a complete inhibition from which a proportion of the glands recover rapidly upon withdrawal of the substance."
https://openalex.org/W2077855295,"The strontium-90 content of the biota near Cape Thompson, Alaska, was related to environmental factors. In plants, perennials with persistent aerial parts had maximum and similar concentrations of strontium-90. The content of caribou muscle varied seasonally and was highest in winter when lichens were an important caribou food."

https://openalex.org/W2064107857,"Studies of the simultaneous changes in the latency and amplitude of the b-wave of the rat electroretinogram (ERG) under three different conditions of adaptation show that the latency is primarily a function of the absolute stimulus intensity, being only slightly affected by conditions that strongly reduce the amplitude. This implies that the latency and the amplitude are determined by two independent processes, with the latency-process more closely linked to the initial photochemical events. Furthermore, the different adaptation conditions have surprisingly similar effects on the shape and amplitude of the electroretinogram, which suggests that they all produce only one type of variation in the amplitude-determining process."

https://openalex.org/W2016903386,"WE have already described1 the effects of indolyl-3-acetic acid (IAA) on the uptake of monovalent cations by segments of sunflower hypocotyl. These effects were highly specific with regard to cation. The auxin markedly inhibited the uptake of NH4+, while under the same conditions K+ uptake was strongly stimulated. Na+ uptake was not significantly affected. The IAA concentration was such that growth of the segments was promoted. We now wish to report that if sucrose is added to the external medium the IAA effects on cation uptake—both inhibitory and stimulatory—are largely abolished."

https://openalex.org/W2044109223,"USING three different methods, which all depend on dye reduction and the use of redox intermediates for the NADPH2 formed in the assay, Budtz-Olsen et al.1 have reported absence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-activity in erythrocytes of sheep and goats. We have been estimating G6PD in sheep erythrocytes by a method which is not dependent on dye reduction, and although the values are lower than in human beings, there is still appreciable activity."

https://openalex.org/W1977945652,"RECENT work has shown that morphine and other narcotic analgesic drugs depress the responses of certain autonomic neuro-effectors to stimulation of their nerves, for example, the cat's nictitating membrane, the rat's and rabbit's sino-auricular node, and the longitudinal muscle of the guinea pig ileum1–5. The inhibition is assumed to be presynaptic because the action of the transmitter, where it can be tested, is not depressed by morphine, and because there is no evidence to show that morphine inhibits impulse transmission in the nerve axons6,7."

https://openalex.org/W2076746477,"SO far, workers on the Triassic dicynodonts1–3 have not been able to indicate how this group originated. However, Camp2 has enumerated twelve characters which he thought would be present in their ancestor. Eleven of these characters are found in the Eo-triassic genus Lystrosaurus4. The twelfth, concerning the presence of a cleithral groove, has been shown5 to be not significant. The so-called cleithral grooves found on the scapulæ of Triassic dicynodonts can be better interpreted as pre-spinous fossæ."

https://openalex.org/W2001947843,"IT is now generally recognized that high-resolution dark-field electron microscopy is essential for a comprehensive study of inperfections in crystalline materials. However, commercial electron microscopes have not been designed in the past with this technique in mind, and consequently the amount of dark-field work that has been carried out to date is limited and has only been possible as a result of a considerable amount of perseverance on the part of the operator. Moreover, the operation has taken so long that injurious contamination of the specimen has occurred. A technique has now been developed here in co-operation with Associated Electrical Industries, Ltd., which allows a suitably modified E.M.6 electron microscope to be used with equal facility for high-resolution dark-field or light-field work."

https://openalex.org/W1978653640,"IN the development of growing plant cell suspensions from callus cultures, there is considerable cell agglomeration for the first 15–20 generations; under our growth conditions1 this represents 4–5 sub-cultures. The diameter of the cell agglomerates may be as high as 0.5 cm, thus transfer by pipette is difficult."
