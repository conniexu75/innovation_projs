PTEN possesses a C-terminal noncatalytic regulatory domain that contains multiple putative phosphorylation sites, which could play an important role in the control of its biological activity. The protein kinase CK2 phosphorylated, in a constitutive manner, a cluster of Ser/Thr residues located at the PTEN C terminus. PTEN-phosphorylated defective mutants showed decreased stability in comparison with wild type PTEN and were more rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Inhibition of PTEN phosphorylation by the CK2 inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole also diminished the PTEN protein content. Our results support the notion that proper phosphorylation of PTEN by CK2 is important for PTEN protein stability to proteasome-mediated degradation.

Mutations in the PTEN gene are present in a great number of tumors, as well as in the germ line cells of patients with several inherited cancer syndromes (reviewed in Refs. 12Myers M.P. Tonks N.K.

In this regard, the C-terminal region of PTEN has been shown to be important in the regulation of the stability and half-life of the molecule (14Georgescu M.-M. Kirsch K.H. Akagi T. Shishido T.

Also, the C-terminal PTEN amino acid sequence possesses a putative PDZ binding motif, which has been proposed to modulate PTEN functions by association to PDZ domain-containing proteins (16Morimoto A.M.

Finally, the C-terminal PTEN domain is rich in putative phosphorylation sites, and phosphorylation of the PTEN C terminus has been recently reported to affect PTEN protein stability and function (20Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-501820Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar); however, the kinase responsible for such phosphorylation remains unidentified.Protein kinase CK21 (formerly casein kinase II) is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed, messenger-independent serine/threonine-kinase that phosphorylates a wide variety of substrates involved in essential cell processes, including cell cycle and cell growth (21Pinna L.A.

In mammals, CK2 is a heterotetramer in vivo, composed of two catalytic (α and/or α′) and two regulatory (β) subunits. Alterations in CK2 expression have been found in distinct types of tumors (24Münstermann U. Fritz G. Seitz G. Yiping L. Schneider H.R. Issinger O.-G. Eur. J.

Also, antibody-mediated CK2 depletion inhibited cell cycle progression and growth of fibroblasts (32Lorenz P. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2733-2739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and CK2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment blocked neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells (33Ulloa L. Dı́az-Nido J. Ávila J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1633-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).In this report, we demonstrate that the C terminus of the tumor suppressor PTEN is constitutively phosphorylated by CK2 at several residues in intact cells. An insight is provided on the putative role of phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism of PTEN biological activity by modulating its stability to proteasome-mediated degradation.DISCUSSIONOn the basis that many CK2 substrates are oncogene products or tumor suppressor proteins as well as key signal transduction proteins, a role for CK2 in the regulation of cell growth- and cell cycle-related processes has been proposed (22Meisner H. Czech M.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence that the tumor suppressor phosphatase PTEN is phosphorylated by CK2 both in vitro and in intact cells. CK2 phosphorylation sites in PTEN were located within a C-terminal cluster of Ser/Thr residues, which were found to be important for PTEN stability to proteasome-mediated degradation. The CK2 phosphorylation sites were identified as the PTEN residues Ser-370, Ser-380, Thr-382, Thr-383, and Ser-385. Because some of these sites can be generated after previous phosphorylation of nearby residues, and because the phosphomimetic S370E/S385E mutant is phosphorylated more efficiently than the S370A/S385A mutant, hierarchic CK2 multisite phosphorylation of this region of PTEN is likely to exist (37Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several findings support the notion that CK2 is the major kinase involved in the phosphorylation of PTEN in intact cells. First, cell treatment with a panel of different stimuli did not substantially affect the phosphorylation of PTEN, suggesting that such phosphorylation is constitutive and messenger-independent, as is known for most CK2-mediated phosphorylations. Second, tyrosine phosphorylation was not detected on PTEN, suggesting that tyrosine kinases do not directly phosphorylate PTEN. Third, phosphorylation of PTEN by the kinase activity present in COS-7 cell extracts was activated or inhibited by CK2 activators or inhibitors, respectively. Fourth, phosphorylation of PTEN in intact COS-7 cells was inhibited by cell treatment with the CK2 inhibitor DRB. Fifth, mutation to Ala of the PTEN CK2-phosphorylation sites, as well as deletion of the C-terminal portion of PTEN including these sites, resulted in an almost complete lack of PTEN phosphorylation in intact cells. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that other kinase(s) not monitored in our assays, using overexpressed HA-PTEN in COS-7 cells, may contribute to the phosphorylation of endogenous PTEN in vivo. Remarkably, the CK2 phosphorylation sites in PTEN are conserved in species from mammals to Xenopus laevis, and clusters of putative CK2 phosphorylation sites are also present at the C terminus of PTEN from Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.We found that PTEN suffers a rapid degradation in COS-7 cells, which was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 but not by lysosome inhibitors, indicating that the turnover of PTEN in cultured COS-7 cells depends mainly on proteasome-mediated degradation. The involvement of the proteasome in the degradation and regulation of the functions of short-lived proteins, including oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, and cell cycle proteins has been described extensively (for reviews, see Refs. 38Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar, 39Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar, 40Lee D.H.L. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Thus, regulated degradation of PTEN via the proteasome could be envisaged as a major physiological mechanism that controls the amount of PTEN in specific cell types and tissues. In this context, it has been reported recently that C-terminal truncation mutants of PTEN have shorter half-lives than the wild type molecule (14Georgescu M.-M. Kirsch K.H. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10182-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 15Tolkacheva T. Chan A.M.-L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 680-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, we show that Ser/Thr to Ala amino acid mutations at the PTEN C terminus, leading to defective phosphorylation by CK2, accelerate the proteasome-mediated degradation of PTEN. However, a double Ser to Glu mutation (the S370E/S385E mutant), that mimicked constitutive CK2 phosphorylation of PTEN at these sites showed a degradation rate comparable with the wild type molecule. Furthermore, cell treatment with the CK2 inhibitor DRB, which inhibited PTEN constitutive phosphorylation, resulted in a diminution in PTEN protein content but only in the absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. While this manuscript was in preparation, Vazquez et al.(20Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-501820Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) also showed that phosphorylation of some of the PTEN C-terminal residues analyzed in our study regulate protein stability as well as PTEN-mediated G1 cell cycle arrest. Thus, constitutive phosphorylation of PTEN by CK2 may play a key role in the regulation of PTEN biological functions upon normal cell growth conditions.Our findings suggest that phosphorylation of the PTEN C terminus itself does not provide enough PTEN protein stability (see below) but rather could be important to acquire the proper, stable conformation of the PTEN C-terminal tail. For instance, it is well documented that phosphorylation of the C terminus of IκBα by CK2 affects the stability and constitutive turnover of this NF-κB regulator (41McElhinny J.A. Trushin S.A. Bren G.D. Chester N. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol.

Pass I. Orchiston E.A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, the possibility exists that phosphorylation of the C terminus of PTEN could modulate its subcellular location and function by affecting its association with regulatory and/or stabilizing molecules. In this regard, deletion of the C-terminal PDZ binding motif of PTEN results in the impairment of some PTEN cellular functions (16Morimoto A.M. Berson A.E. Fujii G.H. Teng D.H.-F. Tavtigian S.V. Bookstein R. Steck P.A. Bolen J.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Also, PTEN has been found to associate, through its PDZ binding motif, with PDZ domain-containing proteins, including hMAST205 and MAGUK scaffolding proteins (17Adey N.B. Huang L. Ormonde P.A. Baumgard M.L. Pero R. Byreddy D.V. Tavtigian S.V. Bartel P.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 35-37PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S. Do D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X-Y. Wood J. Ross C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21477-21485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MAGUKs might regulate the functions of PTEN through the assembly and stabilization of multiprotein signaling complexes at specific subcellular compartments, as known for other related PDZ-containing proteins (45Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that phosphorylation of the Thr-401 residue within the PDZ binding motif of PTEN could regulate its binding to PDZ-containing proteins (17Adey N.B. Huang L. Ormonde P.A. Baumgard M.L. Pero R. Byreddy D.V. Tavtigian S.V. Bartel P.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 35-37PubMed Google Scholar). However, our results suggest that the PTEN Thr-401 residue is not phosphorylated in vivo. Mutations that did not abrogate PTEN phosphorylation, but are predicted to disrupt the association with PDZ-containing proteins (PTEN-(1–386) and T401A mutant), also diminished the stability of PTEN (data not shown), favoring the hypothesis of a putative role for phosphorylation by CK2 in PTEN stabilization through protein association. Frame-shift mutations at the end of the PTEN coding region have been found in tumors, indicating that such mutations could produce C-terminal truncated PTEN molecules with altered tumor suppressor function (13Ali I.U. Schriml L.M. Dean M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 9: 1922-1932Crossref Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by using anti-PTEN antibodies, variable expression levels of PTEN protein are detected in tumor specimens as compared with normal tissues (46Perren A. Weng L.-P. Boag A.H. Ziebold U.

Cancer. 2001; 37: 114-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting that mechanisms other than loss of the PTEN gene may account for alterations on PTEN protein expression in some tumors. The results presented here provide evidence that the CK2 phosphorylation sites contained within the C terminus of PTEN play an important role in its stabilization and turnover, in a process mediated by the proteasome. Our findings support a model in which changes in the phosphorylation status of the C terminus of PTEN might alter the basal expression levels of this tumor suppressor. In this regard, we have not detected dephosphorylation of PTEN after incubation with crude cell extracts, and PTEN phosphorylation status did not change upon cell incubation with the PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid (Fig.2). 2J. Torres and R. Pulido, unpublished observations. The possibility exists that dephosphorylation of PTEN takes place only under particular conditions of activation of an unidentified phosphatase and/or under specific subcellular location of PTEN. Further work will be necessary to ascertain whether regulated dephosphorylation events could affect PTEN phosphorylation and function in vivo.

Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-501820Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar); however, the kinase responsible for such phosphorylation remains unidentified. Protein kinase CK21 (formerly casein kinase II) is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed, messenger-independent serine/threonine-kinase that phosphorylates a wide variety of substrates involved in essential cell processes, including cell cycle and cell growth (21Pinna L.A.

In mammals, CK2 is a heterotetramer in vivo, composed of two catalytic (α and/or α′) and two regulatory (β) subunits. Alterations in CK2 expression have been found in distinct types of tumors (24Münstermann U. Fritz G. Seitz G. Yiping L. Schneider H.R. Issinger O.-G. Eur. J.

Also, antibody-mediated CK2 depletion inhibited cell cycle progression and growth of fibroblasts (32Lorenz P. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2733-2739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and CK2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment blocked neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells (33Ulloa L. Dı́az-Nido J. Ávila J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1633-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the C terminus of the tumor suppressor PTEN is constitutively phosphorylated by CK2 at several residues in intact cells. An insight is provided on the putative role of phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism of PTEN biological activity by modulating its stability to proteasome-mediated degradation. DISCUSSIONOn the basis that many CK2 substrates are oncogene products or tumor suppressor proteins as well as key signal transduction proteins, a role for CK2 in the regulation of cell growth- and cell cycle-related processes has been proposed (22Meisner H. Czech M.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence that the tumor suppressor phosphatase PTEN is phosphorylated by CK2 both in vitro and in intact cells. CK2 phosphorylation sites in PTEN were located within a C-terminal cluster of Ser/Thr residues, which were found to be important for PTEN stability to proteasome-mediated degradation. The CK2 phosphorylation sites were identified as the PTEN residues Ser-370, Ser-380, Thr-382, Thr-383, and Ser-385. Because some of these sites can be generated after previous phosphorylation of nearby residues, and because the phosphomimetic S370E/S385E mutant is phosphorylated more efficiently than the S370A/S385A mutant, hierarchic CK2 multisite phosphorylation of this region of PTEN is likely to exist (37Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several findings support the notion that CK2 is the major kinase involved in the phosphorylation of PTEN in intact cells. First, cell treatment with a panel of different stimuli did not substantially affect the phosphorylation of PTEN, suggesting that such phosphorylation is constitutive and messenger-independent, as is known for most CK2-mediated phosphorylations. Second, tyrosine phosphorylation was not detected on PTEN, suggesting that tyrosine kinases do not directly phosphorylate PTEN. Third, phosphorylation of PTEN by the kinase activity present in COS-7 cell extracts was activated or inhibited by CK2 activators or inhibitors, respectively. Fourth, phosphorylation of PTEN in intact COS-7 cells was inhibited by cell treatment with the CK2 inhibitor DRB. Fifth, mutation to Ala of the PTEN CK2-phosphorylation sites, as well as deletion of the C-terminal portion of PTEN including these sites, resulted in an almost complete lack of PTEN phosphorylation in intact cells. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that other kinase(s) not monitored in our assays, using overexpressed HA-PTEN in COS-7 cells, may contribute to the phosphorylation of endogenous PTEN in vivo. Remarkably, the CK2 phosphorylation sites in PTEN are conserved in species from mammals to Xenopus laevis, and clusters of putative CK2 phosphorylation sites are also present at the C terminus of PTEN from Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.We found that PTEN suffers a rapid degradation in COS-7 cells, which was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 but not by lysosome inhibitors, indicating that the turnover of PTEN in cultured COS-7 cells depends mainly on proteasome-mediated degradation. The involvement of the proteasome in the degradation and regulation of the functions of short-lived proteins, including oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, and cell cycle proteins has been described extensively (for reviews, see Refs. 38Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar, 39Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar, 40Lee D.H.L. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Thus, regulated degradation of PTEN via the proteasome could be envisaged as a major physiological mechanism that controls the amount of PTEN in specific cell types and tissues. In this context, it has been reported recently that C-terminal truncation mutants of PTEN have shorter half-lives than the wild type molecule (14Georgescu M.-M. Kirsch K.H. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10182-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 15Tolkacheva T. Chan A.M.-L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 680-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, we show that Ser/Thr to Ala amino acid mutations at the PTEN C terminus, leading to defective phosphorylation by CK2, accelerate the proteasome-mediated degradation of PTEN. However, a double Ser to Glu mutation (the S370E/S385E mutant), that mimicked constitutive CK2 phosphorylation of PTEN at these sites showed a degradation rate comparable with the wild type molecule. Furthermore, cell treatment with the CK2 inhibitor DRB, which inhibited PTEN constitutive phosphorylation, resulted in a diminution in PTEN protein content but only in the absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. While this manuscript was in preparation, Vazquez et al.(20Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-501820Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) also showed that phosphorylation of some of the PTEN C-terminal residues analyzed in our study regulate protein stability as well as PTEN-mediated G1 cell cycle arrest. Thus, constitutive phosphorylation of PTEN by CK2 may play a key role in the regulation of PTEN biological functions upon normal cell growth conditions.Our findings suggest that phosphorylation of the PTEN C terminus itself does not provide enough PTEN protein stability (see below) but rather could be important to acquire the proper, stable conformation of the PTEN C-terminal tail. For instance, it is well documented that phosphorylation of the C terminus of IκBα by CK2 affects the stability and constitutive turnover of this NF-κB regulator (41McElhinny J.A. Trushin S.A. Bren G.D. Chester N. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol.

Pass I. Orchiston E.A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, the possibility exists that phosphorylation of the C terminus of PTEN could modulate its subcellular location and function by affecting its association with regulatory and/or stabilizing molecules. In this regard, deletion of the C-terminal PDZ binding motif of PTEN results in the impairment of some PTEN cellular functions (16Morimoto A.M. Berson A.E. Fujii G.H. Teng D.H.-F. Tavtigian S.V. Bookstein R. Steck P.A. Bolen J.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Also, PTEN has been found to associate, through its PDZ binding motif, with PDZ domain-containing proteins, including hMAST205 and MAGUK scaffolding proteins (17Adey N.B. Huang L. Ormonde P.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21477-21485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MAGUKs might regulate the functions of PTEN through the assembly and stabilization of multiprotein signaling complexes at specific subcellular compartments, as known for other related PDZ-containing proteins (45Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that phosphorylation of the Thr-401 residue within the PDZ binding motif of PTEN could regulate its binding to PDZ-containing proteins (17Adey N.B. Huang L. Ormonde P.A. Baumgard M.L. Pero R. Byreddy D.V. Tavtigian S.V. Bartel P.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 35-37PubMed Google Scholar). However, our results suggest that the PTEN Thr-401 residue is not phosphorylated in vivo. Mutations that did not abrogate PTEN phosphorylation, but are predicted to disrupt the association with PDZ-containing proteins (PTEN-(1–386) and T401A mutant), also diminished the stability of PTEN (data not shown), favoring the hypothesis of a putative role for phosphorylation by CK2 in PTEN stabilization through protein association. Frame-shift mutations at the end of the PTEN coding region have been found in tumors, indicating that such mutations could produce C-terminal truncated PTEN molecules with altered tumor suppressor function (13Ali I.U. Schriml L.M. Dean M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 9: 1922-1932Crossref Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by using anti-PTEN antibodies, variable expression levels of PTEN protein are detected in tumor specimens as compared with normal tissues (46Perren A. Weng L.-P. Boag A.H. Ziebold U.

Cancer. 2001; 37: 114-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting that mechanisms other than loss of the PTEN gene may account for alterations on PTEN protein expression in some tumors. The results presented here provide evidence that the CK2 phosphorylation sites contained within the C terminus of PTEN play an important role in its stabilization and turnover, in a process mediated by the proteasome. Our findings support a model in which changes in the phosphorylation status of the C terminus of PTEN might alter the basal expression levels of this tumor suppressor. In this regard, we have not detected dephosphorylation of PTEN after incubation with crude cell extracts, and PTEN phosphorylation status did not change upon cell incubation with the PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid (Fig.2). 2J. Torres and R. Pulido, unpublished observations. The possibility exists that dephosphorylation of PTEN takes place only under particular conditions of activation of an unidentified phosphatase and/or under specific subcellular location of PTEN. Further work will be necessary to ascertain whether regulated dephosphorylation events could affect PTEN phosphorylation and function in vivo. On the basis that many CK2 substrates are oncogene products or tumor suppressor proteins as well as key signal transduction proteins, a role for CK2 in the regulation of cell growth- and cell cycle-related processes has been proposed (22Meisner H.

We report here the identification of a functional IL-TIF receptor complex that consists of two receptor chains, the orphan CRF2-9 and IL-10R2, the second chain of the IL-10 receptor complex. Expression of the CRF2-9 chain in monkey COS cells renders them sensitive to IL-TIF. However, in hamster cells both chains, CRF2-9 and IL-10R2, must be expressed to assemble the functional IL-TIF receptor complex. The CRF2-9 chain (or the IL-TIF-R1 chain) is responsible for Stat recruitment. Substitution of the CRF2-9 intracellular domain with the IFN-γR1 intracellular domain changes the pattern of IL-TIF-induced Stat activation. The CRF2-9 gene is expressed in normal liver and kidney, suggesting a possible role for IL-TIF in regulating gene expression in these tissues. Each chain, CRF2-9 and IL-10R2, is capable of binding IL-TIF independently and can be cross-linked to the radiolabeled IL-TIF. However, binding of IL-TIF to the receptor complex is greater than binding to either receptor chain alone. Sharing of the common IL-10R2 chain between the IL-10 and IL-TIF receptor complexes is the first such case for receptor complexes with chains belonging to the class II cytokine receptor family, establishing a novel paradigm for IL-10-related ligands similar to the shared use of the gamma common chain (γc) by several cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15.

The CRF2-9 gene is expressed in normal liver and kidney, suggesting a possible role for IL-TIF in regulating gene expression in these tissues. Each chain, CRF2-9 and IL-10R2, is capable of binding IL-TIF independently and can be cross-linked to the radiolabeled IL-TIF. However, binding of IL-TIF to the receptor complex is greater than binding to either receptor chain alone. Sharing of the common IL-10R2 chain between the IL-10 and IL-TIF receptor complexes is the first such case for receptor complexes with chains belonging to the class II cytokine receptor family, establishing a novel paradigm for IL-10-related ligands similar to the shared use of the gamma common chain (γc) by several cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. interleukin-10 signal transducers and activators of transcription peripheral blood mononuclear cells lipopolysaccharide IL-10-related T cell-derived inducible factor interferon polymerase chain reaction major histocompatibility complex electrophoretic mobility shift assay polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis peptide:N-glycosidase F cytomegalovirus-encoded IL-10 Six new ligands with limited sequence homology (19–27% identity) to IL-101 have been recently identified (1Dumoutier L.

One of these IL-10 homologs is a viral protein, whereas others are encoded in the genome. Cytomegalovirus-encoded IL-10, designated cmvIL-10 (5Kotenko S.V. Saccani S. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1695-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), demonstrates only 27% identity to human IL-10. Despite this limited homology, cmvIL-10 binds to and signals through the canonical IL-10 receptor complex (5Kotenko S.V. Saccani S. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Another IL-10 homolog was cloned as a protein whose expression is elevated in terminally differentiated human melanoma cells and was designated mda-7, for melanoma differentiation-associated gene 7 (3Jiang H. Lin J.J. Su Z.Z. Goldstein N.I. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2477-2486PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the rat mda-7 analog was linked to wound healing (8Soo C. Shaw W.W. Freymiller E. Longaker M.T. Bertolami C.N. Chiu R. Tieu A. Ting K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (the protein was designated c49a) and to ras transformation (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (the protein was designated mob-5). The expression of rat mda-7 (c49a) was localized primarily to fibroblast-like cells at the wound edge and base. During wound healing the level of c49a mRNA was transiently elevated 9- to 12-fold above unwounded controls (8Soo C. Shaw W.W. Freymiller E. Longaker M.T. Bertolami C.N. Chiu R. Tieu A. Ting K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of rat mda-7 (mob-5) was demonstrated to be induced by expression of oncogenicras. Moreover, mob-5 and its putative receptor are oncogenicras-specific targets; mob-5 binds to the cell surface ofras-transformed cells but not of parental untransformed cells (9Zhang R. Tan Z. Liang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24436-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Another IL-10 homolog, designated ak155, was cloned as a protein expressed by Herpesvirus saimiri-transformed T lymphocytes (4Knappe A. Hor S. Wittmann S. Fickenscher H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3881-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Transcription of the gene of a fourth IL-10 homolog, designated IL-19, was demonstrated to be induced in monocytes by LPS treatment. The appearance of IL-19 mRNA in LPS-stimulated monocytes coincided with the expression of IL-10 mRNA (2Gallagher G. Dickensheets H. Eskdale J. Izotova L.S. Mirochnitchenko O.V. Peat J.D. Pestka S. Vazquez N. Donnelly R.P. Kotenko S.V. Genes Immun. 2000; 1: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). An additional protein with homology to IL-10 was designated Zcyto10 (GenBank™ accession number AF224266), but there is no published information available about its activities or expression. Finally, an IL-10 homolog, designated IL-TIF (IL-10-related T cell-derived inducible factor), is expressed by IL-9-treated murine T cells (1Dumoutier L. Louahed J. Renauld J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1814-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Its human analog (human IL-TIF or, provisionally, IL-22) was recently reported (10Dumoutier L. Van Roost E. Colau D. Renauld J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10144-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 11Xie M.H. Aggarwal S. Ho W.H. Foster J. Zhang Z. Stinson J. Wood W.I. Goddard A.D. Gurney A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31335-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Murine IL-TIF expression can be induced by IL-9 in thymic lymphomas, T cells, and mast cells in vitroand by LPS in various organs in vivo. It was also demonstrated that IL-TIF injection induced production of acute-phase reactants in mouse liver, suggesting involvement of IL-TIF in the inflammatory response (10Dumoutier L. Van Roost E. Colau D. Renauld J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10144-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). IL-TIF can induce activation of Stat proteins (Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5) in several cell lines, including mesangial MES13, neuronal PC12, and hepatoma HepG2 cell lines (1Dumoutier L. Louahed J. Renauld J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1814-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 10Dumoutier L. Van Roost E. Colau D. Renauld J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10144-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In addition, there are data linking IL-TIF to allergy and asthma. IL-TIF is induced by IL-9, a Th2 cytokine active on T and B lymphocytes, mast cells, and eosinophils, and potentially involved in allergy and asthma (12Temann U.A. Geba G.P. Rankin J.A. Flavell R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1307-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 13Levitt R.C. McLane M.P. MacDonald D. Ferrante V. Weiss C. Zhou T. Holroyd K.J. Nicolaides N.C. J. Allergy Clin.

Holroyd K.J. Levitt R.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The IL-TIF gene (and also the ak155 gene) is located on human chromosome 12q, where several loci potentially linked to asthma and atopy have been identified by genetic studies, particularly in the 12q13.12-q23.3 region (for review see Ref. 15Cookson W. Nature. 2000; 402s (11.): B5-9BGoogle Scholar). The strongest evidence for linkage is in a region near the gene encoding IFN-γ (16Barnes K.C. Freidhoff L.R. Nickel R. Chiu Y.F. Juo S.H. Hizawa N.

Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1999; 118: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the gene for IFN-γ appears to be highly conserved (no sequence variations were detected in 265 individuals), suggesting that mutations of the IFN-γ gene are unlikely to be a significant cause of inherited asthma (20Hayden C. Pereira E. Rye P. Palmer L. Gibson N. Palenque M. Hagel I. Lynch N. Goldblatt J. Lesouëf P. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1997; 27: 1412-1416PubMed Google Scholar). The IL-TIF and ak155 genes are positioned next to the IFN-γ gene on the bacterial artificial chromosome BAC RPCI11–444B24 (GenBank™ accession numberAC007458) and, thus, are possible candidates for linkage to asthma. Cytokines exert their actions by binding to specific cell surface receptors that leads to the activation of cytokine-specific signal transduction pathways. The functional IL-10 receptor complex consists of two chains (6Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Wu W. Pestka S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5894-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), the ligand binding IL-10R1 subunit (21Liu Y. Wei S.H. Ho A.S. de Waal M. Moore K.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1821-1829PubMed Google Scholar) and the second IL-10R2 subunit that supports signaling through the IL-10R1 chain (6Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Wu W. Pestka S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5894-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Both chains belong to the class II cytokine receptor family (22Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which also includes two receptor chains for type I interferons (IFNs), two receptor chains for type II IFN, and the tissue factor that binds coagulation factor VIIa (for review see Ref. 24Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2557-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, there are currently at least five orphan receptors CRF2-8, CRF2-9, CRF2-10, CRF2-11, and CRF2-12 (cytokinereceptor family class II members) and the extracellular domains of CRF2-8, CRF2-9, and CRF2-10 are mostly homologous to the IL-10R1 extracellular domain (24Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2557-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). 2S. V. Kotenko and S. Pestka, unpublished data. In this study we demonstrate that the functional IL-TIF receptor complex consists of two receptor chains, the orphan CRF2-9 chain and the IL-10R2 chain, which we demonstrate to be a common shared chain between the IL-TIF and the IL-10 receptor complexes. Primers 5′-CCGGTACCAATGGCCGCCCTGCAGAAATCTG-3′ and 5′-GCGAATTCAAATGCAGGCATTTCTCAG-3′ (tif1) and total RNA isolated from PBMCs obtained from a healthy donor were used for reverse transcription-PCR to clone the human IL-TIF cDNA into plasmid pcDEF3 (25Goldman L.A.

The PCR product obtained with primers 5′-CCGGATCCACAGGGAGGAGCAGCTGCGCCC-3′ (tif2) and tif1 and plasmid pEF-IL-TIF as a template was digested with BamHI andEcoRI restriction endonucleases and cloned into corresponding sites of the pEF-SPFL vector (5Kotenko S.V.

This plasmid encodes IL-TIF tagged at its N terminus with the FLAG epitope (FL-IL-TIF). The PCR product obtained with primers tif2 and 5′-CCGAATTCATGCGACTGACGCTCGTCGAATGCAGGCATTTCTCAGAGAC-3′ and plasmid pEF-IL-TIF as a template was digested with BamHI andEcoRI restriction endonucleases and cloned into corresponding sites of the pEF-SPFL vector, resulting in plasmid pEF-SPFL-IL-TIF-P. This plasmid encodes FL-IL-TIF tagged at its C terminus with the Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Val-Ala sequence (FL-IL-TIF-P), which contains the consensus amino acid sequence recognizable by the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (26Kemp B.E.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2557-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) into plasmid pEF3-IL-10R1/γR1 with the use of KpnI and NheI restriction endonucleases, resulting in plasmid pEF-CRF2-9/γR1. Primers 5′-GGCGCTAGCCTCCGGAGCCTTCCTGTTCTCCATG-3′ and 5′-CCGAATTCAGGACTCCCACTGCCAGTCAG-3′ and the same library were used for PCR to clone the CRF2-9 intracellular domain into plasmid pEF-CRF2-9/γR1 with the use of NheI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases, resulting in plasmid pEF-CRF2-9. A “tandem vector” encoding two receptors, the CRF2-9/γR1 and the IL-10R2 chains, in which the expression of each receptor is controlled by separate promoters and polyadenylation signals was created as follows. The fragment containing the EF-1α promoter, the IL-10R2 coding sequence, and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal was released from the pEF-CRF (or pEF-IL-10R2) vector (6Kotenko S.V.

The resulting plasmid was designated pEF-CRF2-9/γR1+IL-10R2. The nucleotide sequences of the modified regions of all constructs were verified in their entirety by DNA sequencing. The 16-9 hamster x human somatic cell hybrid line is the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO-K1) hybrid containing a translocation of the long arm of human chromosome 6 encoding the human IFNGR1 (Hu-IFN-γR1) gene and a transfected human HLA-B7 gene (30Soh J.

COS cell supernatants were collected at 72 h as a source of the expressed proteins. Leukocytes were obtained from a normal donor by leukapheresis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were then isolated by density centrifugation with polysucrose and sodium diatrizoate according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol (Sigma, HISTOPAQUE-1077). To detect cytokine-induced MHC class I antigen (HLA-B7) expression, cells were treated with COS cell supernatants or purified recombinant proteins as indicated in the text for 72 h and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell surface expression of the HLA-B7 antigen was detected by treatment with mouse anti-HLA (W6/32) (31Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. Brown G. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams A.F. Ziegler A.

Three days after transfection, conditioned media from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids was collected and subjected to Western blotting with anti-FLAG epitope-specific M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) as described (5Kotenko S.V.

Northern blotting was performed with two blots (CLONTECH, catalog nos. 7757-1 and 7780-1) and a CRF2-9 probe corresponding to the coding region of the CRF2-9 cDNA as described (2Gallagher G.

The RNA loading was adjusted by the manufacturer with a β-actin signal. The FL-IL-TIF-P protein was transiently expressed in COS cells and purified from conditioned media by immunoaffinity chromatography with the anti-FLAG M1 gel (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocols. FL-IL-TIF-P was labeled with [32P]ATP and used for cross-linking as described (28Li B.L. Langer J.A. Schwartz B. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Human IL-TIF (IL-21) (GenBank™ accession no.AJ277247) is a cytokine with limited homology to IL-10 (10Dumoutier L. Van Roost E. Colau D. Renauld J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Three expression vectors were created (Fig.1 A) encoding intact human IL-TIF, N-terminal FLAG-tagged IL-TIF (FL-IL-TIF), or FL-IL-TIF with the consensus amino acid sequence Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Val-Ala (phosphorylatable site, P), recognizable by the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (26Kemp B.E.

COS cells were transiently transfected with the expression vectors, and 3 days later conditioned media containing FL-IL-TIF or FL-IL-TIF-P were tested by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody for protein expression (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3and 4). Western blotting revealed that FL-IL-TIF was secreted from COS cells and migrated on the SDS-PAGE gel as several bands in the region of about 25–40 kDa, suggesting possible glycosylation of the protein. Indeed, there are three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation (Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser) in human IL-TIF. Treatment of the conditioned media with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) resulted in the disappearance of the higher bands and enhancement of a band in the region of 21 kDa (Fig. 1 B, lane 4), consistent with glycosylation of the 25–40 kDa proteins. FL-IL-TIF-P, purified by affinity column chromatography, was also analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). The32P-labeled FL-IL-TIF-P ([32P]FL-IL-TIF-P) was also resolved on the gel and autoradiographed (Fig. 1 B,lane 6). Human IL-10 tagged with the FLAG epitope at the N terminus and with the phosphorylation site at the C terminus was used as a control (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). CRF2-9 is an orphan human receptor from the class II cytokine receptor family as shown in Fig. 1 D (24Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2557-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We constructed expression vectors encoding intact CRF2-9 and a chimeric CRF2-9/γR1 receptor that has the CRF2-9 extracellular domain fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the human IFN-γR1 chain (Fig.1 C). The previously constructed pEF-CRF (or pEF-IL-10R2) vector (6Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Wu W. Pestka S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5894-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) was also utilized in this study. In addition, to express both receptor chains in a single transfected cell the tandem vector encoding two receptors, the CRF2-9/γR1 and the IL-10R2 chains, in which expression of each receptor is controlled by separate set of promoter and polyadenylation signal was constructed. COS cells were transfected with the expression plasmid encoding CRF2-9, and transfectants were selected by growth in 350 μg/ml G418 for 3 weeks and pooled. To test for responsiveness to IL-TIF, pooled cells were treated with conditioned media from COS cells expressing FL-IL-TIF or left untreated as control, and the detergent-free total cellular lysates were prepared for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). The formation of Stat DNA-binding complexes was detected in FL-IL-TIF-treated COS cells transfected with the plasmid expressing the CRF2-9 chain and not in untreated cells or in FL-IL-TIF-treated control COS cells transfected with the blank expression vector (Fig.2). The DNA-binding complexes (Fig. 2) were shown to consist mainly of two Stats with anti-Stat1 and anti-Stat3 antibodies: Stat1α and Stat3. Thus, the pattern of IL-TIF-induced Stat DNA-binding complexes observed in COS cells expressing CRF2-9 correlates with the pattern of Stat activation demonstrated for IL-TIF signaling in PC-12 or MES-13 cells (1Dumoutier L. Louahed J. Renauld J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1814-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). COS cells were also stably transfected with an expression vector encoding the chimeric CRF2-9/γR1 receptor with the CRF2-9 extracellular domain fused to the transmembrane and the intracellular domains of the IFN-γR1 chain (Fig. 1 C). This chimeric receptor was made to enable us to detect IFN-γ-like biological activities induced by IL-TIF. Because IL-TIF-specific biological activities are not well characterized and may be restricted to specific cell types, and because we expect that the CRF2-9 receptor complex structurally mimics the IL-10 receptor complex, we followed the same approach that was used to create the chimeric IL-10-IFN-γ receptor complex (6Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Wu W. Pestka S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5894-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We predicted that, in cells expressing the chimeric CRF2-9/γR1 receptor, IL-TIF would induce IFN-γ-specific biological activities. As expected, in COS cells expressing the chimeric CRF2-9/γR1 chain, IL-TIF treatment induced activation of Stat1 DNA-binding complexes as demonstrated by EMSA with anti-Stat1 antibody (Fig. 2). We hypothesized that the IL-TIF receptor complex might be structurally homologous to the IL-10 receptor complex, and to consist of two receptor chains with one common chain shared between these two receptor complexes. It has been demonstrated that, in hamster cells, unlike COS cells, hamster IL-10R2 failed to support signaling by the human IL-10R1 chain (6Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Wu W. Pestka S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5894-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar situation holds for the human IL-TIF receptor complex expressed in hamster cells, hamster cells were transfected with the chimeric CRF2-9/γR1 receptor. In these cells IL-TIF treatment failed to induce Stat activation (Fig. 2) or MHC class I antigen expression (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, hamster cells transfected with the tandem vector encoding both the CRF2-9/γR1 and the IL-10R2 chains responded to IL-TIF treatment by activation of Stat1 DNA-binding complexes (Fig. 2) and up-regulation of MHC class I antigen expression (Fig. 3 D). Parental hamster cells and cells expressing the human IL-10R2 chain (6Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Izotova L.S. Pollack B.P. Wu W. Pestka S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5894-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) did not respond to the IL-TIF treatment (Figs. 2, 3 A, and 3 C). F"

Inhibitor experiments show that the effects of exogenous DAD expression are dependent upon cellular Dia proteins. Alanine substitution of DAD consensus residues that disrupt GBD binding also eliminate DAD biological activity.

This study identifies a new homology domain unique to the Diaphanous-related FH family members termed the Dia-autoregulatory domain or DAD.

Other actin-binding factors EF1α and Bud6p/Aip3p associate with Bni1p through other regions (16Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M.

Expression of ΔGBD-mDia1 and -mDia2 in fibroblasts activates a Rho-regulated signaling pathway that leads to the activation of theserum response factor (SRF) transcriptional regulator in the nucleus (18Tominaga T.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). The activated Dia proteins also cooperate with another small GTPase effector, Rho-kinase or ROCK, to induce stress fibers (11Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 18Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2481-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These truncation experiments suggest that the GTPase binding domain of the DRFs contains a negative regulatory activity. Many signaling molecules contain autoregulatory domains. For example, p21-activated kinase (PAK1) (30Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Wierenga R.K. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The PAK1 autoinhibitory domain is adjacent to the CRIB domain (31Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28191-28198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and this association is regulated by binding to activated Cdc42. A similar observation has been made for the Cdc42-binding Wiskott-Aldrichsyndrome protein (WASP) (34Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Kim et al. demonstrated that the amino-terminal CRIB domain of WASP is a bifunctional autoinhibitory and GTPase binding domain (33Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). It binds to the carboxyl-terminal verprolin,cofilin acidic (VCA) region located in the carboxyl terminus. Upon binding to Cdc42, the CRIB domain releases the carboxyl terminus, and the exposed VCA region of WASP functions as an effector by direct binding to the Arp2/3 actin-nucleating complex (35Welch M.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 423-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism has been proposed for the Dia-related proteins (11Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of mDia1 has been shown to interact with the carboxyl terminus in a manner that is disrupted by activated Rho binding to the GBD. Here, a conserved carboxyl-terminal autoregulatory domain, termed DAD, that facilitates intramolecular binding is identified. When exogenously expressed in cells, DAD is a potent activator of the cellular complement of DRFs and causes the induction of both cytoskeletal remodeling and the SRF signaling. NIH 3T3 cells grown on glass coverslips were maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) until 24 h prior to microinjection when cells were changed to medium containing 0.1% (v/v) FCS. The NIH 3T3 SRE-FosHA reporter cell line HA13 was used in all SRE gene expression studies (36Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Cells were microinjected with pulled-glass capillaries using an Eppendorf 5171 semi-automated injection system as described previously (18Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Purified plasmid DNA expression vectors were microinjected at a concentration of 10 μg/ml each in a buffer of phosphate-buffered saline/dH20 (1:1), unless indicated otherwise. Empty vector (pEFm) was included in experiments to normalize injected DNA concentrations when necessary. For fluorescent detection experiments, cells were fixed 3 h after microinjection with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) prior to staining. SRE-regulated FosHA staining was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using primary rabbit anti-HA antisera (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by aminomethyl coumarin acetate (AMCA)-coupled anti-rabbit (Jackson). Filamentous actin was monitored in cells by staining with TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). After staining, coverslips were mounted in gelvatol. Fluorescent images were captured with a digital camera (SPOT R100, Diagnostics) mounted on a Nikon E400 epifluorescence microscope using fixed exposure times with either × 40 or × 100 magnification (1.4 NA) where indicated. Images were saved as TIFF files and assembled into figures using Clarisdraw. mDia1, mDia2, and various domain expression constructs were made in pEFm (courtesy of R. Marais), pEFHA, pEFmEGFP, pT7-plink, pGEX-KG, and pGAD10 from polymerase chain reaction products using standard methods and confirmed by direct sequencing; complete details are available upon request. In vitro translation plasmids were made using pT7-plink (37Pollock R. Treisman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).

For most of the experiments, plasmids encoded the following amino acids for mDia2: GBD, 101–216; FH1, 521–630; FH2, 801–910; and DAD, 1031–1171 unless otherwise indicated. Two-hybrid assays and in vitro translation/GST pull-down assays were conducted as described previously (14Alberts A.S. Bouquin N. Johnston L.H. Treisman R. J. Biol.

In short, the indicated bait proteins were generated by subcloning the indicated cDNAs into pGBT9 Gal4 DNA binding domain plasmid; prey were Gal4 activation domain fusion proteins generated in either pGAD10 or pSE1107. HF7c (CLONTECH) reporter yeast strain was cotransformed with the indicated plasmids and selected on appropriate plates for bait and prey auxotrophic markers and then restreaked onto His-plate to select for Gal4-regulated His reporter expression. Levels of reporter activity were monitored by replicate streaking onto Trp/Leu/His-plates with increasing concentrations (0–64 mm) of 3-aminotriazole. For in vitro translation and pull-down assays, plasmids were constructed using pT7-plink or pCAN (37Pollock R. Treisman R.

Beads were incubated at 4 °C with rocking for 2 h in 25 mm Tris pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Binding reactions were warmed to 30 °C before addition of recombinant RhoA-V14 (34Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Beads were collected by centrifugation and after washing beads three times in 5 bed volumes binding buffer, beads were suspended in SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed, and then stained with Coomassie Blue R250 and dried prior to autoradiography. Amino acid sequence alignments of the growing FH protein superfamily have delineated the proline-rich FH1 and FH2 regions of homology (5Wasserman S.

Comparative alignment of only the Dia-related subfamily yields a conserved domain in the carboxyl termini that is shown in Fig. 1. The consensus sequence (G/A)(V/A)MDXLLEXL(K/R/Q)X(G/A)(S/G/A)(A/P) was designated the Dia-autoregulatory domain or DAD. There is also a conserved region of basic residues several residues toward the carboxyl termini. The DAD domain was found in all the three mouse/human DRFs2 (14Alberts A.S. Bouquin N. Johnston L.H.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) have previously reported that the amino terminus of mDia1 could bind to its carboxyl terminus. A similar intramolecular interaction has also been reported for the Cdc42-binding WASP (34Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). To determine whether DAD could mediate this interaction in mDia2, the DAD domain was tested for binding to the GBD in both two hybrid and GST pull-down assays as shown in Fig. 2,A and B, respectively. In vitro both mDia2 and the isolated GBD bound specifically to the DAD domain (data not shown). The DAD·GBD or DAD interaction with mDia2 was tested for regulation by activated RhoA-V14. Both in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled GBD and mDia2 were incubated with increasing concentrations of purified recombinant RhoA-V14 protein.2 Activated Rho disrupted the association of both the isolated mDia2 GBD and mDia2 itself as shown in Fig. 2 Bbut did not have any effect on FH1-SrcSH3 binding. A model based on these observations is shown in Fig. 2 Cafter Watanabe et al. (11Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) In cells with low levels of activated Rho·GTP, Dia protein assumes an inactive state with the carboxyl-terminal DAD directly interacting with the amino-terminal GBD. Small GTPase activation and GBD binding induces release of the DAD and then effectors are recruited through the FH1 and FH2 domains. The carboxyl-terminal DAD, like the VCA domain of WASP, could be a bifunctional regulator. In this event, DAD would not only associate with the GBD but also recruit effectors such as the ARP2/3 complex in a manner analogous to the WASP-VCA domain (32Williams J.C. Wierenga R.K. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). If DAD lacks effector activity, it is possible that expression of this isolated domain in cells might disrupt the intramolecular GBD-DAD association. In this case, DAD expression might activate endogenous DRFs in cells. These two possibilities were then examined. The mDia2 DAD domain was fused to green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in a mammalian expression plasmid (pEFmEGFP-DAD (18Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar)) and was microinjected into NIH 3T3 cells previously maintained for 24 h in 0.1% serum, which diminishes the appearance of actin fibers. 3 h after injection, the effects on actin reorganization and activation of SRF were assayed. Actin polymerization was observed by fixing and staining cells with fluorescent TRITC-phalloidin, and SRF-regulated gene expression was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence by staining HA13 cells for the induction of a stably transformed SRE-controlled c-fos reporter gene that contains an HA-epitope tag (34Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The effects of EGFP·DAD were compared with similar EGFP fusion proteins containing other mDia2 domains, including the GBD, FH1, and FH2 sequences, in addition to the previously described activated ΔGBD variants (18Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Whereas none of the other homology domains had an effect on actin or SRF activity, EGFP·DAD expression strongly induced the formation of actin filaments in cells as shown in Fig. 3 A. The localization of the fusion proteins differed greatly. The EGFP·FH1 fusion was predominantly nuclear with some diffuse cytoplasmic localization. However, upon stimulation with LPA, the EGFP·FH1 fusion began to decorate actin stress fibers as shown in the example in Fig. 3 B. The inset shows a region from the EGFP·FH1-expressing cell in the top row; merged images clearly show overlapping EGFP·FH1/stress fibers which appearyellow. EGFP·FH2 localization was consistently diffuse throughout the cell, whereas EGFP·DAD was excluded from the nucleus. DAD did appear to concentrate at the ends of a subset of actin fibers in cells expressing higher levels of DAD but not to the extent seen with EGFP·FH1 (data not shown). EGFP·DAD strongly induced SRF as summarized in Fig. 3 C, where bars represent the number of FosHA-positive GFP fusion-expressing cells. This result is consistent with previous results showing a role for the DRFs in an SRF-signaling pathway (18Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar,40Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). The model (Fig. 2 C) predicts that overexpression of the GBD would squelch the effects of DAD domain expression through direct binding. To test this, plasmids encoding both GBD (pEFm-GBD) and DAD (pEFmEGFP-DAD) were microinjected into cells, and actin and SRF activity were monitored as before. As shown in Fig. 4 A, GBD expression blocked DAD-induced actin remodeling. Coinjection of either FH1 or FH2 domains were without effect. Similar results were obtained when SRF activity was assayed (Fig. 4 B). These results showed that the GBD expression inhibited the DAD domain intrans and was, in effect, squelching the DAD domain. The GBD could also block SRF and actin remodeling if DAD was activating Rho. Expression of other Rho GTPase binding domains have been shown to block Rho signaling (36Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). DAD activation of SRF via Rho was tested despite the presumption that the DRFs were downstream effectors of Rho signaling. DAD was coexpressed with either the amino terminus of PKN (PKN.N) or C3 transferase, which also inhibits Rho signaling but not the activated DRFs (18Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 36Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 40Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Neither C3 or PKN.N inhibited DAD activation of SRF (Fig. 4 B) though each blocked serum activation of SRF as previously reported (data not shown). Because of this specific blockade of DAD, it was concluded that DAD was triggering signals downstream of the Rho GTPases to activate SRF. These experiments also show that DAD is biologically active and is capable of specifically binding the GBD in cells. The molecular nature of DAD activity in cells was then examined. If DAD was an effector domain analogous to the WASP-VCA domain (34Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), GBD squelching of DAD activity would be predicted. The GBD would also be expected to block DAD if the alternative occurred; DAD inhibits a negative intramolecular DAD-GBD association. In this case, DAD domain expression would be activating endogenous Dia proteins by unlatching the GBD·DAD autoregulatory mechanism. This was tested by expressing DAD and simultaneously inhibiting endogenous mDia1 by coinjection of affinity-purified anti-mDia1 with the EGFP·DAD expression vector (18Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells express mDia1 but not mDia2; anti-mDia1 antibody recognizes mDia1 amino acids 66–77 (YGDDPTAQSLQD). Anti-mDia1 effectively blocked DAD activity toward actin remodeling (data not shown) and SRF (Fig. 5,A and B). Anti-mDia1 did not inhibit ΔGBD-mDia2 or ΔGBD-mDia1 SRF induction because the deletion constructs lack the peptide sequence necessary for recognition by anti-mDia1 (18Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Src binds to and colocalizes with endogenous Dia proteins (18Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 19Uetz P. Fumagalli S. James D. Zeller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33525-33530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To test if Src has a role in DAD activity, DAD was expressed with either interfering Src (Src K298m/Y530F) or coinjected with affinity-purified anti-Src (13Roche S. Fumagalli S. Courtneidge S.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Both reagents effectively blocked DAD-induced stress fiber formation and SRF (Fig. 5 B). To correlate DAD-DRF binding with DAD biological activity, a series of alanine substitutions were introduced into the DAD consensus region and were tested for binding to mDia2 by two-hybrid analysis. After determining the effects on DAD-GBD association, the resultant DAD domain mutants were then expressed in cells. The results of the binding experiments performed by two-hybrid analysis are summarized in Fig.6 A. Mutations that disrupted the mDia2-DAD interaction are indicated by the filled arrowheads; mutations that had no effect on mDia2 interaction are shown by the open arrowheads. M1041A, L1044A, L1048A (data not shown) (amino acid positions are from the mDia2 peptide sequence; conserved residues are indicated by black boxes, similar residues by grey boxes) substitutions of conserved DAD residues disrupted binding and were inactive toward the activation of both SRF (data not shown) and actin fiber formation as shown in Fig.6 B. The L1044A localization was also significantly altered. Instead of the diffuse membrane localization seen with wild-type DAD, L1044A had a punctate localization in the membrane and appeared at the cell edge. The L1044A substitution allowed the fusion protein to appear in the nucleus and also caused the formation of lamellipod-like extensions. Alanine substitutions of the nonconserved residues S1043A and Q1049A had no effect on binding, and both were able to induce fiber formation and SRF (data not shown). Interestingly, the E1046A substitution of the conserved glutamate residue was also inactive, suggesting that DAD·mDia2 binding is largely mediated through hydrophobic interactions. The interaction is also dependent upon the stretch of basic residues adjacent to the core DAD sequence. The introduction of a stop codon at position 1050 weakened but did not eliminate the interaction as determined by two-hybrid assay and also reduced the number and density of apparent fibers in cells (data not shown). The laboratory is in the process of examining the importance of these residues and the variable distance from the DAD core in its biological activity. Taken together, the results of these DAD mutational experiments show that complete DAD activity is dependent upon its ability to bind to a full-length DRF. The current study defines a regulatory domain that accounts for Rho GTPase activation of the Diaphanous-related FH protein subfamily. The DAD·GBD autoregulatory mechanism is analogous to the interaction of the WASP GTPase binding and the VCA domains (34Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar); the DRFs are regulated by intramolecular GBD·DAD binding where Rho-GTP activates the DRFs by disrupting GBD-DAD interaction. DAD is highly conserved, and its identification further explains the nature of several prior observations where truncation of Bni1, mDia1, and mDia2 GTPase binding domains resulted in their activation (11Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 16Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 18Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Here, it is shown that ectopic DAD expression mimics Rho·GTP binding by interfering with normal autoregulation of cellular DRFs. Based on this model, it may be possible that overexpression of the GTPase binding domain would also unlatch the autoinhibited Dia proteins. This is not the case as DAD clearly activates both actin fiber production and SRF, whereas the GBD was inactive and inhibits DAD in coexpression experiments. These results suggest the GBD is truly a bifunctional autoinhibitory domain in addition to the GTPase binding domain. Even if GBD binding to the carboxyl terminus of the endogenous Dia protein in transunlatched intramolecular autoinhibition, it would likely interfere with endogenous Dia function by masking exposed effector domains contained in the carboxyl terminus or by inducing the inactive state of the Dia proteins through direct binding. This may be reflected in results obtained by Nakano et al. (29Nakano K. Takaishi K. Kodama A. Mammoto A. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2481-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) who have shown that expression of a portion the mDia1 amino terminus interfered with the integrity of the actin fiber network in MDCK cells. It is critical, however, to determine whether these types of interfering proteins block by binding to functional domains of endogenous Dia proteins or simply squelch activated Rho GTPases by binding to a cryptic GTPase binding domain found within these Dia regions. Unfortunately, there is currently little information regarding the specific structural requirements of the DRF GTPase binding domains. This interaction is likely complex, and Rho effector loop mutations suggest that the interaction of Rho with mDia2 is unique (36Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Also, several of the Rho-binding proteins, including PKN and Kinectin, bear multiple binding sites for activated GTPases and cannot be restricted to a limited peptide domain (36Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 43Maesaki R. Ihara K. Shimizu T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 44Flynn P. Mellor H. Palmer R. Panayotou G. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2698-2705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).2 This may also be true for the DRFs. The carboxyl terminus of the DRFs, including regions between DAD and the FH2 domain, may still serve in a signaling or actin remodeling capacity like the WASP carboxyl terminus. DAD itself may also contain intrinsic effector activity. The L1044A-substituted mDia2 DAD, for example, was unable to bind the mDia2 GBD and therefore unlatch the autoinhibited cellular Dia proteins. Expression of this mutated DAD was still able to effect the actin cytoskeleton by causing the disruption of pre-existing actin fibers and the formation of lamella-like extensions. This suggests that either this mutant directly targets cellular components that participate in actin remodeling or it interferes with endogenous DRFs. Both possibilities are being explored as the complete induction of stress fibers by DAD will likely be shown to be dependent upon multiple activities being recruited to activated Rho- or DAD-bound Dia proteins. The current results also raise the possibility that expression of dual function autoregulatory domains from proteins like WASP may have multiple effects in cells; those that are dependent upon the recruitment of cellular factors to the domain of interest, but also those caused by the relief of self-inhibition. Once the DRFs are activated by Rho binding, what is the mechanism of signal transduction to effectors? The current model suggests that once intramolecular inhibition because of GBD-DAD association is relieved by binding to activated Rho, the DRFs then recruit downstream effectors that mediate signals via the proline-rich FH1, the FH2, or other uncharacterized Dia domains. Whereas the integrity of the FH1 domain is required for the ability of ΔGBD-versions of both mDia1 and mDia2 to signal to actin and DRF (18Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), it is clear that both FH1 and FH2 domains are involved in downstream signaling (11Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 26Evangelista M. Blundell K. Longtine M.S. Chow C.J. Adames N. Pringle J.R. Peter M. Boone C. Science. 1997; 276: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). It is also possible that FH1 is functionally an input domain that receives signals from upstream signaling modules or mediates cross-talk via cellular factors such as Src (18Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 19Uetz P. Fumagalli S. James D. Zeller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33525-33530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or IRSp53/BAIAP2 (22Fujiwara T. Mammoto A. Kim Y. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 271: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Src for example, may be targeting the DRFs upon activation by Rho, even though prior work has shown that mDia1 membrane localization is dependent upon Rho (16Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Src-dependent targeting may therefore be a permissive event. This is consistant with the conclusion of this study; ectopic DAD expression triggers endogenous Dia protein in a manner similar to activated Rho. In this situation, activated cellular Dia proteins are then directed to the membrane by factors in a FH1 domain-dependent manner. v-Src has been shown to be directed to focal adhesions in a Rho- and actin-dependent manner (45Fincham V.J. Unlu M. Brunton V.G. Pitts J.D. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1551-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Given our previous findings with interfering Src and anti-Src antibodies (13Roche S. Fumagalli S. Courtneidge S.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) that block activated Dia function, Src and Dia targeting may be mutually dependent events that are controlled by the rate-limiting Rho-activation step. The DAD peptide represents a useful biological tool to study Rho signaling and cytoskeletal regulation pathways. Because DAD effects are largely dependent upon the endogenous complement of cellular DRFs, the results generated from further experiments using DAD will likely be more useful in the dissection of Dia-dependent signaling events. For example, in comparison to the activated ΔGBD-mDia variants, DAD expression induces the formation of stable microtubules whose orientation better reflects those observed after growth factor treatment. 3G. Gundersen, personal communication. DAD and mutated DAD proteins are now being tested for effects on downstream signaling pathways. Specifically, it will be interesting to examine the effects of the DFNA1 mutation (12Lynch E.D. Lee M.K. Morrow J.E. Welcsh P.L. Leon P.E. King M.C. Science. 1997; 278: 1315-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) on DAD activity in cells and on its ability to interact with the GBD. The autosomal dominantDFNA1 mutation in the human Dia1 gene occurs at a donor splice site at the carboxyl terminus. The mutation causes a frameshift 15 amino acids away from the core DAD sequence, which introduces an anomalous 19 amino acids onto the protein. Thus far in our laboratory, the effects of truncations near this region of DAD have been equivocal, but this may suggest that it destabilizes the autoinhibitory GBD-DAD association. Expression of truncated versions of mDia1 by Watanabe et al. (11Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) appears to cause disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in some cells and resembles the results seen with DAD mutants shown here. However, the effects of the DFNA1 mutation on Dia1 protein function will not be clear until these Dia1 mutants are expressed in cells at in vivo levels.

For example, the Omega class glutathione transferase GSTO1–1 has a typical glutathione transferase fold but little enzymatic activity with many conventional substrates (7Board P.G. Coggan M.

Unlike other mammalian glutathione transferases that have active site tyrosine or serine residues (8Wilce M.C. Parker M.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Although the intracellular function of the Omega class GSTs is unknown, a member of the Omega class is over-expressed in a radiation-resistant mouse lymphoma cell line (9Kodym R. Calkins P. Story M.

Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) to identify additional members of the glutathione transferase structural family and were impressed by sequence similarities between GSTO1–1 and the chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) family of proteins, which are thought to form chloride channels in intracellular membranes or to be chloride channel modulators (11Valenzuela S.M.

We therefore compared the structure of the CLIC proteins and GSTO1–1 in more detail and found that NCC27 (CLIC1) belongs to the GST structural family. Because of the structural similarity, we also examined the ability of GSTO1–1 to form or modulate ion channels. We find that GSTO1–1 modulates ryanodine receptors (RyRs), which are the calcium release channels in skeletal and cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). There is evidence that GSTO1–1 is present in skeletal and cardiac muscle (7Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V.

Minor manual alterations were introduced into the alignment, taking into consideration both the model and an alignment of other GST family members. 2Further details of the alignment are available from Dr. Philip Board at the John Curtin School of Medical Research. Modelling was performed with the HOMOLOGY module of the Insight II package (MSI, San Diego, CA) based on the alignment in Fig. 1. Despite the low level of sequence identity (∼15%), visual inspection of the model confirmed that the NCC27 sequence is compatible with the canonical GST fold. Further validation of the model was derived from applying a THREADING procedure (19Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) to the NCC27 sequence that scored the highest match against GSTO1–1 when compared with the nonredundant structure data base with a Z score of-2.78 Recombinant GSTO1–1 was expressed inEscherichia coli after cloning the cDNA into the expression vector pQE 30 (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia). The expressed protein has a poly-His tag and was purified by Ni-agarose chromatography (20Whittington A. Vichai V. Webb G. Baker R. Pearson W. Board P. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The purified protein was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, 60 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0. The C32A mutant was created by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The mutant protein was purified and stored by the same procedures as the wild type enzyme. To block protein thiols, GSTO1–1 was diluted to 2 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 60 mmNaCl, pH 8.0 containing 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The protein was incubated at 20 °C for 1 h and then dialyzed extensively against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 60 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 at 4 °C. Antiserum to human GSTO1–1 was prepared by immunizing rabbits with purified recombinant GSTO1–1 in Fruend's adjuvant. Pre-immune serum was collected before immunization for use as a control. The polyclonal antisera obtained recognized recombinant GSTO1–1 and GSTO1–1 derived from human tissue extracts on Western blots. GSTO1–1 at 21–210 μg/ml was added to the cis side of bilayers containing phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine (5:3:2, w/w), and the solution was stirred for 30–90 min. Solutions for this experiment contained the following:cis/trans, 500/50 mm NaCl; cis and trans, 10 mm TES (pH 4.0–7.0), with or without 1 mm CaCl2. SR vesicles were prepared from rabbit or pig skeletal muscle or sheep cardiac muscle as described previously (21Laver D.R. Roden L.D. Ahern G.P. Eager K.R. Junankar P.R. Dulhunty A.F. J. Membr.

RyRs were identified by their ability to conduct Cs+ ions with a single channel conductance of 250–300 picosiemens at +40 or −40 mV and by their susceptibility to block by 10 μm ruthenium red added to the cis chamber at the end of each experiment. Recording solutions contained the following (cis and trans): 230 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 20 mm CsCl, and 10 mm TES (pH 7.4 with CsOH), with 1 mm CaCl2(trans), and 10−6 or 10−5m calcium ions (cis) buffered using 1 mm1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. GSTs, buffer, and antibody were added to the cis chamber and were “washed out” by perfusion with 10 volumes ofcis solution. Bilayer potentials are given relative to thetrans chamber. 10 and 100 μl of stock GSTO1–1 solution (see above) were added to the cis chamber to give final GSTO1–1 concentrations of 21 and 210 μg/ml, respectively. Therefore 10 and 100 μl of buffer alone were added in control experiments (see Figs. 3 a and4 a).Figure 4Average effects of cytoplasmic GSTO1–1 on RyR channels.

Mean current (I′, the average of all data points in a record) was used as a measure of channel activity, because many bilayers contained more than one active channel. Data are presented in Figs. 3 and 4 as relative mean current (I′t/I′c, whereI′t is the mean current under test conditions andI′c is the control mean current). Bilayer potential was changed between −40 and +40 mV every 30 s.I′t and I′c were measured from 120-s recordings (2 × 30 s at −40 mV and 2 × 30 s at +40 mV) obtained under each condition, i.e. control conditions, for each [GST] or [buffer], after antibody addition, or after washout. Data is presented as the mean ± S.E., and the numbers of bilayers are given. The number of experiments included in the average data exceeded the number of bilayers because (a) measurements at −40 and +40 mV were included in the average, and (b) the experiment was often repeated on one bilayer. The significance of the difference between control and test values was tested (a) using a Student's t test, either 1- or 2-sided and either for independent or paired data, as appropriate, or (b) using the nonparametric “sign” test (23Minium E.W. King B.K. Bear G. Statistical Reasoning in Psychology and Education. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). Differences were considered to be significant whenp ≤ 0.05 Alignment of the human GSTO1–1 sequence and the human chloride channel protein NCC27 (Fig. 1) reveals several similarities, both in length and in the number of conserved and conservatively replaced residues. The similarity is particularly striking in the N-terminal glutathione-binding region, with conservation of a CPF motif that includes the active site cysteine residue of GSTO1–1. There are four amino acid positions that are common to virtually all known glutathione transferases (7Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24798-24806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, asterisks). These positions include a cis Pro within the GSH binding site and an Asp, which acts as an N-terminal cap near the start of helix 6. Two Gly residues also appear to be important for structural reasons (8Wilce M.C. Parker M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Conspicuously, all four of these residues are conserved in the CLIC proteins. Additional sites, such as Leu-34, Asp-76, Phe-83, Leu-84, Phe-167, and Leu-168 (Fig. 1, number signs) show a pattern of hydrophobicity that extends throughout other GST classes. Based on the alignment, a tentative three-dimensional structure was predicted by homology modelling (Fig. 2). The model is plausible because there are no uncomplexed buried charges, and most hydrophobic residues are shielded from solvent. The side of helix 3 that forms an interface with helix 4 is quite polar, suggesting that there may be a relative shift between the N- and C-terminal domains with respect to other GST structures (Fig. 2). Both helix 4 and helix 5 are likely to be kinked, with regions of irregular hydrogen bonding. Therefore some differences between the CLIC protein and Omega structures are predicted (7Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24798-24806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Modelling GSH into the putative active site reveals that a covalent bond could be formed between the GSH Cys and Cys-24 of the CLIC protein, analogous to that observed in the Omega class GST structure (7Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24798-24806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Lys-49, Arg-51, and Arg-29 are able to complex the negative GSH charges, whereas Glu-63 and Asp-76 complex the positive charge on the γ-glutamyl group of GSH. Thus, whereas considerable caution must be exercised when interpreting alignments with limited sequence identity, the sequence of the CLIC pro-tein is generally consistent with the canonical GST structure, particularly in the N-terminal domain. Additional support for the model comes from the application of an automated THREADING procedure to the NCC27 sequence (19Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). NCC27 scored the best match with the Omega GST structure, with a Z score of −2.78 when compared with other folds in the nonredundant structure data base. The predicted similarities in the structure of the Omega class GSTs and the CLIC proteins led us to examine the possibility that GSTO1–1 may behave like CLICs and act as an ion channel and/or ion channel modulator. Although GSTO1–1 alone did not form ion channels in lipid bilayers under the conditions we used, we found that it modulated RyR channels. GSTO1–1 (21 μg/ml), added to the cis (cytoplasmic) solution, reduced cardiac RyR2 activity by about 50% in 28 of 29 bilayers (Fig. 3, b and c, and Fig.4, b and c). A 10-fold higher GST concentration (210 μg/ml) caused similar depression of cardiac RyR activity in seven bilayers (Fig.4 b). The K i for inhibition of RyR2 activity in four bilayers that were exposed to a series of GSTO1–1 concentrations was 1 μg/ml (Fig. 4 f). The apparent increase in activity as [GSTO1–1] increased from 21 to 210 μg/ml in Fig. 4 b was not significant and may have arisen from inclusion of data from different bilayers for the different concentrations. The increase is not seen in the limited data set of Fig. 4 f, containing bilayers exposed to each of the three GSTO1–1 concentrations. Control experiments showed that buffer lacking GSTO1–1 did not affect RyR activity (Figs.3 a and 4 a). Depression of RyR activity by the GST was independent of cytoplasmic (cis) [Ca2+] between 10−5 and 10−6m (Fig. 3, b and c, and Fig. 4,b and c) and independent of bilayer potential (therefore average values in Fig. 4 include measurements at −40 and +40 mV). Covalent modification (oxidation) of the RyR complex by GSTO1–1 was not responsible for the inhibition, because channel activity recovered and was even potentiated above control levels (n = 10) when GSTO1–1 was washed out (Fig. 3 b). Normal channel activity could also be restored by addition of polyclonal anti-GSTO1–1 antiserum (n = 7), with potentiation of activity above control levels in each case (Fig. 3 c and Fig. 4,b and c). These changes in channel activity were a specific effect of the antibody on GSTO1–1 because (a) recovery was not seen when 100 μl of pre-immune serum lacking antibody was added to channels whose activity was depressed by GSTO1–1 (n= 4), and (b) 100 μl of antiserum alone did not affect RyR2 channel activity in the absence of GSTO1–1 (Fig. 4 a). Two other kinds of experiment indicate that inhibition of RyR2 activity by GSTO1–1 is related to its thiol transferase activity. First, when GSTO1–1 was treated with N-ethylmaleimide (GSTO1–1-M), it lost both its enzyme activity and its ability to inhibit RyR2 activity (n = 8) (Figs. 3 d and 4 d). Indeed channel activity was increased by GSTO1–1-M (Fig.4 d , n = 7). Control-incubated enzyme (GSTO1–1-C; see “Experimental Procedures”) was then applied, and channel activity fell to control levels (Fig.4 d). The depression may have been less than expected because inactive GSTO1–1-M was occupying some of the inhibition sites and preventing GSTO1–1-C binding. In the second type of experiment, GSTO1–1 with a Cys-32 → Ala mutation that removed enzyme activity lost its ability to cause depression of RyR2 activity (11 or 110 μg/ml, n = 6). Indeed, RyR2 channel activity was increased by the mutated GSTO1–1 (n = 4). An increase in RyR2 activity to levels that were greater than before exposure to GSTO1–1 after washout of the enzyme was also seen after addition of antibody and after addition of N-ethylmaleimide-treated enzyme, suggesting that an activating action of GSTO1–1 was unmasked when the inhibitory effect was removed or was not present. Only an excitatory effect of GSTO1–1 was seen in skeletal muscle RyR1 channels, and this was not reversed within 5 min of removing GSTO1–1 (Figs. 3 e and 4 e). Early studies of the glutathione transferase family relied on functional similarities to identify different family members. In previous studies we have identified additional members of the GST structural family by sequence alignment-based searches of the expressed sequence tag and GenBankTM data bases (5Board P.G. Baker R.T. Chelvanayagam G. Jermiin L.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar,7Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24798-24806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The recently described Zeta and Omega class GSTs were identified by this approach, and although they are clearly members of the GST structural family, they are functionally distinct from previously described GST classes. In the present study we utilized the Omega class GST sequence to search for additional members of the GST structural family. This search revealed significant sequence similarity with members of the CLIC group of intracellular channel proteins. Detailed examination of an alignment of the GSTO1 and NCC27 (CLIC1) sequences revealed the conservation of several key residues that are conserved throughout the GST structural family. Subsequent homology modelling strongly supported the prediction that NCC27 adopts the canonical GST fold and can be classified as a member of the GST structural family. The formation and modulation of ion channels are novel functions never previously associated with members of the GST family and clearly extend the potential roles of this superfamily. The observation that CLIC proteins probably adopt a GST fold and share a similar N-terminal extension and ‘active site’ motif with GSTO1 suggested that we should investigate the capacity of an Omega class GST to form or modulate ion channels. GSTO1–1 did not form channels under the conditions we used. However, because GSTO1–1 is strongly expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle (7Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24798-24806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), we examined its capacity to modulate RyRs. Our results clearly indicated that GSTO1–1 is able to either inhibit or potentiate RyR calcium channels. The inhibition we observed (a) does not depend on an oxidation reaction, (b) requires an active enzyme conformation, and (c) is seen only in RyR2. Activation of RyRs is independent of enzyme activity and is seen in both RyR1 and RyR2. The results suggest that RyR2 has two binding sites for GSTO1–1 and that enzyme binding to one site activates the channel, whereas enzyme binding to the second site inhibits the channel. The RyR has a very large cytoplasmic domain with multiple ligand binding sites, and there are several examples of ligands with dual effects on the channel because ligands can bind to more than one site. Examples are Ca2+ (21Laver D.R. Roden L.D. Ahern G.P. Eager K.R. Junankar P.R. Dulhunty A.F. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 147: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), ATP (24Kermode H. Williams A.J. Sitsapesan R. Biophys.

Laver D.R. Gallant E.M. Casarotto M.G. Pace S.M. Curtis S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 189-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Ion channel modulation is a novel and unrecognized role for a GST; this is the first report of modulation of RyRs by a GST protein. RyR channels are regulated by many factors including oxidation and reduction reactions (26Dulhunty A. Haarmann C. Green D. Hart J. Antioxidants Redox Signalling. 2000; 2: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). GSTO1–1 provides an additional mechanism by which redox state might be conveyed to the channels. Cytoplasmic [Ca2+] increases during oxidative stress, partly through oxidative activation of RyRs (26Dulhunty A. Haarmann C. Green D. Hart J. Antioxidants Redox Signalling. 2000; 2: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An increase in [GSTO1–1] during oxidative stress could protect RyR2 from oxidation-induced activation in all cells expressing this RyR isoform. Because CLIC proteins also form or modulate ion channels (11Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol.

Because cardiac RyR2s form macromolecular complexes that include protein kinase A (28Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar), the possibility that the modulating effects of GSTO1–1 may be mediated by interactions with the RyR2-associated protein kinase deserves further investigation. GST modulation of RyRs may have widespread effects. GSTO1–1 is over-expressed in a radiation-resistant lymphoma cell line (9Kodym R. Calkins P. Story M. J. Biol.

Neurexins are neuron-specific cell surface proteins that act as receptors for the excitatory neurotoxin α-latrotoxin.

In agreement with this hypothesis, we now show that the cytoplasmic tail of neurexins captures Munc18 via a multiprotein complex that involves Mint1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both Mint1 and Mint2 can directly bind to neurexins in a PDZ domain-mediated interaction. Various Mint and/or CASK-containing complexes can be assembled on neurexins, and we demonstrate that Mint1 can bind to Munc18 and CASK simultaneously.

Our data support a model whereby one of the functions of Mints is to localize the vesicle fusion protein Munc18 to those sites at the plasma membrane that are defined by neurexins, presumably in the vicinity of points of exocytosis. glutathioneS-transferase green fluorescent protein GDP dissociation inhibitor Mints, CASKs, and Velis are multidomain proteins that probably function as molecular adaptors in a number of biological processes. They contain PDZ domains, which are protein-protein interaction modules that often bind to the extreme C termini of target proteins (1Cowburn D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Vertebrates contain three Mint genes, one CASK gene, and three Veli genes (2Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Mints 1 and 2 are specifically expressed in the nervous system and bind to Munc18–1, a sec1-like protein that is essential for neurotransmitter release (2Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 6Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F.

Mint1 is evolutionary conserved, and the Caenorhabditis elegans lin-10 gene is a Mint1 homolog (7Whitfield C.W. Benard C. Barnes T. Hekimi S. Kim S.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2087-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mints have been identified in different organisms and biological contexts, leading to various names (TableI). CASK was identified as a novel MAGUK (membrane-associatedguanylate kinase domain-containing protein) that binds to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of neurexins, neuron-specific cell surface proteins (4Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurexins were initially purified as receptors for α-latrotoxin, a neurotoxin that triggers massive exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, and function as heterophilic cell-adhesion molecules (12Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 13Nguyen T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26032-26039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Independently, CASK was discovered inC. elegans as the protein encoded by the lin-2gene, which collaborates with lin-10 and a third gene,lin-7, in vulva development (14Hoskins R. Hajnal A.F. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Development. 1996; 122: 97-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Finally, the three widely expressed Veli genes are the vertebrate homologs of the C. elegans lin-7 gene (5Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Mints, CASK, and Velis share distinct properties; all are vertebrate homologs of C. elegans genes involved in vulva development and are multidomain proteins that contain one (CASK and Velis) or two (Mints) PDZ domains. In vertebrate brain, CASK binds to Mint1, but not to Mints 2 and 3, and to all three Velis to form a tripartite complex (5Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The adaptor proteins assembled into this tight complex contribute not only four PDZ domains but also SH3, phosphotyrosine-binding domain, and guanylate kinase domains (5Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Velis also bind to the MAGUKs hDLG2 and hDLG3 (5Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C.

Among such potential targets are not only the cell-surface proteins neurexins and syndecans, which interact with the PDZ domain of CASK (4Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kharazia V. Naisbitt S. Cohen A.R. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), but also calcium channels and amyloid precursor protein, which bind to different domains in Mints (17Maximov A. Südhof T.C.

In the current study, we have addressed the following questions: First, do Mint1 and Mint2 share similar properties, especially because in brain both Mint1 and Mint2 bind to Munc18? Second, could Mints function to recruit Munc18 to the plasma membrane? Third, do Mints participate in the formation of distinct PDZ domain-protein complexes? We demonstrate that both Mints 1 and 2 bind directly to neurexins and that this interaction is mediated by their PDZ domains. In addition, we show that neurexin-bound CASK can constitute an alternate pathway to specifically recruit Mint1-bound Munc18. Furthermore, we provide evidence that these complexes function to localize Munc18 to neurexin. We propose that various Mint-containing complexes on neurexin could recruit Munc18 to the plasma membrane at sites of exocytosis. The Escherichia coliexpression vectors encoding GST1-neurexin I, GST-neurexin IΔ10 (named GST-neurexin IΔ3 in the cited publication), and GST-Munc18–1 have been described previously (2Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 19Hata Y. Davletov B. Petrenko A.G. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1993; 10: 307-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), as are the eukaryotic expression vectors for Mints 1 and 2 and neurexin Iβ (2Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 20Ushkaryov Y.A. Hata Y. Ichtchenko K. Moomaw C. Afendis S. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11981-11987Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Vectors encoding full-length GST-Mint1, GST-CASK, and GFP-Mint1 were a kind gift from A. Maximov (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Monoclonal antibodies directed against CASK, Mint1, Mint2, and Munc18 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal anti-neurexin I antibodies were raised against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 10 amino acids of the protein. Monoclonal antibodies against syntaxin 1 and GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) were a kind gift from R. Jahn (Max-Planck-Institut for Biophysical Chemistry, Gõttingen, Germany). GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and immobilized on glutathione-agarose using standard procedures. Neurexin peptides (sequence NKKNKDKEYYV) and gp41 peptides (sequence WFSITNWLWYI) were coupled via an added N-terminal cysteine to SulfoLink beads, whereas calcium channel peptides (sequence RHSYHHPDQDHWC) and a point-mutated variant (sequence RHSYHHPDQDHWT) were coupled via their N-terminal amino group to AminoLink beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Total rat brain extracts were prepared in buffer A (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium chloride, 320 mmsucrose, 1.0% Triton X-100). Recombinant full-length Mint1 was expressed as GST fusion, and the GST moiety was cleaved with thrombin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Affinity chromatographies were performed at 4 °C in buffer A, which was adjusted to include 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for binding of recombinant proteins and to 600 mm potassium acetate for chromatography on immobilized peptide. Binding steps lasted 12–16 h. For differential centrifugation, rat brain was homogenized in buffer A without detergent, and a crude membrane fraction was prepared by pelleting particles larger than 800 S. This supernatant was spun again to pellet particles larger than 30 S to prepare the cytosolic supernatant. Quantitative immunodetection on Western blots was performed using radiolabeled 125I secondary antibodies, and the signals were quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using ImageQuant software. COS cell were transfected with pcDNA3 GFP-Mint1 encoding full-length Mint1 tagged with GFP either alone or in combination with pCMVL13 encoding full-length neurexin Iβ. Cells were stained with an antibody against neurexin I and visualized using a Bio-Rad confocal microscope. All proteins were expressed as full-length GST fusion proteins in E. coli. Soluble CASK and Mint1 were prepared by cleavage of the GST moiety with thrombin. To prepare complexed Mint1, beads containing 600 pmol of GST-Munc18–1 were incubated with 100 pmol of soluble Mint1 for 14 h. After unbound Mint1 was washed out, typically 10 pmol of Mint1 were stably bound to GST-Munc18–1. 35 pmol of CASK were loaded onto these Mint1/GST-Munc18 beads and incubated for 4 h. In parallel, identical amounts of CASK were loaded onto 10 pmol of GST-Mint1. Bound CASK, Mint1, and GST-Mint1 were quantitated after Western blotting as described above. Previously, the PDZ domain protein CASK has been described to bind to the extreme C terminus of neurexins (4Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As CASK binds Mint1 and Velis, this tripartite complex coats the cytosolic domain of neurexins (5Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To study the interaction of the tripartite complex with neurexins in vitro, we solubilized rat brain and performed affinity chromatography on the immobilized cytoplasmic domain of neurexin I (GST-NxI). CASK bound efficiently and in a salt-resistant manner to the C terminus of neurexin I and was enriched in the final eluate along with Mint1 and Velis (Fig. 1 A, lane 3 and data not shown). No binding of CASK and Mint1 was observed to a truncated neurexin I lacking the C-terminal 10 amino acids (GST-NxIΔ10) (Fig. 1 A, lane 5). Unexpectedly, Mint2 also interacted with the native C terminus of neurexin I (Fig. 1 A,lane 3). This was surprising because Mint2, though highly similar to Mint1, does not bind CASK (5Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The vesicle trafficking protein Munc18, which interacts with both Mint1 and Mint2, was recovered mainly in the salt eluate of the neurexin I affinity chromatography, albeit at lower yields, together with syntaxin 1 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 3). GDI served as negative control for binding. The CASK-independent binding observed for Mint2 suggested that it might directly interact with the C terminus of neurexin I. Such a property of Mint2 could be shared by Mint1. This notion was supported by a second line of binding studies, using either membrane or cytosolic proteins prepared from rat brain. CASK was mainly recovered in the membrane pellet (Fig. 1 B, lane 2) with only a very small fraction detectable in cytosol (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). Mint1 was evenly distributed between membranes and cytosol (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 versus 5). Using both fractions, affinity chromatography on the immobilized cytoplasmic domain of neurexin I was performed (Fig. 1 C). Surprisingly, the Mint1 from the cytosolic fraction that lacks CASK bound as efficiently to neurexin I as the membrane-bound fraction of Mint1 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 4 versus 6). Likely explanations for these results were either the direct interaction of Mint1 and Mint2 with the cytosolic tail of neurexins or the existence of an unknown functional CASK analog in the cytosol. To address the direct binding of Mint1 to the cytoplasmic domain of neurexin I, full-length Mint1 was expressed in E. coli, and the purified, soluble protein was incubated with the immobilized cytoplasmic domain of neurexin I (Fig. 2 A). Mint1 was recovered efficiently and specifically on neurexin I. The binding is highly salt-resistant and is dependent on the 10 C-terminal amino acids of neurexin I (Fig. 2 A, lane 4 versus 7). To test for an interaction of Mint proteins with the extreme C-terminal amino acids of neurexins, Mint1 and Mint2 were expressed in COS cells and bound to immobilized peptides corresponding to the C-terminal 11 amino acids of neurexin I (Fig. 2 B). A peptide derived from gp41, encoded by the human immunodeficiency virus type I, which shares a hydrophobic C terminus with the neurexin peptide, was used as negative control. Mint1 and Mint2 were recovered exclusively on the immobilized neurexin I peptide (Fig. 2 B,lane 2). Our results provide evidence that besides CASK, Mint proteins can be additional direct binding partners of the extreme C termini of neurexins. To confirm this direct interaction with neurexin I. GFP-Mint1 was transfected alone or cotransfected with neurexin Iβ into COS cells, and its intracellular distribution was examined by confocal microscopy. In control cells, GFP-Mint1 was distributed throughout the cytosol similar to GFP (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). Upon coexpression of neurexin 1β, the majority of GFP-Mint1 was detected at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 B), where it colocalized with neurexin 1β (Fig. 3, C and D). Expression of the plasma membrane protein syntaxin 1, which is not predicted to interact with Mint1, did not alter the cytosolic localization of GFP-Mint1 (data not shown). The almost quantitative recruitment of Mint1 from the cytosol to neurexin Iβ suggests their strong interaction in vivo. Next, we addressed whether direct binding of Mints to neurexins is mediated by their PDZ domains using recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli. We prepared both full-length Mint1 and a mutant that was truncated within the first PDZ domain (Mint1ΔPDZ; Mint1 amino acids 1–688) and therefore contains no functional PDZ domain. Binding of Mint1 and its mutant form to various peptides was quantitated (Fig. 4 A). The specific binding of Mint1 to the C-terminal peptide of neurexin was abolished in the ΔPDZ mutant, demonstrating that the interaction was PDZ domain-mediated. Previously, the interaction of Mint1 with the N-type calcium channel α1B subunit has been reported (17Maximov A. Südhof T.C. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24453-24456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Binding of Mint1 to the C-terminal peptide of this calcium channel was almost as strong as to the neurexin peptide, was mediated by the Mint1 PDZ domains, and the exchange of the terminal amino acid of the peptide from Cys to Thr significantly reduced Mint1 binding (Fig. 4 A). Both CASK and Mint1 can bind directly to neurexins and to each other. Therefore, the assembly of various multimeric complexes could proceed as CASK could be indirectly recruited to neurexin-bound Mint1 and vice versa. To test these scenarios, the same molar amounts of recombinant, full-length CASK and Mint1 were bound either alone or in combination to immobilized neurexin I peptide or gp41 peptide as negative control (Fig. 4 B). Equal amounts of CASK and Mint1 were specifically recovered on the neurexin peptides, indicating similar binding strengths. Upon coincubation of both CASK and Mint1, the yield approximately doubled for both proteins. A likely explanation is that in this case, each neurexin-bound CASK (or Mint1) provides for an additional binding site for Mint1 (or CASK). Additional experiments confirmed that under saturating conditions, CASK and Mint1 interact with each other in a 1:1 stoichiometry (data not shown). Munc18 is essential for neurotransmitter secretion (6Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Südhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), presumably because of its interaction with syntaxin 1 (21Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). It binds to the Munc18-interaction domain in the N-terminal region of Mint1, which also contains the interaction domain of Mint1 with CASK (2Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 5Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, Munc18 can be bound to the cytoplasmic tail of neurexins, which indicates that Mints 1 and 2 recruit Munc18 to this plasma membrane protein. Notably, neurexin-bound CASK could also function as an adaptor of Mint1-bound Munc18 and thereby recruit Munc18 to neurexins in an additional pathway. However, the interaction domains of Mint1 with CASK and Munc18 are in close proximity (5Butz S. Okamoto M. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), which might obstruct their simultaneous binding required for this CASK-dependent pathway. To resolve this question, two subsequent binding steps were performed on immobilized GST-Munc18. First, recombinant Mint1 was bound to the GST-Munc18-containing beads, and unbound Mint1 was washed out. Subsequently, recombinant CASK was loaded onto this Mint1/GST-Munc18 preparation (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1–4). Efficient CASK binding was observed (Fig. 5 A, lane 4), demonstrating that Mint1 can indeed bind simultaneously to Munc18 and CASK. In parallel, recombinant CASK was loaded onto directly immobilized GST-Mint1,i.e. in absence of Munc18. As expected, CASK bound to this preparation of uncomplexed Mint1 (Fig. 5 A,lane 6) but not directly to GST-Munc18 (Fig. 5 A,lane 8). Quantitative analysis showed that the recovery of CASK on Mint1/GST-Munc18 was increased 4 (± 1.4)-fold over the recovery of CASK on GST-Mint1 alone (Fig. 5 A and data not shown). Soluble Mint1 bound well to GST-CASK but not to GST alone (data not shown). In summary, the interaction of Mint1 with Munc18 does not interfere with the binding of Mint1 to CASK and could even enhance this binding to CASK. Therefore, Munc18 is likely to interact not only with Mint1-neurexin complexes but also to be incorporated via Mint1 into CASK-neurexin complexes. We report here that Mints 1 and 2 are novel direct binding partners of neurexins and that the Mint-neurexin complexes are as likely as CASK-neurexin complexes to be formed. Distinct neurexin complexes could be assembled in different neuronal compartments or during brain development. We propose that all these neurexin complexes can interact with Munc18. Both Mint1 and Mint2 could function as direct adaptors of Munc18 to neurexins, whereas Mint1 in addition could recruit Munc18 to CASK-neurexin (Fig. 5 B). Munc18 is essential for the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, and the recruitment of Munc18 to the neuronal plasma membrane is likely to be important for its function in neurotransmission. Previously, only the interaction of Munc18 with syntaxin was known to bind Munc18 at the plasma membrane. The analysis described here provides novel evidence that in parallel to syntaxin, neurexin-bound Mint could help to localize Munc18 to distinct sites at the plasma membrane. As neurexins have been proposed to function in neuronal cell adhesion, it is possible that they define specific sites at the plasma membrane and that Mint complexes and Mint1-CASK complexes on neurexin are involved in the localized recruitment of Munc18 to the sites of exocytosis. In support of this hypothesis, both CASK and Mint1 have been reported to be localized at synapses (16Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kharazia V. Naisbitt S. Cohen A.R. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 22Okamoto M. Matsuyama T. Sugita M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3067-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).

Five AGE receptors identified so far are RAGE (receptor for AGE), galectin-3, 80K-H, OST-48, and SRA (macrophage scavengerreceptor class A types I and II). Since SRA is known to belong to the class A scavenger receptor family, and the scavenger receptor collectively represents a family of multiligand lipoprotein receptors, it is possible that CD36, although belonging to the class B scavenger receptor family, can recognize AGE proteins as ligands. This was tested at the cellular level in this study using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing human CD36 (CD36-CHO cells). Cellular expression of CD36 was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescent microscopy using anti-CD36 antibody. Upon incubation at 37 °C, 125I-AGE-bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA) and 125I-oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL), an authentic ligand for CD36, were endocytosed in a dose-dependent fashion and underwent lysosomal degradation by CD36-CHO cells, but not wild-type CHO cells. In binding experiments at 4 °C, 125I-AGE-BSA exhibited specific and saturable binding to CD36-CHO cells (K d = 5.6 μg/ml). The endocytic uptake of 125I-AGE-BSA by these cells was inhibited by 50% by oxidized LDL and by 60% by FA6-152, an anti-CD36 antibody inhibiting cellular binding of oxidized LDL. Our results indicate that CD36 expressed by these cells mediates the endocytic uptake and subsequent intracellular degradation of AGE proteins. Since CD36 is one of the major oxidized LDL receptors and is up-regulated in macrophage- and smooth muscle cell-derived foam cells in human atherosclerotic lesions, these results suggest that, like oxidized LDL, AGE proteins generated in situ are recognized by CD36, which might contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic macrovascular complications.

Cellular interactions with AGE proteins are known to induce several biological responses, not only endocytic uptake and degradation, but also induction of cytokines and growth factors, which are likely linked to the development of diabetic vascular complications (9Vlassara H.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Since foam cells in the early phase of atherosclerosis are derived from monocyte/macrophages, in which SRA is highly expressed (30Naito M. Suzuki H. Mori T. Matsumoto A. Kodama T. Takahashi K. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 591-599PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yla-Herttuala S. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Sigal E. Sarkioja T. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), SRA may also play an important role as an AGE receptor in the early stages of atherosclerosis. In contrast, although functionally related to SRA, the class B receptors differ significantly in structure. CD36, the defining member of this class, is a highly glycosylated, single chain 88-kDa protein that binds Ox-LDL, fatty acids, anionic phospholipids (including phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine), and the proteins collagen and thrombospondin (32Endemann G.

Blood. 1992; 80: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of the broad ligand specificity of CD36, multiple roles for this protein have been proposed. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that CD36 mediates a significant proportion of binding and internalization of Ox-LDL by tissue-differentiated macrophages (37Nicholson A.C. Frieda S. Pearce A. Silverstein R.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 38Huh H.Y. Pearce S.F. Yesner L.M. Schindler J.L. Silverstein R.L.

Matsuzawa Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1859-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Antibodies to CD36 have been shown to block up to 50% of the binding of Ox-LDL to, as well as its endocytic uptake by, normal monocyte-derived macrophages (37Nicholson A.C. Frieda S. Pearce A. Silverstein R.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 38Huh H.Y. Pearce S.F. Yesner L.M. Schindler J.L. Silverstein R.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2020-2028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In monocyte/macrophages from donors with a human polymorphism associated with lack of CD36 expression (Naka−), the capacity to bind and internalize Ox-LDL and the capacity to accumulate cholesteryl esters were reduced to 50% compared with those obtained from normal subjects (39Nozaki S. Kashiwagi H. Yamashita S. Nakagawa T. Kostner B. Tomiyama Y. Nakata A. Ishigami M. Miyagawa J. Kameda-Takemura K. Kurata Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1859-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Similarly, the cell association of Ox-LDL at 37 °C with, and its cell binding at 4 °C to, peritoneal macrophages obtained from CD36 null mice were reduced to 37 and 53–60%, respectively, compared with wild-type macrophages (54Febbraio M.

Furthermore, CD36 is expressed in monocytes/macrophages in the core of atherosclerotic plaques (40Nakata A. Nakagawa Y. Nishida M. Nozaki S. Miyagawa J. Nakagawa T. Tamura R. Matsumoto K. Kameda-Takemura K. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Considered together, these studies suggest that the role of CD36 in atherogenic processes might be different from that of SRA. This study was conducted to test whether AGE proteins could be recognized as ligands by CD36. The results obtained from cellular experiments using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing human CD36 (CD36-CHO cells) demonstrated a potential novel role for CD36 in the pathogenesis of AGE-induced diabetic macrovascular complications. Penicillin G (1650 IU/mg), streptomycin sulfate (750 IU/mg), G418, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Ham's F-12 medium were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Na125I (3.7 GBq/ml) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. FA6-152 (mouse anti-human CD36 monoclonal antibody) was purchased from Immunotech. MO25 (mouse anti-human CD36 monoclonal antibody) was kindly provided by Dr. G. A. Jamieson (American Red Cross). MOPC21 (mouse IgG) was purchased from Sigma. Other chemicals were of the best grade available from commercial sources. AGE-BSA was prepared as described previously (41Takata K. Horiuchi S. Araki N. Shiga M. Saitoh M. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14819-14825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.0 g of BSA was dissolved in 10 ml of 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 3.0 g of d-glucose. Each sample was sterilized by ultrafiltration, incubated at 37 °C for 40 weeks, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). The extent of lysine modification was 71% for AGE-BSA. TheN ε-(carboxymethyl)lysine content of AGE-BSA was 7.7 mol/mol of BSA (42Nagai R. Matsumoto K. Ling X. Suzuki H. Araki T. Horiuchi S. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1714-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation of human plasma from normal lipidemic subjects after overnight fasting (43Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31430-31435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mmEDTA (43Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31430-31435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare Ox-LDL, LDL was dialyzed against PBS to remove EDTA. LDL (0.1 mg/ml) was then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C with 5 μm CuSO4, followed by addition of 1 mm EDTA and cooling (43Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31430-31435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobilities of AGE-BSA preparations toward the anode were 1.4 times higher than those of unmodified BSA. Under identical conditions, Ox-LDL showed a similar increase in electrophoretic mobilities. Thus, the modification of BSA with glucose is associated with a significant increase in the net negative charge (42Nagai R. Matsumoto K. Ling X. Suzuki H. Araki T. Horiuchi S. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1714-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). AGE-BSA was labeled with 125I by IODO-GEN (Pierce), and Ox-LDL was labeled as described by McFarlane (44McFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 182: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar) to specific radioactivities of 850 and 400 cpm/ng, respectively. CHO-K1 cells were maintained at 37 °C in medium A (Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin) containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cDNA of human CD36 was amplified from a human placenta cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: sense, 5′-CTCCAAGCTTAGAAAAATGGGCTGTGAC-3′; and antisense, 5′-GCATGCGGCCGCATTTGTGCTATTGTTACA-3′. The amplified human CD36 cDNA was subcloned into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen), sequenced, and transfected into CHO-K1 cells by the electroporation method using a Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad). To select CD36-positive colonies, cells were cultured in medium B (medium A supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418). Positive clones (CD36-CHO cells) detected by immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-CD36 monoclonal antibody FA6-152 were selected and maintained as a stock culture in medium B, which selects against cells that spontaneously lose expression of CD36. Human platelets (a positive control) were prepared using NycoPrep® (Nycomed Pharma AS, Oslo, Norway). Blood obtained from a healthy consenting human volunteer who had not received any medication for at least 1 week was anticoagulated with 1 mm EDTA. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 600 × g for 15 min at room temperature. Washed platelets were then isolated from platelet-rich plasma using NycoPrep® 1.063. The cells were collected and solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) (Tris-buffered saline) containing 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Samples (50 μg of protein/lane) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and then electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline/Tween) for 2 h. The membrane was then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-CD36 monoclonal antibody (MO25) in Tris-buffered saline/Tween for 1 h and washed with the same buffer three times. Immunoreactive bands were detected by incubation with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) for 45 min, followed by addition of ECL reagent. For CD36 immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were cultured in a 4-well LAB-TEK®chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) for 16 h, washed three times with 0.01 m PBS (pH 7.4), fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 20 min, and washed again with PBS. The cells were then blocked with 5% BSA at room temperature and incubated with anti-CD36 antibody (FA6-152) diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h, followed by sequential incubation with FluoroLink Cy2-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) diluted 1:1000. The specimens were mounted using Dako fluorescent mounting medium after washing and examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (FLUOVIEW, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Immunofluorescent flow cytometric analysis was performed using a mouse monoclonal antibody against CD36 (FA6-152). Cells (1 × 106 cells in 200 μl) were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated FA6-152 (final concentration of 2.0 μg/ml) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse IgG1 (final concentration of 2.0 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 30 min and assayed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson) as previously reported (46Matsumoto K. Hirano K. Nozaki S. Takamoto A. Nishida M. Nakagawa-Toyama Y. Janabi M.Y. Ohya T. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Appropriate cell fractions for the analysis were selected using a two-dimensional display of forward scatter and side scatter of analyzed cells. Except for the binding study, all cellular experiments were performed at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Untransfected CHO cells were cultured in medium A containing 10% fetal calf serum, and CD36-CHO cells were cultured in medium B. Cells (8 × 104) were seeded in a 24-well plate and cultured for 2 days in 1.0 ml of medium B (for CD36-CHO cells) or medium A containing 10% fetal calf serum (for untransfected CHO cells), which was then replaced by medium C (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3% BSA). After culture for 1 h, each well received 0.5 ml of medium C containing various concentrations of 125I-Ox-LDL or125I-AGE-BSA in the presence or absence of 20-fold excess amounts of the unlabeled ligand to be tested. After incubation for the indicated times, the medium was taken from each well, and soluble radioactivity in trichloroacetic acid was determined as an index of cellular degradation as described previously (3Araki N. Ueno N. Chakrabarti B. Morino Y. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10211-10214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of medium C and then three more times with PBS, they were lysed with 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C, and the cell-associated radioactivity and cellular proteins were determined with the BCA protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). For the binding study, cells that had been seeded in each well as described above were incubated for 90 min at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of medium C with various concentrations of 125I-AGE-BSA in the presence or absence of 20-fold excess amounts of the unlabeled ligands. Each well was washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 3% BSA and a further three times with PBS. The cells were lysed, and the cell-bound radioactivity and cellular proteins were determined as described above. CD36-CHO cells, which stably express human CD36, were prepared as described above. To confirm overexpression of CD36, we performed Western blotting with anti-CD36 monoclonal antibody (MO25). Human platelets, which express a significant amount of CD36, were used as a positive control. Wild-type CHO cells did not yield any bands, whereas CD36-CHO cells showed a distinctive band (Fig.1 A). We performed further flow cytometric analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-CD36 monoclonal antibody (FA6-152). Human CD36 was expressed on the cell surface of CD36-CHO cells, but not wild-type CHO cells (Fig. 1,B and C). Control IgG showed no immunofluorescence (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether CD36 expressed by these cells was functional or not, the cell association and endocytic degradation of Ox-LDL by CD36-CHO cells were compared with untransfected wild-type CHO cells. The specific cell association of 125I-Ox-LDL with, and its specific degradation by, CD36-CHO cells exhibited a dose-dependent saturation pattern, with specific association showing a maximal level of 175 ng/mg of cell protein; the apparent K d for cell association was 0.7 μg/ml, and the maximal ligand association was 193.4 ng/mg of cell protein (Fig. 2). The specific degradation of 125I-Ox-LDL reached a plateau at >175 ng/mg of cell protein; the apparent K d for degradation was 0.7 μg/ml, and the maximal ligand degradation was 232.6 ng/mg of cell protein (Fig. 2). Parallel experiments in untransfected cells (Fig. 2) and mock-transfected CHO cells showed that the cell association of 125I-Ox-LDL and its endocytic degradation occurred at a negligible level (data not shown). These results indicate that CD36 expressed on CD36-CHO cells serves as a receptor for Ox-LDL.Figure 2Endocytic uptake of 125I-Ox-LDL by CD36-CHO cells. Cells were incubated for 5 h in 0.5 ml of medium C with increasing concentrations of 125I-Ox-LDL in the presence (▪) or absence (●) of 20-fold excess amounts of the unlabeled ligands. The amounts of cell-associated125I-Ox-LDL (upper panels) and its degradation (lower panels) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The specific cell association and degradation (▴) were plotted after correcting for nonspecific cell association and degradation. Data represent the means of three separate experiments. Error bars represent S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We determined the endocytic uptake and degradation of 125I-AGE-BSA by CD36-CHO cells at 37 °C. The amount of cell association of 125I-AGE-BSA with CD36-CHO cells increased in a dose-dependent manner and was almost competed away by a 20-fold excess of unlabeled AGE-BSA (Fig.3). The specific cell association exhibited a dose-dependent saturation pattern with a plateau level of 140 ng/mg of cell protein, an apparentK d of 4.1 μg/ml, and a maximal ligand association of 215.1 ng/mg of cell protein. This level was >3.5-fold higher than that of specific cell association with wild-type CHO cells, which showed only a slight cell association for AGE-BSA (Fig. 3). The degradation of 125I-AGE-BSA by the transfected cells was also significant. The specific degradation was increased dose-dependently, with a plateau level of 38 ng/mg of cell protein; the apparent K d for degradation was 3.9 μg/ml, and the maximal ligand degradation was 52.6 ng/mg of cell protein (Fig. 3). In sharp contrast, untransfected cells did not degrade 125I-AGE-BSA at all under the same conditions (Fig.3). Furthermore, mock-transfected CHO cells also demonstrated no endocytic degradation of 125I-AGE-BSA (data not shown). This result disclosed a novel function of CD36 as a receptor for AGE-BSA. We attempted to determine the cellular binding of 125I-AGE-BSA to CD36-CHO cells at 4 °C. The total binding of125I-AGE-BSA was inhibited by 80% by an excess amount of unlabeled AGE-BSA. The specific binding, obtained by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding, yielded a saturation pattern. Scatchard analysis of this specific binding disclosed a binding site with an apparent K d of 5.6 μg/ml and maximal surface binding of 130 ng/mg of cell protein, indicating that CD36-CHO cells possess a high affinity binding site for AGE-BSA (Fig.4). The K d value of Ox-LDL for CD36 was 3.1 μg/ml (data not shown). To examine whether the recognition site for AGE-BSA in CD36-CHO cells was identical to that for Ox-LDL, we studied the effect of Ox-LDL on the cellular binding of125I-AGE-BSA to CD36-CHO cells at 4 °C. The cellular binding of 125I-AGE-BSA to CD36-CHO cells was effectively (60%) replaced by unlabeled AGE-BSA, whereas unlabeled Ox-LDL had a slightly weaker effect (30%). Unlabeled LDL (used as a negative control) was ineffective in suppressing the cellular binding of AGE-BSA (Fig. 5 A). We further studied the effect of Ox-LDL on the endocytic uptake of125I-AGE-BSA by CD36-CHO cells at 37 °C. The cell association of 125I-AGE-BSA with CD36-CHO cells was effectively (>80%) replaced by unlabeled AGE-BSA, whereas unlabeled Ox-LDL had a slightly weaker effect (<40%). Unlabeled LDL (the negative control) was ineffective in suppressing the cell associat"
https://openalex.org/W2048235174,"Infection of host cells by viruses leads to the activation of multiple signaling pathways, resulting in the expression of host genes involved in the establishment of the antiviral state. Among the transcription factors mediating the immediate response to virus is interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) which is post-translationally modified as a result of virus infection. Phosphorylation of latent cytoplasmic IRF-3 on serine and threonine residues in the C-terminal region leads to dimerization, cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation, association with the p300/CBP coactivator, and stimulation of DNA binding and transcriptional activities. We now demonstrate that IRF-3 is a phosphoprotein that is uniquely activated via virus-dependent C-terminal phosphorylation. Paramyxoviridae including measles virus and rhabdoviridae, vesicular stomatitis virus, are potent inducers of a unique virus-activated kinase activity. In contrast, stress inducers, growth factors, DNA-damaging agents, and cytokines do not induce C-terminal IRF-3 phosphorylation, translocation or transactivation, but rather activate a MAPKKK-related signaling pathway that results in N-terminal IRF-3 phosphorylation. The failure of numerous well characterized pharmacological inhibitors to abrogate virus-induced IRF-3 phosphorylation suggests the involvement of a novel kinase activity in IRF-3 regulation by viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2153566250,"The ectodermal dysplasia receptor (EDAR) is a recently isolated member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that has been shown to play a key role in the process of ectodermal differentiation. We present evidence that EDAR is capable of activating the nuclear factor-κB, JNK, and caspase-independent cell death pathways and that these activities are impaired in mutants lacking its death domain or those associated with anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and the downless phenotype. Although EDAR possesses a death domain, it did not interact with the death domain-containing adaptor proteins TRADD and FADD. EDAR successfully interacted with various TRAF family members; however, a dominant-negative mutant of TRAF2 was incapable of blocking EDAR-induced nuclear factor-κB or JNK activation. Collectively, the above results suggest that EDAR utilizes a novel signal transduction pathway. Finally, ectodysplasin A can physically interact with the extracellular domain of EDAR and thus represents its biological ligand.

Pinheiro M. Ectodermal Dysplasias: A Clinical and Genetic Study. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1984Google Scholar). A similar phenotype is seen in mice with mutations involving thedownless locus, suggesting the existence of a common underlying genetic defect. Recently, mutations in EDAR,1 a novel receptor of the TNFR family, were found in several families with autosomal dominant and recessive forms of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and indownless mice (2Monreal A.W. Ferguson B.M. Headon D.J. Street S.L. Overbeek P.A. Zonana J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 3Headon D.J. Overbeek P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Although the above studies established the role of EDAR in ectodermal differentiation, the signaling pathways activated by this receptor remain to be elucidated. Death domain-containing receptors of the TNFR family are believed to activate two main signaling cascades: a kinase cascade leading to NF-κB and JNK activation and a caspase cascade leading to cell death (4Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). As the cytoplasmic domain of EDAR was reported to contain a region with partial homology to the death domain, we decided to test its abilities to activate the above signaling cascades (2Monreal A.W. Ferguson B.M. Headon D.J. Street S.L. Overbeek P.A. Zonana J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 3Headon D.J. Overbeek P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence that, like the classical death domain-containing receptors, EDAR is capable of activating the NF-κB, JNK, and cell death pathways. However, EDAR does not interact with the death domain-containing adaptor proteins TRADD or FADD and does not activate the caspase cascade. Our results suggest the existence of a novel signaling pathway utilized by EDAR. 293T and MCF7 cells were obtained from Dr. David Han (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). 293 EBNA cells were obtained from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against FLAG, Myc, and hemagglutinin tags were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. FLAG beads and control beads were obtained from Sigma. The pull-down kinase assay kit for JNK was obtained from New England Biolabs Inc., and the constructs for the Pathdetect luciferase reporter assay were purchased from Stratagene. YOPRO-1 was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. Synthetic caspase inhibitors (Z-VAD-fmk and t-butoxycarbonyl-Asp-fmk) were purchased from Calbiochem. EDAR cDNA encoding amino acids 22–448 was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using normal prostate RNA as a template. The primers used for amplification also carried restriction enzyme sites at their 5′ termini. The amplified product was subsequently cloned in a modified pSecTagA vector carrying a FLAG epitope tag downstream of the murine Igκ signal peptide. The above FLAG-EDAR construct was used to generate deletion mutants EDARΔC223, EDARΔC164, and EDARΔC94 by taking advantage of the naturally occurring SmaI,SalI, and XhoI sites in the EDAR cytoplasmic domain, whereas the deletion mutant EDARΔC38 was generated using a custom primer containing an XbaI site. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Quick-Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and using the FLAG-EDAR plasmid as a template. To generate the EDAR immunoadhesin (EDAR Fc), the 5′-fragment of the FLAG-EDAR construct containing the signal peptide, the FLAG epitope, and nucleotides encoding the extracellular domain of EDAR (amino acids 21–177) was amplified using custom primers. The resulting product was cloned upstream of the Fc portion (amino acids 236–462) of the murine Ig heavy chain. This construct also carried a C-terminal FLAG tag. A murine TAJ immunoadhesin construct (mTAJ-Fc) was generated similarly by fusing the extracellular ligand-binding domain of murine TAJ protein (amino acids 1–172) to the Fc portion of the murine Ig heavy chain. To construct Myc-EDA I the nucleotide sequence corresponding to amino acids 134–391 of the EDA-A1 isoform was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using total RNA derived from human prostate gland as a template. The upstream primer used for amplification was 5′-CGCGGGATCCCGCCCTATTGAATTTCTTC-3′, and the downstream primer used was 5′-CGCGGTCGACCTAGGATGCAGGGGCTTCAC-3′. The amplified product was digested with BamHI and SalI enzymes and subsequently cloned into a modified pFastBAC1 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.), which contained a Myc epitope tag downstream of a baculovirus gp67 signal peptide. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by automated fluorescent sequencing. Constructs encoding NIK and its mutants (5Natoli G. Costanzo A. Moretti F. Fulco M. Balsano C. Levrero M. J. Biol.

The dominant-negative IKK1 mutant was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Gaynor. 293T cells (3 × 105) were transfected with 2 μg of various constructs in each well of a six-well plate. After 36 h, nuclear extracts were prepared, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed essentially as described previously (9Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The NF-κB reporter assay was performed essentially as described previously (9Chaudhary P.M. Jasmin A. Eby M.T. Hood L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5738-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected in duplicate in a 24-well plate with the various test plasmids along with an NF-κB/luciferase reporter construct (75 ng/well) and a Rous sarcoma virus promoter-driven β-galactosidase reporter construct (pRcRSV/LacZ; 75 ng). Twenty-four to thirty hours later, cells were lysed, and extracts were used for the measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities, respectively. Luciferase activity was normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity to control for the difference in the transfection efficiency. For the c-Jun transcriptional activation assay, 293 EBNA cells (1.2 × 105) were transfected in duplicate with various expression constructs (500 ng) along with a fusion transactivator plasmid containing the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to transcription factor c-Jun (pFA-c-Jun) (50 ng), a reporter plasmid encoding the luciferase gene downstream of the Gal4 upstream activating sequence (pFR-luc) (500 ng), as well as a Rous sarcoma virus/LacZ (β-galactosidase) reporter construct (75 ng). Cells were lysed 24 h later, and luciferase assay was performed as described previously (10Chaudhary P.M. Eby M.T. Jasmin A. Hood L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19211-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For studying in vivo interaction, 2 × 106 293T cells were plated in a 100-mm plate and cotransfected 18–24 h later with 5 μg/plate of each epitope-tagged construct by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. A hemagglutinin-tagged green fluorescent protein-encoding plasmid was also included in some experiments. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and one EDTA-free mini-protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)/10 ml. Cell lysates (500 μl) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of FLAG or control mouse Ig beads precoated with a supersaturated casein solution. Beads were washed twice with lysis buffer; twice with wash buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), and 500 mm NaCl; and again with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by Western blotting. Essentially a similar procedure was used for experiments involving coimmunoprecipitation of TRADD and TRAFs, except cells were lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA, and the beads were washed extensively in the above buffer containing 1 mNaCl. 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding EDAR and TAJ immunoadhesins, and 12 h post-transfection, the medium was changed to 293SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Supernatants containing the secreted immunoadhesin were collected 48 h later and stored in aliquots at −70 °C until use. Myc-EDA I protein was produced by infection of Sf9 insect cells with the corresponding baculovirus construct following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Supernatant containing the secreted protein was collected 48 h post-infection, filtered, and stored at −70 °C until use. For coimmunoprecipitation assay, equal volumes (500 μl) of the immunoadhesin and Myc-EDA supernatants were mixed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle shaking. Supernatants were subsequently divided into two halves and immunoprecipitated with goat anti-mouse IgG1 beads (Sigma) or control antibody beads precoated with supersaturated casein solution. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by Western blotting. For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 5 μl of a control supernatant or the supernatant containing Myc-EDA I were immobilized overnight at 4 °C in the wells of a microwell plate in Na2CO3/NaHCO3 buffer (pH 9.6). After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween (TBST), 5 μl of supernatants containing FLAG-tagged immunoadhesins (or a control supernatant) diluted in Tris-buffered saline were added to the wells and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. After washing, goat anti-mouse peroxidase (1:2000 in TBST) was added for 1 h. Color was developed using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma), and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm. We began by testing the ability of EDAR to activate an NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter construct upon transient transfection in 293T cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, transfection of EDAR in these cells led to significant activation of the NF-κB pathway that was comparable in magnitude to that induced by TNFR1. In comparison, TAJ/TROY, another TNFR family member that is highly expressed in skin during embryonic development (11Eby M.T. Jasmin A. Kumar A. Sharma K. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15336-15342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Kojima T. Morikawa Y. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Senba E. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20742-20747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), failed to activate the NF-KB pathway. NF-κB activation by EDAR was further confirmed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 1 B). TRAF2 has been known to mediate NF-κB activation by various TNFR family members, and TANK/I-TRAF has been known to regulate this process (13Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the roles of TRAF2 and TANK/I-TRAF in the activation of the NF-κB pathway by EDAR. An N-terminal deletion mutant of TRAF2 (14Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) that could effectively block NF-κB activation by CD40 was ineffective in blocking NF-κB induction by EDAR (Fig.2 A). Similarly, EDAR-induced NF-κB activation was not affected by coexpression of TANK/I-TRAF (Fig. 2 A). Collectively, these results suggest either that TRAF2 and TANK/I-TRAF are not involved in NF-κB activation via EDAR or that they play a functionally redundant role in this process. We have also tested the ability of dominant-negative mutants of the receptor-interacting protein and TRADD to block EDAR-induced NF-κB, but have failed to observe any significant inhibitory effect (data not shown). The NIK and IKK serine/threonine kinases have been shown to be involved in the activation of the NF-κB pathway by the members of the TNFR and interleukin-1 receptor families (15Verma I.M. Stevenson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11758-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To determine the role of these proteins in EDAR-induced NF-κB activation, we took advantage of the dominant-negative inhibitors of these kinases. As shown in Fig.2 B, a C-terminal deletion mutant (NIK-2101) and a catalytic site mutant (NIK-K429R) of NIK could effectively block NF-κB induced by EDAR. However, a dominant-negative mutant of MEKK1 (MEKK1-D1369A), a related MAPK, failed to block EDAR-, CD40-, or TNFR1-induced NF-κB, suggesting the specificity of the observed effect. EDAR-induced NF-κB activation was also effectively blocked by dominant-negative mutants of IKK1 (IKK1-K44M) and IKK2 (IKK2-K44M), respectively (Fig.2 C). As IKKs function by mediating inducible phosphorylation and degradation of IκB proteins, we tested the ability of a dominant-negative mutant of IκBα (IκBα-S32A/S36A) to block NF-κB induction by EDAR. This mutant contains serine-to-alanine substitutions at amino acids 32 and 36, respectively, and is resistant to phosphorylation-induced degradation of IκBα (16Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 D, NF-κB induction by EDAR was effectively blocked by IκBα-S32A/S36A. Taken together, the above results suggest that EDAR activates NF-κB by NIK- and IKK-induced phosphorylation and degradation of the IκBα protein. We used C-terminal deletion mutagenesis to map the domain of EDAR responsible for NF-κB activation. Deletion mutants EDARΔC38 and EDARΔC94, which are missing the C-terminal 38 and 94 amino acids, respectively, were only minimally effective in NF-κB activation (Fig.3, A and B). The EDARΔC38 mutant possesses a partial death domain, whereas the EDARΔC94 mutant is missing it entirely (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that the death domain plays a crucial role in NF-κB activation by EDAR. A complete lack of NF-κB activation was also observed upon expression of mutants EDARΔC164 and EDARΔC223, which are missing additional C-terminal sequences of the cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 3, A and B). We next tested whether two EDAR mutations seen in association with anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia could affect the ability of EDAR to activate the NF-κB pathway. The E379K mutation is an autosomal recessive mutation in the death domain of murine EDAR and is responsible for the spontaneous downless Jacksonphenotype, whereas the R420Q mutation has been detected in the death domain of human EDAR in a family with autosomal dominant anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (2Monreal A.W. Ferguson B.M. Headon D.J. Street S.L. Overbeek P.A. Zonana J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 3Headon D.J. Overbeek P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We used site-directed mutagenesis to generate the corresponding mutants of the human EDAR gene. As shown in Fig. 3 (B and C), whereas the E379K mutant retained significant residual ability to activate the NF-κB pathway, the R420Q mutant demonstrated a more severe loss of this activity. These results suggest that the recessive phenotype of the E379K mutant may be due to the need for two mutant alleles to significantly influence NF-κB signaling. We would like to further point out that, in addition to the R420Q mutation, a nonsense mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of EDAR has also been detected in a family with autosomal dominant anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (2Monreal A.W. Ferguson B.M. Headon D.J. Street S.L. Overbeek P.A. Zonana J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This mutation (R358ter) results in the production of a truncated protein that is missing the C-terminal 90 amino acid residues and that closely resembles the deletion mutant EDARΔC94, which failed to activate the NF-κB pathway (Fig. 3, A and B). Taken together, the above results suggest that the impaired ability to activate NF-κB may be a key determinant in the pathogenesis of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. In addition to NF-κB activation, different members of the TNFR family are also known to activate the JNK pathway. Therefore, we tested the ability of EDAR to activate this pathway using a luciferase-based c-Jun transcriptional activation assay. In this assay, luciferase expression is driven by JNK-mediated phosphorylation of the activation domain of transcription factor c-Jun that is fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. As shown in Fig. 4 A, expression of EDAR in the 293 EBNA cells led to modest activation of the JNK pathway. In contrast to the situation with NF-κB activation, the JNK-inducing ability of EDAR was relatively weak as compared with that of TAJ/TROY. Activation of the JNK pathway by EDAR was further confirmed using a pull-down kinase assay based on in vitro phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun (Fig. 4 B). We used deletion and point mutagenesis to map the region of the EDAR cytoplasmic domain responsible for JNK activation. These studies revealed that, although the EDARΔC38 and EDARΔC94 deletion mutant have some residual JNK activation ability, almost a complete lack of this ability is present in deletion mutants EDARΔC164 and EDARΔC223 (Fig. 4 C). Thus, the putative death domain of EDAR is essential for both NF-κB and JNK activation. Finally, we tested the ability of the two EDAR mutants known to be associated with anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia to activate the JNK pathway. As in the situation with NF-κB activation, the E379K mutant was almost half as effective as the wild-type protein in JNK activation, whereas a more severe impairment of JNK activation was seen with the R420Q mutant. TRAF2 has been shown to play an essential role in JNK activation via various members of the TNFR family (17Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 18Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig.4 D, a dominant-negative mutant of TRAF2 that could effectively block CD40-induced JNK activation failed to block JNK activation via EDAR. These results suggest either that TRAF2 is not involved in JNK activation via EDAR or that it plays a functionally redundant role in this process. Finally, EDAR-induced JNK activation was effectively blocked by the JNK-binding domain of JIP1 (Fig.4 E), a recently described inhibitor of the JNK pathway (19Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). As discussed above, EDAR is known to possess a region in its cytoplasmic domain with partial sequence homology to the “death domain” present in the apoptosis-inducing members of the TNFR family. Previous studies have demonstrated that transient transfection of EDA, the putative ligand for EDAR, in MCF7 cells leads to cellular rounding and detachment, which are not inhibited by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (20Bayes M. Hartung A.J. Ezer S. Pispa J. Thesleff I. Srivastava A.K. Kere J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Ezer S. Schlessinger D. Srivastava A. Kere J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1581-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, transient transfection of EDAR in 293T, 293 EBNA, or MCF7 cells led to cellular rounding and detachment, two features suggestive of cell death (Fig.5, A–C). However, unlike TNFR1-transfected cells, cellular rounding and detachment were relatively delayed features of EDAR-transfected cells (24versus 30 h). Finally, unlike TNFR1-transfected cells, those cells transfected with EDAR failed to demonstrate membrane budding, a feature associated with caspase-dependent cell death (Fig. 5 A). We were next interested in testing whether EDAR-expressing cells actually undergo cell death. To test this hypothesis, we used nuclear staining with YOPRO-1, a cell-impermeable DNA-intercalating dye. As shown in Fig. 5 D, although the majority of vector-transfected cells failed to show nuclear staining with this dye, a large number of EDAR-transfected cells stained positively, suggesting a lack of membrane integrity indicative of cell death. However, unlike the TNFR1-transfected cells, those cells dying in response to EDAR failed to show nuclear fragmentation, another key feature of caspase-dependent cell death (Fig. 5 D). The lack of caspase activation during EDAR-induced cell death was characterized further by using several known inhibitors of this pathway. EDAR-induced cell death was not blocked by Z-VAD-fmk andt-butoxycarbonyl-Asp-fmk, two synthetic cell-permeable caspase inhibitors, and by CrmA and p35, two virally encoded caspase inhibitors. In contrast, all these caspase inhibitors effectively blocked cell death induced by TNFR1 (Fig.6, A and B). Similarly, EDAR-induced cell death was not blocked by MRIT/cFLIP, MC159L, and dominant-negative mutants of caspase-8 (caspase-8-C360S) and FADD, suggesting that EDAR uses a FADD- and caspase-8-independent pathway for inducing cell death (Fig. 6 C). Finally, EDAR-induced cell death was not blocked by a dominant-negative IκBα mutant or JBD-JIP1, suggesting the lack of involvement of the NF-κB and JNK pathways in this process (data not shown). Caspase-3 is one of the executioner caspases of the caspase cascade and is activated during apoptosis induced by death receptors belonging to the TNFR1 family (22Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). We used a chromogenic assay, based on caspase-3-mediated cleavage of the chromogenic substrate Z-DEVD-p-nitroanilide, to test the activation of caspase-3 during EDAR-induced cell death. As shown in Fig.6 D, cell lysates from TNFR1- or DR4-transfected cells demonstrated caspase-3 activation, whereas EDAR-transfected cells failed to do so. Collectively, the above results suggest that cellular rounding and eventual cell death induced by EDAR overexpression are not mediated by a caspase-dependent mechanism. We used deletion and point mutagenesis to map the region in the EDAR cytoplasmic domain responsible for induction of cell death. As shown in Fig. 6 E, the EDARΔC38 deletion mutant, which retains a partial death domain, demonstrated significant residual ability to induce cell death, whereas the EDARΔC94 mutant, which completely lacks the death domain, possessed only a minor cell death-inducing ability. However, a complete lack of this activity was present in the deletion mutants lacking the death domain, such as EDARΔC164 and EDARΔC223. Finally, the point mutants E379K and R420Q demonstrated significant residual cell death-inducing ability. The death domain-containing adaptor proteins TRADD and FADD have been shown to play an essential role in signaling via various death domain-containing receptors of the TNFR family (4Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of these proteins to interact with EDAR using a coimmunoprecipitation assay. EDAR failed to coimmunoprecipitate FADD and TRADD when overexpressed with them in 293T cells (Fig.7, A and B). Control experiments, performed in parallel, confirmed successful coimmunoprecipitation of FADD with Fas and TRADD with TNFR1, thereby demonstrating the validity of the assay. In addition to the death domain-containing adaptor proteins, different members of TRAF family have been shown to interact with various members of the TNFR family (13Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of these proteins to interact with EDAR using coimmunoprecipitation assay. EDAR successfully coimmunoprecipitated murine TRAF1, murine TRAF2, and TRAF3 when these proteins were coexpressed in 293T cells (Fig. 7,C–F). Deletion mutagenesis revealed that the C-terminal 94 amino acids, encoding the death domain, were not essential for interaction of EDAR with murine TRAF1. Consistent with this hypothesis, the death domain point mutants E79K and R420Q were as effective as the wild-type protein in coimmunoprecipitating murine TRAF1. Finally, EDAR successfully coimmunoprecipitated with NIK, a protein known to be involved in NF-κB activation by various members of the TNFR family (Fig. 7 G). However, we have so far failed to detect an interaction between a GST fusion protein containing the EDAR cytoplasmic domain and in vitro transcribed and translated TRAF2 or NIK (data not shown). Similarly, no interaction has been detected between the cytoplasmic domain of EDAR and TRAF2 or NIK using a yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown). Collectively, the above results suggest that the interaction between EDAR and TRAFs or NIK might be facilitated by the presence of intermediate bridging proteins present in the 293T cells. EDA is believed to be the ligand for EDAR based on the similarity in the clinical features of genetic disorders resulting from the mutations in these genes (2Monreal A.W. Ferguson B.M. Headon D.J.

The functional hallmarks of ECaC comprise a constitutively activated Ca2+-selective cation channel with a substantial permeability at physiological membrane potentials and a Ca2+-dependent feedback regulation of channel activity including fast inactivation and slow current decay. Interestingly, ECaC becomes permeable to monovalent cations by lowering extracellular Ca2+ to micromolar concentrations. Under these latter conditions, the single channel conductance of ECaC is ∼70 picosiemens. ECaC is most closely, albeit still distantly, related to capsaicin receptors and the trp channel family (8Kanzaki M. Nagasawa M. Kojima I. Sato C. Naruse K. Sokabe M. Iida H.

These channels function as Ca2+-permeable cation channels and contain six putative transmembrane domains, including a pore-forming region between S5 and S6. Despite their structural similarity, these channels differ from ECaC in their mechanism of activation and some of their functional properties (8Kanzaki M. Nagasawa M. Kojima I. Sato C. Naruse K.

The capsaicin receptors facilitate Ca2+influx after receptor activation, whereas the trp channels are activated after Ca2+ store depletion or phospholipase C activation. ECaC has a high selectivity for Ca2+, illustrated by PCa:PNa values of more than 100, whereas the homologous channels display in general a less eminent Ca2+ selectivity. Furthermore, the current-voltage relationship of the capsaicin receptor and trp channels displays outward rectification, whereas ECaC currents show a pronounced inward rectification. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the molecular determinants responsible for the key properties of ECaC. Only three negatively charged amino acid residues reside in the putative pore-forming region of ECaC, i.e. Glu535, Asp542, and Asp550, which are potential Ca2+-binding sites determining the conductive properties of this channel. Interestingly, these residues are absent in the other structurally related six transmembrane-spanning proteins, except for Glu535, which is conserved in the capsaicin receptor (2Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W.

We have evaluated the functional role of these negatively charged residues and show that the aspartate at position 542 is crucial for the described hallmarks of ECaC. These findings are of vital importance in our understanding of how ECaC can show an exquisite Ca2+selectivity that is relevant for the Ca2+ handling by Ca2+-absorbing epithelia and might be important to understand dysfunctioning of Ca2+ absorption.

We used this bicistronic expression vector, pCINeo/IRES-GFP/rbECaC, to coexpress rbECaC and enhanced GFP. Mutagenesis of the amino acids at positions 535, 542, and 550 was carried out using the QuickChange™ Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequences of mutants D535A, D542A, D542E, D542N, D542K, and D550A have been verified by sequencing the corresponding cDNAs. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) human serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity-controlled incubator with 10% CO2.

Whole-cell currents were measured with an EPC-9 (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) or an L/M-EPC-7 (List Elektronics, Darmstadt, Germany) using ruptured patches. Cell capacitance and access resistance were monitored continuously. The internal (pipette) solution contained 20 mm CsCl, 100 mm cesium-aspartate, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N-N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 4 mm Na2ATP, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with CsOH. The standard extracellular solution (Krebs solution) contained 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with CsOH. For measuring currents carried by various monovalent cations, NaCl was equimolarly replaced by LiCl, KCl, CsCl, or N-metnyl-d-glucamine-Cl. For increased concentrations of Ca2+, 30 mmCa2+ was added to the Krebs solution. Osmotic differences were adjusted by adding the respective concentrations of mannitol to the Krebs or Ca2+-free solutions. Cells were kept in a nominally Ca2+-free medium to prevent Ca2+ overload and exposed for a maximum of 5 min to a Krebs solution containing 1.5 mm Ca2+ before sealing the patch pipette to the cell. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20 °C–22 °C). Stimulation protocols consisted of either linear voltage ramps from −100 or −150 mV to +100 mV within 400 ms, applied every 5 s, or step protocols consisting of a series of 60-ms voltage steps applied every 5 s from a holding potential of +20 mV to voltages between +60 and −140 or −180 mV with a decrement of 40 mV. Unless stated otherwise, the sampling interval was 1 ms for the ramp protocols and 0.2 ms for the step protocol. Data were filtered at the appropriate frequency before digitization To comparing data obtained from different cells, current amplitudes were expressed per unit of cell capacitance. We measured the permeability of different monovalent cations through ECaC by the shift in the reversal potentials of the respective ion from the reversal potentials for Na+ currents, ΔErev, and calculated the permeability ration by Px/PNa=exp/(ΔErev×F/RT)Equation 1 where R, T, and F have the usual meaning. The software package ASCD (G. Droogmans, Leuven, Belgium) was used for analysis of whole-cell currents including all fitting routines. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Overall statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. In case of significance (p < 0.01), individual groups were compared by using Student's ttest. The pore region of ECaC and of the rat homologue (calcium transporter 1) contains a unique assembly of amino acids compared with the capsaicin receptors and the trp channels (Fig.1). Most striking is the presence of three conserved negatively charged amino acids in the pore consisting of a glutamate at position 535 and aspartates at positions 542 and 550, respectively (2Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W.

Fig. 2 shows the effects of mutating aspartate at position 542 for alanine on the kinetics of ECaC currents during hyperpolarizing pulses. Large and stable currents were observed in cells expressing wild-type ECaC exposed to nominally Ca2+-free solutions (Fig. 2 A, left panel), which were even enhanced if extracellular Mg2+ was further reduced by adding 0.1 mm EDTA (Fig. 2 A, right panel). The current induced by hyperpolarizing voltage pulses showed a fast decay to a smaller steady-state level in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+, which has been described as a voltage-dependent block of ECaC by Mg2+ (Fig.2 A, second panel from the left). This block was less pronounced in the presence of both Mg2+ and Ca2+, consistent with the permeation of Ca2+through ECaC (Fig. 2 A, second panel from the right). Cells expressing the D542A mutant displayed large currents, which showed intrinsic slow inactivation. In contrast to wild-type ECaC, these currents were completely independent of extracellular Mg2+and Ca2+ (Fig. 2 B). The rapid current decay component due to Mg2+ block was absent in D542A, indicating that this mutant is insensitive to block by Mg2+. This was further supported by the lack of an EDTA effect (Fig. 2 B, right panel). A more detailed analysis revealed that the permeation pattern, estimated from the currents at −80mV normalized by the size Na+ currents at this potential, of monovalent cations through D542A was also different from that of wild-type ECaC. The permeation sequence of wild-type ECaC was Eisenman X, with Na+ being more permeable than Li+ (Fig. 3 A). D542A mutants, however, were more permeable for Li+ than for Na+, which is consistent with an Eisenman XI sequence (Fig. 3, B and C). The Ca2+permeability of ECaC can be directly shown when Ca2+ is added to an extracellular solution in which all monovalent cations were substituted by N-methyl-d-glucamine+. Under these conditions, only small currents remained, which were likely Cl− currents. Administration of Ca2+ induced a large, inwardly rectifying current that reversed at very positive potentials. This current indicates Ca2+ influx through ECaC (16Hoenderop J.G.J. Müller D. Suzuki M. van Os C.H. Bindels R.J.M. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hyperten. 2000; 9: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It was completely absent in D542A. On the contrary, the background currents were even blocked in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2, C and D). Currents through wild-type ECaC showed clear inward rectification (Fig.4 A), with a density of 534 ± 137 pA/pF for 30 mm Ca2+ at −80 mV (n = 32). The reversal potential was shifted from +15 ± 2 mV in divalent cation-free solutions (n = 21) to +47 ± 3 mV (30 mm Ca2+;n = 24). For evaluation of the permeability of Ca2+, we measured the difference of the reversal potential in Ca2+-free solutions and in 30 mmCa2+-containing solution for all mutants tested. The absence or negative shift of the reversal potential indicates the absence of Ca2+ permeability. The averaged data are summarized in Fig. 4 G. The D542A mutant did not show rectification, and current densities were smaller than those in wild-type ECaC (Fig. 4, B and E) but significantly higher than those in nontransfected HEK cells (2.5 ± 0.4 pA/pF at 30 mm Ca2+ and −80 mV;n = 8), indicating that the mutant is functionally expressed. Extracellular divalent cations slightly shifted the reversal potential to more negative potentials, indicating that the D542 channels are no longer permeable for divalent cations (Fig.4 G). The rapid and Ca2+-dependent current decay during repetitive stimulations with voltage ramps, another characteristic feature of wild-type ECaC (5Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G.-J. Prenen J. Stuiver M.

The Ca2+permeability of both mutants was not significantly different from that of wild-type ECaC. Fig. 5 shows that currents through both mutants show a fast decay comparable to that of wild-type currents, although the rate of decay is faster for the E535A mutant and slower for the D550A mutant (Fig. 5 C). As in the wild type, Mg2+reduced the current at the end of the hyperpolarizing pulses for both the E535A and D550A mutant, with the block being more pronounced in E535A than in D550A (Fig. 6, A, C, and D). As shown above, the aspartate residue close to the pore is important for ECaC. A similar situation was recently described for the vanilloid receptor, in which neutralization of Asp646 reduced the permeability for Mg2+ (12Garcia-Martinez C. Morenilla-Palao C. Planells-Cases R. Merino J.M. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32552-32558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the role of this crucial site, we have mutated the aspartate residue by either glutamate, a negatively charged amino acid with a longer side chain, the polar asparagine, methionine with a longer side chain, and the positively charged lysine. As shown in Fig. 1, VR1, a nonselective channel that is also permeable for Ca2+, has a methionine residue at the same site. Therefore, we tested this special mutant to probe whether pore characteristics similar to those for VR1 could be obtained. In addition, we have studied the permeation profile for monovalent cations through these respective mutants. Results are shown in TablesI and II. All mutants express functional cation channels. The current density is significantly increased for all mutants except D542K; the current density for D542K did not differ from that seen in nontransfected HEK cells (see Table I). D542K also showed the same permeation phenotype (data not shown) as nontransfected cells, indicating that no functional channels were expressed. However, the permeation profiles for monovalent cations were clearly different in the other mutants. In nontransfected cells, the permeation sequence follows Eisenman IV for a weak field strength site (Cs > K > Na > Li). D542M expression resulted only in very small currents with an Eisenman type IV permeation profile, also indicating a weak field strength binding site for cations that is equivalent to the background cation conductance. D542E expression also resulted in small currents, but the permeation type still matched that of a high field strength binding site as observed for wild-type ECaC and also for D542N and D542A (TableII). D542N and D542A exhibited the highest current densities for monovalent cations of all mutants. However, Ca2+ permeation was lacking in all mutants, as indicated by the absence of a positive shift in reversal potential on adding extracellular Ca2+(Fig. 4 G). This lack of Ca2+ permeation is also manifested by the absence of any current increase when 30 mm Ca2+ was added to a cation-free solution (same experiment as in Fig. 2, C and D; data not shown; D542A, n = 4; D542N, n = 6; D542E, n = 4; D542M, n = 6). In addition, the rapid Ca2+-dependent current decay was attenuated in E, N, and M substitutions (data not shown).

Open table in a new tab Currents were measured in the absence of divalent cations at −80 mV (ramp protocol). Relative permeability for various monovalent cations trough ECaC as measured from reversal potential shifts (Eq. 1). Shifts were always measured from the same cells. The present study demonstrates that a single aspartate residue located in the putative pore region of ECaC is crucial for its key features including a high Ca2+ permeability, block by Mg2+, and Ca2+-dependent current decay. These properties are essential for ECaC functioning in Ca2+ (re)absorption in the kidney, intestine, and placenta. The putative pore region of ECaC contains three negatively charged amino acids that are conserved among different species (17Ugate G. Pérez F. Latorre R. Biol. Res. 1998; 31: 17-32PubMed Google Scholar). Our data clearly show that Asp542 is an important molecular determinant of Ca2+ selectivity and Ca2+permeation through ECaC. The effects of an extension of the side chain length of this negative residue (D542E) indicate that not only the negative charge but also a steric factor controlled by the length of that side chain is important. Unexpectedly, the currents through the D542E mutants are much smaller than those for the Ala and Asn mutant. They are similar in size for the D542M mutants. D542M showed very small currents. These data, together with the permeation sequence similar to the background cation conductance, may indicate that D542M might be even nonfunctional. It is likely that the longer side chain in the D542M mutants may hinder permeation of Ca2+ and decrease the field strength of the monovalent binding site (Eisenman IV). Exchange of aspartate for an uncharged but polar amino acid (D542N) had similar effects, indicating that the electronegative oxygen of this side chain (at physiological pH) cannot substitute for the negative charge of aspartate. These findings indicate that both the charge and the length of the side chain at position 542 are essential for Ca2+ permeability. Under physiological conditions, ECaC transports Ca2+efficiently with a high degree of selectivity over monovalent cations (5Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G.-J. Prenen J. Stuiver M. Willems P.H.G.M. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3963-3969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Permeation of monovalent cations follows the Eisenman X sequence, indicating a strong field strength binding site (6Nilius B. Vennekens R. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G.J. Bindels J.M. Droogmans G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 527: 239-248Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Mutation of Asp542 into an alanine induced a shift in the permeability for monovalent cations from Eisenman X to Eisenman XI, indicating that, in contrast with the permeation of Ca2+, the binding of monovalent cations is not influenced, or that the field strength of the binding site is even increased. There is no evidence for additional negatively charged residues in the pore region. The existence of a second putative binding site for Ca2+ in another region of the pore is therefore unlikely. It is therefore difficult to reconcile the observed anomalous mole fraction behavior of ECaC (5Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G.-J. Prenen J. Stuiver M. Willems P.H.G.M. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3963-3969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) with the two-binding site model used to describe Ca2+ selectivity and high Ca2+permeability of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. It is remarkable that substitution of aspartate at position 542 by glutamate attenuated the Ca2+ permeability of ECaC because conserved glutamate residues form the high-affinity binding site in voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. The pore region of the vanilloid receptor family is homologous to ECaC but lacks the aspartate at 542, which may explain the observed low Ca2+ selectivity of these channels (9Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7144) Google Scholar, 10Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Instead, methionine is placed at this site. The D542M mutation in ECaC only resulted in small currents. The pore is still permeable for monovalent cations with an Eisenman type IV permeation sequence, indicating a weaker field strength binding site than that seen for all the other mutants. However, in contrast with VR1, which is permeable for Ca2+ and Mg2+, the mutant D542M channel is impermeable for Ca2+, indicating that the mechanism of permeation through the ECaC pore is different from that of VR1. It is interesting that a homologous member of this family cloned from rat intestine, calcium transporter 1, contains an additional negative aspartate between the two aspartate residues at positions 542 and 550 (16Hoenderop J.G.J. Müller D. Suzuki M. van Os C.H. Bindels R.J.M. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hyperten. 2000; 9: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This additional aspartate could produce subtle differences in Ca2+ permeability of these channels with important implications for Ca2+ handling in the respective tissues, but electrophysiological data about calcium transporter 1 are currently lacking to substantiate this concept. Obviously, aspartate at position 542 is also essential for Mg2+ binding and channel block. In addition, Mg2+ block of the monovalent current through ECaC still persists when the side chain of the negatively charged residue is prolonged (D542E) or by substitution of the aspartate into the polar asparagine (D542N). Thus, the structure of the Mg2+-binding site may differ from that of the Ca2+-binding site. The fact that E535A increases and D550A decreases the block by Mg2+ indicates that Mg2+ binding to the essential Asp542 site is modulated by these adjacent negative charges. In conclusion, the molecular determinants of Ca2+selectivity and permeation of ECaC appear to reside at a single aspartate residue in the pore region, a role that is played by glutamate residues in voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the selectivity filter for Ca2+ in ECaC might also consist of a ring of four negatively charged residues in a tetrameric pore molecule. Consequently, single mutations in the pore of ECaC would cause defective channels, which would be unable to perform a significant Ca2+ absorptive function. It will certainly be challenging to search for such mutants in patients with familiar malabsorption of Ca2+. We thank Dr. J. Eggermont for providing the IRES-GFP vector and M. Crabbé, H. Van Weijenbergh, and M. Schuermans for help with the cell culture."

AQP3 and AQP4 are expressed constitutively at the basolateral membrane of collecting duct epithelial cells, with AQP3 mainly in cortical collecting duct and AQP4 in inner medullary collecting duct. Transgenic mice lacking AQP3 have low water permeability in cortical collecting duct and manifest NDI with marked polyuria and decreased urine osmolality (17Ma T. Song Y. Yang B. Gillespie A.

In contrast, mice lacking AQP4 show only a mild defect in urinary concentrating ability (18Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin.

Although animal models exist of NDI caused by abnormalities in neurohypophysial vasopressin secretion, such as the Brattleboro rat (20Saito T. Ishikawa S. Sasaki S. Higashiyama M. Nagasaka S.

Physiol. 2000; 279: F370-F382PubMed Google Scholar), there are no animal models of renal AQP2 deficiency/mutation.The AQP2 point mutation T126M was identified as a cause of non-X-linked recessive NDI in humans (22Mulders S.M. Knoers N.V. Van Lieburg A.F. Monnens L.A. Leumann E. Wuhl E. Schober E. Rijss J.P. Van Os C.H. Deen P.M.T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 242-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In transfected mammalian cells, AQP2-T126M protein is retained at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and degraded more rapidly than wild-type AQP2 (23Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We also showed recently that ER-retained AQP2-T126M is mildly misfolded but functional (24Tamarappoo B.K. Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34825-34831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Treatment of transfected cells with chemical chaperones such as glycerol resulted in relocation of AQP2-T126M to the cell plasma membrane where it was able to function as a water channel and correct the defective cell phenotype (23Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 24Tamarappoo B.K. Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34825-34831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Chemical chaperones or other agents that modify interactions with molecular chaperones were proposed as possible therapies for NDI. However therapy development requires demonstration that disease-causing AQP2 mutants are ER-retained in native kidney cells and that chaperone-modifying strategies are effective in vivo.The purpose of this study was to generate and characterize a mouse model of recessive NDI caused by AQP2 mutation. We previously isolated and analyzed the mouse AQP2 cDNA and gene and showed that the mouse AQP2-T126M ortholog behaved like human AQP2-T126M in its ER localization, function, and correction by chemical chaperones (25Yang B. Ma T. Xu Z. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1999; 57: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The homozygous AQP2-T126M knock-in mice created here had NDI and expressed the mutant AQP2 protein in collecting duct epithelial cells, as engineered, but the mice had an unexpectedly severe phenotype with neonatal mortality.RESULTSTargeted gene replacement in embryonic stem cells was done to replace wild-type AQP2 with AQP2-T126M. As shown in Fig.1, a positive-negative selection strategy was used in which a loxP-flanked polII-neo selection cassette was introduced in intron 2. In addition to the T126M mutation, mutations H122S, N124S, and A125T were engineered in exon 2 of the coding sequence to preserve the consensus site for N-linked glycosylation found in human AQP2. Two mutant mouse lines were generated: a CD1 line in which the Pol2neobpA cassette was retained in the genome (strain A) and a hybrid CD1/FVB/N line (strain B) in which the Pol2neobpA cassette was deleted by breeding with mice expressing cre-recombinase.Southern blot analysis of strain A mouse liver genomic DNA digested with ApaI and probed as indicated in Fig. 1 showed a smaller fragment at 3.2 kb corresponding to the replaced gene containing a 1.8-kb polII-neo selectable marker (Fig.2 A, left). In the strain B mice, Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA digested withApaI/FseI showed a fragment at 3.5 kb indicating the engineered FseI restriction site and deletion of polII-neo cassette (Fig. 2 A, right). Deletion of polII-neo sequence was confirmed by sequence analysis. The genotype distribution from breeding of heterozygous mice was 13 wild-type, 31 heterozygous, and 14 homozygous mutant mice (strain A) and 10 wild-type, 19 heterozygous, and 12 mutant mice (strain B), in agreement with a 1:2:1 Mendelian distribution expected in the absence of prenatal mortality. Northern blot analysis showed the same 1.7-kb transcripts in kidneys of wild-type and mutant mice, but with marked up-regulation (3.5-fold by densitometry) of the transcript corresponding to the mutant AQP2-T126M (Fig. 2 B). AQP2 transcript up-regulation is known to occur with dehydration (27Fushimi K. Uchida S. Hara Y. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Nature. 1993; 361: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 28Hayashi M. Sasaki S. Tsuganezawa H. Monkawa T. Kitajima W. Konishi K. Fushimi K. Marumo F. Saruta T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1778-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To confirm that AQP2 in kidneys of mutant mice contained the engineered mutations, the full-length AQP2 coding sequence was RT-PCR amplified from wild-type and mutant mice. Sequence analysis of the full coding region confirmed the four mutations for strain A and strain B mice (Fig.2 C).Functional analysis and cellular localization of the RT-PCR amplified wild-type and mutant AQP2 sequences were done in heterologous expression systems. In Xenopus oocytes microinjected with transcribed cRNAs, osmotic water permeability was increased by expression of the mutant AQP2, though to a lesser extent than wild-type AQP2 (Fig. 3 A), in agreement with previous results for human and mouse AQP2-T126M (23Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 25Yang B. Ma T. Xu Z. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1999; 57: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transient expression in CHO cells revealed an endosomal/plasma membrane expression pattern for the wild-type AQP2, but an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) expression pattern for the mutant AQP2 (Fig. 3 B), in agreement with results for human and mouse AQP2-T126M (23Tamarappoo B.K.

Therefore the mutant AQP2 coding sequence expressed in mice has the expected functionality and ER-localization when expressed in heterologous systems.Figure 3Functional analysis and intracellular localization of AQP2 proteins.

Most strain A mutant mice died at 5–6 days after birth when no intervention was done to prolong survival. Survival of some pups was prolonged up to 8 days by separation of most wild-type and heterozygous pups from the homozygous pups (to minimize competition for milk) and by fluid supplementation by oral feeding (30–50 μl of milk, four times per day) or subcutaneous fluid injections (50–100 μl of half-normal saline, three times per day). Interestingly, many hybrid strain B mice were able to survive to day 8, although they were remarkably smaller than wild-type litter mates from day 3 onward.Figure 4Phenotype of AQP2-T126M mutant mice.

(It was not possible to obtain urine from very young mutant mice.) Serum osmolality was remarkably elevated in the dehydrated mutant mice (Fig. 4 C). Blood urea nitrogen of the mutant pups was ∼7-fold greater than in wild-type pups (79 ± 15 mg/dl versus 11.6 ± 0.6 mg/dl). To determine whether the heterozygous mice manifest any abnormality in urinary concentrating ability, urine osmolalities were compared in adult (4–5 weeks of age) wild-type and heterozygous mice. Averaged urine osmolalities were 1544 ± 69 mosm (heterozygous) and 1585 ± 187 mosm (wild type), increasing after a 36-hour water deprivation to 3001 ± 126 mosm(heterozygous) and 3081 ± 291 mosm (wild type, differences not significant).Immunoblot analysis of whole kidney homogenates showed that the majority of immunoreactive protein in wild-type and heterozygous mice migrated as a diffuse band of apparent molecular size 34–40 kDa (Fig.5 A), which represents fully processed AQP2 with complex glycosylation. A band of lower intensity at the predicted molecular size of nonglycosylated AQP2 was also seen. In contrast, the mutant AQP2 protein migrated mainly as a single band at ∼31 kDa, which from previous data in oocytes and transfected cells probably represents an ER-retained form of AQP2 with core glycosylation. Sometimes bands at higher molecular weights were seen that probably represent AQP2 multimers.Figure 5Biochemical analysis of AQP2-T126M protein in kidney collecting duct.

Endoglycosidase F treatment, which cleaves all sugars, gave a single band at 29 kDa for all genotypes (Fig. 5 B). Endoglycosidase H treatment, which cleaves high-mannose core sugars of proteins that have not exited the ER, did not affect wild-type AQP2 but digested most of the 31-kDa form of the mutant AQP2.

To determine whether this difference in detergent solubility occurs in native kidney, membrane homogenates were treated with CHAPS for 30 min (as done in Ref. 24Tamarappoo B.K. Yang B. Verkman A.S.

Fig. 5 C shows remarkably greater detergent sensitivity of wild-type versus mutant AQP2. The in vivo biochemical data thus confirm several of the biochemical properties of the mutant AQP2 established in cell culture models.Last, renal morphology and AQP2 immunolocalization were studied in kidneys of wild-type and mutant mice. Remarkably, kidneys from the mutant mice showed signs of obstructive uropathy including dilatation of collecting ducts and papillary atrophy (Fig.6 A, right). Many kidneys of the mutant mice contained a large fluid-filled cavity where the medulla should be. Immunofluorescence of kidneys from 5-day-old wild-type mice showed AQP2 localization in medullary collecting duct, but unlike adult mice, very little AQP2 was found in cortical collecting duct (Fig. 6, B and C,left). AQP2 was found at the apical membrane, in agreement with previous results in rat and human kidney (27Fushimi K. Uchida S. Hara Y. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S.

At low magnification, AQP2 immunostaining was also found mainly in the medulla of kidneys from mutant mice, albeit at a substantially greater level than in wild-type mice (Fig. 6 B, right). At higher magnification, AQP2 was seen both within cells, probably in the ER, as well as at the plasma membrane in some tubules (Fig.6 C, right). Insets in Fig.6 C show higher magnification.Figure 6Renal morphology and localization of AQP2 protein in kidney.

The mutant mice had a urinary concentrating defect resulting in dehydration, failure to thrive, and death. Interestingly, mice lacking AQP1 (31Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), AQP3 (17Ma T. Song Y. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and AQP4 (18Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), which manifest urinary concentrating defects to differing extents, do not have reduced neonatal survival. The severe NDI in the AQP2 mutant mice supports the conclusion that transepithelial water permeability in collecting duct is rate-limited by apical membrane water permeability.The neonatal mortality in the mutant mice was an unexpected finding, especially in view of the limited urinary concentrating ability of young normal mice. For several reasons, we believe that the early death is because of polyuria and its consequences, rather than to other causes related to expression of the mutated AQP2 protein. First, mice lacking an unrelated protein (the V2 receptor), which probably have comparable polyuria to the mutant AQP2 mice, also fail to thrive and die early (32Yun J. Schoneberg T. Liu J. Schulz A. Echelbarger C.A. Promeneur D. Nielsen S. Sheng H. Grinberg A. Deng C. Wess J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Other knockout mouse models (AQP3, NKCC2) having polyuria appear to develop kidney damage (33Yang B. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 624-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34Takahashi N. Chernavvsky D.R. Gomez R.A. Igarashi P. Gitelman H.J. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5434-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The mouse kidney is probably particularly sensitive to damage by polyuria compared with rat (e.g. Brattleboro rat) or human (e.g. subjects with NDI). We think it is unlikely that mutant AQP2 expression is itself damaging to the kidney, because very little AQP2 is expressed at the time of birth or before, and because the mutant mice appear grossly normal at 1–2 days after birth. Last, the low urine osmolality and high serum osmolality measured in the mutant mice indicates marked polyuria and probably underestimates the severity of the polyuria because the mice are in renal failure by the time they are large enough to permit collection of urine and serum samples.Initial efforts to prolong the survival of the mutant mice by fluid supplementation were only partially successful. The improved survival of the strain B mice with the hybrid CD1 and FVB/N background is probably related strain differences, because the mutant AQP2 sequence is identical in both mouse strains, and the amount of expressed protein was comparable. More work involving fluid supplementation and transferring the mutant genotype to mice of different genetic backgrounds will be needed to determine whether survival of the mutant mice until adulthood is possible.Northern blot analysis indicated increased mutant AQP2 expression in the homozygous mutant mice, which is probably related to dehydration and high serum vasopressin concentrations. The AQP2 promoter contains a cAMP response element that is responsible for up-regulation of AQP2 expression in states of high circulating vasopressin (35Hozawa S. Holtzman E.J. Ausiello D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1695-C1702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis showed that the mutant AQP2 protein was core glycosylated as demonstrated by its size and sensitivity to endoglycosidase H. As found previously in transfected cell models, mutant AQP2 in kidney was also relatively resistant to detergent solubilization. However, immunofluorescence showed a significant fraction of the mutant AQP2 at the apical plasma membrane. It is possible that transfected cell cultures, where the mutant AQP2 is found exclusively at the ER, are not good models for the in vivo targeting of mutant AQP2. However, the grossly abnormal collecting duct morphology in mutant mice precludes such interpretations. The plasma membrane localization of some mutant AQP2 molecules might be a consequence of the many changes in epithelial cell physiology resulting from increased intraluminal pressure. Another interesting possibility is that the accumulation of osmolytes in renal medulla might facilitate the plasma membrane targeting of some mutant AQP2 molecules, as was found in cell culture models (23Tamarappoo B.K. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).In summary, we have created and characterized the first mouse model of human NDI. The AQP2-T126M-expressing mutant mice permit in vivo studies of the biochemistry of a disease-causing AQP2 mutant. Adult AQP2 mutant mice, if and when available, should be useful in addressing fundamental issues about the pathophysiology of NDI caused by AQP2 mutations, and for testing the efficacy of established and novel therapies to improve urinary concentrating ability. The formation of concentrated urine by the kidney requires high osmotic water permeability across the collecting duct epithelium. Collecting duct epithelial cells express aquaporin water channels AQP2,1 AQP3, and AQP4 (1Frigeri A. Gropper M.A. Turck C.W. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

AQP2 is the vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone)-regulated water channel (5Yamamoto T. Sasaki S.

Nephrol. 1999; 10: 647-663PubMed Google Scholar). Vasopressin induces the fusion of intracellular vesicles containing AQP2 with the apical plasma membrane resulting in increased water permeability (7Nielsen S. Chou C.L. Marples D. Christensen E.I.

In the present study we have utilized the technique of fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor the rate of GnRH receptor-receptor interactions. This technique relies on the observation that the degree of physical intimacy of molecules can be assessed by the tendency of proximal fluorophores to exchange energy. Our data indicate that GnRH agonist, but not antagonist, occupancy of the GnRH receptor promotes physical intimacy (microaggregation) between receptors. The time course indicates that this occurs promptly (<1 min) after occupancy and persists for at least 80 min and within the physiologically relevant range of the releasing hormone. The process measured is not inhibited by 0.1 mm vinblastin, 2 μm cytochalasin D, or 3 mm EGTA, an observation that distinguishes it frommacroaggregation (patching, capping, and internalization). These observations, along with reports from other laboratories, are consonant with a growing body of evidence that indicates that microaggregation is an early event following agonist occupancy of the receptor and part of the mechanism by which effector regulation occurs.

Subsequently it was shown that treatment of gonadotropes with releasing hormone agonists caused receptors to move sufficiently close to one another that a radioiodine molecule could be transferred from a lactoperoxidase molecule covalently linked to a receptor-bound agonist onto an adjacent receptor (7Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3602-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These two types of observations suggested that agonist occupancy of the receptor promotes microaggregation (physical association within 100–120 Å), the occurrence of which is sufficient to stimulate cellular responses. For these reasons, microaggregation has been suspected to be a component of the mechanism leading to hormonal activation of the gonadotrope (1Conn P.M. Rogers D.C. Stewart J.M. Neidel J. Sheffield T. Nature. 1982; 296: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This process appears to occur as quickly as it can be measured (<1 min) (7Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3602-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and is distinguished frommacroaggregation (patching, capping, internalization), an event that occurs later (>20 min), appears sensitive to vinblastin, cytochalasin D, and EGTA, and is associated with extinction of responses (8Hazum E.

The GnRH receptor is an intriguing member of the GPCR superfamily because it is the smallest known at this time with a short extracellular N-terminal tail and virtually no C-terminal intracellular tail, a region associated with modifications that regulate the loss of other receptors. Unfortunately there has not been a reliable or convenient method adequate to measure interactions between GnRH receptors, let alone develop mathematic descriptions for this process (17Blum J.J. Conn P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7307-7311Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Blum J.J. Reed M.C. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 2: E263-E272Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is useful for assessment of protein-protein interactions. To occur, it is necessary that two different fluorophores are within 100 Å of each other and that the emission spectrum of the donor overlaps the absorption spectrum of the acceptor. We (19Lin X. Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 146: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Cornea A. Janovick J. Lin X. Conn P.M.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1818-1819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported the usefulness of chimeras of GnRHR-spacer-GFP (green fluorescent protein) for tracking receptor trafficking. The recent availability of red fluorescent proteins, excellent spectral partners of GFP for FRET at distances of 100 Å (22dos Remedios C.G. Moens P.D. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), allows the simultaneous visualization of both fluorescent proteins in a confocal microscope, the observation of receptor aggregation in real time, and the measurement of aggregation rates. We show that occupancy by GnRH agonists promotes receptor microaggregation at doses, and with a time course, appropriate for a role of this event in GnRH receptor signaling in vivo. Rat GnRHR complementary DNA (cDNA) in pcDNA1 was generously provided by Dr. W. W. Chin. The expression vector pcDNA3.1 was purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). pEGFP-N1 vector, which encodes a GFP variant (F64L, S65T-GFP; REF) for human codon usage preferences was purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. pDsRed vector, a human codon-optimized variant that uses the strong cytomegalovirus IE promoter and allows fusions to the N terminus of RFP1 (referred to as RFP below), was also purchased from CLONTECH. DMEM, Opti-MEM, LipofectAMINE, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes and competent cells for cloning were purchased from Promega Corp.(Madison, WI). The GnRH agonist, buserelin (d-t-butyl-d-Ser6-Pro9des Gly10 EA GnRH, Hoechst), and antagonist, “Nal-Arg” (Ac-d-Nal1-d-4-chlorophenylalanine2-d-3-pyridylalanine3, Arg5-d-Arg6-d-Ala10-GnRH, Contraceptive Development Branch, NIH) were obtained as indicated. All GnRH analog solutions were prepared 10-fold concentrated, and 50 μl of this solution was added to 450 μl of medium so that the final concentration was achieved. Other reagents were of the highest degree of purity available from commercial sources. Wild-type rGnRHR cDNA in pcDNA1 was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 at BamHI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites. The rGnRHR-C tail-GFP, the fusion of the N terminus of the GFP to the C terminus of the rat GnRHR with the catfish GnRHR intracellular C tail, was constructed as described previously (18Blum J.J. Reed M.C. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 2: E263-E272Google Scholar). The chimera of rGnRHR-C tail and RFP was constructed by overlap extension PCR, a procedure used to join DNA fragments that contain an overlap region. The first PCR reaction included the T7 primer and a 30-mer chimeric reverse primer (CTTGGAGGAGCGCACCAT/CTGTCCACTGGG) encoding for the RFP1-N1 and rGnRHR-C tail without the stop codon. The sequence for RFP including the full coding region and 3′-untranslated region was amplified from pRFP1-N1 vector using a 30-mer chimeric forward primer (GACCAACCCAGTGGACAG/ATGGTGCGCTCC) and a pRFP1-N1 reverse primer (RED-N1-Rev). The DNA fragments from the two PCR reactions for rGnRHR-C tail and RFP were used as templates in a third PCR reaction with primer sets of T7 and RED-N1-Rev. The third PCR reaction produced a full-length chimeric cDNA for rGnRHR-C tail-RFP. The chimeric cDNA was flanked by the restriction sites present in the polylinker of pcDNA3.1 vector. The cDNA was digested with BamHI and XbaI and cloned into the same sites of pcDNA3.1 vector. The identity of the chimeric constructs and the correctness of the PCR-derived coding sequence were verified by Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Large scale plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared using a Qiagen EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Prep kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The purity and identity of the plasmid DNA were further verified by restriction enzyme analysis. For confocal microscopy of live cells, glass coverslips (24 × 40 mm) were immersed in 12 n HCl for 1–2 h, rinsed three times with sterile distilled water, and then secured in a sterile 100-mm Petri dish with dental wax. The GH3 cells were maintained in growth medium (DMEM (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 20 μg/ml gentamicin (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA)) in a humidified atmosphere (37 °C) containing 5% CO2. The cells were plated at a density of 9 × 105 cells/dish. Twenty-four h later, the cells were washed once with 3 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then were transiently transfected with 0.71 μg of cDNA for chimeric rGnRHR-C tail-RFP plus 0.45 μg of cDNA for chimeric rGnRHR-C tail-GFP using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM/dish. These cDNA concentrations resulted in an optimally detectable increase of FRET in response to cell activation by buserelin. Increasing or decreasing the ratio of RFP:GFP receptor chimeras resulted in loss of the FRET signal. Five h later, 1.5 ml of DMEM, 20% FCS was added to each dish. Twenty four h after the start of the transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM, 10% FCS, gentamicin, and the cells were allowed to incubate for 24 h. Forty eight h after the start of the transfection, the cells were washed two times with warm medium (DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, gentamicin) and were then incubated with 10 μm cycloheximide for 24 h. The cells were washed twice with 26 °C DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, gentamicin; the coverslips containing the cells were then transferred to a cell chamber, and room temperature medium was added to the chamber and incubated with the live cells during confocal imaging. Where indicated, 50 μl of buserelin solution (10−6m) was added to 450 μl of medium in the imaging chamber, for a final concentration of 10−7m, unless otherwise specified. When vinblastin or cytochalasin D were used, cells were incubated for 60 min in 0.1 mm vinblastin or 30 min in 2 μm cytochalasin D in medium at 37 °C and then imaged at room temperature as described above. In these experiments, vinblastin or cytochalasin D were continuously present during the imaging period. Chelation of calcium with 3 mm EGTA in the imaging medium caused cells to detach from the coverslips. To retain their orientation for time-lapse imaging, 0.5% low melting point agarose (Bio-Rad) was added both to the EGTA-containing medium and to the control medium. An inositol phosphate bioassay was used to check the biological activity of the chimeric constructs. Briefly, GH3 cells were plated in a 24-well Costar (Cambridge, MA) plate at 105 cells/well. Twenty four h later, the cells were washed once with 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM and then transiently transfected with 0.8 μg of plasmid chimeric receptor DNA/well or wt rGnRHR cDNA using 2 μl of LipofectAMINE in 0.250 ml of Opti-MEM. Five h later, 0.25 ml of DMEM, 20% FCS was added per well. Twenty four h after the start of the transfection, the medium was replaced with 0.5 ml/well DMEM, 10% FCS, gentamicin, and the cells were allowed to grow. Fifty four h after transfecting, the cells were washed with DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 μg/ml gentamicin and then preloaded with 0.5 ml of DMEM (inositol free) containing 4 μCi of [3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 18 h at 37 °C. After preloading, the cells were washed with DMEM (inositol free) containing 5 mm LiCl and stimulated with buserelin for 2 h. The medium was removed, and 1 ml of 0.1 m formic acid was added to each well. The cells were frozen and thawed to disrupt the cell membranes. Inositol phosphate accumulation was determined by Dowex anion exchange chromatography and liquid scintillation spectroscopy as described previously (23Huckle W.R. Conn P.M. Conn P.M. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 149-155Google Scholar). Cells expressing both GnRHR-C tail-GFP and GnRHR-C tail-RFP were imaged in an open chamber in DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, gentamicin medium at room temperature maintained at 26–27 °C in a Leica TCS-SP confocal microscope using a 63 × 1.25 numerical aperture water immersion objective, pinhole 2.5 Airy disc units. GFP was excited with the 488-nm line of an Ar laser, and RFP was excited with the 568-nm line of a Kr laser. Emission was measured simultaneously in the green channel from 500–550 nm and in the red channel from 610–670 nm. FRET was measured in both fixed and live cells, with and without activation by buserelin, by imaging GFP before and after the red fluorescent protein was photobleached with a large dose of irradiation with the 568-nm line of a Kr laser. The increase of donor fluorescence (green) after receptor (red) bleaching was interpreted as evidence of FRET occurring from GFP to RFP. For all time-lapse experiments, GFP was excited with 488-nm blue light with the minimum intensity necessary to obtain an image, to minimize photobleaching and cell damage due to absorption of light energy. Emission channels were the same as described above; the image recorded in the red channel was due partly to GFP contribution in the overlapping red spectral range, partly to excitation of RFP fluorescence at 488 nm, and partly to the resonance energy transfer from GFP to RFP. Images were acquired every 5, 10, or 30 s for the first 10 min, every 2 min for up to 30 min, and every 5 min for up to 2 h. Five sections were acquired for each time point to compensate possible focus shifts during the time-lapse experiment. Four-dimensional image stacks were open and organized in MetaMorph (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). For each time point, only one section was chosen of the five acquired, so that it imaged the same plane within the cell throughout time, compensating for focus shift. Regions of interest were selected on membranes so that they did not include any of the intracellular red fluorescent signal, areas of intense membrane blebbing or motion. The average intensity of the red and green fluorescence was measured in each area of interest at all time points using MetaMorph. The red to green ratio was calculated and then normalized to unity for the value at time 0 and graphed as a function of time. The GnRHR-C tail-RFP chimera is expressed on the plasma membrane, as was reported for the GnRHR-C tail-GFP construct (19Lin X. Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 146: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, RFP can be found in cytoplasmic compartments (Fig.1, A and B); this material may be misfolded copies or molecules otherwise targeted for destruction. The GnRHR-C tail-RFP is functional and elicits inositol phosphate production in response to the GnRH agonist buserelin, similar to that of the wild-type receptor (Fig.1 C) and to the GnRHR-C tail-GFP construct (19Lin X. Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 146: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In cells expressing both receptor constructs, the red and green fluorescent proteins are colocalized (interdispersed) on the plasma membrane. If receptors are present as individual monomers, their fluorescence will not be affected by each other. If molecules of GFP and RFP come into appropriate physical proximity, energy absorbed by illumination of the green fluorophore is transmitted by FRET to the red fluorophore, which will then emit a red photon. In this case, a reduction of green fluorescence is associated with the increase of red fluorescence. FRET only occurs if three conditions are simultaneously satisfied. First, the emission spectrum of the donor must overlap with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor. Second, the two fluorophores must be within 100 Å of each other. Third, the transition dipoles of the donor and acceptor must be favorably oriented. The spectra of GFP and RFP are well suited for FRET. If they are part of dimerized GnRHR-C tail molecules, the distance and orientation will be favorable for FRET at least part of the time, because each fluorophore is attached to a flexible 51-amino acid-long linker that confers sufficient flexibility to allow the fluorophore to attain the correct dipole orientation. This flexibility will likely prevent FRET from occurring every time receptors come into intimate association, however. We show evidence that FRET is increased in GH3 cells activated by the GnRH agonist buserelin but is not increased in response to medium or to a GnRH antagonist. These observations are consonant with GnRH receptor microaggregation as a component of signal transduction. FRET can occur only in the presence of an acceptor molecule. If RFP (the acceptor) is removed or destroyed, it would be predicted that the fluorescence of GFP (the donor) would increase upon illumination. Fig.2 shows examples of cells imaged before (A and B) and after (C andD) photobleaching of RFP on an area including the plasma membrane. The integrated intensity of green (Fig. 2, A andC) and red (B and D) fluorescence is measured for the same rectangular area that includes the membrane. For Fig. 2, panel I, cells were fixed after 30 min of treatment with buserelin. For the cell shown, the green fluorescence intensity increased from 68,217 to 69,313 (arbitrary units) when the red fluorescence intensity decreased from 41,844 to 17,542 after specific photobleaching of RFP by 568-nm radiation. Changes in green fluorescence measured for other cells in the same sample ranged from 5 to 15%. In Fig. 2, panel II, control cells were fixed without buserelin treatment. In the example shown, green fluorescence was 43,903 before and 43,406 after photobleaching of RFP from 13,880 to 5,857. Changes for other cells in the same population ranged from −5 to 5%. Fig. 2, panel III shows a live cell imaged 16 min after addition of buserelin. In this case, the intensity of green fluorescence changed from 43,040 to 49,736 when the intensity of RFP was reduced from 20,565 to 7,875. The increase in donor fluorescence observed after acceptor photobleaching was small but consistent with values expected for FRET probability, considering the factors mentioned above. If GnRH agonists provoke receptor microaggregation, it is predictable that treatment with buserelin in cells expressing GnRHR-C tail-GFP and GnRHR-C tail-RFP will cause the increase of red fluorescence at the expense of green fluorescence. We imaged live cells temporally after addition of 10−7m buserelin to the culture and measured the average intensity of green and red fluorescence in the same small region on the plasma membrane at all time points. Fig. 3 is an example of cell regions analyzed over 20 min after activation by buserelin. Green and red fluorescence intensities were normalized to their values at time 0. The graph shows a small but constant increase of red fluorescence, increasing ∼10% after 20 min. The intensity of green fluorescence drops robustly, partly due to energy transfer to RFP and partly due to photobleaching. The photobleaching rate of GFP alone is not affected by the presence of buserelin, suggesting that the increase in the ratio of red to green fluorescence intensity measured over time, observed only in the presence of buserelin, is not caused by the faster bleaching of GFP. When several small regions were arbitrarily chosen along the membrane of the same cell, not all displayed an increase in the rate of red/green fluorescence after addition of buserelin. We conclude that receptor aggregation, as monitored by FRET, is not a uniform process throughout the cell membrane but rather occurs in “islands” of microaggregation. Results presented are averages over larger regions. For the same cell, regions that show internalization of the receptor tend to have red:green ratios >30% higher than regions that do not. When internalization is not visible, low and high FRET areas are visually indistinguishable. Even though we are aware of other possible contributing factors, for simplicity we used the increase of the ratio of red:green fluorescence as a measure of FRET and consequently of receptor aggregation. Use of this simplification is supported by the observation that, in the absence of activation, the red:green fluorescence ratio is largely constant in time for a small region of a cell membrane. Fig.4 A shows the fluorescence ratio for a cell for 10 min before (⋄) and after exposure to buserelin (●) from 0 to 20 min. The ratio fluctuates very little around the initial value, but, as buserelin is added, the ratio increases significantly and largely linearly. To test whether the change of medium may play an artifactual role in our observation, we changed from the initial medium to fresh medium and then to 10−7m buserelin (Fig. 4 B). The ratio of red:green fluorescence intensity did not change with the medium exchange and remained constant for the 24 min imaged in these conditions. As soon as medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10−7m buserelin, the FRET signal, as measured by the red:green intensity ratio, increased constantly for the next 20 min (Fig. 4 B). When cells were exposed to GnRH antagonist, Nal-Arg (10−7m), the red:green ratio remained constant for the duration of the experiment, through two changes of medium alone and one addition of medium containing Nal-Arg for 1 h (Fig. 4 D). When Nal-Arg was replaced by a solution containing a 100-fold molar excess of buserelin, the ratio of red:green fluorescence increased less and reached a plateau after ∼20 min (Fig. 4 C). The experiments were repeated (three or more times) with different batches of cells, transfected and imaged at different times with similar results. Linear fit of the red/green intensity over the first 20 min gives rate constants with an average over seven experiments of 0.054 ± 0.019 min−1 for buserelin, 0.005 ± 0.010 min−1 for medium, and 0.003 ± 0.014 min−1 for Nal-Arg. After the initial fast rise in FRET signal lasting about 20 min, the signal remains nearly constant for at least 1 h and decreases thereafter. Motion of the cell membrane in this time frame makes persistent observation of specific regions difficult and adds to the noise level (Fig. 5 A). Lowering the concentration of buserelin did not abolish the increase of FRET, but in most cases it reduced the rate of FRET increase (data not shown). Even 10−10m buserelin, for which we did not observe receptor internalization during the times examined, produced an increase of the red to green fluorescence ratio (Fig. 5 B). We then examined the action of 0.1 mm vinblastin, an alkaloid drug that inhibits patching and capping (7Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3602-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) but has no action on microaggregation. Vinblastin did not affect the increase in the red to green fluorescence ratio after addition of buserelin (Fig.5 C). Because the effect of vinblastin is mediated by the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, we tested the effect of cytochalasin D, a microfilament-destabilizing agent. As observed for vinblastin, treatment with cytochalasin did not block the FRET signal (Fig. 5 D). No internalization was observed in the presence of either vinblastin or cytochalasin D at the concentrations used. Absence of calcium in the culture medium causes a dramatic reduction in cluster formation and internalization (i.e. macroaggregation (8Hazum E. Cuatrecasas P. Marian J. Conn P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6692-6695Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar)). We added 3 mm EGTA, together with 0.5% low melting point agarose, to the imaging medium to examine whether the FRET signal was dependent on the presence of calcium. The FRET response was robust, similar to that of the control in the presence of agarose (Fig. 5, E and F), suggesting that microaggregation rather than macroaggregation was being observed by this measurement. The present study utilized the FRET technique to examine GnRH receptor-receptor interactions. Our findings suggest that agonist occupancy of the receptor enhances energy transfer, and we infer that a decreased receptor-receptor distance has occurred. Occupancy of the receptor by an antagonist (or no occupancy at all) is not accompanied by increased energy transfer and suggests, therefore, that intimate receptor-receptor interactions do not occur in this circumstance. This interaction can be measured within minutes and appears linear for 20–30 min. The time course is consistent with our previous estimate (7Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3602-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), although the prior method did not allow a detailed rate determination. Based on other interactions (24Pollok B.A. Heim R. Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 57-60Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 25Mitra R.D. Silva C.M. Youvan D.C.

Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar) assessed by the FRET technique, it is reasonable to view a receptor-receptor distance, upon microaggregation, of <120 Å consistent with prior estimates for the distance between agonist binding sites on adjacent receptors (1Conn P.M. Rogers D.C. Stewart J.M. Neidel J. Sheffield T. Nature. 1982; 296: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We show that energy transfer in response to an agonist is independent of vinblastin treatment, which is a convenient means of distinguishing microaggregation from large scale patching, capping, and internalization. It is somewhat surprising that GFP and RFP allow apparently normal receptor function and are useful markers for receptors (24Pollok B.A. Heim R. Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 57-60Scopus (388) Google Scholar), given their large size and shape; however, recent observations suggest that estimates of issues of specific orientation may not be as significant as once believed (22dos Remedios C.G. Moens P.D. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In the case of the GnRH receptor, inclusion of a spacer between the receptor and fluorophore appears to be essential, because without this, the chimeric protein is not properly routed (19Lin X. Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 146: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The specific spacer used, however, does not appear to be critical. Although useful for rate calculations, the FRET technique does not allow quantification of numbers of receptor microaggregates either before or after hormone treatment, and interpretation is further complicated because the energy transfer only occurs when GFP and RFP are proximal (<100 Å) and the geometry permits a productive event. It would not be unreasonable to imagine that <20% of all actual receptor-receptor collisions are measured, because even under optimal conditions only 50% of the collisions would be GFP·RFP. The present study provides data that are consonant with a role of microaggregation in GnRH receptor signaling. These data provide estimates of rates of this process in real time. In addition, our findings suggest that microaggregation is restricted to particular areas of the membrane. Furthermore, these data indicate that the long C-terminal tails characteristic of most GPCRs, but absent in the GnRH receptor, are not required for microaggregation. Evidence for receptor-receptor interactions have now been observed for a number of receptors (10Guo C. Dowers S.K. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol.

Stabilization of the pyrimidine motif triplex at physiological pH is, therefore, crucial in improving its therapeutic potential. To this end, we have investigated the thermodynamic and kinetic effects of our previously reported chemical modification, 2′-O,4′-C-methylene bridged nucleic acid (2′,4′-BNA) modification of triplex-forming oligonucleotide (TFO), on pyrimidine motif triplex formation at physiological pH. The thermodynamic analyses indicated that the 2′,4′-BNA modification of TFO increased the binding constant of the pyrimidine motif triplex formation at neutral pH by ∼20 times. The number and position of the 2′,4′-BNA modification introduced into the TFO did not significantly affect the magnitude of the increase in the binding constant. The consideration of the observed thermodynamic parameters suggested that the increased rigidity itself of the 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFO in the free state relative to the unmodified TFO may enable the significant increase in the binding constant at neutral pH. Kinetic data demonstrated that the observed increase in the binding constant at neutral pH by the 2′,4′-BNA modification of TFO resulted from the considerable decrease in the dissociation rate constant. Our results certainly support the idea that the 2′,4′-BNA modification of TFO could be a key chemical modification and may eventually lead to progress in therapeutic applications of the antigene strategy in vivo.

A triplex is usually formed through the sequence-specific interaction of a single-stranded homopurine or homopyrimidine triplex-forming oligonucleotide (TFO)1 with the major groove of homopurine-homopyrimidine stretch in duplex DNA (1Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 541-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev.

In the pyrimidine motif triplex, a homopyrimidine TFO binds parallel to the homopurine strand of the target duplex by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding to form T·A:T and C+·G:C triplets (1Mirkin S.M.

On the other hand, in the purine motif triplex, a homopurine TFO binds antiparallel to the homopurine strand of the target duplex by reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding to form A·A:T (or T·A:T) and G·G:C triplets (1Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 541-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 1996; 6: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Because the cytosine bases in a homopyrimidine TFO must be protonated to bind with the guanine bases of the G:C duplex, the formation of the pyrimidine motif triplex needs an acidic pH condition and is thus extremely unstable at physiological pH (6Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 180-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Singleton S.F.

However, the purine motif triplex formation is severely inhibited by physiological concentrations of certain monovalent cations, especially K+. Undefined association between K+ and the guanine-rich homopurine TFO has been applied to explain the inhibitory effect (9Milligan J.F. Krawczyk S.H. Wadwani S.

The 2′,4′-BNA modification of TFO increased the thermal stability of the pyrimidine motif triplex DNA at neutral pH using a homopurine-homopyrimidine target duplex and its specific cytosine-rich TFO (25Imanishi T. Obika S. J. Syn. Org. Chem. Jpn. 1999; 57: 969-980Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic explanation for the 2′,4′-BNA modification-mediated triplex stabilization was not clearly understood. Here, therefore, we have further extended our previous study to explore thermodynamic and kinetic effects of the 2′,4′-BNA modification on the pyrimidine motif triplex formation at neutral pH. The thermodynamic and kinetic effects of the 2′,4′-BNA modification on the pyrimidine motif triplex formation between a 23-base pair homopurine-homopyrimidine target duplex (Pur23A·Pyr23T; Fig.1 b) and its specific 15-mer unmodified or 2′,4′-BNA-modified homopyrimidine TFO (Pyr15T, Pyr15BNA7-1, Pyr15BNA7-2, Pyr15BNA5-1, and Pyr15BNA5-2; Fig. 1 b) have been analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA; Refs. 33Lyamichev V.I.

Results from these independent lines of experiments have clearly indicated the significant effect of the 2′,4′-BNA modification to promote the pyrimidine motif triplex formation at neutral pH. The binding constant at neutral pH for the pyrimidine motif triplex formation with the 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFO was ∼10–20 times larger than that observed with the corresponding unmodified TFO. Kinetic data have also demonstrated that the contribution for the increase in the binding constant by the 2′,4′-BNA modification of TFO resulted from the considerable decrease in the dissociation rate constant. The ability of the 2′,4′-BNA modification of TFO to promote the pyrimidine motif triplex formation at physiological pH would support further progress in therapeutic applications of the antigene strategy in vivo.DISCUSSIONThe K a of the pyrimidine motif triplex formation with Pyr15T at pH 5.8 was 20 times larger than that observed with Pyr15T at pH 6.8 (Table II), which is consistent with the previously reported results that the neutral pH is unfavorable for the pyrimidine motif triplex formation involving C+·GC triads (6Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 180-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Singleton S.F.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8963-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The K a of the triplex formation with Pyr15BNA7-1, Pyr15BNA7-2, Pyr15BNA5-1, or Pyr15BNA5-2 at pH 6.8 was 10–20 times larger than that observed with Pyr15T at pH 6.8 (TableII). The increase in K a at pH 6.8 by the 2′,4′-BNA modification of TFO was supported by the results of EMSA (Fig. 2) and IAsys (Table III). In addition, the 2′,4′-BNA modification of TFO increased the thermal stability of the pyrimidine motif triplex at pH 6.8 (Table I). These results indicate that the 2′,4′-BNA modification of TFO considerably promotes the pyrimidine motif triplex formation at neutral pH.The ΔH on the triplex formation measured by ITC reflects a major contribution from the hydrogen bonding and the base stacking involved in the triplex formation (38Kamiya M. Torigoe H. Shindo H. Sarai A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 4532-4538Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 46Edelhoch H. Osborne Jr., J.C. Adv.

On the other hand, the ΔS on the triplex formation measured by ITC includes a positive entropy change from release of structured water on the triplex formation and a major contribution of a negative conformational entropy change from the conformational restraint of TFO involved in the triplex formation (38Kamiya M. Torigoe H. Shindo H. Sarai A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 4532-4538Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 46Edelhoch H. Osborne Jr., J.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1976; 30: 183-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 47Cheng Y.- K. Pettitt B.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1992; 58: 225-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 48Shafer R.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 55-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because the formed triplex structure involving Pyr15T at pH 5.8 and that involving Pyr15T at pH 6.8 is the same, the magnitude of ΔH and ΔS on the triplex formation measured by ITC could be the same between the two conditions. However, unexpectedly, the magnitudes of ΔH and ΔS for Pyr15T at pH 6.8 were significantly smaller than those observed for Pyr15T at pH 5.8 (Table II). When the ΔH and ΔS are calculated from the fitting procedure of ITC, the heat observed by ITC is divided not by the effective concentration really involved in the triplex formation but by the apparent concentration added to the triplex formation (37Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar). The calculation does not take it into consideration what percentage of the added concentration is really effectively involved in the triplex formation. Thus, if the triplex formation is less stoichiometric under a certain condition, the magnitudes of ΔH and ΔS for the less stoichiometric triplex formation estimated by ITC are smaller than those observed for the more stoichiometric triplex formation under another condition. Therefore, the significantly smaller magnitudes of ΔH and ΔS for Pyr15T at pH 6.8 relative to those for Pyr15T at pH 5.8 (Table II) suggest that the triplex formation with Pyr15T at pH 6.8 was significantly less stoichiometric than that with Pyr15T at pH 5.8, which was also supported by the significantly smaller magnitudes ofK a and ΔG for Pyr15T at pH 6.8 (TableII). In contrast, the K a and ΔG for Pyr15T at pH 5.8 and those for the 2′,4′-BNA modified TFOs at pH 6.8 were quite similar (Table II), suggesting that the triplex formation under the two conditions was similarly quite stoichiometric. We conclude that the triplex formation with Pyr15T at pH 6.8 was significantly less stoichiometric than that with Pyr15T at pH 5.8 and that with the 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFOs at pH 6.8. Thus, to discuss the promotion mechanism of the triplex formation by the 2′,4′-BNA modification, the comparison of the ΔH and ΔSbetween Pyr15T at pH 6.8 and 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFOs at pH 6.8 is not valid because of the significantly reduced stoichiometry for Pyr15T at pH 6.8. The comparison of the ΔH and ΔSbetween Pyr15T at pH 5.8 and 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFOs at pH 6.8 with similar stoichiometry will provide a reasonable promotion mechanism for the triplex formation by the 2′,4′-BNA modification, as discussed below.Although the K a and ΔG for Pyr15T at pH 5.8 and those for the 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFOs at pH 6.8 were quite similar (Table II), the ingredients of ΔG, that is, ΔH and ΔS, were obviously different from each other. The magnitudes of the negative ΔH and ΔS for the 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFOs at pH 6.8 were smaller than those observed for Pyr15T at pH 5.8 (Table II). The hydrogen bonding and the base stacking involved in the triplex formation are usually considered the major sources of the negative ΔH on the triplex formation (38Kamiya M. Torigoe H. Shindo H. Sarai A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 4532-4538Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 46Edelhoch H. Osborne Jr., J.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1976; 30: 183-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 47Cheng Y.- K. Pettitt B.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1992; 58: 225-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 48Shafer R.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 55-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, the difference in ΔH for the stoichiometric triplex formations between Pyr15T at pH 5.8 and the 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFOs at pH 6.8 (Table II) suggests that the hydrogen bonding and the base stacking of the triplex with the 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFOs are significantly different from those with the corresponding unmodified TFO. In fact, the CD spectra show that the triplexes with the 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFO had the A-like conformation (Ref. 45Johnson K.H. Gray D.M. Sutherland J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and Fig. 4). The A-like conformation by the 2′,4′-BNA modification of TFO may result in the difference in the negative ΔH between the unmodified and 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFOs. On the other hand, the negative ΔS on the triplex formation is mainly contributed by a negative conformational entropy change attributable to the conformational restraint of TFO involved in the triplex formation (38Kamiya M. Torigoe H. Shindo H. Sarai A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 4532-4538Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 46Edelhoch H. Osborne Jr., J.C. Adv.

Therefore, the smaller magnitude of the negative ΔS for the 2′,4′-BNA modified TFOs at pH 6.8 relative to that for Pyr15T at pH 5.8 (Table II) suggests that the 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFO in the free state is more rigid than the corresponding unmodified TFO. The increased rigidity of the 2′,4′-BNA modified TFO in the free state relative to the corresponding unmodified TFO causes the smaller entropic loss on the triplex formation with the 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFO at neutral pH, which provides a favorable component to the ΔG and leads to the increase in theK a of the triplex formation at neutral pH. We conclude that the increased rigidity of the 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFO in the free state may be one of the factors that increases theK a of the pyrimidine motif triplex formation at neutral pH.The increase in the K a by the 2′,4′-BNA modification was similar in magnitude among the four modified TFOs (Fig. 2 and Tables II and III), indicating that the number and position of the 2′,4′-BNA modification did not significantly affect the magnitude of the increase in the K a at neutral pH. The rigidity itself of the 2′,4′-BNA-modified TFO may be more important to achieve the increase in the K a at neutral pH than the variation of the number and position of the 2′,4′-BNA modification. Thus, other modification strategies to gain the increased rigidity of TFO may also be useful to increase the K a at neutral pH.Kinetic data have demonstrated that the 2′,4′-BNA modification of TFO considerably decrease the k dissoc of the pyrimidine motif triplex formation (Table III). The decrease in thek dissoc is a plausible kinetic reason to explain the remarkable gain in the K a at neutral pH by the 2′,4′-BNA modification (Fig. 2 and Tables II and III). Both our group (38Kamiya M. Torigoe H. Shindo H. Sarai A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 4532-4538Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and others (49Rougee M. Faucon B. Mergny J.L. Barcelo F. Giovannangeli C. Garestier T. Helene C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9269-9278Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) have previously proposed a model that triplexes form along nucleation-elongation processes: in a nucleation step only a few base contacts of the Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds may be formed between TFO and the target duplex, and this may be followed by an elongation step, in which Hoogsteen base pairings progress to complete triplex formation. Both groups (38Kamiya M. Torigoe H. Shindo H. Sarai A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 4532-4538Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 49Rougee M. Faucon B. Mergny J.L. Barcelo F. Giovannangeli C. Garestier T. Helene C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9269-9278Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) have also suggested that the observedK a , which is the ratio ofk assoc to k dissoc, may mostly reflect rapid equilibrium of the nucleation step, which is probably the rate-limiting process of the triplex formation. In this sense, the 2′,4′-BNA modification of TFO is considered to slow the collapse of the nucleation intermediate using the rigidity of TFO to increase the K a of the pyrimidine motif triplex formation.The present study has clearly demonstrated that the 2′,4′-BNA modification of TFO promotes pyrimidine motif triplex formation at neutral pH. We conclude that the design of TFO to bridge different positions of sugar moiety with the alkyl chain to gain the increased rigidity of TFO is certainly a promising strategy for the promotion of triplex formation under physiological condition and may eventually lead to progress in therapeutic applications of the antigene strategyin vivo. In recent years, triplex DNA has attracted considerable interest because of its possible biological functions in vivo and its wide variety of potential applications, such as regulation of gene expression, site-specific cleavage of duplex DNA, mapping of genomic DNA, and gene-targeted mutagenesis (1Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 541-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev.

A triplex is usually formed through the sequence-specific interaction of a single-stranded homopurine or homopyrimidine triplex-forming oligonucleotide (TFO)1 with the major groove of homopurine-homopyrimidine stretch in duplex DNA (1Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 541-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 1996; 6: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the pyrimidine motif triplex, a homopyrimidine TFO binds parallel to the homopurine strand of the target duplex by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding to form T·A:T and C+·G:C triplets (1Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 541-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev.

On the other hand, in the purine motif triplex, a homopurine TFO binds antiparallel to the homopurine strand of the target duplex by reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding to form A·A:T (or T·A:T) and G·G:C triplets (1Mirkin S.M.

https://openalex.org/W2049524204,"Protein transport in the early secretory pathway requires Rab2 GTPase. This protein promotes the recruitment of soluble components that participate in protein sorting and recycling from pre-Golgi intermediates (vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs)). We previously reported that a constitutively activated form of Rab2 (Q65L) as well as Rab2 wild type promoted vesicle formation from VTCs. These vesicles contained Rab2, beta-COP, p53/gp58, and protein kinase Ciota/lambda but lacked anterograde-directed cargo. To identify other candidate Rab2 effectors, the polypeptide composition of the vesicles was further analyzed. We found that vesicles released in response to Rab2 also contained the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). To study the relationship of this enzyme to Rab2 function, we performed a quantitative binding assay to measure recruitment of GAPDH to membrane when incubated with Rab2. Rab2-treated microsomes showed a 5-10-fold increase in the level of membrane-associated GAPDH. We generated an affinity-purified anti-GAPDH polyclonal to study the biochemical role of GAPDH in the early secretory pathway. The antibody arrests transport of a reporter molecule in an assay that reconstitutes ER to Golgi traffic. Furthermore, the affinity-purified antibody blocked the ability of Rab2 to recruit GAPDH to membrane. However, the antibody did not interfere with Rab2 stimulated vesicle release. These data suggest that GAPDH is required for ER to Golgi transport. We propose that membranes incubated with anti-GAPDH and Rab2 form dead end vesicles that are unable to transport and fuse with the acceptor compartment."

CD146 is located at the intercellular junction where it plays a role in the cohesion of the endothelial monolayer. CD146 engagement initiates an outside-in signaling pathway involving the protein tyrosine kinases FYN and FAK as well as paxillin. Here we report that CD146 engagement by its specific monoclonal antibody in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induces a Ca2+ influx that is sensitive to thapsigargin and EGTA treatment, indicating that CD146 engagement initiates a store-operated calcium mobilization. In addition, biochemical and pharmacological analysis revealed that CD146 engagement initiates the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ, Pyk2, and p130Cas. Pharmacological inhibition of Ca2+ flux with 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acetoxymethyl ester and EGTA indicated that an increase in Ca2+ is required for Pyk2 and p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, a complex association was observed between Pyk2, p130Cas, and paxillin. These results indicate that CD146 is coupled to a FYN-dependent pathway that triggers Ca2+ flux via phospholipase C-γ activation leading subsequently to the tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream targets such as Pyk2, p130Cas, FAK, and paxillin.

CD146 expression is not restricted to the endothelium but is found on other non-malignant and malignant cell types such as melanoma cells (4Shih I.E. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In these cells, the cell surface expression of CD146 is associated with the metastatic properties of primary tumors (5Luca M.

CD146 belongs to the Ig superfamily of cell adhesion molecules with a V-V-C2-C2-C2 structure in the extracellular portion, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a relatively short cytoplasmic tail containing 61 amino acids (7Sers C.

CD146 is involved in cell-cell adhesion through a heterophilic ligand that still remains unknown (8Shih I.M. Speicher D. Hsu M.Y. Levine E. Herlyn M.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This localization is consistent with a role of CD146 in the control of cohesive cell-cell interactions. 1N.

Dejana E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). They promote adhesion through their extracellular domain, whereas the intracytoplasmic tail is implicated in the outside-in signaling pathway that is derived from their engagement (12Taira E.

CD146 initiates an outside-in signal cascade upon monoclonal antibody engagement. Whereas CD146 is not phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, its engagement promotes the recruitment of the Src family kinase p59 fyn (FYN)2as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation of a large panel of intracellular proteins including p125FAK (FAK) and paxillin, two proteins present in focal adhesion plaques (16Anfosso F.

Calcium is a central second messenger that mediates a large number of cellular processes such as cell division, gene transcription, and/or cell death (17Clapham D.E.

Activation of multiple cell surface receptors linked to PTK activation leads to increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+] i) (19Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A feature of PTK-induced increase in [Ca2+] i involves a two-step process characterized at first by a rapid, transient release of Ca2+ stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (20Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). This release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores occurs, at least in part, via activation of phospholipase C (21Kim H.K. Kim J.W.

PLCγ activation results in increased production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and emptying of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor-gated Ca2+stores. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores then induces sustained extracellular calcium influx via store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (23Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Numerous endothelial cell functions are regulated by elevation in [Ca2+] i levels such as the secretion of endothelial cell granules, regulation of endothelial permeability, adhesion, and transmigration of circulating cells as well as rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton (24Huang A.J.

We show here that engagement of CD146 in HUVEC triggers a store-dependent Ca2+ influx that requires the tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr(P)) of FYN and PLCγ. In addition, CD146 engagement induces the Tyr(P) of the PTK Pyk2 (29Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L. Wilm M. Anderegg R.J. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol.

Thus, these data confirm and expand the concept that besides its function as adhesive protein, CD146 is also a signaling molecule involved in the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Fluo3-AM, Pluronic F-127, and BAPTA-AM were from Molecular Probes (Eugene OR). Thapsigargin, herbimycin, and ionomycin were from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA); PP1 and U73122 were from Calbiochem. Culture medium and culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Chemical reagents were from Sigma. mAbs against CD146 (S Endo-1 and 7A4) were from Biocytex (Marseille, France), and goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin F(ab′)2 (GAM) was from Jackson Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA), and mAbs against phosphotyrosine (PY20), FYN, p130Cas, Pyk2, paxillin, and PLCγ were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). HUVECs were isolated from umbilical cord veins according to the method of Jaffe et al. (34Jaffe E.R. Nachman R. Becker C. Minick C. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar). They were used at subconfluency after one passage. Cell monolayers were starved for 3 h in serum-free RPMI containing 0.5% BSA. For drug treatment experiments, HUVECs were pretreated with the drug for the indicated time prior to CD146 engagement. CD146 clustering was performed as described previously (16Anfosso F. Bardin N. Francès V. Vivier E. Camoin-Jau L. Sampol J. Dignat-George F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26852-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, quiescent HUVECs were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-CD146 F(ab′)2 mAb in HBSS 30 min at 4 °C; after washing, cross-linking was then performed with 20 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 (GAM), and the cells were processed for calcium determinations. Control cells were incubated with isotype-matched IgG1 and cross-linked with GAM. Herbimycin, PP1, and U73122 were dissolved in Me2SO and incubated with HUVECs in serum-free HBSS, at the required concentration, 30 min prior to engagement of CD146. When required, HUVECs were preincubated with BAPTA-AM for 30 min at 37 °C and washed twice in HBSS, and engagement of CD146 was performed as indicated above. To study the effect of EGTA on the tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins, EGTA (5 mm) was added throughout the addition of GAM. Serum-starved subconfluent HUVECs grown in 96-well plates were loaded with Fluo3-AM (5 μm) and 0.2 mg/ml Pluronic F-127 by incubation in loading buffer (HBSS supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% BSA) (35Donnadieu E. Trautmann A. Malissen M. Trucy J. Malissen B. Vivier E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32828-32834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed in loading buffer and incubated for at least 15 min at room temperature, washed, and incubated again in loading buffer. CD146 engagement was then performed using anti-CD146 mAb at 4 °C as described (16Anfosso F. Bardin N. Francès V. Vivier E. Camoin-Jau L. Sampol J. Dignat-George F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26852-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed and incubated in Ca2+-free loading buffer to which 2 mm CaCl2 was added when required, and cross-linking with GAM was performed as described above. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were determined immediately upon addition of GAM to the Fluo3-loaded cell monolayers at 37 °C using a plaque-reader spectrofluorimeter (Cytofluor series 4000 Perspective Biosystems). Levels of fluorescence from cells in individual wells were monitored at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. The signal was calibrated by addition of 10 μm ionomycin containing Ca2+ (2 mm) to obtain maximal fluorescence (Rmax). After a stable fluorescence at 530 nm (Rmax), the medium was changed to one containing 5 mm EGTA in calcium-free medium with 10 μm ionomycin (Rmin). [Ca2+] i concentration was calculated using the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (36Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using the equation: [Ca2+] i = Kd (R −Rmin)/(Rmax− R) with Kd = 400 nm (37Kao J.P.Y. Harootunian A.T. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8179-8184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, HUVECs were pretreated at 37 °C before cross-linking for 5 min with 1 μmthapsigargin for measurement of calcium release from intracellular stores. The effect of extracellular calcium was analyzed in presence of 5 mm EGTA in the loading buffer. Calcium influx was then assayed as required. All pharmacological and monoclonal antibody treatments did not alter the cell viability assessed both by treatment with 10 mm ionomycin to trigger calcium influx and by trypan blue dye exclusion demonstrating that the cells were still viable. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (16Anfosso F. Bardin N. Francès V. Vivier E. Camoin-Jau L. Sampol J. Dignat-George F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26852-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In brief, cell lysates (300–600 μg of total proteins/sample, i.e. 0.3 to 1 × 107 cells/sample) were immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of mAb for 3 h at 4 °C under constant agitation, followed by a 2-h incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads. After washing, the recovered proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose C+ membranes. After blocking, membranes were incubated in TBS-T 5% BSA containing indicated antibodies (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and ECL reagent. When required, membranes were stripped and reblotted with the indicated antibodies. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Calcium measurements were analyzed by the unpaired Student's t test. Differences were considered significant with p < 0.05. To determine whether the engagement of CD146 in HUVECs triggers an increase in [Ca2+] i , cells loaded with 5 μm Fluo3-AM were pretreated with anti-CD146 mAb F(ab′)2 fragment (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 20 min and equilibrated at 37 °C for 180 s, and [Ca2+] i was measured after cross-linking with GAM F(ab′)2 antibody (20 μg/ml). In the presence of 2 mm extracellular calcium, the engagement of CD146 resulted in an increase in [Ca2+] i characterized by an initial peak followed by a phase showing a slow decrease (Fig.1). The initial increase peaked from basal levels of 139.4 ± 20.6 to 912.9 ± 188.3 nm (mean values ± S.E., p < 0.001,n = 15) within 30 s upon GAM addition. This [Ca2+] i rise was followed by a gradual decline in [Ca2+] i levels which at the end of the incubation had not yet returned to base-line levels. [Ca2+] i rise was dose-dependent, and 10 μg/ml anti-CD146 generated a maximal [Ca2+] i response (data not shown). No change in [Ca2+] i was observed when an isotype-matched antibody was used instead of anti-CD146 mAb indicating that intracytoplasmic calcium changes are specific for the engagement of CD146. To determine which Ca2+ sources contribute to the intracytoplasmic calcium flux in response to CD146 engagement, internal Ca2+ stores were depleted by 1 μm thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of endoplasmic Ca2+ pumps (38Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 87: 2466-2470Crossref Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). Addition of 1 μm TG to HUVECs preincubated with anti-CD146 mAb induced a transient increase in [Ca2+] i (1643.6 ± 334.5 in TG-treated cells versus 128.7 ± 21.5 nm in control cells,n = 4) which peaked in 20 s. After [Ca2+] i has returned down to base-line values within 180 s, GAM was added to the monolayer. Preincubation of HUVEC with TG (1 μm) completely blocked [Ca2+] i increase after addition of GAM as compared with [Ca2+] i increase obtained in cells without TG treatment (Fig. 2 A, n = 4). These results indicated that the initial rise of [Ca2+] i in response to CD146 engagement was dependent on intracellular store depletion. Cross-linking of CD146 was then performed in the presence or absence of EGTA (5 mm). EGTA had no effect on the initial transient increase but strikingly decreased the [Ca2+] i in the second phase from 832.5 ± 106.3 to 332.9 ± 45.8 nm (p < 0.002, n = 4) (Fig. 2 B). The role of extracellular calcium was confirmed in a subsequent experiment where CD146 cross-linking was performed in the absence of extracellular calcium. As shown in Fig. 2 C, only the first transient rise in [Ca2+] i was observed. After the peak has returned close to the basal level, subsequent addition of 2 mm Ca2+ to the extracellular medium restored the second slow phase of [Ca2+] i (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these data indicate that the second phase of slow decrease was on the dependence of extracellular calcium sources. These results suggest that CD146 engagement stimulates Ca2+ influx into the cells that depends both on Ca2+ release from internal stores and Ca2+ entry from the extracellular milieu. For receptors coupled to PTK, calcium mobilization requires the activation of PTK and the recruitment of PLCγ to the plasma membrane (20Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Previous data have indicated that upon engagement, CD146 recruits the PTK FYN (16Anfosso F. Bardin N. Francès V. Vivier E. Camoin-Jau L. Sampol J. Dignat-George F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26852-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To define the roles of FYN in the mobilization of Ca2+ linked to CD146 engagement, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-FYN mAb, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Tyr(P) mAb (PY20). As shown in Fig.3 (upper panel), Tyr(P) of FYN was observed after CD146 engagement (lane b) but was not observed after treatment of HUVECs with an isotype-matched IgG1 mAb (lane a). The Tyr(P) of FYN was totally abolished by preincubation of HUVECs with herbimycin (2 μm, lane c) and PP1 (10 μm, lane d), a Src family kinase inhibitor selective for the kinases FYN and Lck (39Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). CD146 engagement also induced the Tyr(P) of PLCγ (Fig.4, upper panel, lane b) which was not observed in control cells (lane a). PLCγ phosphorylation was abolished by preincubation of HUVECs with PP1 (10 μm) (lane c). Preincubation of cells with BAPTA-AM, a chelator of intracellular calcium, or EGTA did not inhibited the Tyr(P) of PLCγ (lanes d and e). These results suggest that the Tyr(P) of PLCγ induced by CD146 engagement is mediated by FYN activation. However, no direct association between CD146 and PLCγ was initiated by CD146 engagement (data not shown). The involvement of FYN and PLCγ in [Ca2+] i mediated by CD146 engagement was confirmed by using pharmacological inhibitors. Pretreatment of HUVECs for 30 min with 2 μm herbimycin (Fig.5 A) or 10 μm PP1 (Fig. 5 B) prior to CD146 engagement extinguished [Ca2+] i increase induced by CD146 cross-linking. Similarly, preincubation of HUVECs 30 min with 10 μmU73122, an inhibitor of PLCγ (40Smith R.J. Sam L.M. Justen J.M. Bundy G.L. Bala G.A. Bleasdale J.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 688-697PubMed Google Scholar), abolished the rise in [Ca2+] i in response to CD146 engagement (Fig.5 C). Taken together, these results are consistent with a scheme according to which CD146 engagement induces the recruitment and activation of FYN, leading to the Tyr(P) of PLCγ, which in turn participates to the increase in [Ca2+] i .Figure 5Effect of kinase inhibitors on calcium influx induced by CD146 engagement in HUVEC. CD146 engagement was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Calcium release in HUVECs loaded as described Fig. 1 was assayed for 360 s after GAM cross-linking (●). Prior to CD146 engagement, cells were incubated 30 min with inhibitors (*). A, herbimycin (Herb, 2 μm); B, 10 μm PP1; and C, 10 μmU73122. The curves are representative of four experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CD146 engagement leads to the Tyr(P) of FAK, a PTK present in focal adhesion (15DeLisser H.M. Scott Badwin H. Albelda S.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PYK2, another PTK related to FAK, is activated by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration (reviewed in Ref. 41Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). To determine whether PYK2 was involved in the signaling pathway mediated by CD146 engagement, anti-Pyk2 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P) PY20 and anti-Pyk2. GAM cross-linking performed for 15 min induced the Tyr(P) of a band of ∼100 kDa identified as Pyk2 (Fig.6 A, upper panel, lane b) that was not observed in the absence of CD146 engagement. The Tyr(P) of Pyk2 was abolished by PP1 (10 μm) (lane c), by the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (25 μm,lane d), and by EGTA (5 mm, lane e). This phosphorylation was observed despite the absence of a molecular association between CD146 and Pyk2 (data not shown). These data indicate that Pyk2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following CD146 engagement by a process requiring both the activation of an Src family PTK and calcium mobilization from intra- and extracellular stores. The adapter protein p130Cas localizes to focal adhesion points and interacts with Pyk2 (32Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton H.A. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 33Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of Pyk2 as a transducing molecule toward proteins of the focal adhesion plaques was then investigated in response to CD146 engagement. Similar to experiments with Pyk2, CD146 cross-linking with GAM for 15 min induced the Tyr(P) of a band with a molecular mass of ≈130 kDa corresponding to p130Cas (Fig. 6 B, upper panel, lane b). No phosphorylation was observed in HUVECs treated with a control isotype-matched (IgG1) mAb (lane a). The Tyr(P) of p130Cas was abrogated by pretreatment of HUVECs with PP1 (10 μm, lane c) and was reduced by BAPTA-AM (25 μm) or EGTA (5 mm) (lanes dand e). Nevertheless, CD146 did not associate with p130Cas (data not shown). Pyk2 has been shown to associate with paxillin (42Salgia R. Avraham S. Pisick E. Li J.L. Raja S. Greenfield E.A. Sattler M. Avraham H. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31222-31226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Paxillin is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD146 engagement (16Anfosso F. Bardin N. Francès V. Vivier E. Camoin-Jau L. Sampol J. Dignat-George F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26852-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether paxillin and also p130Cas associate with Pyk2 in HUVECs upon CD146 triggering. As shown in Fig.7, anti-Pyk2 immunoprecipitates performed on anti-CD146-stimulated HUVEC lysates contained a 130-kDa band reactive with anti-p130Cas mAb as well as a 70-kDa band reactive with anti-paxillin mAb (lanes b). Of note, constitutive association of Pyk2 and paxillin but not of Pyk2 and p130Cas was observed in unstimulated HUVECs (lanes a). The time course of the Tyr(P) of FYN, PLCγ, Pyk2, and p130Cas upon CD146 engagement was then investigated. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) mAb and immunoblotted with the indicated mAbs. CD146 engagement rapidly stimulates the Tyr(P) of FYN and PLCγ (Fig.8) which reached their maximum 2 and 5 min, respectively, after GAM cross-linking. It should be noted that Tyr(P) of Fyn was detected as soon as 15 s upon CD146 engagement (data not shown). Maximal Tyr(P) of Pyk2 and p130Cas were observed after 20 min. The Tyr(P) of Pyk2 was transient, whereas that of p130Cas remained sustained after 30 min. These results indicate that CD146 engagement induces an outside-in signal pathway involving at first FYN and PLCγ followed by the phosphorylation of Pyk2 and p130Cas. Previous data have indicated that CD146 initiates an outside-in signal transduction pathway that involves the recruitment of the Src PTK FYN and leads to the Tyr(P) of FAK and paxillin, two proteins present in the focal adhesion plaques (16Anfosso F. Bardin N. Francès V. Vivier E. Camoin-Jau L. Sampol J. Dignat-George F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26852-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that in endothelial cells, CD146 engagement promotes an increase in [Ca2+] i both by Ca2+ release from TG-sensitive Ca2+ stores and entry of extracellular Ca2+. This process requires the activation of FYN and PLCγ. Moreover, Ca2+ appears to serve as a second messenger by coupling Ca2+ release to the Tyr(P) of the related FAK kinase, Pyk, and the adapter protein, p130Cas, and favoring their association. The Ca2+ influx initiated by CD146 engagement in HUVECs is representative of the well known SOCE. Indeed, the initial rapid Ca2+ mobilization depends upon TG-sensitive stores, whereas the long lasting decrease depends on the extracellular Ca2+. This SOCE is mediated by activation of FYN and PLCγ (20Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), a key enzyme involved in calcium traffic (19Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). CD146 recruitment of FYN initiates the Tyr(P) of PLCγ, as evidenced by the inhibition of PLCγ Tyr(P) by PP1, and is consistent with the time course. These data of FYN and PLCγ phosphorylation are in agreement with previous reports indicating that FYN is involved in calcium mobilization by initiating the activation of PLCγ (44Briddon S.J. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 45Dhar A. Shukla S.D. J. Biol.

Some recent data suggest that Ca2+ influx results from a secretory pathway induced by a close interaction between ER calcium stores and the plasma membrane via an involvement of the actin cytoskeleton (47Putney J.W.

The secretion requires intracellular fusion events mediated by SNAP-25, a membrane protein belonging to the SNAP receptor proteins (49Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 475-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The mobilization of calcium ions in addition to the recruitment of FYN play an active role in the outside-in signaling pathway mediated by CD146. Indeed, CD146 engagement leads to Tyr(P) of Pyk2, the calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase related to FAK (reviewed in Ref. 41Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), by a calcium-dependent mechanism. FYN is also involved in the activation of Pyk2. It is known that several Pyk2 tyrosine residues (Tyr-402, Tyr-579, and Tyr-580 within the catalytic domain and Tyr-881 within the carboxyl terminus domain) create binding sites for the SH2 of the Src-like PTK (50Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 51Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pyk2 also associates with and is phosphorylated by FYN during stimulation of T cell antigen receptor (52Qian D.P. Lev S. Vanoers N.C. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in the case of CD146 engagement, FYN exerts an indirect effect on Pyk2 because no direct association between Fyn and Pyk2 could be found (data not shown). Moreover, Pyk2 Tyr(P) occurs more later than that of FYN, indicating that Pyk2 acts downstream of FYN. The signaling pathway initiated by CD146 engagement includes the Tyr(P) of FAK and its substrate paxillin (16Anfosso F. Bardin N. Francès V. Vivier E. Camoin-Jau L. Sampol J. Dignat-George F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26852-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). p130Cas belongs to the group of proteins that associate with FAK and is involved in cell migration (33Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation in response to CD146 engagement strengthens the relationship between CD146 and focal adhesion points by a way that is dependent on FYN recruitment. Indeed, p130Cas Tyr(P) depends on an Src PTK activation as demonstrated by PP1 inhibition and on calcium influx as evidenced by its partial inhibition by the calcium chelators. Src PTKs have been implicated in the Tyr(P) of p130Cas mediated by integrins or shear stress (53Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Okuda M. Takahashi M. Suero J. Murry C.E. Traub O. Kawakatsu H. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26803-26809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Nevertheless Pyk2 does not associate with p130Cas in anti-CD146-treated HUVECs. The molecular structures implicated in the association of Pyk2 and p130Cas upon CD146 engagement are not known, but the SH3 domain of p130Cas and the two proline-rich sequences of Pyk2 have been involved in the formation of such a complex (55Ohba T. Ishino M. Aoto H. Sasaki T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). p130Cas is a ligand of FAK by its SH3 domain (56Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and increases cell migration promoted by FAK (57Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Taken together, the fact that p130Cas plays an important role in the organization of the cytoskeletal framework (58Nakumura I. Jimi E. Duong L.T. Sasaki T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11144-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 59Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z.I. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T.

These results are consistent with data indicating that a part of CD146 is recovered in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction and that CD146 colocalizes with F-actin (1Bardin N. George F. Mutin M. Brisson C. Horschowski N. Francès V. Lesaule G. Sampol J. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Nevertheless a direct effect of CD146 engagement on the actin reorganization has never been observed (data not shown). In summary, the present study thus demonstrates that engagement of CD146 induces a complex signaling pathway that includes Ca2+ influx as a second messenger involved in cytoskeleton dynamics. FYN plays a crucial function in the initiation of CD146 signal transduction. Upon engagement, FYN is recruited and phosphorylated by CD146. FYN allows the activation of PLCγ which in turns can hydrolyze membrane phosphoinositides. The binding of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate to its receptor would induce the release of Ca2+ from internal stores and initiate a store-dependent entry of extracellular Ca2+. In addition, FYN regulates the Tyr(P) of targets of CD146 localized in the focal adhesion plaques by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. FYN initiates the phosphorylation of Pyk2 which in turns associates with p130Cas and paxillin and will allow their localization in focal adhesion plaques. CD146 engagement leads to the Tyr(P) of FAK and paxillin and their association on the one hand (16Anfosso F. Bardin N. Francès V. Vivier E. Camoin-Jau L. Sampol J. Dignat-George F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26852-26856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and Tyr(P) of Pyk2 and its association with paxillin on the other hand. It is known that FAK and Pyk2 are differentially regulated by cell adhesion and by soluble factors or develop distinct signal transduction events. Whereas FAK mainly localizes to focal contact sites, Pyk2 exhibits a punctate perinuclear distribution in FAK−/− embryo fibroblasts. Only a small fraction of Pyk2 is found in focal adhesion points (43Sieg D.J. Iliæ D. Jones K.C. Damsky C.H. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5933-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar,61Schaller M.D. Sasaki T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2384-2389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We can hypothesize that upon CD146 engagement, distinct signaling pathways might be developed. The cellular context might dictate which nonreceptor PTK is activated. The localization of CD146 at the intercellular junction suggests that CD146 might mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions that initiate an outside-in signaling cascade after its engagement with its ligand. Further studies are needed to determine the in vivo physiological relevance of the signaling pathways linked to CD146.

P115 interacts with two Golgi proteins, GM130 and giantin, suggesting that they might also participate in ER-Golgi traffic. Here, we show that peptides containing the GM130 or the giantin p115 binding domain and anti-GM130 and anti-giantin antibodies inhibit transport of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G protein to a mannosidase II-containing Golgi compartment. To determine whether p115, GM130, and giantin act together or sequentially during transport, we compared kinetics of traffic inhibition. Anti-p115, anti-GM130, and anti-giantin antibodies inhibited transport at temporally distinct steps, with the p115-requiring step before the GM130-requiring stage, and both preceding the giantin-requiring stage. Examination of the distribution of the arrested VSV-G protein showed that anti-p115 antibodies inhibited transport at the level of vesicular-tubular clusters, whereas anti-GM130 and anti-giantin antibodies inhibited after the VSV-G protein moved to the Golgi complex. Our results provide the first evidence that GM130 and giantin are required for the delivery of a cargo protein to the mannosidase II-containing Golgi compartment.

Cell. 1997; 89: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, the peripherally associated membrane protein p115 is required for ER to Golgi transport at the level of vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) downstream of the Rab1-requiring step and upstream of the Ca2+-dependent step (16Alvarez C. Fujita H. Hubbard A. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1205-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The recruitment of p115 to membranes is mediated by Rab1, and p115 can interact directly with a subset (membrin, rbet 1, and syntaxin5) of the ER-Golgi SNAREs (17Allan B.B. Moyer B.D. Balch W.E. Science. 2000; 289: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition to its VTC association, p115 directly interacts with two Golgi membrane proteins, GM130 and giantin (18Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.S. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Sonnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). GM130 is an extended rod-like protein (∼130 nm) with coiled-coil domains, initially identified as a component of an insoluble Golgi matrix (20Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). GM130 is anchored by its C-terminal domain to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane through interaction with the myristoylated protein GRASP-65 (the Golgi reassembly stacking protein 65) (21Barr F.A. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 91: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 22Barr F.A. Nakamura N. Warren G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3258-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The p115 binding domain of GM130 lies within its N-terminal 74 amino acids (23Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar,24Linstedt A.D. Jesch S.A. Mehta A. Lee T.H. Garcia-Mata R. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10196-10201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). At the ultrastructural level, GM130 localizes predominantly to thecis-Golgi (20Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). This distribution partially overlaps with p115 labeling the cis-Golgi. However, p115 appears more concentrated on structures associated with the cis-most aspect of the cis-cisterna (18Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.S. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The other p115 binding partner, giantin, is an integral component of the Golgi membrane that contains a large N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (>350 kDa) and a C-terminal membrane anchor domain (25Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 26Seelig H.P. Schranz P. Schroter H. Wiemann C. Griffiths G. Renz M. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 1994; 205: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Giantin is predicted to form a segmented coiled-coil dimer rod of ∼250 nm. The p115 binding domain has been mapped to the N-terminal 70 amino acids of giantin (24Linstedt A.D. Jesch S.A. Mehta A. Lee T.H. Garcia-Mata R. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10196-10201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Giantin has been localized to tubular-cisternal Golgi elements that might represent fenestrated connections between cisternal stacks (26Seelig H.P. Schranz P. Schroter H. Wiemann C. Griffiths G. Renz M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2564-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Such regions of the Golgi have been proposed to be specialized budding domains (28Weidman P. Roth R. Heuser J. Cell. 1993; 75: 123-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Ladinsky M.S. Mastronarde D.N. McIntosh J.R. Howell K.E. Staehelin L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1135-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Confocal analysis indicates that giantin and p115 do not extensively colocalize in the Golgi region (30Shima D.T. Haldar K. Pepperkok R. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1211-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The functions of GM130 and giantin have been studied predominantly in a cell-free assay that is based on the observation that Golgi complex disassembles during mitosis and subsequently re-assembles during late telophase (31Lucocq J.M. Berger E.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In this assay, isolated Golgi membranes are treated with mitotic cytosols to generate Golgi fragments that under experimentally controlled conditions (in the presence of NSF, α- and γ-soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs), and p115) re-assemble into cisternal elements and stacks (32Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.M. Warren G. Cell. 1995; 82: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The interaction between p115 and GM130 appears functionally relevant in this assay since the addition of the N-terminal GM130 peptide that binds p115 inhibits cisternal regrowth and cisternal stacking (23Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 33Shorter J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Likewise, the addition of the p115 binding N-terminal giantin peptide inhibits cisternal regrowth and cisternal stacking (34Lesa G.M. Seemann J. Shorter J. Vandekerckhove J. Warren G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2831-2836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting a functional interaction between p115 and giantin. The requirement for both GM130 and giantin function in the assay is further supported by the ability of anti-GM130 or anti-giantin antibodies to block cisternal regrowth and subsequent cisternal stacking (33Shorter J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The role of GM130 and giantin in membrane transport has been largely unexplored, but their close relationship with p115 suggests that these proteins might also participate in ER-Golgi traffic. The involvement of GM130 in traffic was suggested by the finding that expression of a GM130 mutant lacking the p115 binding N terminus inhibited the surface delivery of VSV-G protein and resulted in the disappearance of Golgi cisternae with the concurrent accumulation of small vesicles in the Golgi region (35Seemann J. Jokitalo E.J. Warren G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The role of giantin in trafficking has not been previously analyzed. We have examined the role of GM130 and giantin in ER-Golgi traffic by utilizing a VSV-G ts045 based semi-intact cell transport assay we previously used to document p115 requirement at the VTC stage of transport (16Alvarez C. Fujita H. Hubbard A. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1205-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Transport was inhibited by peptides corresponding to the p115 binding N-terminal domains of either GM130 or giantin and by anti-GM130 and anti-giantin antibodies. In all cases, the inhibition occurred before VSV-G protein delivery to the mannosidase II-containingmedial/trans-Golgi compartment. Both anti-GM130 and anti-giantin antibodies inhibited transport subsequently to the stage inhibited by anti-p115 antibodies. In agreement, morphological data showed that the anti-GM130 and the anti-giantin antibodies inhibit at the Golgi level at stages downstream from the VTC step inhibited by anti-p115 antibodies. Analysis of the kinetics of inhibition indicates that GM130 and giantin act at temporally different stages, with the GM130-requiring stage preceding the giantin-requiring stage. Our results document the novel requirement for GM130 and giantin in ER-Golgi transport and suggest that GM130 and giantin do not function simultaneously. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p115 (36Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and against GM130 (18Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.S. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J.

For affinity purification, lysates of bacteria expressing glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-p115 fusion protein or GM130 were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose strips containing GST-p115 or GM130 were incubated with immune serum in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% fat-free dried milk, 0.1% Tween 20 for 3 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were eluted with 0.1m glycine, pH 3.0, neutralized with 1/10 volume 1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2. The antibodies were concentrated and then used in transport assays. Monoclonal anti-giantin G1/133 antibody has been described previously (25Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol.

Monoclonal antibodies against mannosidase II were from BabCO (Berkeley, CA). Monoclonal antibodies against VSV-G protein (P5D4) were kindly provided by Dr. Kathryn Howell (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). Goat anti-rat and anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). GM130 fragment encoding amino acids 1 to 270 was generated with the polymerase chain reaction using the primer pair 5′-CCGGATCCGAATGTCGGAAGAAACCAG with 5′-GTTTCTAGACCATGATTTTCACCTCGTC and a template encoding rat GM130 cDNA in a pBluescript-II vector (18Nelson D.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10196-10201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). GST fusion protein expression and purification was performed according to the manufacturer's (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) protocol. The ER to Golgi transport assay was performed as described previously (16Alvarez C. Fujita H. Hubbard A. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1205-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 37Schwaninger R. Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Pind S. Balch W.E.

Briefly, NRK cells were grown on 10-cm Petri dishes (80–90% confluent) and infected with the temperature-sensitive strain of the vesicular stomatitis virus, ts045 VSV at 32 °C for 3–4 h (39Bergmann J.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 85-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The cells were pulse-labeled with Tran35S-label (200 mCi/ml; ICN, Irvine, CA) at the restrictive temperature (42 °C) for 10 min, chased with complete medium for 5 min, and perforated by hypotonic swelling and scraping. Transport reactions were performed in a final total volume of 40 μl in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 75 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm N-acetylglucosamine, ATP regeneration system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 IU of rabbit muscle creatine phosphokinase), 5 μl of rat liver cytosol, and 5 μl of semi-intact cells in 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 90 mm potassium acetate. Transport was initiated by transferring cells to 32 °C. After 90 min of incubation, cells were pelleted, resuspended in appropriated buffer, and digested with endoglycosidase H (endo-H) as described previously (37Schwaninger R. Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Pind S. Balch W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed on 8% SDS/PAGE and by fluorography. Transport was quantitated using a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). In some experiments, increasing concentrations of GST fusion peptides were added to a complete transport mixture containing cytosol and incubated on ice for 30 min to allow the peptides to interact with cytosolic p115. The mixtures were then added to the semi-intact cells, and transport was initiated at 32 °C. In some experiments, increasing concentrations of antibodies were added to a complete transport reaction containing semi-intact cells, transport mixture, and cytosol and incubated on ice for 30 min to allow the antibodies to interact with cellular GM130 or giantin. Transport was then initiated at 32 °C. Kinetic staging experiments were performed as described previously (40Davidson H.W. Balch W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 41Tisdale E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To test binding of cytosolic p115 to cell membranes used in the semi-intact cells transport assay, NRK cells were perforated (by hypotonic swelling and scraping as above) and rinsed with 0.5 m KCl to remove endogenous p115. In some experiments, increasing concentrations of GST-GM130/1–270 fusion peptide were added to a complete transport mixture containing cytosol and incubated on ice for 30 min to allow the peptide to interact with cytosolic p115. The mixtures were then added to semi-intact cells, and the cells were incubated for 60 min at 32 °C. Cells were collected by pelleting and rinsed (two times) with transport buffer, and the cell pellet was processed for SDS-PAGE. The amount of membrane-associated p115 was detected by Western blotting and quantified using GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). In some experiments antibodies were added to the semi-intact cells and incubated on ice for 30 min to allow the antibodies to interact with cellular GM130 or giantin. The cells were then supplemented with complete transport mixture and cytosol and incubated for 60 min at 32 °C. Cells were then processed as above to measure membrane-associated p115. NRK cells plated on coverslips were infected with ts045 VSV at 32 °C for 30 min followed by an incubation at 42 °C for 3 h and then shifted to ice and permeabilized with digitonin (20 mg/ml), as described previously (16Alvarez C. Fujita H. Hubbard A. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1205-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 42Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Coverslips were incubated at 32 °C for 90 min in transport mixtures supplemented with various IgGs, as indicated under “Results.” Transport was terminated by transferring coverslips to ice and fixing the cells in 3% paraformaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. The coverslips were then processed for double-label immunofluorescence as described previously (16Alvarez C. Fujita H. Hubbard A. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1205-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cell area and the mean fluorescence were measured with the IP Lab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics). The total cell area, the Golgi region area (defined by the presence of a select Golgi marker; see Fig. 6 legend), and the area of colocalization between the VSV-G protein and the Golgi marker were defined manually. These data are presented as a mean of analyses from five representative cells. To test whether the p115-interacting proteins GM130 and giantin participate in membrane traffic, we added recombinant GM130 or giantin peptide constructs to the semi-intact cell transport assay used previously to document p115 requirement during VSV-G protein transport (16Alvarez C. Fujita H. Hubbard A. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1205-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The peptide constructs were generated as GST fusion proteins and contained either the N-terminal 270 amino acids of GM130 (GST-GM130/1–270) or the first 261 amino acids of giantin (GST-GTN/1–261) fused to the C terminus of GST (Fig. 1 A). We previously showed that each construct contains a domain sufficient and necessary for p115 binding (24Linstedt A.D. Jesch S.A. Mehta A. Lee T.H. Garcia-Mata R. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10196-10201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The fusion constructs and a control GST protein were expressed in bacteria and purified nearly to homogeneity as judged by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1 B). The SDS-PAGE mobilities of the fusion constructs are appropriate for the specific composition of each peptide (GM130/1–270 is predicted to be 29,565 daltons, whereas GTN/1–261 is predicted to be 30,144 daltons). Increasing concentrations of GST-GM130/1–270 or GST-GTN/1–261 were added to cytosol and incubated on ice for 20 min to allow the peptides to bind to cytosolic p115. The mixtures were then used in the semi-intact cell transport assay. Transport was measured by following the processing of VSV-G protein from a core-glycosylated (endo-H-sensitive) ER form to a more mature (endo-H-resistant) form upon its arrival in a Golgi compartment containing mannosidase II. In agreement with previously published results (6Tisdale E.J. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29372-29379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14Subramaniam V.N. Peter F. Philp R. Wong S.H. Hong W. Science. 1996; 272: 1161-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), when transport was measured with untreated cytosol, ∼60% of VSV-G protein was processed to endo-H-resistant form, and this was set as 100% relative transport (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). When transport was analyzed in the absence of ATP (with an ATP-depleting system), more than 90% of VSV-G protein remained endo-H-sensitive, and this was set as 0% processing (lane 1). The addition of 10 μm GST had negligible effect on transport (lane 3). In contrast, addition of increasing amounts of the GST-GM130/1–270 construct led to a dose-dependent inhibition of VSV-G protein transport (lanes 4–6). Adding the GST-GTN/1–261 construct to the transport assay was also inhibitory. At the lowest concentration tested (2 μm,lane 7), the fusion peptide had no effect on transport, but increasing the concentration to 6 or 8 μmled to a significant (>80%) inhibition of VSV-G protein-processing (lanes 8 and 9, respectively). These data suggest that interactions between p115 and GM130 and between p115 and giantin are required for transport and that both GM130 and giantin function in ER-Golgi traffic. However, we have recently shown that the N-terminal domain of GM130 and the N-terminal domain of giantin interact with the same C-terminal acidic domain of p115 and compete for binding (24Linstedt A.D. Jesch S.A. Mehta A. Lee T.H. Garcia-Mata R. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10196-10201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, the addition of either the GST-GM130/1–270 or the GST-GTN/1–261 fusion peptide will prevent the interaction of p115 with both GM130 and giantin. Consequently, inhibition of transport by either peptide may not distinguish between GM130 alone, giantin alone, or both proteins as required for transport. To further characterize the role of GM130 and giantin in transport, anti-GM130, and anti-giantin antibodies were added to the semi-intact cell assay. Increasing amounts of affinity-purified polyclonal anti-GM130 antibodies were added to transport mixtures containing cytosol. The mixtures were added to permeabilized cells, and the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min to allow the antibodies to bind cellular GM130. Cells were then shifted to 32 °C for 90 min. As shown in Fig.2 A, lanes 3–6, the addition of anti-GM130 antibodies inhibited transport of VSV-G protein in a dose-dependent manner. Transport was blocked 70% when 0.48 μg was present in the assay (lane 6). Preincubation of the antibodies with recombinant full-length GM130 immobilized on nitrocellulose strips efficiently neutralized the inhibitory effect (compare lanes 2 and 7). In contrast, the antibodies remained inhibitory when pre-incubated with recombinant full-length p115 immobilized on nitrocellulose strips (data not shown). The addition of monoclonal antibodies directed against giantin also inhibited VSV-G protein transport. As shown in Fig. 2 B,lanes 3–6, the addition of 0.1- 0.8 μg of anti-giantin antibodies inhibited relative transport of VSV-G protein 10–90%. Heat-inactivating the antibodies neutralized their inhibitory effect (compare lanes 2 and 7). Analogous results were obtained with affinity-purified polyclonal anti-giantin antibodies (data not shown). These data indicate that anti-GM130 and anti-giantin antibodies inhibit VSV-G protein transport and suggest that both GM130 and giantin participate in VSV-G protein movement from the ER to a mannosidase II-containing Golgi compartment. We have shown previously that p115 binds to Golgi membranes by interacting with the N termini of GM130 and giantin (18Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.S. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Linstedt A.D. Jesch S.A. Mehta A. Lee T.H. Garcia-Mata R. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10196-10201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and that p115 is required for ER to Golgi traffic of VSV-G protein (16Alvarez C. Fujita H. Hubbard A. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1205-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, the anti-GM130 and anti-giantin antibodies could inhibit VSV-G protein transport by preventing p115 membrane binding. To address this issue, transport mixture (without cytosol) was supplemented with increasing amounts of anti-GM130 or anti-giantin antibodies, then added to perforated NRK cells that have been washed with 0.5 m KCl to remove membrane-associated p115. The cells were preincubated on ice for 30 min to allow the antibodies to bind cellular GM130 or giantin. Cytosol was added as the source of p115, and the cells were incubated at 32 °C for 60 min to allow p115 binding. The amount of p115 recovered with the membranes was determined by Western blotting and was quantitated relative to the amount of calnexin (used to standardize the amount of cells) present in each sample. As shown in Fig. 3 A,lanes 3–6, increasing amounts of affinity-purified anti-GM130 antibodies did not influence the binding of p115 to membranes. Equivalent amounts of bound p115 were recovered in those samples as in control samples (lane 1) or containing membranes treated with an irrelevant antibody against mannosidase II (lane 7). Cells that did not receive cytosol showed no detectable p115 (lane 2), indicating that the KCl wash removed all endogenous p115 and that cytosol was the only source of p115 in the assay. Similarly, p115 binding was observed when increasing concentrations of anti-giantin antibodies were added to the assay (Fig.3 B). No signal was observed when cells were omitted from the assay (lane 7). The effect of"

Previous biochemical studies from our laboratory have shown that calcium-free calmodulin and calcium bound calmodulin protect sites at amino acids 3630 and 3637 from trypsin cleavage (Moore, C. P., Rodney, G., Zhang, J. Z., Santacruz-Toloza, L., Strasburg, G., and Hamilton, S. L. (1999)Biochemistry 38, 8532–8537). We now demonstrate that both calcium-free calmodulin and calcium-bound calmodulin bind with nanomolar affinity to a synthetic peptide matching amino acids 3614–3643 of the ryanodine receptor. Deletion of the last nine amino acids (3635–3643) destroys the ability of the peptide to bind calcium-free calmodulin, but not calcium-bound calmodulin. We propose a novel mechanism for calmodulin's interaction with a target protein. Our data suggest that the binding sites for calcium-free calmodulin and calcium-bound calmodulin are overlapping and, when calcium binds to calmodulin, the calmodulin molecule shifts to a more N-terminal location on the ryanodine receptor converting it from an activator to an inhibitor of the channel. This region of the ryanodine receptor has previously been identified as a site of intersubunit contact, suggesting the possibility that calmodulin regulates ryanodine receptor activity by regulating subunit-subunit interactions.

The N-terminal four-fifths of the protein form the large cytoplasmic “foot” region, and the C-terminal one-fifth of the protein spans the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)1 membrane and forms the pore (1Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). RYR1 controls the release of Ca2+ from the SR, which is necessary for muscle contraction. RYR1 is modulated by several endogenous proteins (2Fleischer S. Inui M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 18: 333-364Google Scholar) that bind within the cytoplasmic domain to produce long-range, allosteric regulation of channel activity. Because endogenous modulators affect RYR1 channel activity and ultimately affect Ca2+ release from the SR, these modulators are likely to affect excitation contraction coupling. Calmodulin (CaM) is one of the endogenous modulators of the Ca2+ release channel (3Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys.

CaM is a dumbbell-shaped molecule consisting of N-terminal and C-terminal domains separated by an eight-turn α-helix. The N- and C-terminal domains each contain two Ca2+ binding sites (8Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenbough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Upon Ca2+ binding, CaM undergoes a global conformational change that leads to the exposure of hydrophobic pockets that bind the target protein (6James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 7Weinstein H. Mehler E. Am. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 213-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Most target proteins of CaM require the Ca2+-induced conformational change in CaM for binding and activation. Some target proteins, including RYR1, bind and are functionally altered by CaM in the absence of Ca2+ (9Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarret H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The major CaM-binding protein in skeletal muscle SR membranes is the Ca2+ release channel (3Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). At low Ca2+concentrations, comparable to the levels in resting muscle, CaM binds to and acts as a partial agonist of RYR1 (3Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At high Ca2+ concentrations, such as those measured during a calcium transient, CaM inhibits RYR1 (3Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that CaM plays a role in closing the channel in response to a Ca2+transient. We have shown that the conversion of CaM from an activator to an inhibitor of RYR1 is due to the binding of Ca2+ to CaM (10Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have also shown that CaM binds with high affinity at low and high Ca2+ concentrations to a single site on each subunit of RYR1 (10Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and that these binding sites are lost rapidly upon mild trypsin digestion of SR membranes (11Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both Ca2+-free CaM (apoCaM) and Ca2+CaM bound to RYR1 protect sites at amino acids 3630 and 3637 from trypsin digestion (11Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These data suggest that there is either a common region for the binding of both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM or that the binding of apoCaM and Ca2+CaM to separate sites can allosterically regulate the accessibility of this region of RYR1 (amino acids 3630–3637) to trypsin. The latter possibility seems unlikely because both an activator of the channel (apoCaM) and an inhibitor of the channel (Ca2+CaM) protect the same sites from trypsin (11Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine whether the region of RYR1 that encompasses amino acids 3630 and 3637 binds apoCaM and Ca2+CaM, we prepared a series of synthetic peptides matching sequences in this region. We found that both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM bind to peptides representing amino acids 3614–3643 of RYR1 but that different amino acids within this region contribute to Ca2+CaM and apoCaM binding. TRANS35S-LABEL™ (>1000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Irvine, CA). Bovine serum albumin, 3-(N-morpholino)propane sulfonic acid, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and dithiothreitol were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Peptides were synthesized in the core facility at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX) under the direction of Dr. Richard Cook. The mammalian CaM cDNA was graciously provided by Dr. Z. Grabarek (Boston Biomedical Institute, Boston, MA), and the cDNA for CaM B1234Q was graciously provided by Dr. Kathy Beckingham (Rice University, Houston, TX). Both CaM cDNAs were subcloned into the NdeI andBPU 1102 sites of the pET3 vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). For expression, BL21-DE3 Escherichia coli transformed with the pET3-CaM plasmid was induced with 0.3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were solubilized using the B-Per Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Mammalian CaM was purified by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, and B1234Q was purified by anion exchange chromatography (10Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of CaM and B1234Q were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine brain CaM as the standard. The mammalian CaM cDNA subcloned into the pET3 vector was expressed, metabolically labeled with TRANS35S-LABEL™, and purified according to the procedure described previously (10Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To replace methionine residues with the unnatural amino acid selenomethionine, CaM was expressed as described for the [35S]methionine labeling, except selenomethionine (7 μg/100 ml) was added to the minimal media at the time of induction in place of the radiolabel. SR membranes were prepared from rabbit hind leg and backstrap skeletal muscle and then purified using sucrose gradient centrifugation (12Hawkes M.J. Diaz-Munoz M. Hamilton S.L. Membr. Biochem. 1989; 8: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Lowry (13Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. 35S-CaM binding to SR membranes (10 μg) was as described previously (10Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The binding buffer contained 50 mm 3-(N-morpholino)propane sulfonic acid, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm EGTA with 1.2 mm CaCl2 (high Ca2+ binding buffer, 200 μm free Ca2+) or 1 mmEGTA alone (low Ca2+ binding buffer, 10 nm free Ca2+). Samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters and washed five times with 3 ml of the same buffer used for the binding incubation. The electrophoretic mobility of CaM was evaluated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under discontinuous conditions as a modified technique described by Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing gels (20% polyacrylamide) were run at 30 mA under low Ca2+conditions (1 mm EGTA in all gel buffers) or high Ca2+conditions (200 μm CaCl2 in all gel buffers). To determine the relative affinity of CaM for the CaM-binding peptide P3614–3643, tryptophan fluorescence was monitored with increasing amounts of CaM (0–210 nm) in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm3-(N-morpholino)propane sulfonic acid, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EGTA. At nanomolar Ca2+ concentrations, the final concentration of P3614–3643 was 100 nm. For high Ca2+ conditions, CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1.2 mm (200 μm free Ca2+), and the P3614–3643 concentration was 30 nm. Fluorescence data were collected on an SLM 8000C fluorometer (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). Excitation was at 295 nm with a 2 nm bandwidth and filtered with a UV pass filter (Oriel 59152). The emission was recorded at 340 nm with a 2.0 nm bandwidth and filtered through a 340 nm bandpass filter (Corion 9L134). To monitor the effects of selenomethionine CaM (Se-CaM), fluorescence data were collected on a SpectraMax Gemini fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). CaM proteins and P3614–3643 were added to final concentrations of 6 and 3 μm, respectively. Tryptophan excitation was set at 280 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 310 to 400 nm. Final fluorescence data were obtained by subtracting CaM and buffer effects from those of the CaM plus peptide and then normalized to the amount of peptide. Under these conditions, the observed fluorescence is attributed to the single tryptophan residue in the CaM-binding peptide P3614–3643. Scatchard analysis of 35S-CaM binding data to SR membranes was analyzed by linear regression. In the fluorescence studies, the EC50 and the Hill coefficient,n, were determined by fitting the data to the Hill equation by nonlinear regression (Sigma Plot 4.0; Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). FL=R/(1+(K/L)n)Equation 1 F L is the fluorescence intensity after subtracting nonspecific binding, R is the total binding site concentration, and L is the concentration of CaM. In the gel shift assays, densitometry was performed on the CaM band. Optical density data obtained in the presence of peptide were normalized to the optical density of the CaM band alone (the first lane of each gel) and plotted as a function of the peptide:CaM ratio. We have previously shown that CaM (either apoCaM or Ca2+CaM) bound to RYR1 protects sites at amino acids 3630 and 3637 from trypsin cleavage (11Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). One explanation for this finding is that both forms of CaM bind directly to this region of RYR1. To assess this possibility, we synthesized a series of peptides (TableI) matching sequences around this region. A representative nondenaturing gel of the five different peptides with CaM in 200 μm free Ca2+ is shown in Fig. 1 A. The densitometer determinations of the intensity of the CaM bands in the presence of increasing concentrations of peptide from three independent experiments at a 200 μm freeCa2+ are shown in Fig. 1 B. The peptide-CaM complexes migrate as higher molecular weight bands than CaM. The peptides alone do not enter the gel because they are positively charged. P3625–3644, P3614–3634, and P3614–3643 all show significant binding to Ca2+CaM, whereas P3614–3627 shows some binding to Ca2+CaM. Two of the peptides (P3614–3627 and P3614–3634) form only a single band with CaM regardless of the peptide:CaM ratio, whereas P3625–3644 and P3614–3643 can form multiple complexes with Ca2+CaM. The data suggest that Ca2+CaM interacts with these latter two peptides at both the N- and C-terminal lobes, and, at these high peptide concentrations, each CaM molecule binds to two peptides or both ends of CaM interact simultaneously with a single peptide. However, P3614–3627 and P3614–3634 may only have the binding site for one lobe of CaM and therefore produce only a single band, even at high peptide:CaM ratios. We interpret these findings to mean that both the N- and C-terminal lobes of Ca2+CaM bind within the sequence 3614–3634.Table ISummary of the interaction of Peptides with CAM and B1234QCa2+Ca2+(μm)(nm)PeptidesCaMB1234QCaMB1234Q(P3636–3652) FRMTPLYNLPTHRACNM−−−−(P3614–3627) KSKKAVWHKLLSKQ−−−−(P3625–3644) SKQRRRAVVACFRMTPLYNL+++++++(P3614–3634) KSKKAVWHKLLSKQRRRAVVA++−−−(P3614–3643) KSKKAVWHKLLSKQRRRAVVACFRMTPLYN++++++++ Open table in a new tab We also examined the interactions of these peptides with CaM at nanomolar concentrations of Ca2+ (Fig.2). A representative nondenaturing gel is shown in Fig. 2 A, and the data from three experiments are summarized in Fig. 2 B. ApoCaM bound only P3625–3644 and P3614–3643 (lanes 4 and 6), and its complexes with these peptides did not enter the gel. ApoCaM does not bind to either P3614–3634 or P3614–3627. As will be discussed below, the apoCaM appears to cooperatively bind two molecules of P3614–3643, suggesting that both the N- and C-terminal lobes of apoCaM bind to the sequence between 3625 and 3643. A mutant CaM, B1234Q, contains a single glutamate to glutamine substitution at the -Z position in each of the four EF-hand Ca2+ binding domains (15Mukherjea P. Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These substitutions cause a substantial decrease in the ability of CaM to bind Ca2+. Under the conditions used in these studies, B1234Q should not bind Ca2+ and can be used as a model of Ca2+-free CaM, even under high Ca2+ conditions. To confirm the low Ca2+ results, we tested the ability of B1234Q to bind to the peptides under high Ca2+ conditions. Fig.3 shows the densitometric analysis of the B1234Q CaM from three independent nondenaturing gel shift experiments at a micromolar concentration of Ca2+. Under this high Ca2+ condition, B1234Q does not bind peptides P3636–3652, P3614–3627, and P3614–3634 but does bind P3625–3644 and P3614–3643. These results with B1234Q under high Ca2+ conditions are consistent with those obtained with apoCaM (Table I). As with apoCaM, the B1234Q-peptide complexes do not enter the gel. Taken together, the results of all the gel shift assays suggest that the important molecular determinants for apoCaM binding are within the C terminus of the peptide P3614–3643, whereas Ca2+CaM binds toward the N terminus of P3614–3643. The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by selenium incorporated into CaM as selenomethionine (Se-CaM) has previously been used to characterize the interaction between CaM and other CaM-binding peptides (16Yuan T. Weljie A.M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the movement of CaM from the C-terminal portion of P3614–3643 toward the N terminus upon binding Ca2+, we assessed the ability of Se-CaM to quench the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the seventh amino acid of P3614–3643 (corresponding to Trp3620 of RYR1) at low and high Ca2+ concentrations. We tested the binding of CaM (without selenium) to P3614–3643 at a low Ca2+concentration (<10 nm free Ca2+) and found a slight blue shift and enhancement of the tryptophan fluorescence (Fig.4 A). The complex of P3614–3643 with Se-CaM displays a similar shift and enhancement in the peak tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 4 A). At a high concentration of Ca2+ (200 μm free Ca2+), there is a large blue shift and enhancement in the peak tryptophan fluorescence observed in the CaM-P3614–3643 complex that is quenched when Se-CaM is complexed with P3614–3643 (Fig.4 B). These data support a model in which apoCaM binds to the C-terminal portion of the CaM-binding peptide P3614–3643, and upon binding Ca2+, Ca2+CaM shifts to bind the N terminus of P3614–3643. The affinity of CaM for Ca2+ is increased when it is complexed with its target site (17Olwin B.B. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8081-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To determine whether the affinity of B1234Q for Ca2+ is increased when it is complexed with P3614–3643, we assessed the Ca2+ dependence of the interaction of CaM and B1234Q with P3614–3643 by monitoring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of P3614–3643. The Ca2+CaM-P3614–3643 complex showed a greater enhancement in tryptophan fluorescence than the apoCaM-P3614–3643 complex (Fig. 4,B versus A). The EC50 for the change in tryptophan fluorescence by CaM with increasing Ca2+concentrations was 81.0 ± 1.0 nm (Fig.5). The complex of B1234Q-P3614–3643 resulted in a similar blue shift and increase in the peak tryptophan fluorescence, as did apoCaM (data not shown). However, there was no observable change in the peak tryptophan fluorescence with increasing Ca2+ concentrations using B1234Q (Fig. 5). These data suggest that at high Ca2+ concentrations, B1234Q remains Ca2+-free when bound to the CaM-binding peptide P3614–3643. To define a sequence as the binding site for CaM, the peptide matching this sequence should have an affinity for CaM that is similar to that of RYR1. Our previous binding studies (11Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) used a CaM that had three additional amino acids at the N terminus due to the expression vector (now designated (N+3)CaM). Using metabolically labeled 35S-(N+3)CaM, we determined that three to four CaMs bind per tetramer on RYR1 at both nanomolar and micromolar concentrations of Ca2+. We have now generated and metabolically labeled CaM that does not have these three amino acids and analyzed its binding to SR membranes. The binding of 35S-CaM to SR membranes is shown in Fig.6 as representative Scatchard plots at nanomolar and micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ and is compared with 35S-(N+3)CaM in TableII. At both nanomolar and micromolar concentrations of Ca2+, 35S-CaM had lower affinity than that found with the 35S-(N+3)CaM. However, the B max values were similar. At a nanomolar concentration of Ca2+, there are 2.9 ± 0.5 (n = 3) CaM binding sites per ryanodine binding site, and at a micromolar concentration of Ca2+, there are 3.6 ± 0.5 (n = 3) CaM binding sites per ryanodine binding site. Because RYR1 binds one molecule of ryanodine, there are three to four CaMs bound per RYR1. Furthermore, (N+3)CaM completely inhibits the binding of 35S-CaM at both low and high Ca2+ concentrations (data not shown). These data indicate that both CaM constructs bind to the same sites. The three extra amino acids on the N terminus of (N+3)CaM are Gly-His-Ser. Why these amino acids increase the affinity of CaM for its binding site on RYR1 is unclear but may involve the charge on the His residue.Table IIBinding of 35S-CAM and 35S-(N+3)CAM to SR membranesCaMK d (nm) nm Ca2+B max(pmol/mg) nm Ca2+K d (nm) μmCa2+B max (pmol/mg) μmCa2+35S-(N+3)CaM4.7 ± 0.4 (n = 3)57 ± 3 (n = 3)2.5 ± 0.5 (n = 3)65 ± 4 (n = 3)35S-CaM26 ± 1 (n = 3)56 ± 3 (n = 3)17 ± 1 (n = 3)71 ± 8 (n = 3) Open table in a new tab To determine the relative affinity between CaM and P3614–3643, we measured the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of P3614–3643 as a function of increasing CaM concentration at nanomolar and micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ (Fig.7). The EC50 for apoCaM interaction with P3614–3643 was 20 ± 1 nm(n = 3). The EC50 for the interaction of Ca2+CaM with P3614–3643 was 9 ± 1 nm. Therefore, the affinity of CaM for the CaM-binding peptide P3614–3643 is on the same order of magnitude as that seen for RYR1 in SR membranes, suggesting that the sequence from 3614–3643 of RYR1 constitutes an apoCaM and Ca2+CaM binding site. From these data, it can be seen that at low Ca2+ concentrations, the maximal enhancement of tryptophan fluorescence is at a molar stoichiometry of 2:1 (peptide:CaM). This is also evident at high Ca2+ concentrations, although to a lesser extent. At both high and low Ca2+ concentrations, the Hill coefficients are greater than 1, suggesting that two peptides bind to each CaM molecule and that the binding of the first molecule greatly enhances the affinity for the second. The actual values of the Hill coefficients are difficult to determine because we are working with peptide concentrations that are greater than the K d of CaM for the peptide. Both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM modulate RYR1, but the functional consequences of the binding of these two forms of CaM to RYR1 are completely different: apoCaM is a channel activator, whereas Ca2+CaM is a channel inhibitor (3Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of activation and inhibition of RYR1 by CaM is unknown. We have previously shown with RYR1 (10Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Moore C.P.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C46-C53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that: 1) apoCaM and Ca2+CaM each bind to three to four sites per RYR1 tetramer, 2) apoCaM and Ca2+CaM binding sites are destroyed by trypsin at the same rate, 3) apoCaM and Ca2+CaM protect their own and each other's binding sites from destruction by trypsin, 4) the trypsin cleavage sites protected by both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM are located at amino acids 3630 and 3637, 5) both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM can protect their own and each other's binding site from oxidation (which destroys binding of both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM), 6) both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM can protect the apoCaM site from alkylation withN-ethylmaleimide (NEM), whereas NEM destroys only apoCaM binding, 7) the cysteine protected from alkylation with NEM by bound apoCaM or Ca2+CaM is cysteine 3635, and 8) the binding of 35S-B1234Q (the mutant CaM that cannot bind Ca2+) is completely inhibited by Ca2+ CaM and vice versa. These data support a model in which both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM bind to an overlapping region on RYR1, but there are different determinants within the RYR1 sequence for apoCaM and Ca2+CaM binding. To our knowledge, there are no other examples of a single region of a protein that can bind both Ca2+CaM and apoCaM using different determinants within the same region. We have also previously shown that this region is at a subunit-subunit interface within the RYR1 tetramer (20Wu Y. Aghdsai B. Dou S.J. Jhang J.Z. Liu S.Q. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25051-25061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that CaM may regulate RYR1 function by regulating the interactions between subunits. We now present additional data to support this model and to map the molecular determinants of the CaM binding site on RYR1. We demonstrate that a peptide corresponding to amino acids 3614–3643 of RYR1 can bind both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM. ApoCaM and B1234Q (a model of apoCaM even at high concentrations of Ca2+) bind to peptides P3625–3644 and P3614–3643 with similar affinities, suggesting that the middle and C-terminal half (amino acids 3625–3643) of the longer peptide are required for apoCaM binding. Ca2+CaM binds to both of these peptides and to a shorter peptide corresponding to amino acids 3614–3634, suggesting that the Ca2+CaM site is N-terminal to the apoCaM binding site. Previous investigations on the interactions between calmodulin and target peptides have made use of fluorescence spectroscopy of the tryptophan residue within the target peptide (21Weljie A.M. Vogel H.J. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Gomes A.V. Barnes J.A. Vogel H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of this technique to monitor the interaction of CaM with the RYR1 CaM-binding peptide, P3614–3643. This peptide has a tryptophan residue seven amino acids from its N terminus. We have shown that upon binding both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM, the peak intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of P3614–3643 is enhanced and blue shifted. These effects are much more pronounced for Ca2+CaM. This effect has also been observed for tryptophan residues on other CaM-binding peptides (16Yuan T. Weljie A.M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 21Weljie A.M. Vogel H.J. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and can be attributed to the tryptophan moving from a solvent exposed to a more buried hydrophobic position upon the binding of CaM. However, the possibility of other types of conformational changes occurring in the peptide-CaM interaction cannot be eliminated. Through monitoring the changes in the fluorescence yield of P3614–3643 upon the addition of CaM, we have shown that the relative affinity of CaM for P3614–3643 is in the same range as we have observed between 35S-CaM and RYR1. These data suggest that this stretch of amino acids within RYR1 constitutes the apoCaM and Ca2+CaM binding site. In other studies using tryptophan fluorescence to characterize CaM binding to its target peptide, Yuan et al. (16Yuan T. Weljie A.M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) were able to determine the binding orientation of CaM with a peptide encompassing the CaM binding region of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase. These investigators made use of the unnatural amino acid selenomethionine in place of methionine to quench the tryptophan fluorescence of myosin light chain kinase. The CaM-binding peptide of RYR1, P3614–3643, contains a single tryptophan residue near its N terminus. Data from our gel shift assays suggest that the determinants for apoCaM binding lie in the C-terminal portion of P3614–3643, whereas those for Ca2+CaM are more N-terminal to this on P3614–3643. If this is correct, then the use of Se-CaM at low Ca2+ concentrations should not significantly alter the tryptophan fluorescence of the Se-apoCaM-P3614–3643 complex compared with that of the apoCaM-P3614–3643 complex. However, at high Ca2+ concentrations, the binding of Se-CaM to P3614–3643 should quench the tryptophan fluorescence compared with that of the CaM-P3614–3643 complex. This is what we observed, supporting a model in which CaM, upon binding Ca2+, slides toward the N terminus of the RYR1 CaM-binding peptide, P3614–3643. Previous studies have shown that CaM can bind two peptides under some conditions (23Mukherjea P. Beckingham K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 29: 555-563PubMed Google Scholar). Our fluorescence binding data show Hill coefficients greater than 1, suggesting that each CaM molecule can bind two molecules of the peptide P3614–3643. Apparently, under the conditions of the peptide binding assays used for this study, this interaction is favored over the engagement of both ends of the CaM molecule by a single peptide. This phenomenon was also seen in the nondenaturing gels. However, it is expected that a single CaM molecule will bind to this sequence in the intact RYR1. The studies with the peptides strongly indicate that the sequence has the components necessary for binding both the N- and C-terminal lobes of the CaM molecule. In summary, our studies suggest that both apoCaM and Ca2+CaM interact with a sequence on RYR1 that includes amino acids 3614–3643. Our peptide data indicate that the Ca2+CaM site on RYR1 overlaps the apoCaM binding site, but different amino acids within these regions contribute to the binding of the two forms of CaM. This interpretation is supported by our previous findings that alkylation of cysteine 3635 inhibits apoCaM binding but not Ca 2+ CaM binding (19Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Williams B.Y. Rodney G. Mandel F. Strasburg G.M. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C46-C53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings also support a model in which Ca2+CaM shifts toward the N terminus of its binding site upon binding Ca2+ (Fig.8). Because Ca2+CaM is known to inhibit the channel, whereas apoCaM activates it, the conformation of the Ca2+CaM binding site would be expected to differ substantially from that of the apoCaM site."

FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli contains three glutaredoxins, with Grx2 being the predominant in terms of concentration and catalytic activity (80% of total GSH-oxidoreductase activity in E. coli) (28Aslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Currently, only one human glutaredoxin has been reported (23Padilla C.A. Martinez-Galisteo E. Barcenea J.A. Spyrou G. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The protein is generally considered intracellular but may also be found in human plasma (29Nakamura H. Vaage J. Valen G. Padilla A.C. Bjornstedt M. Holmgren A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Apart from its activity with ribonucleotide reductase, human glutaredoxin can reduce the GSH-mixed disulfide of inactive oxidized nuclear factor-I and thus restore its DNA binding activity (30Bandyopadhyay S. Strake D.W. Mieyal J.J. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 392-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxin has a role in reduction of mixed disulfides in cells exposed to oxidative stress (31Jung C.H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).The nuclear factor-κB NF-κB/Rel is one of the transcription factors whose DNA binding activity is regulated by a redox mechanism. Agents that modify free sulfhydryls such as N-ethylmaleimide and diamide inactivate the DNA binding of NF-κB, whereas reductants such as dithiothreitol (DTT), β-mercaptoethanol, and thioredoxin enhance its DNA binding activity (for review, see Ref. 4Kamata H. Hirata H. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar; Ref. 32Okamoto T. Sakurada S. Yang J.-Y. Merin J.P. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). NF-κB regulates the expression of various genes related to the immune response, stress, inflammation, and the inhibition of apoptosis (33Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar,34Van-Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar). Ordinarily, NF-κB proteins are expressed in an inactive form bound to an inhibitory protein referred to as I-κB. Following appropriate stimuli (UV radiation, inflammatory cytokines, phorbol esters, reactive oxygen species (ROS)), NF-κB is released from the cytoplasmic complex by phosphorylation and ubiquination-dependent degradation of I-κB. The I-κB-released NF-κB dimer translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to cognate DNA sequences and activates transcription of specific target genes (35Grilli M. Chiu J.J.S. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 36Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5546) Google Scholar, 37O'Neill L.A.J.

NF-κB is activated in a number of in vivo model systems of brain injury: brain trauma, focal ischemia, and kainate-induced seizure (38Salminen A. Liu P.K. Hsu C.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Baudry M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis of brain sections from Alzheimer's disease patients revealed that NF-κB was activated in the most damaged areas of the brain (42Terai K. Matsuo A. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 1996; 735: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In Parkinson's disease patients, the number of neurons with NF-κB-stained nuclei was 70-fold higher than that of control subjects, suggesting that translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus was related to the pathophysiology of the disease (43Hunot S. Brugg B. Richard D. Michel P.P. Muriel M.P. Ruberg M. Faucheux B.A. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7531-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar).Ref-1 regulates the activity of several transcription factors, including AP-1 elements (Jun-Fos dimers) and NF-κB. In addition, Ref-1 possesses apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease DNA repair activity against DNA damage caused by ROS, UV, and IR radiation (44Xanthoudakis S. Curran T.

It is expressed in subpopulations of cells in the brain, including granule neurons of the cerebellum (47Duguid J.R. Eble J.N. Wilson T.M. Kelly M.R.

Ref-1 itself is subject to redox control and was shown to interact with thioredoxin (49Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yudoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 64: 3633-3638Crossref Scopus (719) Google Scholar).The data presented here demonstrate that E. coli and human glutaredoxins could protect cerebellar granule neurons from DA-induced death by activating the DNA binding activity of NF-κB through Ref-1.MATERIALS AND METHODSPostnatal day 8 BALB/c mice were obtained from Tel Aviv University Animal Care Facility (Glasberg Animal Research Tower). Culture media, sera, and trypsin (0.25% in 0.05% EDTA) were from Biological Industries Co. (Beit Hemeek, Israel). 32P was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Sephadex G-25 from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden), and NF-κB inhibitor (SN50) from Promega (Madison, WI). Rabbit antibodies against NF-κB p65 and Ref-1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). I-κB-ΔN plasmid was a gift from Prof. Yinon Ben-Neriah.E. coli Grx2 was a recombinant preparation purified to homogeneity as described (50Shi J. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30639-36042Google Scholar). The single and double cysteine to serine mutants in the active site of Grx2 were prepared as described previously (50Shi J. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30639-36042Google Scholar), but without His tags, and purified to homogeneity with the method for the wild type protein. Antibodies to Grx2 were raised in a rabbit by standard techniques. Recombinant human Grx was prepared as described by (51Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Spyrou G. Bergman T. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11236-11243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Primary Culture of Cerebellar Granule NeuronsCultures of highly enriched granule neurons were obtained from postnatal day 8 BALB/c mice (52Lasher R.S. Zagon I.S. Brain Res. 1972; 41: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Cells were dissociated by trypsinization and plated in standard medium (basal Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B, supplemented with 1 mg/ml glucose (53Schram M. Eimrl S. Costa E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1193-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) on dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (cell density, 7 × 106 cells/35-mm diameter dish, 1.5 × 106cells/well for a 24-well plate, 2.5 × 105 cells/well for a 96-well plate). Cytosine-β-arabinofuramoside (Ara-C) (10 μm) was added to the medium 18–22 h after plating to prevent replication of non neuronal cells (54D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Galissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar).TreatmentsDA (3-hydroxytyramine hydrochloride, CH8502, Sigma) was dissolved directly in the proper culture medium. Cerebellar granule neurons were maintained in standard medium for 6–7 days. The medium was then replaced with serum-free standard medium with DA, rhGrx, Grx2, or Grx2 mutants, for various periods of time. Control cultures were maintained in serum-free standard medium.Prior to addition to the neurons, glutaredoxins were reduced with 2 mm DTT for 20 min at 37 °C. DTT was removed by two spin columns of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).Analysis of Neuronal ViabilityThe viability of the cultures (96-well plates) after treatment with DA and/or glutaredoxins was assessed either by Alamar Blue assay (AccuMed) or by 4,6-diaminodiphenyl-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Alamar reagent (1:10) was added to the treated cells for 2–2.5 h at 37 °C. The viability was evaluated by subtracting the fluorescence of the medium alone (without cells) from the fluorescence of the cells at 530 nm excitation wavelength and 590 nm emission wavelength. Cells were fixated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, rinsed with PBS, and incubated with 5 μg/ml DAPI for 5 min. Nuclei were visualized under UV light. Each assay was carried out in triplicate.Determination of the Apoptotic Commitment PointNeurons were treated with 600 μm DA. At different time points following DA exposure (1–24 h), the drug was washed out and replaced with fresh medium without DA. Similar sets of untreated cells served as control. Cell survival was monitored 24 h after DA administration, as mentioned above.Protein ContentProtein cell content was determined according to the method of Bradford (55Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 254-257Crossref Scopus (213510) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard.Immunocytochemistry and Nuclear Staining with DAPICerebellar granule neurons were grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine hydrobromide (P2636, Sigma).Treated neurons were fixed for 30 min in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, washed with PBS (pH 7.4), permeabilized, and blocked for 20 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in 10% normal goat serum. Cells were then incubated with anti-p65 or anti-Ref-1 antibodies (1:50) in PBS containing 2% normal goat serum for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and then incubated for 1 h with Cy3- or Cy2-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). To identify the cellular location of Ref-1 or p65, the DNA of the cells were stained with DAPI.Protein BiotinylationSulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (catalog no. 21335) (biotin) was purchased from Pierce. Grx2 and C9S-C12S mutant were incubated with biotin (75 μg of biotin/mg of protein) in PBS buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. Residual biotin was removed using Sephadex G-25 column before being given to cultures. Biotinylation was confirmed by Western blot analysis using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase.Biotinylated Grx2 and C9S-C12S mutant were incubated for 30 min with the neurons. Thereafter, the slides were washed, fixed for 5 min in methanol (−20 °C) followed by a 2-min incubation in acetone (−20 °C), and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and goat γ-globulin (Jackson Laboratories) (200 μg/ml) for 1 h. Next, the slides were washed and incubated with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (0.5 μg/ml, Jackson Laboratories) for 30 min. After overnight washing in PBS, the slides were mounted.To prevent bleaching of the fluorescence, moviol with n-propyl gallate was added to the slides before being excited with fluorescein and rhodamine filters.Treatment Affecting Coated Pit StructureHypertonic treatment, which blocks endocytosis via coated pits by dispersing the underlying clathrin lattices (55Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 254-257Crossref Scopus (213510) Google Scholar), was performed by incubating the culture for 15 min in PBS supplemented with 0.45 m sucrose. The cells were kept in hypertonic medium during incubation with Grx2.Confocal MicroscopyFluorescently-stained cells were analyzed using Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope. Zeiss LSM 410 inverted (Oberkochen, Germany) is equipped with a 25-milliwatt krypton-argon laser (488 and 568 maximum lines) and 10-milliwatt helium-neon laser (633 maximum lines). A 40× numeric aperture/1.2 C Apochromat water-immersion lens (Axiovert 135M, Zeiss) was used for all imaging.Western Blot AnalysisWestern blot analysis was performed as described by Harlow and Lane (57Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. Each lane was loaded with an equal amount of protein extracts (30 or 60 μg), which, following electrophoresis, was transferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 1.5 h. Blots were stained with Ponceau to verify equal loading and transfer of proteins. Membranes were then probed with anti-Ref1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-IκB α or anti-phospho-IκB α (Ser32) antibodies (New England Biolabs) (1:1000). Intensity of the signal was determined by ECL-Plus detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).Nuclear and Cytoplasmic ExtractsNeurons (7 × 106 cells) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off, pelleted, and resuspended in 30 μl of hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). After 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added (0.6%) and the lysates were spun down at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed (cytoplasmic extract), and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of buffer B (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) with frequent vortexing for 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, the nuclear extract was spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA).EMSAThe binding reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 15,000 cpm of 32P-labeled κB oligonucleotides (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) (Promega, Madison, WI) was incubated for 30 min with 5 μg of nuclear extract. For specificity control, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe was applied. In the antibody supershift assay, the reaction mixture minus probe was incubated with 2 μg of p50 and/or p65 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 15 min at room temperature. Products were analyzed on a 5% acrylamide gel made up in 1× TGE (50 mm Tris, 400 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA). Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film or to phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics). Quantitative data were obtained using PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics).Antisense Oligonucleotide TreatmentRef-1 antisense oligonucleotide and the complementary sense oligonucleotide were synthesized and high performance liquid chromatography-purified by Sigma Genosys Ltd. The oligonucleotides were labeled with fluorescein at the 5′ end and phosphorotioated at the 3′ end (at the positions marked by *) to confer nuclease resistance. The sequence of the Ref-1 antisense probe was 5′-TTCCCCGCTTTGGCAT*C*G*C-3′ and the sense 5′-GCGATCCCAAAGCGGGGAA-3′ (nucleotides −3 to 16). The probe did not show homology to other known genes according to the GenBank™ data base.The oligonucleotides were dissolved (10 mm stock) in distilled water prior to use and diluted to a final concentration of 5 and 10 μm in serum-free medium. Cerebellar granule neuons were treated with oligonucleotides 6 days after plating.Cotransfection of Cultured Cerebellar Granule NeuronsCerebellar granule neurons (1.5 × 106) were transfected 6 days after plating using the calcium phosphate method (58Moulder K.L. Onodora O. Burk J.R. Strittmatter W.J. Johnson E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 15: 705-715Crossref Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and with pl I-κB-ΔN gene (pRC-CMV-I-κB-ΔN), or with the GFP plasmid and the pRC-CMV empty vector. Cotransfections were carried out using a ratio of 1:1. 24 h after transfection, the medium was replaced by serum-free medium with or without DA and/or Grx2, and neuronal viability was analyzed by counting GFP positive cells under microscope (×20). For each treatment, four different fields from four different wells were analyzed.DISCUSSIONDA, the endogenous neurotransmitter of the nigro-striatal pathway, is a powerful oxidant that exerts its toxic potential through its oxidative metabolites. Reducing thiols such as DTT, NAC, and GSH are capable of neutralizing DA oxidative metabolites and thereby conferring protection against DA-induced apoptosis (14Zilkha-Falb R. Ziv I. Offen D. Melamed E. Barzilai A. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 17: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the search of more physiological thiol antioxidant, we found that E. coli Grx2 and human glutaredoxin could protect neuronal cells against DA-induced death by activating the NF-κB-dependent signal transduction pathway through Ref-1. Grx2 penetrated the neurons whether or not it was redox-active (Fig. 2). Our results are consistent with several studies that demonstrated that human Trx and its double thiol mutant were taken up similarly by 3T3 and MCF7 cells (2Powis G. Oblong J.E. Gasdaska P.Y. Breggren M. Hill S.R. Kirkpatrick D.L. Oncol. Res. 1994; 6: 539-544PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gasdaska J.R. Berggren M. Powis G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1643-1650PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Grx2 penetrates into the neurons is not clear. It does not involve a coated pit-dependent mechanism, perhaps by fluid phase, for example (61Sandvig K. Van Deurs B. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 275-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Grx2 internalization per se is not sufficient to initiate signal transduction; it must catalyze GSH-disulfide oxidoreduction in its active form. Similarly, Gasdaska et al. (3Gasdaska J.R. Berggren M. Powis G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1643-1650PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the redox activity of Trx is essential for its effects on cell proliferation. Our study does not rule out the possibility that Grx2 exerts its effects through specific interaction with cell surface receptors.Next, we looked for the intracellular targets of Grx2. Transcription factors whose DNA binding activity is redox-dependent were good candidates (reviewed in Ref. 4Kamata H. Hirata H. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Such transcription factors are the NF-κB Rel family of proteins, which have conserved cysteine residues in their DNA binding domains (62Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 63Okuno H. Akahori A. Sato H. Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. Iba H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 695-701PubMed Google Scholar). Modification of the cysteines with diamide reduced their activity, whereas treatment with reducing agents enhanced DNA binding. In this work, redox-active Grx2 increased the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. The effect was observed in isolated nuclei, suggesting a direct effect on NF-κB (e.g. the reduction of a mixed disulfide between a conserved cysteine and GSH). However, Grx2 also stimulates NF-κB translocation, through a process that involves I-κBα phosphorylation and degradation. Several reports indicated that accumulation of ROS can induce I-κB phosphorylation and degradation (64Kretz R.C. Mehlen P. Mirault M.E. Arrigo A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 65Legrand P.S. Schoonbroodt S. Martroule J.Y. Piette J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1998; 45: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 66Chen F. Demers L.M. Vallyathan V. Ding M. Lu Y. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20307-20312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our results show that a reductive agent such as Grx2 can induce I-κBα phosphorylation and/or ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This notion is consistent with the findings that glutathione peroxidase is involved in I-κBα phosphorylation (64Kretz R.C. Mehlen P. Mirault M.E. Arrigo A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes have been shown to be redox-regulated by the ratio between GSH and GSSG (67Obin M.S. Shang F. Gong X. Handelman G. Blumberg J. Taylor A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 68Janagen-Hodge J. Obin M.S. Gong X. Shang F. Nowell T.R. Cong J. Abasi H. Blumberg J. Taylor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 275: 28218-28226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Our results are partially consistent with the recent findings obtained by Hirota et al. (69Hirota K. Matsui M. Murata M. Takashima T. Cheng F.-S. Itoh T. Fukuda K. Yudoi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), who showed that hGrx reduced the ability of tumor necrosis factor α to phosphorylate I-κB but on the other hand enhanced NF-κB activation in HEK293 cells.The fact that Grx2 stimulates NF-κB DNA activity through Ref-1 activation (Fig. 11) demonstrates a multiple signaling role for Grx2. It has been shown that AP-1 transcriptional activity is regulated by a direct association between Trx and Ref-1 (49Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yudoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 64: 3633-3638Crossref Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Our data show that Ref-1 expression levels are redox regulated. In the presence of DA which causes oxidative stress, Ref-1 levels were dramatically decreased (Fi"
https://openalex.org/W2050749389,"Among the prokaryotae, the nucleotide ppGpp is a second messenger of physiological stress and starvation. The target of ppGpp is RNA polymerase, where it putatively binds and alters the enzyme's activity. Previous data had implicated the β-subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase as containing a single ppGpp binding site. In this study, a photocross-linkable derivative of ppGpp, 6-thioguanosine-3′,5′-(bis)pyrophosphate (6-thio-ppGpp), was used to localize the ppGpp binding site. In in vitrotranscription assays, 6-thio-ppGpp inhibited transcription from the argT promoter identically to bona fide ppGpp. The thio group of 6-thio-ppGpp is directly photoactivatable and is thus a zero-length cross-linker. Cross-linking of RNA polymerase was directed primarily to the β′-subunit and could be competed efficiently by native ppGpp but not by GTP or GDP. Cyanogen bromide digestion analysis of the cross-linked β′-subunit was consistent with an extreme N-terminal cross-link. To assess allosteric consequences of ppGpp binding to RNA polymerase, high level trypsin resistance in the presence and absence of ppGpp was monitored. Trypsin digestion of RNA polymerase bound to ppGpp leads to protection of an N-terminal fragment of the β′-subunit and a C-terminal fragment of the β-subunit. We propose that the N terminus of β′ together with the C terminus of β constitute a modular ppGpp binding site. Among the prokaryotae, the nucleotide ppGpp is a second messenger of physiological stress and starvation.

We propose that the N terminus of β′ together with the C terminus of β constitute a modular ppGpp binding site. RNA polymerase monoclonal antibody matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry Within the bacterial domain of the kingdom prokaryotae exists a general and ubiquitous response to nutritional and environmental stress, the stringent response (1Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Niedhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Wash. D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). This general stress response is mediated by high level accumulation of the transcription effector guanosine-3′,5′-(bis)pyrophosphate (ppGpp). A major effect of elevated ppGpp levels is an immediate and severe reduction of stable rRNA and tRNA gene transcription (2Ryals J. Little R. Bremer H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1261-1268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cessation of stable RNA syntheses halts the major energy consuming activities of the cell, transcription and translation. This period of metabolic inactivity allows the cell to utilize its remaining energy reserves to adapt to stressful growth conditions through induction of specific “stress genes” (3Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Nguyen L.H. Jensen D.B. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7982-7989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once adaptation is near completion, ppGpp levels decrease and growth resumes. Failure to reduce ppGpp levels results in a severe reduction of cell viability (4Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that ppGpp exerts its effects by directly binding to RNA polymerase (RNAP).1 Certain rifampicin-resistant mutants of the β-subunit of RNAP display increased intracellular sensitivity to ppGpp (5Little R. Ryals J. Bremer H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 787-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Little R. Ryals J. Bremer H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 1162-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spontaneously occurring mutants that confer survival under artificial and prolonged exposure to toxic levels of ppGpp were mapped to the rpoBgene, encoding the β-subunit of RNAP (7Tedin K. Bremer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2337-2344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant strains devoid of ppGpp, ppGpp0 strains, are incapable of surviving nutritional deprivation; however, specific mutants of the ς70-, β-, or β′-subunits of RNAP restores normal survivability to ppGpp0 strains (8Hernandez V.J. Cashel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 536-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quenching studies of RNAP in the presence of increasing concentrations of a fluorescently labeled ppGpp analogue (1-aminonapthalene-5-sulfonate-ppGpp) is consistent with binding of ppGpp to a single binding site on RNAP (9Reddy P.S. Raghaven A. Chatterji D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cross-linking analyses by Chatterji et al. (10Chatterji D. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) using a radioactive photocross-linkable derivative of ppGpp, 8-azidoguanine-3′,5′-(bis)pyrophosphate (8-azido-ppGpp), demonstrated predominant cross-linking of ppGpp to the β-subunit. In the same study (10Chatterji D. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), it was also observed that both N- and C-terminal partial trypsin digestion fragments of the β-subunit were cross-linked by 8-azido-ppGpp, suggesting a modular ppGpp binding site analogous to that of the nucleotide binding site at the catalytic center of RNAP (11Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Markovtsov V. Zaychikov E. Denissova L. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6641-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies on RNAP-ppGpp interactions, a precise localization of the ppGpp binding site on RNAP is lacking. An allosteric mechanism of ppGpp action on RNAP is generally invoked as mediating its transcriptional effects, although this has not been extensively studied. In this context, allostery refers to the inducement of functionally relevant conformational changes of RNAP as a result of ppGpp binding at a location other than the catalytic site. Consistent with this notion, ribonucleoside triphosphates do not compete with ppGpp for RNAP binding (12Kingston R.E. Nierman W.C. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2787-2797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, circular dichroism studies have revealed a small but significant change in total α-helical content of RNAP following addition of ppGpp (13Woody A.Y. Woody R.W. Malcolm A.D. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To date, this single previous study (13Woody A.Y. Woody R.W. Malcolm A.D. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) represents the only physical evidence of induced conformational change of RNAP by ppGpp. Clearly, further studies characterizing the nature of ppGpp allostery are warranted. The aim of the present investigation is 2-fold: 1) to substantiate and refine the location of the ppGpp binding site on E. coliRNAP; and 2), to begin to elucidate the nature of ppGpp-induced conformational changes of RNAP. Toward the first of these goals, we synthesized a new photocross-linkable derivative of ppGpp, 6-thioguanosine-3′,5′-(bis)pyrophosphate (6-thio-ppGpp). The 6-thio-ppGpp derivative is a zero-length photocross-linking reagent, because the thiol group is directly photoactivatable and has a van der Waals radius similar to the oxygen for which it is substituted (14Sergiev P.V. Lavrik I.N. Wlasoff V.A. Dokudovskaya S.S. Dontsova O.A. Bogdanov A.A. Brimacombe R. RNA. 1997; 3: 464-475PubMed Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling of RNAP with 6-thio-ppGpp indicates that the N terminus of the largest subunit of RNAP, β′, is the predominant location of cross-linking. To begin to investigate the conformational consequences of ppGpp-RNAP interactions, we assessed alterations in trypsin sensitivity of RNAP in the presence and absence of ppGpp. Three major ppGpp-dependent trypsin-resistant fragments of RNAP were observed. Identification of these trypsin-resistant fragments and their superimposition onto the three-dimensional structure of RNAP indicates an overlap with and close proximity to the 6-thio-ppGpp cross-linking site. These results have ramifications for both definitive identification of the ppGpp binding site on RNAP as well as for the allosteric consequences of ppGpp-RNAP interaction. -Escherichia coli RNA polymerase was purified from E. coli K12 strain MG1655 using the method of Burgess and Jendrisak (15Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) with the modifications of Lowe et al. (16Lowe P.A. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Final ς70 holoenzyme separation from core enzyme was accomplished by heparin-Sepharose chromatography (17Wellington S.R. Spiegelman G.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Crude RelA-ribosome preparations were prepared according to Cashel (18Cashel M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 57: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Chemicals and solvents were reagent grade, used without further purification, and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All radioactive nucleotides were obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. Synthesis conditions for ppGpp were as described (18Cashel M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 57: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For synthesis of radioactive ppGpp, 0.5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol) were diluted with 1 mm cold ATP and 0.5 mm GDP or 6-thioguanosine-5′-triphosphate (6-thio-GTP) in a 0.1 ml reaction volume mixed with 60 A260 units of crude RelA-ribosomes at room temperature for 12 h. Final purification of ppGpp was on a QAE-Sephadex A-25 column as described (19Cashel M. Kalbacher B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2309-2318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotides were typically eluted with a 0–0.5 m linear gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. Elution products were visualized by autoradiography after separation by polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography (20Cashel M. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 3: 341-355Google Scholar). It was noted that 6-thioguanosine derivatives chromatographed with lower mobility on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates than the corresponding guanosine containing compounds. The ppGpp-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated through removal of the triethylammonium bicarbonate solvent by lyophilization in a vacuum centrifuge at room temperature. The product was resuspended in 50 μl of water followed by precipitation with 2% NaI in acetone, the pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of acetone and a final wash with 1 ml of ether. The final product was resuspended in 50 μl of water. 6-Thio-ppGpp exhibited an ultraviolet light spectrum typical for ppGpp with a characteristic maximum at 253 nm and a shoulder peak between 265 and 280 nm at pH 7.0 (19Cashel M. Kalbacher B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2309-2318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 6-mercaptoguanosine was converted into the corresponding triphosphate as described by Sergiev et al. (14Sergiev P.V. Lavrik I.N. Wlasoff V.A. Dokudovskaya S.S. Dontsova O.A. Bogdanov A.A. Brimacombe R. RNA. 1997; 3: 464-475PubMed Google Scholar). The proton and phosphorus NMR spectra of purified ppGpp and 6-thio-ppGpp were obtained at 500 MHz on a Varian INOVA 500 (Chemistry Instrumentation Center, State University of New York at Buffalo) in 10% D2O pH 4.0, spectra was collected for 27 h. 1H and31P chemical shifts were compared and found to be nearly identical between ppGpp and 6-thio-ppGpp. Assignments of proton shifts were based on previous published spectra for 6-thio-GTP (14Sergiev P.V. Lavrik I.N. Wlasoff V.A. Dokudovskaya S.S. Dontsova O.A. Bogdanov A.A. Brimacombe R. RNA. 1997; 3: 464-475PubMed Google Scholar). RNA synthesis was carried out with a mixture of argT and lacUV5 (10 nmeach) promoter-bearing linear templates in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 250 μm GTP, ATP, and CTP, and 20 μm UTP with 15 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) in 20-μl reaction volumes at 37 °C for 10 min. Increasing amounts of GDP, ppGpp, or 6-thio-ppGpp were incubated as indicated with 100 nm RNA polymerase for 15 min at room temperature and then warmed to 37 °C for 2 min prior to initiating the reaction by adding an equal volume of prewarmed template/substrate mix. Reactions were terminated and processed according to Hsu (21Hsu L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 59-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was fractionated on a 7 murea-6% polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer. All cross-linking experiments were carried out in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol. E. coli RNA polymerase (1 μm) was incubated with radioactively labeled 6-thio-ppGpp in a 20-μl reaction volume. Samples were mixed, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then transferred to ice and irradiated with 302 nm ultraviolet light (MacroVue UV-20 transilluminator; surface intensity, 9000 μW/cm2) for 20 min at a distance of 4 cm in an open Eppendorf tube covered with a polystyrene filter to remove stray radiation of <290 nm, thus avoiding protein-protein cross-linking. Photoaffinity labeling reactions were terminated by the addition of 5× SDS sample buffer (0.625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 25% glycerol) to a 1× concentration. Samples were heated to 65 °C for 5 min and then resolved by electrophoresis through a SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel (30:0.8 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) to separate all RNA polymerase subunits and through a SDS-4% polyacrylamide gel to resolve β- and β′-subunits using Tris-glycine buffer. Radioactive 6-thio-ppGpp cross-linked β′-subunit was extracted from a denaturing SDS-4% polyacrylamide gel following electrophoresis. The region of the polyacrylamide gel containing β′-protein was excised. Protein was eluted by diffusion out of polyacrylamide by overnight shaking of macerated gel slices in 0.03% SDS at 37 °C. Eluted protein was concentrated by freeze-drying and then resuspended in water to a final concentration of 1–2% SDS (22Markovtsov V. Mustaev A. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3221-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Partial cyanogen bromide (CNBr) degradation of isolated β′-protein was performed as described previously (23Grachev M.A. Lukhtanov E.A. Mustaev A.A. Zaychikov E.F. Abdukayumov M.N. Rabinov I.V. Richter V.I. Skoblov Y.S. Chistyakov P.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cleavage products were fractionated by electrophoresis on a SDS-7–16% gradient polyacrylamide gels in a Tris-glycine buffer system. RNA polymerase (0.25 μm) was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 200 μm of either GDP or ppGpp in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA. After a 2-min warming at 37 °C, samples were mixed with increasing amounts of tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethylketone-treated trypsin (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, and 2.5 μm) in a 20-μl reaction volume and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 5 min. Trypsin digestions were stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration 10 mm, immediately followed by the addition of 5× SDS-sample buffer to a 1× concentration and incubation at 105 °C for 2 min. Total trypsin fragments were resolved in a SDS-12% polyacylamide gel and visualized by colloidal Coomassie G-250 staining (24Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). Specific trypsin fragments were identified by Western blot analyses using monoclonal antibodies against N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal epitopes of β′ (7RC78, 7RC74, and NT73, respectively) and β (7RB145, 7RB135, and NT63, respectively) (Ref. 25Thompson N.E. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7003-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and courtesy of Richard Burgess, University of Wisconsin-Madison). Reactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Science Products) Radioactive samples were visualized by autoradiography and, when necessary, imaged on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager and quantified using the Molecular Analyst f software (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.). Protein fragments were excised from Coomassie-stained gels and analyzed at Borealis Biosciences Inc., Toronto Canada by MALDI-TOF MS. The nucleotide derivative 6-thioguanosine-5′-triphosphate (6-thio-GTP) was synthesized from 6-mercaptoguanosine and used as a substrate in the enzymatic reaction depicted in Reaction 1, to yield 6-thioguanosine-3′,5′-(bis)pyrophosphate (6-thio-ppGpp; Fig.1). The reaction occurs in two steps, using crude RelA-ribosomes (see “Experimental Procedures”). 6­thio­GTP+ATP→6­thio­pppGpp+AMPEquation EStep_1 6­thio­pppGpp→6­thio­ppGpp+PiEquation EStep_2 REACTION1The reactivity of 6-thio-GTP was comparable with GTP in the RelA-mediated reaction (data not shown). The conversion of pppGpp to ppGpp is mediated by the enzyme guanosine pentaphosphatase, which is present in crude RelA-ribosome preparations (18Cashel M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 57: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Highly purified 6-thio-ppGpp was separated and obtained as described by Cashel (18Cashel M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 57: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The structure of purified 6-thio-ppGpp was verified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Both phosphorus (31P) and proton (1H) spectra of bona fide ppGpp and 6-thio-ppGpp were comparable and indicative of very similar structures (Fig. 1). Unlike the proton NMR spectra reported for 6-thio-GTP (14Sergiev P.V. Lavrik I.N. Wlasoff V.A. Dokudovskaya S.S. Dontsova O.A. Bogdanov A.A. Brimacombe R. RNA. 1997; 3: 464-475PubMed Google Scholar), 6-thio-ppGpp shows a strong chemical shift specific for a mercapto group proton (Fig. 1). Thus, in solution at pH 4.0, most of 6-thio-ppGpp bears a mercapto group at position 6 of the guanine moiety rather than a thio group as depicted in Fig. 1. The predominance of the mercapto over the thio form of 6-thio-ppGpp may simply be because of the acidic pH under which NMR was performed. This is unclear, however, because the absolute p Ka of the thio group of 6-thio-ppGpp is unknown, and sufficient material was not obtained to be able to determine this experimentally. Because the photoreactive conformation of the 6-thioguanosine moiety is the thio form, cross-linking to RNA polymerase is only possible if the bound form of 6-thio-ppGpp is in the thio form and not the mercapto form, as appears to be the case (Fig. 3). To test the activity of 6-thio-ppGpp compared with ppGpp, their ability to inhibit transcription of the tRNA promoter, P argT , was assayed. The activity of the argT promoter is negatively affected by increased ppGpp levels in vivo (26Rowley K.B. Elford R.M. Roberts I. Holmes W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate for the first time a specific inhibition of P argT in vitro by ppGpp under standard ionic and transcription conditions. At low ionic conditions, <50 mm KCl, the inhibitory effects of ppGpp were diminished (data not shown). A 4–6-fold inhibition of RNA synthesis from P argT was observed at the highest concentration of ppGpp tested (Fig.2). As an internal control, transcription from a P lacUV5 template was monitored in an equimolar mixed template reaction. The transcription from P lacUV5 was also inhibited between 20–35%, as previously noted (27Kajitani M. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1951-1957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but ppGpp preferentially inhibited transcription from P argT . The inhibition of transcription of P argT by 6-thio-ppGpp paralleled that of ppGpp. Increasing amounts of radioactive 6-thio-ppGpp were mixed with 1 μmRNA polymerase and subjected to photoactivating ultraviolet light irradiation. Electrophoretic analysis of radioactively labeled RNAP on denaturing polyacrylamide gels revealed the presence of cross-linker on all RNAP subunits. At limiting concentrations of cross-linker, however, labeling appeared predominant for β- and/or β′-subunits (Fig.3 A). Further cross-linking experiments were all performed at an equimolar concentration of RNAP and 6-thio-ppGpp (1 μm ea). In competition experiments, cross-linking of β′- and β-subunits was dramatically reduced in the presence of a 200-fold excess of cold genuine ppGpp but not GTP (Fig.3 B). Electrophoresis of photoaffinity-labeled RNAP on low percentage denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels to resolve β′- and β-subunits showed that the majority (∼90%) of label was associated with the β′ subunit (Fig. 3 C). Competition with cold ppGpp had little effect on residual β-subunit cross-linking, but it essentially eliminated cross-linking of the β′-subunits (Fig.3 D). No competition with 6-thio-ppGpp binding was observed in experiments with either GTP or GDP (Fig. 3 D). In addition, we observed no effect on cross-linking in the presence of nonspecific or promoter containing DNA, RNA, or rifampicin (data not shown). The labeled β′-subunit shown in Fig. 3 C was excised and extracted from the 4% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to partial CNBr digestion. Following digestion, the fragments were resolved on a gradient polyacylamide gel and visualized by phosphorimaging. The actual partial CNBr digest is shown in Fig.4 in comparison with idealized computer-generated profiles of a single-hit partial CNBr digest of β′. Idealized digestions were generated assuming either extreme C- or N-terminal labeling of β′, respectively. The profile of the experimental CNBr digestion fragments aligns well with the idealized CNBr N-terminally labeled fragment ladder, particularly the three very specific bands of 102, 130, and 152 amino acid residues (Fig. 4). The pattern and intensity of bands is comparable with what has been obtained previously for N-terminally labeled β′ (28Nudler E. Avetissova E. Markovtsov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1996; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with 6-thio-ppGpp cross-linking between amino acid residues 29 and 102 of the β′-subunit of RNAP, because no label was found in association with the extreme N-terminal 29 amino acid residue fragment. To begin to explore the allosteric consequences of ppGpp binding to RNAP, resistance to trypsin proteolysis was used to probe for ppGpp stabilized domains of RNAP. Limiting proteolysis has been used as a means of defining subtle alterations in the conformation of RNAP upon promoter binding (29McMahan S.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12424-12431Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as well as for the definition of major RNAP structural domains (30Borukhov S. Severinov K. Kashlev M. Lebedev A. Bass I. Rowland G.C. Lim P.P. Glass R.E. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23921-23926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we employed in this study an excess of trypsin to assay for protection of small highly structured domains of RNAP formed upon ppGpp binding. A range of trypsin concentration between 0 and 2.5 μm was used to digest a solution of 0.25 μm RNAP preincubated with 250 μm GDP or ppGpp. Trypsin fragments were resolved on denaturing polyacylamide gels. Following Coomassie staining, three prominent ppGpp-dependent trypsin-resistant fragments were revealed with an apparent molecular mass of ∼100, 40, and 28 kDa, respectively (Fig. 5 A, indicated by asterisks). The same fragments were also obtained in the presence of GDP; however, they had a much lower resistance to trypsin in comparison with ppGpp (Fig. 5 A). The binding of ppGpp does not, therefore, appear to induce formation of unique conformers of RNAP. Instead, it seems to stabilize the existing domain structure and/or sterically hinder trypsin accessibility. In control experiments, bovine serum albumin trypsin sensitivity was identical in the presence or absence of either GDP or ppGpp (data not shown). Attempts to cleave RNAP cross-linked with radioactive 6-thio-ppGpp did not give a clear or consistent pattern of digestion; we conjecture that this failure was the result of technical problems, e.g. an interference with trypsin activity by the presence of nonspecific UV-induced cross-links. Perhaps in future experiments, the exact identification of the conformational change of RNAP induced following 6-thio-ppGpp cross-linking may be achieved using methods other than trypsin digestion to probe for changes in protein conformation. The identity of the tryptic fragments stabilized in the presence of ppGpp was determined by Western blot analyses. The trypsinized samples shown in Fig. 5 A were processed for Western analyses and probed with a battery of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against various epitopes of the β- and β′-subunits (see “Experimental Procedures”). The β′-subunit-specific mAb, 7RC78, recognizes an epitope located between amino acid residues 115 and 236. Western blots of trypsin fragments with 7RC78 reveals that the 100- and 28-kDa ppGpp-protected fragments contain the N terminus of the β′-subunit (Fig. 5 B). The β-subunit-specific mAb, NT63, recognizes an epitope between amino acid residues 922 and 1099 and is the most C-terminal epitope recognized by available RNAP mAbs (Burgess and colleagues (15Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 16Lowe P.A. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R.

Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 31381-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar)). Western blot analysis with NT63 is consistent with the 40kDa fragment containing the C terminus of β (Fig. 5 C). Given the fact, however, that the epitope of NT63 is a considerable distance from the actual C terminus of the β-subunit, it was difficult to make a definitive C-terminal assignment to this fragment. For this reason, MALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed on the 40-kDa trypsin stable fragment. MALDI-TOF MS analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicated that the 40-kDa β fragment spans amino acid residues 958–1328 ± 10. Thus, the C-terminal assignment of the 40-kDa β-subunit band was confirmed. Assignment of the approximate end points of the 28-kDa fragment by MALDI-TOF MS was not successful because of contamination by identical size fragments of the α-subunit. Fortunately, the close proximity of the β′-specific mAb, 7RC78, allows confident N-terminal assignment to the trypsin stable 28-kDa fragment. The global stress regulator, ppGpp, a ligand and effector of RNAP, has been studied since its discovery by Cashel and Gallant (31Cashel M. Gallant J. Nature. 1969; 221: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) over 30 years ago, yet little is known about how it binds to and modifies RNAP. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel photocross-linkable derivative of ppGpp, 6-thioguanosine-3′,5′-(bis)pyrophosphate. This cross-linkable ppGpp derivative has allowed us to obtain the first indication that ppGpp binds near the N terminus of the large subunit of RNAP, β′. This compound has the distinct advantage over preceding cross-linkable ppGpp derivatives of carrying a zero-length cross-linking group. The chemical structure of 6-thio-ppGpp in solution, confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, reveals a predominance of the mercapto group (analogous to an enol group in ppGpp) rather than the thio group (analogous to a keto group in ppGpp) at the sixth position of the guanine moiety at pH 4.0 (Fig. 1). At this same pH level, a mercapto group was not noted or reported for the precursor, 6-thio-GTP (14Sergiev P.V. Lavrik I.N. Wlasoff V.A. Dokudovskaya S.S. Dontsova O.A. Bogdanov A.A. Brimacombe R. RNA. 1997; 3: 464-475PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of the 3′-pyrophosphate on ppGpp may change the local chemistry of the thio group on the guanine ring. No enol proton was detectable in bona fide ppGpp, indicating that this property is unique for the thiolated ppGpp. It is not clear which is the preferred form of 6-thio-ppGpp at pH 7.9, at which cross-linking and transcription analyses were performed. Equilibrium competition experiments and relative affinity measurements of 6-thio-ppGpp compared with ppGpp could not be performed because of the nonequilibrium conditions necessary for efficient 6-thio-ppGpp cross-linking (see “Experimental Procedures”). If 6-thio-ppGpp at pH 7.9 is predominantly in the mercapto conformation, however, it does not appear to affect dramatically its efficacy in inhibiting transcription (Fig. 2). Fundamental chemistry dictates that the thio and not the mercapto conformation of the 6-thioguanosine moiety is subject to photoactivation. With this in mind, the observed cross-linking of RNAP by 6-thio-ppGpp (Fig. 3) is consistent with a preferred binding to RNAP of the thio form of 6-thio-ppGpp. It is likely, therefore, that in natural ppGpp the keto group at position 6 of the guanine moiety is important for the binding of ppGpp to RNAP. Predominant cross-linking of radioactively labeled 6-thio-ppGpp occurs within the first 102 amino acid residues of the N terminus of the β′-subunit of RNAP (Figs. 3 and 4). This location overlaps with the conserved region A of β′ (β′A). In the recently solved crystal structure model of Thermus aquaticus RNAP, the extreme N terminus of the β′-subunit, including β′A, is disordered and lacks electron density (32Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The crystal data together with our finding that ppGpp binds to and induces trypsin resistance to the N-terminal portion of β′ (Fig. 5 B) leads us to propose that ppGpp binding induces a higher order structure of this region. The N terminus of β′ is implicated as playing a crucial role in many aspects of the transcription process. Region β′A contains a zinc finger, which is essential for stable DNA association of the elongating transcription complex (33Nudler E. Avetissova E. Markovtsov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1996; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and has been cross-linked to the double-stranded DNA at the lagging end of the transcription bubble (34Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Malhotra A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Darst S. Science. 2000; 289: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Additionally, within the transcription complex the extreme N terminus of the β′-subunit cross-links along the entire length of the “extruded” nascent RNA (34Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Malhotra A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Darst S. Science. 2000; 289: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 35Nudler E. Gusarov I. Avetissova E. Kozlov M. Goldfarb A. Science. 1998; 281: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This close proximity of the extruded RNA to the N terminus of β′ is “replaced” in a paused transcription complex by an alternate proximity of the RNA to the so-called “flap” structure of the β-subunit (36Wang D. Severinov K. Landick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8433-8438Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This repositioning or “switching” of the path of RNA within the complex is thought to be part of the mechanism of transcriptional pausing (36Wang D. Severinov K. Landick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8433-8438Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Finally, a primary determinant of ς70 binding is found between amino acid residues 260 and 309 of the β′-subunit (37Arthur T.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 31381-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These multifaceted functions associated with the N terminus of β′ will be considered below in light of the putative binding of ppGpp near this region and the known effects of ppGpp. The binding of ppGpp to RNAP has been proposed to destabilize specifically the open complex of rRNA promoters (27Kajitani M. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1951-1957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Gourse R.L. Gaal T. Aiyar S.E. Barker M.M. Estrem S.T. Hirvonen C.A. Ross W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, ppGpp binding and restructuring of the region of RNAP near the N terminus could disrupt the function of the β′A zinc finger and/or ς70 interaction and could lead to collapse of the open complex. Another well documented effect of ppGpp is that it decreases transcription elongation rates, primarily by increasing the pause times at naturally occurring pause sites (12Kingston R.E. Nierman W.C. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2787-2797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16236-16241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18335-18340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12265-12271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because the path of nascent RNA, extruded across the N terminus of β′ in elongating RNAP, is altered to putatively bring about transcriptional pausing (36Wang D. Severinov K. Landick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8433-8438Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), ppGpp binding might directly influence this process. Thus, the binding of ppGpp to this particular region of RNAP may be linked mechanistically to many of the observed effects of ppGpp-RNAP interactions. Previous data (see the Introduction) have indicated that ppGpp binding is localized to the β-subunit of RNAP. However, in this study we have determined that the N terminus of the β′-subunit is in close proximity to bound ppGpp. Although our results seemingly conflict with these previous observations, upon closer examination they actually corroborate earlier data concerning ppGpp-RNAP binding. We have synthesized and used for the first time a zero-length cross-linking ppGpp derivative, 6-thio-ppGpp. Preceding studies (10Chatterji D. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) used an azido group cross-linker, which replaces the proton at position 8 of the guanine moiety of ppGpp with an azido group (-N3). The thio group at position 6 of the guanine moiety of 6-thio-ppGpp is 8–10 Å distant from the azido group of 8-azido-ppGpp. Given the considerable separation of these two cross-linking groups, the thio group of 6-thio-ppGpp predictably would be in a different location and thus provide unique cross-links compared with 8-azido-ppGpp. Our trypsin resistance studies (Fig. 5) are congruent with the formation of a highly structured N-terminal portion of the β′-subunit and C-terminal portion of the β-subunit of RNAP as a consequence of ppGpp binding. These results are consistent with the fact that the N and C termini of β′ and β, respectively, are spatially close in the three-dimensional model of prokaryotic RNAP and constitute an intertwined interface of the two subunits (32Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). These observations lead us to propose that the binding of ppGpp is allosteric and that the site of binding is modular and located close to the intersubunit interface comprising the N- and C-terminal portions of the β′- and β-subunits, respectively. We thank and gratefully acknowledge Dr. Mike Cashel for providing high purity ppGpp for NMR and in vitrotranscription studies as well as for offering continuing encouragement. We thank Richard Burgess and Nancy Thompson for providing RNA polymerase monoclonal antibodies, Arkady Mustaev for advice on cross-linking, and Sudha Chakrapani for initiating the trypsin-sensitivity studies.

The atomic structure of a single SNARE complex that is required for synaptic vesicle fusion has been solved and was shown to consist of a highly twisted parallel bundle of four amphipathic helices, one from the vesicle protein VAMP, one from the plasma membrane protein syntaxin 1A and two from the plasma membrane protein SNAP-25 (3Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 4Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Although the contacting surfaces of the helices are mostly hydrophobic, a layer of residues in the center of the bundle, referred to as the “zero layer,” are comprised of glutamines for the plasma membrane SNAREs (Q-SNAREs) and arginine for the vesicle SNARE (an R-SNARE). Most SNARE proteins appear to possess either a glutamine or arginine at that deduced position, although the functional importance of these residues are not known (5Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of SNAREs in the specific docking and fusion of transport vesicles remains controversial, different types of experiments indicate that SNARE complexes are the core machinery for intracellular membrane fusion. For example, purified synaptic SNAREs catalyze the rapid and efficient fusion of synthetic vesicles (6Parlati F. Weber T. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 7Nickel W. Weber T. McNew J.A. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our understanding of SNARE function is limited by a lack of comparisons between SNARE complexes from different fusion events. Without structural knowledge of several SNARE complexes, we cannot understand the functional distinction between Q- and R-SNAREs, nor the general significance of the synaptic four-helix bundle. Although many SNAREs have been discovered and implicated in membrane fusion events, it is only the exocytic complex for which even a subunit structure is known. SNARE complexes outside the synapse have been studied primarily using immunoprecipitation experiments in cellular detergent extracts. Five SNAREs involved in yeast vacuolar fusion were shown to coprecipitate, implying the existence of a pentameric cis-SNARE complex (8Ungermann C. von Mollard G.F. Jensen O.N. Margolis N. Stevens T.H. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, because at least one of these proteins, Ykt6p, has been shown to operate in multiple transport steps (8Ungermann C. von Mollard G.F. Jensen O.N. Margolis N. Stevens T.H. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9McNew J.A. Sogaard M. Lampen N.M. Machida S. Ye R.R. Lacomis L. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17776-17783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), it is possible that the five associated SNAREs are present in two or more distinct complexes with overlapping members. Likewise, in ER/Golgi transport, yeast Sed5p (and mammalian syntaxin 5) coprecipitated with an array of other SNAREs (10Sogaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E.

Further immunoprecipitations in mammals demonstrated that syntaxin 5 and GOS-28 appeared to be in separate complexes from syntaxin 5 and sec22b, membrin, and rbet1 (12Hay J.C. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Steegmaier M. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1489-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The latter group probably functions in membrane fusion between ER-derived vesicles and vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) or between homotypically fusing ER-derived vesicles (13Rowe T. Dascher C. Bannykh S. Plutner H. Balch W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 5, rbet1, membrin, and sec22b have all been localized by immunoelectron microscopy to VTCs (12Hay J.C. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Steegmaier M. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1489-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and all four of their yeast counterparts exist on ER-derived vesicles generated in vitro (14Cao X. Barlowe C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Rexach M.F. Latterich M. Schekman R.W. J.

These four ER/Golgi SNAREs could either form two or more overlapping ternary complexes or a single quaternary complex containing all four members. Immunoprecipitation experiments could not distinguish between these possibilities, whereas functional results from yeast mutants suggested that members of this group of proteins functioned in at least two distinct fusion complexes (17Spang A. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The precise compositions of ER/Golgi SNARE complexes were not clearly demonstrated using purified yeast ER/Golgi SNAREs, because Sed5p appeared to engage in several potentiated ternary complexes including Sed5p·Sec22p·Bos1p and Sed5p·Bet1p·Bos1p (18Stone S. Sacher M. Mao Y. Carr C. Lyons P. Quinn A.M. Ferro-Novick S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Sacher M. Stone S. Ferro-Novick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17134-17138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Which one of these ternary complexes, if any, was a complete SNARE complex? The simple possibility that all four proteins form a single quaternary complex has not been experimentally addressed. We used purified mammalian ER/Golgi SNAREs to precisely define the higher-order SNARE complexes they can form in vitro. Here we document the subunit composition, assembly, and regulation of a quaternary SNARE complex that likely mediates the first fusion event in the secretory pathway. The complex demonstrates a remarkable similarity to the synaptic fusion complex, establishing a pattern to be repeated at other transport steps. Syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1, three Q-SNAREs, assemble to create a high affinity binding site for sec22b, an R-SNARE. This assembly pattern is consistent with sec22b opposing the other three proteins on opposite membranes, as VAMP opposes SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1 in the synapse. The resulting quaternary complex has a stoichiometry of 1:1:1:1 (Q:Q:Q:R, as in the synapse), perhaps arranged in a four-helix bundle as in the synapse, but where the Q-helices of membrin and rbet1 (one from each) play the role of the two SNAP-25 helices. In addition, we have explored the kinetic assembly mechanism of the ER/Golgi complex and its negative regulation by the syntaxin 5 amino-terminal domain. Monoclonal and affinity purified polyclonal anti-SNARE antibodies were described previously (11Hay J.C. Chao D.S. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12Hay J.C. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Steegmaier M. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1489-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Anti-VAMP2 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli using vector pGEX-KG (20Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar), whereas hexahistidine-tagged sec22b employed pQE-9 (Qiagen). See the Fig. 1 legend for the specific residues of each protein expressed. Bacteria were grown in Luria Broth at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.4–0.6, when they were either shifted to 15 °C (for GST-syntaxin 5 constructs) for 30 min prior to protein induction at 15 °C for 2–3 h, or induced immediately at 37 °C (all other constructs) for 2–3 h. GST fusion protein production was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; His6-sec22b with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After harvesting the cultures, bacteria were resuspended in French Press buffer (for all constructs except sec22b: 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; for sec22b, the same buffer lacking DTT) at 20 ml/liter of culture, French Pressed twice, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant (S1) was recovered. For His6-sec22b, GST-rbet1, and GST-syntaxin 5 (residues 251–333), the S1 was immediately centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 45 min, and the supernatant was collected. For GST-syntaxin 5 (residues 55–333), the S1 was adjusted to 0.35% sodium sarkosyl, mixed gently for 30 min, and then supplemented to 1% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol. After centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 45 min, the supernatant was collected. For GST-membrin, the S1 was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was homogenized in the original volume of French Press buffer. This was treated with sarkosyl, Triton X-100, and glycerol and centrifuged as above. The final 100,000 × g supernatant was retained. For GST fusion proteins, the supernatant from the final 100,000 ×g spin was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, and eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm glutathione containing 0.1% Triton X-100. For His6-sec22b, the final supernatant was loaded onto a column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen); washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20; washed again with the same buffer plus 0.025m imidazole; and eluted with a 0.025–0.25 mgradient of imidazole in the same buffer. From this point on, manipulations varied for each protein. Glutathione-purified GST-rbet1 was cleaved in solution with an optimal concentration (determined on each occasion) of human thrombin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature and then passed over a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, to remove GST. Rbet1 in the flow-through was then concentrated on a YM-3 membrane (Amicon) to ∼100 μg/ml, dialyzed for ≥4 h into Buffer A (20 mmHepes, pH 7.2, 0.15 m KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol) then supplemented with 1 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and stored at −80 °C. Glutathione-purified syntaxin 5 (residues 55–333) was cleaved in solution with an optimal concentration of human thrombin for 1 h at room temperature, then either dialyzed into Buffer A or in some cases further purified by velocity sedimentation on 5–30% glycerol gradients run in Buffer A plus 0.2% Triton X-100. The 5-ml gradients were overlaid with 0.5 ml sample and spun at 201,000 ×g (at rav) for 24 h in a Beckman MLS-50 rotor and the purest fractions were supplemented with protease inhibitors (see above) and stored at −80 °C. Glutathione-purified GST-membrin was first desalted into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1m KCl, 1 mm EGTA on Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), cleaved in solution with thrombin, passed back over glutathione-Sepharose to deplete GST and uncleaved fusion protein, and then purified on velocity gradients as described above. Ni2+-NTA-agarose-purified sec22b was separated from a major degradation product by two consecutive runs on a 100-ml Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) run in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm EGTA. The purified His6-sec22b was then dialyzed into Buffer A, supplemented with protease inhibitors as above, and stored at −80 °C. All binding incubations were conducted in Buffer A (see above) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. A typical bead-binding reaction consisted of 10 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose beads containing 124 pmol (620 nm) of immobilized protein and 80–620 pmol (400 nm to 3.1 μm) of soluble binding partners in a final volume of 200 μl. After 1 h at 4 °C with constant agitation, beads were washed three times with Buffer A plus 0.1% BSA prior to solubilization of the bound proteins in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. All Western blots that were quantitated utilized 125I-labeled secondary antibodies and standards quantified relative to BSA. For solution binding assays, which were incubated for varying time periods at 4 °C (see each figure legend), a 300-μl reaction typically contained ∼600 pmol (2 μm) of each protein, 250 μl of which was injected onto a 24-ml Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) run in Buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 30 μg/ml BSA. Individual column fractions were either analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting or were precipitated with acetone prior to gel and Western analysis. For the experiment in Fig. 8, A and B, typical ternary or quaternary binding incubations were carried out for 1 h, followed by gel filtration as usual. To the purified ternary complex (fraction 17) we added twice the normal concentration of sec22b and incubated for an additional hour. This fraction along with the corresponding purified quaternary complex fraction were then mock-immunodepleted using BSA-blocked 1:1 protein A: protein G beads, and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. Supernatant from the 100,000 ×g spin was immunoprecipitated using BSA-blocked protein A/G beads for a control or the same beads containing covalently cross-linked (using dimethylpimelimidate) monoclonal 4E11 anti-rbet1 antibodies. The beads were then washed three times with Buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and noncovalently bound proteins were solubilized for SDS-PAGE as described below in the immunoprecipitation section.Figure 4Formation of a highly cooperative ternary complex composed of rbet1, membrin, and syntaxin 5. Purified soluble SNARE proteins were mixed in solution for 1 h in the combinations indicated (right), and gel-filtered on Superdex 200. Individual column fractions were immunoblotted for rbet1 (top four panels), membrin (fifth and sixth panels) and syntaxin 5 (bottom two panels). The lower band in the seventh and eighth panels is a degradation product of syntaxin 5 (see Fig. 1). Elution positions of native thyroglobulin (669 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), BSA (67 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) are indicated with arrows above the fraction numbers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Syntaxin 5 and rbet1 potentiate each other in binding to bead-immobilized GST-membrin. Soluble syntaxin 5 (400 nm in A, 2 μm in B) and rbet1 (3.1 μm in A, 1.5 μm inB) were mixed with glutathione beads preloaded with either GST or GST-membrin (620 nm). After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, beads were washed three times and analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting for syntaxin 5 (A) or rbet1 (B). Ponceau staining of blots indicated that equal amounts of GST or GST-membrin were loaded for each condition (not shown). At the doses used in part A, a maximum of 6.6% of the added syntaxin 5 bound to the beads with a molar ratio of 0.044 (syntaxin 5/GST-membrin). In part B, 14.3% of added rbet1 bound with a molar ratio of 0.36 (rbet1/GST-membrin). All values represent the mean of two duplicates ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Purified recombinant ER/Golgi SNAREs.Proteins were expressed as GST fusions (membrin, rbet1, and syntaxin 5) or a hexahistidine-tagged construct (His6-sec22b) inE. coli and purified by glutathione- or nickel-affinity chromatography. Thrombin cleavage of fusion proteins and subsequent purification steps are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Approximately 200 ng of each protein was loaded in each gel lane. The His6-sec22b and rbet1 constructs encoded essentially the entire cytoplasmic domains of the proteins (2–196 and 1–95, respectively). Rbet1 appears as a doublet of bands that behave nearly identically in binding assays; the lower band is a carboxyl-terminal degradation/truncation product (amino acids 1 to ∼90). Syntaxin 5 encoded the entire cytoplasmic domain of the smaller 34-kDa syntaxin 5 isoform (residues 55–333 of the entire syntaxin 5 open reading frame, Ref. 24Hui N. Nakamura N. Sonnichsen B. Shima D.T. Nilsson T. Warren G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The upper syntaxin 5 band contains residues 55–333, the second band is an amino-terminal degradation product (amino acids 70–333), and the third band is a carboxyl-terminal degradation product (amino acids 55–251) produced during thrombin digestion (see the legend to Fig. 7 for details). The upper of the two syntaxin 5 degradation products was active in some binding reactions, the lower was not. The membrin construct encoded essentially the entire protein including the transmembrane domain (residues 2–212). These four purified protein constructs were used throughout our studies except where specifically stated otherwise.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8The isolated ternary complex does not bind sec22b. Purified soluble SNAREs were mixed and incubated in solution to form the ternary complex lacking sec22b (as in Fig. 4) or the complete quaternary complex (as in Fig. 6), and the respective complexes were purified by gel filtration. The isolated ternary complex was then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with purified sec22b at twice the concentration normally used for quaternary complex assembly. Both complexes were then immunoprecipitated with anti-rbet1 monoclonal antibodies (4E11) that do not affect the formation of SNARE complexes.A, compositions of the samples prior to immunoprecipitation, analyzed by immunoblotting. B, immunoprecipitated pellets analyzed by immunoblotting. Control represents the ternary mixture immunoprecipitated with beads lacking antibody 4E11. Immunoblotting of the supernatant remaining after immunoprecipitation revealed that all of the rbet1 had been depleted in both of the samples precipitated with immune beads (not shown). C, purified soluble SNAREs were mixed and incubated in solution to form the ternary complex lacking sec22b. After 2.5 h at 4 °C, sec22b was added to the ternary mixture (sequential assembly) and a new binding reaction was begun containing identical amounts of all four proteins (simultaneous assembly). After 1 h at 4 °C, both binding mixtures were gel filtered and individual column fractions were immunoblotted for sec22b. A, B, andC utilized only the membrane-proximal helix of syntaxin 5 (amino acids 251–333) rather than the full cytoplasmic domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) E. coli strain NM522 containing the protein construct was streaked on minimal M9 plates and grown 48 h at 37 °C. Fresh colonies were then used without storage to innoculate 100 ml of minimal medium (1× M9 salts, 0.2% dextrose, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2.0 mmMgCl2, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 10 μg/ml thiamine hydrochloride) and grown overnight to high density. One ml of this culture was then used to innoculate fresh 100-ml cultures in the above medium containing 0.5 mCi of [U-14C]glucose (ICN cat. no. 1104701, 316 mCi/mmol). Protein induction and purification were essentially as described above. Solution-binding reactions were similar to nonradioactive reactions (above). After gel filtration as usual, fractions 17 and 18 were pooled and either directly acetone precipitated or immunoprecipitated with monoclonal 4E11 anti-rbet1 antibody covalently cross-linked (using dimethylpimelimidate) to a 1:1 mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and electrophoresed using high Tris/urea gels (21Schlenstedt G. Gudmundsson G.H. Boman H.G. Zimmermann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13960-13968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described. Gels were Coomassie Blue-stained and dried, and bands were first quantitated with a laser densitometer and then exposed to Kodak Biomax-MS x-ray film with a Kodak Biomax Transcreen-LE intensifying screen. Radioactive bands were then excised, minced, and incubated overnight at 50 °C with 1 ml of TS-2 tissue solubilizer (Research Products International) and counted in 10 ml 3a20 toluene-based counting mixture (Research Products International). To calculate molar stoichiometries using Coomassie Blue staining, stain intensities were divided by the predicted protein molecular weight and expressed relative to syntaxin 5. To calculate stoichiometries using radioactivity, 14C counts in each band were divided by the predicted number of carbon atoms in each protein construct (calculated from the sequence), and the resulting quotient was expressed relative to that of syntaxin 5. NRK cells were transfected as before (22Hay J.C. Hirling H. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were depleted of intracellular ATP by rinsing them twice with glucose-free buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 70 mm sucrose, 130 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4), and they were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with the same buffer containing 0.2 mm iodoacetic acid (sodium salt) and 0.1 μmantimycin A. Cells were then solubilized in KCl buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The clarified supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation using 1:1 protein A: protein G beads loaded with anti-Myc (9E10 from our tissue culture medium) antibodies covalently cross-linked with dimethylpimelimidate. 0.4 ml of extract was incubated with 10 μl of 50% antibody beads for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with KCl buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and noncovalently bound proteins were solubilized by incubation for 5 min at room temperature with nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After pelleting the beads, the bead-free supernatant was adjusted to ∼5% β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The immunoprecipitations with wild-type NRK and PC12 cells shown in Fig. 10, B and C followed essentially the same protocol except that we used rabbit preimmune IgG or affinity-purified anti-syntaxin 5 antibody covalently cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose. We expressed in bacteria the following protein constructs: 1) GST fused to the full cytoplasmic domain of the shorter isoform of rat syntaxin 5 (amino acids 55–333 where amino acid 1 would be the N terminus of the longer syntaxin 5 isoform, Ref. 24Hui N. Nakamura N. Sonnichsen B. Shima D.T. Nilsson T. Warren G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), 2) GST fused to full-length rat membrin (amino acids 2–212), 3) hexahistidine-tagged mouse sec22b cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 2–196), and 4) GST fused to rat bet1 cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 1–95). Although we were unable to express the cytoplasmic domain of membrin in bacteria, we found that the full-length protein expressed well and was partially soluble. In addition, we found that partially soluble GST-membrin and GST-syntaxin 5 fusion proteins could be completely solubilized using the ionic detergent sarkosyl (25Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), which was then replaced with Triton X-100 during the purification on glutathione-Sepharose (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The resulting GST-syntaxin 5 and GST-membrin were fully soluble and functional in binding reactions. All expressed proteins were first purified by glutathione-Sepharose or nickel-affinity chromatography, the GST moiety was cleaved from GST fusion proteins, and the proteins were further purified as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1 shows a Coomassie Blue-stained gel of the purified proteins used for most of the studies. Although all of the four VTC-localized ER/Golgi SNAREs coprecipitated in detergent extracts (12Hay J.C. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Steegmaier M. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1489-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we wanted to characterize the sets of direct protein interactions responsible for their association. We therefore immobilized GST-rbet1, GST-membrin, and GST-syntaxin 5 onto glutathione beads and incubated them separately with soluble rbet1, membrin, syntaxin 5, or sec22b. After washing with"
https://openalex.org/W2088404957,"Arh1p is an essential mitochondrial protein of yeast with reductase activity. Here we show that this protein is involved in iron metabolism. A yeast strain was constructed in which the open reading frame was placed under the control of a galactose-regulated promoter. Protein expression was induced by galactose and repressed to undetectable levels in the absence of galactose, although cells grew quite well in the absence of inducer. Under noninducing conditions, cellular iron uptake was dysregulated, exhibiting a failure to repress in response to medium iron. Iron trafficking within the cell was also disturbed. Exposure of Arh1p-depleted cells to increasing iron concentrations during growth led to drastic increases in mitochondrial iron, indicating a loss of homeostatic control. Activity of aconitase, a prototype Fe-S protein, was deficient at all concentrations of mitochondrial iron, although the protein level was unaltered. Heme protein deficiencies were exacerbated in the iron-loaded mitochondria, suggesting a toxic side effect of accumulated iron. Finally, a time course correlated the cellular depletion of Arh1p with the coordinated appearance of various mutant phenotypes including dysregulated cellular iron uptake, deficiency of Fe-S protein activities in mitochondria and cytoplasm, and deficiency of hemoproteins. Thus, Arh1p is required for control of cellular and mitochondrial iron levels and for the activities of Fe-S cluster proteins.

Thus, Arh1p is required for control of cellular and mitochondrial iron levels and for the activities of Fe-S cluster proteins. iron-sulfur cluster hemagglutinin antigen epitope polymerase chain reaction Iron is required as a cofactor for critical proteins that mediate diverse processes such as cellular respiration and synthesis of metabolic intermediates (1Brittenham G. Hoffman R. Benz E. Shattil S. Furie B. Cohen H. Silberstein L. McGlave P. Hematology, Basic Principles and Practice. Churchill Livingstone, New York2000: 397-428Google Scholar). However, iron is also extremely toxic, capable of generating free radicals that damage proteins, lipids, and DNA (2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals In Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, Oxford, UK1991Google Scholar). Thus, eukaryotic cells such as yeast regulate iron uptake into cells in homeostatic fashion, inducing uptake in response to iron starvation, and repressing uptake in response to iron overload (3Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Several mutant strains of yeast have been identified that exhibit dysregulation of cellular iron uptake. In these mutants, iron uptake into cells continues without homeostatic repression, and the assimilated iron is sequestered in mitochondria. Furthermore, in these mutants, Fe-S1 cluster proteins are defective, suggesting a link between iron trafficking and the status of Fe-S clusters in the cell (4Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R.

Fe-S clusters are modular units in which iron and sulfur are coordinated in various combinations and linked to the peptide backbone of proteins via cysteine sulfurs (11Beinert H.B. Holm R.H. Munck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Because of their ability to donate or accept electrons with tremendously varied range of potentials, these clusters are involved in many fundamental biological processes from cellular respiration to metabolic conversions (12Beinert H. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 2-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Although the clusters can form spontaneously under laboratory conditions, recent genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that their in vivo formation is catalyzed by specific proteins (13Zheng L. Dean D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In bacteria, several of these proteins are associated together on the isc operon, and their precise biological roles in Fe-S cluster synthesis are being determined in ongoing biochemical work (14Zheng L. Cash V. Flint D. Dean D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 15Yuvaniyama P. Agar J. Cash V. Johnson M. Dean D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A cysteine desulfurase (IscS) mediates release of sulfur from cysteine for formation of Fe-S clusters (17Zheng L. White R. Cash V. Jack R. Dean D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Fe-S cluster intermediates assembled onto a protein template (IscU) may be transferred to an apoprotein recipient (15Yuvaniyama P. Agar J. Cash V. Johnson M. Dean D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A protein with conserved cysteines (IscA) may bind and donate iron. A chaperone belonging to the Hsp70 family (HscA) and a co-chaperone (HscB) likely play roles in folding or unfolding synthetic intermediates, such as the intermediates assembled on the IscU template (14Zheng L. Cash V. Flint D. Dean D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 16Hoff K. Silberg J. Vickery L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Finally, a ferredoxin which itself contains a 2Fe-2S cluster (Fd x) is encoded by the isc operon and facilitates iron-sulfur protein synthesis when overexpressed, but its precise function has not been ascertained (18Nakamura M. Saeki K. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, homologs of the bacterial proteins of the isc operon are nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins. Mutations leading to decreased expression of the Hsp70 chaperone Ssq1p (homologous to HscA) (5Knight S. Sepuri N. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18389-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and Nfs1p (homologous to IscS) (8Li J. Kogan M. Knight S. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33025-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), have been shown to result in dysregulated cellular iron uptake, mitochondrial iron accumulation, and deficient Fe-S cluster proteins. The synthetic phenotype resulting from loss-of-function of Isu1p (homologous to IscU) and Nfu1p (homologous the C terminus of the bacterial NifU), has been characterized by iron accumulation in mitochondria and deficient Fe-S proteins (10Schilke B. Voisine C. Beinert H. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10206-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In addition, mutants in Nfs1p, Isu1p, Jac1p, and Ssq1p have been selected for their ability to escape the oxygen-dependent lysine auxotrophy that occurs as a consequence of Sod1p deficiency (6Strain J. Lorenz C. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G. Ta D. Vickery L. Culotta V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These mutants manifest Fe-S protein deficiencies and iron trafficking abnormalities. Finally, experiments depleting ferredoxin, Yah1p (homologous to Fdx), by turning off a regulated promoter, have uncovered a role for this protein in synthesis or maintenance of Fe-S clusters and in control of mitochondrial iron levels (9Lange H. Kaut A. Kispal G. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Other yeast genes without homologs on the isc operon that produce similar phenotypes when mutated or depleted are YFH1, the yeast frataxin homolog (4Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), and ATM1, an ABC transporter of the mitochondrial inner membrane (19Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 4: 188-195Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). YFH1 deletion results in mitochondrial iron accumulation (4Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L.

Foury F. Koenig M. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Atm1p depletion results in iron trafficking abnormalities, deficient cytoplasmic Fe-S proteins but normal mitochondrial Fe-S proteins (7Kispal, G., Csere, P., Prohl, C., and Lill, R. (1999) EMBO J. 3981–3989Google Scholar). Arh1p is an essential yeast protein with reductase activity localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane (21Manzella L. Barros M. Nobrega F. Yeast. 1998; 14: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Lacour T. Achstetter T. Dumas B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 37: 23984-23992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Arh1p lacks a bacterial homolog on the isc operon. In this work, we demonstrate a role for Arh1p in cellular and mitochondrial iron homeostasis. Rich medium consisted of 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and various carbon sources. To induce the GAL1promoter, 2% raffinose and 0.5% galactose served as the carbon source. Expression from the GAL1 promoter was turned off by shifting the cultures to identical medium without galactose. In some experiments, 2% glucose or 3% ethanol was used as carbon source. For experiments with different concentrations of iron, standard defined medium with 2% raffinose or 2% glucose was modified by addition of ferric ammonium sulfate. The open reading frame of Arh1p was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase and genomic DNA as a template. The primers added XbaI and NdeI sites on the 5′ end and BglII and XhoI sites on the 3′ end. The PCR product was cloned into the XbaI and XhoI sites of pBluescript II, and the resulting plasmid pBS-Arh1 was linearized by BglII and desphosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The BamHI-BglII fragment containing three tandemized copies of the hemagglutinin epitope (HA3) (23Wilson I. Niman H. Houghten R. Cherenson A. Connolly M. Lerner R. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the dephosphorylated BglII site, creating plasmid pBS-Arh1HA3. The correct orientation of the tag was confirmed by sequencing. The XbaI-XhoI fragment containing the open reading frame and tag (Arh1p-HA3) was subcloned into the corresponding sites of the integrating expression vector pEMBlyex4i to create pGal-Arh1HA3. In this vector, there is a GAL1 promoter, CYC1transcription start site and terminator, and URA3 marker for selection of yeast transformants. A unique StuI site in the URA3 gene of the plasmid is present for directing integration into the ura3–52 locus. For knockout of ARH1, an interruption/deletion cassette was constructed. A 1.2-kilobase DNA fragment containing the HIS3 gene with BamHI ends was amplified by PCR using pRS413 as template, digested with BamHI to generate cohesive ends, and ligated into the BamHI and BclI sites of the ARH1 open reading frame of pBS-Arh1. The interruption/deletion cassette was released by digestion with XbaI and XhoI. The parental diploid strain YPH501 (24Sikorski R. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with the XbaI-XhoI fragment of the ARH1 knockout cassette and transformants were selected for histidine prototrophy. Correct integration was confirmed by genomic PCR. Plasmid pGal-Arh1HA3 was linearized at the unique StuI site and integrated into the ura3–52 site of the heterozygous ARH1/Δarh1 knockout strain. The transformants were sporulated and tetrads were germinated on plates containing galactose as a carbon source. A tetrad clone that was His+ (marker for Δarh1) and Ura+(marker for pGal-Arh1HA3) was identified and referred to as the Gal-Arh1 strain. For expression in bacteria, the ACO1 and YAH1 open reading frames were amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and inserted into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET21b (Novagen). The overexpressed proteins with C-terminal His6 tags were found to be sequestered in inclusion bodies. These proteins were solubilized in 8 m urea, purified on Ni-NTA columns (Qiagen), and eluted with 0.4 m imidazole. The eluates were further purified by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and used to immunize rabbits for generation of polyclonal antibodies. Antibodies to Cyc1p were generated by immunizing rabbits with yeast holocytochrome c purchased from Sigma. Anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and anti-Cox3p (Molecular Probes) are commercially available mouse monoclonal antibodies. Mitochondria were isolated as described (25Murakami H. Pain D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2051-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Intact mitochondria (equivalent to 200 μg of protein) were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6m sorbitol. For releasing the intermembrane space contents, mitochondria were subjected to hypotonic shock by diluting to 0.1m sorbitol and incubating at 0 °C for 10 min. The mitoplasts were recovered by centrifuging at 12,000 ×g and then solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100. The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g and supernatant and pellet fractions were separated (26Martin H. Eckerskorn C. Gartner F. Rassow J. Lottspeich F. Pfanner N. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For quantitation of the55Fe label, fractions were exposed to 2% SDS in 200 μl for 15 min at room temperature and suspended in 1 ml of scintillation mixture for counting in a Beckman scintillation counter. High-affinity cellular iron uptake was measured as described (27Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Elde D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Aconitase was assayed by measuring the formation of cis-aconitate at 240 nm. The reaction mixture of 1 ml contained of 20 mm iso-citrate, 90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 μl (100 μg) of purified mitochondria solubilized in 1.5% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside containing 1 mm sodium citrate. The ΔA240 was measured for 2 min at room temperature, and the activity was expressed as nanomoles of cis-aconitate formed per mg of mitochondria protein per min (28Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Succinate dehydrogenase was assayed on mitochondrial lysate in 0.5% Triton X-100 by following the reduction of p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet to the p-iodonitrotetrazolium-formazan as described (29Munujos P. Coll-Canti J. Gonzalez-Sastre F. Gella F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 506-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Leu1p (3-isopropylmalate dehydratase) activity was measured in concentrated cytoplasmic lysates (∼10 mg/ml). The assay mixture of 500 μl consisted of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm citraconate, and 20 μl (200 μg) of cell extract. The mixture was transferred to a 2 mm quartz cuvette and the decrease in ΔA235 was recorded over 3 min at room temperature. Activity was expressed as ΔA235/min/mg of protein (30Kohlhaw G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For detection of heme, mitochondrial proteins (100 μg) separated by polyacrylamide gel and blotted to nitrocellulose were incubated with peroxide developer and chemiluminescent substrates (Blaze, Pierce) for 5 min prior to exposing the blot to film (31Vargas C. McEwan A. Downie J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To characterize the function of Arh1p, we replaced a portion of the open reading frame with a HIS3 marker gene in the diploid strain YPH501. Sporulation of this diploid strain resulted in 2+:2− segregation for viable colonies with all the viables showing auxotrophy for histidine (not shown). This result is consistent with the previously reported essential nature of the ARH1 gene (21Manzella L. Barros M. Nobrega F. Yeast. 1998; 14: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,22Lacour T. Achstetter T. Dumas B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 37: 23984-23992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To further study cellular effects of Arh1p, we generated a strain in which the only functional ARH1 gene was replaced with a gene fusion. In this construct, the open reading frame was fused at the C terminus to 3 copies of the HA epitope and placed under control of the GAL1 galactose-inducible promoter. Growth of the strain in galactose medium, inducing for the promoter, resulted in high level expression of the protein as monitored by monoclonal anti-HA antibodies. In the absence of inducer, as expected, Arh1p was undetectable (Fig. 1, panel A). The growth properties of this strain were then evaluated. The growth of the Gal-Arh1 strain on galactose containing media was indistinguishable from the wild-type parent YPH499 (Fig. 1 , panel B, top). However, suprisingly, when incubated in the absence of inducer and in the presence of glucose, which acts as a strong repressor for the GAL1 promoter, growth and colony formation were minimally affected. Colonies were only slightly smaller than wild-type controls after 2 days (Fig. 1, panel B, middle) but then caught up after another day incubation (not shown). The implication of this observation is that a small amount of “leaky” Arh1p protein expression, undetectable by immunoblotting, was sufficient to support growth. Cells with repressed Arh1p expression were not normal, however. Plating efficiency of the Gal-Arh1 cells on ethanol agar plates was decreased by more than 2 logarithms, and colony size was markedly diminished compared with the wild-type control cells (Fig. 1,panel B, bottom). The ethanol carbon source is noninducing for the GAL1 promoter and furthermore, is nonfermentable. Failure to utilize nonfermentable carbon sources may reflect mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from Arh1p depletion. Such a phenotype would be consistent with a nonredundant mitochondrial function for this protein. We next examined cellular iron uptake in the Gal-Arh1 strain and found that it was dysregulated. In the wild-type YPH499 strain grown in the presence of iron chelator (bathophenanthrolene disulfonate) the rate of high-affinity iron uptake was induced, whereas the same strain exposed to iron during growth showed repressed iron uptake. Mutations of several mitochondrial genes implicated in mitochondrial iron homeostasis exhibit altered responses of cellular iron uptake to iron exposures. In the MA14 mutant, carrying a mutation in the NFS1 gene, cellular iron uptake was induced and incompletely repressed by iron exposures in the medium (Fig.2). Similarly, the Gal-Arh1 mutant grown in the absence of inducer showed a lack of response of cellular uptake to medium iron. At most media iron concentrations, cellular iron uptake was nonrepressed in the Gal-Arh1 strain compared with wild-type levels. At 10 μm medium iron concentration, uptake was completely repressed to the wild-type level (Fig. 2). Arh1p is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane (22Lacour T. Achstetter T. Dumas B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 37: 23984-23992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and might affect mitochondrial iron usage and distribution. To directly test this possibility, we exposed the wild-type YPH499 strain or the Gal-Arh1 strain to various iron concentrations in defined growth medium lacking the galactose inducer. Radioactive 55Fe was added as a tracer. After 16 h of growth during which the labeling of intracellular iron pools reached a steady state, mitochondria were isolated and the iron content and distribution were ascertained by analysis of the radionuclide. The Gal-Arh1 mutant showed a striking inability to control mitochondrial iron levels (Fig. 3). At the lowest medium iron concentration (0.1 μm, Fig. 3, panel A), wild-type and Gal-Arh1 mitochondrial iron levels were comparable and less than 1 pmol/μg of protein. A 10-fold increase in medium iron exposure had minimal effect on the mitochondrial iron of the wild-type but resulted in more than a 20-fold increase in mitochondrial iron of the mutant (1.0 μm, Fig. 3,panel B). An additional 5-fold increase in medium iron exposure had small effects on the wild-type but resulted in another more than a 5-fold increase in mitochondrial iron in the mutant (5.0 μm, Fig. 3, panel C). The exposure to still higher levels of medium iron did not result in further increase in mitochondrial iron in the Gal-Arh1 mutant (50 μm, Fig. 3,panel D). Within mitochondria, the characteristics of iron were also strikingly altered in the Gal-Arh1 strain. At the lowest iron concentration, total mitochondrial iron was comparable in the wild-type and Gal-Arh1 strain, as was iron in the intermembrane space and mitoplast fractions. However, when mitoplasts were sonicated disrupting the inner membrane, a significant portion of the iron label was pelleted by low speed centrifugation (not shown). We considered that this iron pool might represent adherence of iron to membrane lipids or accumulation of aggregated iron proteins. Triton X-100 almost quantitatively solubilizes most mitochondrial proteins, and therefore we evaluated the distribution of iron after Triton X-100 solubilization of mitoplasts. In the Gal-Arh1 mutant a significant fraction of mitoplast iron was pelleted even after Triton X-100 treatment (40% versus 13% in the wild-type) consistent with the possibility that the iron label may be present in aggregated proteins (Fig. 3, panel A,TX-100 pellet). Increases in total mitochondrial iron in the Gal-Arh1 strain were associated with marked increases in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (38-, 80-, and 10-fold increased compared with wild-type in Fig. 3, panels B-D). Although not to the same degree, iron was also increased in the intermembrane space and in the Triton X-100 soluble fraction of the mitoplasts under these iron loading conditions. In summary, the Gal-Arh1 strain with repressed Arh1p expression showed a loss of mitochondrial iron homeostasis. A distinct Triton X-100-resistant form of iron appeared in the absence of an increase in the total mitochondrial iron level; in addition, after iron exposure during growth, mitochondrial iron accumulated to a remarkable degree. In view of the marked alterations of iron distribution to mitochondria, iron proteins of the mitochondria were evaluated. Aconitase (Aco1p), a soluble enzyme of the mitochondrial matrix depends on an intact iron-sulfur cluster for its enzymatic activity. Aconitase activity was equivalent to the wild-type level in the Gal-Arh1 strain under inducing conditions for Arh1p expression (not shown), but activity was markedly decreased in the same strain grown in the absence of inducer (Fig.4). The deficiency was not due to altered protein expression or turnover, because Aco1p could still be detected in normal abundance (Fig. 4). The discrepancy between normal protein levels and decreased activity indicates that enzymatically inactive protein was present. The residual aconitase activity in the Gal-Arh1 strain varied between 16 and 34% of wild-type levels despite more than 100-fold changes in the mitochondrial iron contents (ranging from 0.4 to 54 pmol/μg of protein). The deficiency was not improved by iron starvation as might be expected if it were a toxic effect of iron overload. Conversely, the Aco1p activity was not recovered in the iron loaded mitochondria. Mitochondrial heme proteins were examined. By immunoblot analysis, cytochrome oxidase subunit 3 (Cox3p) was found to be virtually absent from the Gal-Arh1 mitochondria with elevated iron content (isolated from 1.0, 5.0, and 50 μm iron containing media). By contrast, the protein was present and undiminished in Gal-Arh1 mitochondria with normal iron content (isolated from 0.1 μm iron containing medium) (Fig.5). Cox3p is mitochondria encoded, and therefore, mtDNA damage might account for the observed effects on Cox3p. However, staining with the fluorescent dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride showed that mtDNA was present in Gal-Arh1 mitochondria grown in the absence of inducer (not shown). In addition, a similar trend was observed for cytochrome c protein, which is nuclear encoded. This protein was markedly decreased in the Gal-Arh1 mitochondria, with the exception of the low iron point. Covalently bound c-type heme groups of Cyc1p (cytochrome c) and Cyt1p (cytochrome bc1) can be visualized by their intrinsic peroxidase activities (Fig. 5), and these were found to be markedly decreased in the Gal-Arh1 mutant. In mitochondria isolated from low iron growth conditions, the signals from heme in Cyc1p and Cyt1p were increased compared with iron-loaded mitochondria; however, complete normalization was not achieved. Thus, the mutant phenotype characterizing cells depleted of Arh1p included deficiency of heme proteins. The hemoprotein deficiency was mitigated in the Gal-Arh1 mutant mitochondria isolated from low iron medium. In accord with this last observation, these mitochondria were pink in color as distinguished from the paler color of their counterparts isolated from iron replete media. We examined the appearance of iron regulatory phenotypes after shifting the Gal-Arh1 strain from galactose (inducing) conditions to raffinose (noninducing) conditions, in rich media containing ∼1 μm iron. At the time of the switch, expression of HA-tagged Arh1p could be easily detected with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Fig. 6,panel A). A more rapidly migrating band reactive with anti-HA antibody on immunoblots was frequently observed (* in Fig. 6,panel A). However, the amount of this species varied from experiment to experiment and most likely represents proteolytic clipping at the N terminus of Arh1p. A similar pattern of proteolysis has been described for the Drosophila homolog of Arh1p (32Freeman M. Dobritsa A. Gaines P. Segraves W. Carlson J. Development. 1999; 126: 4591-4602PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, after growing under noninducing conditions for 12 h, the protein declined to undetectable levels and remained undetectable for the 24-, 36-, 48-, and 60-h time points. During this 60-h time period, cell growth was normal in the absence of detectable Arh1p. At the end of 60 h, galactose was added back to the medium, and the Arh1p protein expression was turned back on for 10 h (Fig. 6,panel A, +10). Control proteins Put2p, a matrix protein involved in proline utilization, and Por1p, a structural outer membrane protein, were present in equivalent amounts in mitochondria isolated from all time points (Fig. 6, panel A). Cellular iron uptake was examined during the course of Arh1p depletion and repletion. When assessed at the time of the shift to noninducing conditions and 12 h later, cellular iron uptake was indistinguishable from wild-type (not shown), although Arh1p protein was already undetectable at the 12-h time point. Cellular uptake then increased 10-fold at the 24-h time point (Fig. 6 B). The iron uptake level remained elevated throughout the rest of the experiment, failing to rec"

Erythrocyte osmotic water permeability is inhibited by ∼90% by mercurial sulfhydryl compounds and has biophysical properties of a pore pathway including a low Arrhenius activation energy and a high ratio of osmotic to diffusional water permeability (1Macey R.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C195-C203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The water-selective transporter AQP11 is the major erythrocyte water transporter as proven by the reduced water permeability in erythrocytes from Colton −/− humans lacking AQP1 (2Macey R.I. Mori S. Smith B.L. Preston G.M. Mohandas N. Collins M. van Zili P.C.M. Zeidel M.L. Agre P. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Recently, immunocytochemical evidence has suggested that the “aquaglyceroporin” AQP3 provides the major non-AQP1 pathway for water transport across the erythrocyte plasma membrane as well as the transport pathway for glycerol (4Roudier N. Verbavatz J.-M. Maurel C. Ripoche P. Tacnet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8407-8412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Erythrocyte glycerol permeability is substantially greater than that across lipid bilayers and is inhibited by phloretin (5Macey R.I. Farmer R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar); however, the molecular identity of the putative glycerol transporter has not been established. The principal goal of this study was to determine the functional role of AQP3 in erythrocyte water and glycerol permeability. Transport measurements were done on erythrocytes lacking AQP1 and AQP3 individually and AQP1/AQP3 together. We reasoned that the very low water permeability of AQP1-deficient erythrocytes would permit the detection of even small amounts of functional AQP3 as a further decrease in permeability in AQP1/AQP3-deficient erythrocytes. A secondary goal of this study was to investigate the roles of AQP1 and AQP3 in the urinary-concentrating mechanism. AQP1 and AQP3 are expressed in the kidney: AQP1 in proximal tubule, thin descending limb of Henle, and medullary vasa recta (6Sabolic I. Valenti G. Verbavatz J.M. Van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S.

Mice lacking AQP1 are polyuric and have urine osmolalities of 500–700 mosm that do not increase after water deprivation or DDAVP administration (3Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J.

Invest. 2000; 105: 2686-2692Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Mice lacking AQP3 also manifest nephrogenic diabetes insipidus but with a very different pattern (13Ma T. Song Y. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). AQP3 null mice are remarkably polyuric with base-line urine osmolalities of <280 mosm but are able to concentrate their urine to 1000–1400 mosm after water deprivation or DDAVP administration. In this study, mice lacking AQP1 and AQP3 were generated and characterized. A comparison of water and glycerol permeabilities of erythrocytes from the single and double knockout mice permitted a direct assay of the functional role of AQP3. A comparison of urinary-concentrating ability in the single and double knockout mice tested whether the different patterns of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus result from distinct defects in countercurrent exchange and collecting duct function. Because the AQP1 and AQP3 genes are localized on different chromosomes in the mouse genome, AQP1/AQP3 double knockout mice were generated by intercross of the single knockouts. The breeding of F2 generation double heterozygous mice yielded 53 AQP1/AQP3 knockout mice out of 756 pups. Red blood cells and bone marrow aspirates were smeared onto glass slides. Samples were fixed in acetone/methanol (1:1) and incubated for 30 min with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with AQP1 or AQP3 antiserum (1:1000) for 1 h at 23 °C in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Slides were rinsed with 2.7% NaCl and then with PBS, and they were incubated with a secondary Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit F(ab)2 fragment (1:200) for visualization by fluorescence microscopy. Mice weighing 30–32 g were kept in the mouse metabolic cages (Harvard Apparatus) for 24 h for measurements of daily fluid consumption and urine output. For analysis of urine osmolalities, urine samples were collected by placing mice on a wire mesh platform in a clean glass beaker until spontaneous voiding was observed. Urine osmolalities were measured by freezing point depression osmometry (Micro-osmometer, Precision Systems, Inc.). Fresh erythrocytes obtained by tail bleeding (100–200 μl/bleed) were washed three times in PBS to remove serum and the cellular buffy coat. Stopped-flow measurements were carried out on a Hi-Tech Sf-51 instrument (Wiltshire, United Kingdom). For measurement of osmotic water permeability, suspensions of erythrocytes (∼0.5% hematocrit) in PBS were subjected to a 100 mm inwardly directed gradient of sucrose. The kinetics of decreasing cell volume was measured from the time course of 90o scattered light intensity at 530 nm wavelength. Osmotic water permeability coefficients (Pf) were computed from the light-scattering time course as described previously (14van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18267-18269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For measurement of glycerol permeability, the erythrocyte suspension was subjected to a 100 mm inwardly directed gradient of glycerol. In some experiments, 0.3 mm HgCl2 or 0.5 mmphloretin was added to the erythrocyte suspension before stopped-flow experiments. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal pentobarbital (30 mg/g body weight). Kidneys were fixed in situ by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed tissues were processed by routine histological methods, and 6-μm paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin. AQP1/AQP3 double knockout mice were generated by intercross of AQP1 and AQP3 null mice. The mice were grossly phenotypically normal when given free access to food and water except for obvious polyuria. Over the first 10 weeks of life, the double knockout mice were 20–25% smaller by body weight than wild-type littermates. At 6 weeks, the mean body weights were 27.8 ± 2.4 g (wild-type) and 21.7 ± 3.2 g (AQP1/AQP3 knockout). The AQP1 null mice were 15–20% smaller than wild-type mice, whereas the AQP3 null mice were not impaired in their growth. The survival of AQP1/AQP3 double knockout mice was also impaired compared with the single knockout mice. Although >90% of living AQP1 and AQP3 null mice that were genotyped at 5 days remained alive at 8 weeks, only 50% of the double knockout mice were alive at 8 weeks. Osmotic water permeability was measured in erythrocytes from wild-type mice and mice lacking AQP1 and AQP3 individually and AQP1/AQP3 together. Fig. 1 A shows the time course of osmotic cell shrinking in response to a 100 mm inwardly directed osmotic gradient of sucrose. The data are plotted using three contiguous time scales to show the full time course of decreasing cell volume. Erythrocyte water permeability was remarkably reduced by AQP1 deletion but not further reduced by AQP3 deletion. Fig. 1 B shows the inhibition of water transport by the mercurial HgCl2. Water transport was strongly inhibited in erythrocytes from wild-type and AQP3 null mice and was inhibited to a lesser extent in erythrocytes from AQP1 null mice and AQP1/AQP3 double knockout mice. Fig. 2 summarizes osmotic water permeability coefficients (Pf) determined in four mice of each genotype. AQP3 deletion did not reduce Pf in wild-type or AQP1 null mice nor did it affect the inhibitory potency of HgCl2. Temperature dependence measurements were performed to determine the Arrhenius activation energy for erythrocyte water transport. Computed activation energies (10–37 °C) were <4 kcal/mol for wild-type and AQP3 null mice and >8 kcal/mol for AQP1 null mice and the double knockout mice. Erythrocyte glycerol permeability was measured from the time course of cell swelling in response to a 100 mm inwardly directed gradient of glycerol. As shown in Fig.3 A, the glycerol gradient produced an initial rapid decrease in cell volume due to osmotically induced water efflux followed by slower cell swelling that was due to glycerol and secondary water influx. At 20 °C, glycerol equilibrated across erythrocytes from wild-type mice with a half-time of ∼20 s, giving a permeability coefficient (PGly) of 2.63 × 10−6 cm/s (top curve). Glycerol permeability was inhibited by 64% by 0.5 mmphloretin (second curve) and was strongly temperature-sensitive (bottom curves), increasing 2.8-fold from 10 to 30 °C that was consistent with a facilitated transport pathway. Fig. 3 B shows glycerol permeability in erythrocytes from AQP3 null mice in the absence and presence of phloretin. Results were similar to those in erythrocytes from wild-type mice. Data from a series of mice showed that AQP3 deletion did not reduce erythrocyte glycerol permeability or its inhibition by phloretin (Fig.3 C). Together the permeability measurements indicate that AQP3 does not contribute measurably to erythrocyte water or glycerol permeability. Immunocytochemistry was done to look for AQP3 protein in erythrocytes. Fig. 4 A shows little AQP3 antibody labeling of permeabilized erythrocyte smears from humans (left) and wild-type mice (middle). Similar low levels of labeling were detected in erythrocytes from AQP3 null mice (right). In contrast, AQP3 was readily detected in the kidney-collecting duct in wild-type mice (Fig. 4 B,left) but not in AQP3 null mice (right). Urinary-concentrating function was compared in the wild-type, single knockout, and double knockout mice. Fig.5 A shows daily fluid consumption and urinary output in the mice. Polydipsia and polyuria were greater in AQP3 than in AQP1 null mice and further increased in the AQP1/AQP3 double knockout mice. The difference in fluid intake and urinary output, primarily representing insensible respiratory losses, was similar in all groups. Fig. 5 B summarizes urine osmolalities in mice given free access to food and water and in mice deprived of food and water for 24 h. Base-line urine osmolality was high (>1500 mosm) in wild-type mice and nearly doubled after water deprivation. Base-line urine osmolality was much lower in the AQP1 null mice and changed little after water deprivation. Urine osmolality was lower in AQP3 null mice but increased 2.4-fold after water deprivation. Interestingly, the deletion of AQP1 and AQP3 together resulted in an even lower base-line urine osmolality, which unlike that in AQP1 null mice increased 2.9-fold after water deprivation (see “Discussion”). Most adult AQP1/AQP3 double knockout mice showed marked tumor-like swelling of the flanks bilaterally (Fig.6 A, left), which was never seen in wild-type mice. The flank swelling was caused by kidney enlargement (Fig. 6 A, middle and right). Examination of the morphology in kidneys from wild-type mice showed well demarcated cortex and papilla (Fig.6 B, top panels). In contrast, kidneys from AQP3 null mice (Fig. 6 B, bottom panels) and AQP1/AQP3 double knockout mice (not shown) showed medullary atrophy and cortical thinning. At 4 weeks of age, >50% of kidneys from AQP3 null mice and >90% of kidneys from AQP1/AQP3 double knockout mice showed these changes. Many adult mice showed hydronephrosis. The kidneys with severe hydronephrosis were markedly enlarged and transparent enough to reveal dilated renal blood vessels (Fig. 6 A, right panel). Similar changes in renal morphology have been seen in polyuria causing increased intrarenal pressures (15Takahashi N. Chernavvsky D.R. Gomez R.A. Igarashi P. Gitelman H.J. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5434-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The medullary atrophy appeared to be an age-dependent phenomenon that was infrequently seen in mice under the age of 2 weeks but found in ∼50% of mice at age 4 weeks (Fig. 6 B). The mice with flank swelling and renal enlargement had serum azotemia (blood urea nitrogen 78 ± 27 mg/dl, normal <15 mg/dl) and generally did not survive beyond 10–12 weeks. The results here provide direct evidence against a role for AQP3 in erythrocyte water and glycerol permeabilities. The low osmotic water permeability in AQP1-deficient erythrocytes was not further reduced by AQP3 deletion. Erythrocyte glycerol permeability was not affected by AQP3 deletion nor was the inhibition of glycerol permeability affected by phloretin. The conclusion of the prior study suggesting a role for AQP3 in erythrocyte water and glycerol transport was based primarily on indirect immunocytochemical evidence (4Roudier N. Verbavatz J.-M. Maurel C. Ripoche P. Tacnet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8407-8412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our AQP3 antibodies were unable to detect AQP3 in human or mouse erythrocytes by immunostaining, whereas AQP3 was readily detected in the kidney-collecting duct. Although small amounts of erythrocyte AQP3 expression cannot be ruled out given the limitations of available antibodies, our data provide functional evidence against an important contribution of AQP3 to erythrocyte water and glycerol permeability. The molecular mechanisms of erythrocyte glycerol transport and non-AQP-mediated water transport remain unknown. The high and phloretin-inhibitable glycerol permeability suggests the existence of an as yet unidentified glycerol transport protein. Interestingly, the residual water permeability after AQP1 deletion was partially inhibited by mercurials, suggesting the expression of another water-transporting protein. Erythrocytes contain UT-B (originally called UT3 in rat and mouse and UT11 in human) (for review see Refs. 16Trinh-Trang-Tan M.M. Bankir L. Exp. Nephrol. 1998; 6: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and 17Sands J.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 635-646PubMed Google Scholar), a urea-transporting protein that also transports water when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (18Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9369-9372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); however, quantitative analysis suggests that UT-B does not contribute significantly to water permeability in native erythrocytes (19Sidoux-Walter F. Lucien N. Olives B. Gobin R. Rousselet G. Kamsteeg E.J. Ripoche P. Deen P.M. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30228-30235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Measurement of water permeability in the erythrocytes lacking UT-B should be informative and when available, transport measurements in erythrocytes lacking UT-B and AQP1 together. Alternately, the non-AQP1 erythrocyte water transport pathway might involve a different aquaporin or non-aquaporin water transporter, such as a water-permeable glucose carrier (20Fischbarg J. Kuang K.Y. Hirsch J. Lecuona S. Rogozinski L. Silverstein S.C. Loike J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8397-8401Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or Na+-coupled solute cotransporter (21Meinild A.K. Loo D.D. Pajor A.M. Zeuthen T. Wright E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F777-F783PubMed Google Scholar). As in erythrocytes, water permeability in vesicles derived from the renal proximal tubule is inhibited by mercurials (3Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the data presented here on erythrocytes, water permeability in proximal tubule vesicles from AQP1 null mice is not inhibited by mercurials and probably involves a lipid pathway. Functional analysis of double knockout mice lacking two aquaporins has been useful in analyzing the role of aquaporins in organs that express more than one aquaporin. A small contribution of airway water channel AQP4 to airspace-capillary water permeability was demonstrated by comparative measurements in lungs from AQP1 null mice, which already have low water permeability, with lungs from AQP1/AQP4 double knockout mice (22Song Y. Ma T. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, the role of high basolateral membrane water permeability in the kidney-collecting duct was quantified in functional studies on mice lacking AQP3 versus AQP3/AQP4 together (13Ma T. Song Y. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). AQP3 is expressed mainly in the cortical and outer medullary-collecting duct, whereas AQP4 is expressed mainly in the inner medullary-collecting duct. Measurements in double knockout mice provided information about whether the partial urinary-concentrating ability of AQP3 null mice in response to water deprivation results from residual AQP4-mediated water permeability in the inner medullary-collecting duct. The roles of AQP1 (microvascular water channel) and AQP5 (alveolar epithelial water channel) in lung physiology were investigated using AQP1/AQP5 null mice (23Ma T. Fukuda N. Song Y. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Although airspace-capillary osmotic water permeability was reduced by more than 30-fold by AQP1/AQP5 deletion, active near-isosmolar alveolar fluid absorption was not affected, providing strong evidence against a role of aquaporins in lung physiology (24Verkman A.S. Matthay M.A. Song Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L867-L879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We note that the AQP1/AQP3 double knockout mice generated for the experiments described here have a greater impairment of growth and general robustness than the previously created AQP1/AQP4, AQP1/AQP5, or AQP3/AQP5 double knockout mice. Although the reason(s) for the relatively poor growth and survival of AQP1/AQP3 null mice cannot be established from the data presented here, we speculate that defective gastrointestinal function might be involved. AQP1 null mice manifest dietary fat misprocessing (25Ma T. Jayaraman S. Wang K.S. Song Y. Yang B. Li J. Bastidas J.A. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C126-C134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and AQP3 appears to be expressed strongly throughout the gastrointestinal tract (26Silberstein C. Kierbel A. Amodeo G. Zotta E. Bigi F. Berkowski D. Ibarra C. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1999; 32: 1131-1303Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Ramirez-Lorca R. Vizuete M.L. Venero J.L. Revuelta M. Cano J. Ilundain A.A. Echevarria M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) so that their double deletion might further compromise intestinal nutrient absorption. Urinary-concentrating ability in mice lacking AQP1 and AQP3 together was impaired to a greater extent than that in mice lacking AQP1 or AQP3 individually. AQP1 deletion results in defective isosmolar fluid absorption in proximal tubule as well as in defective countercurrent exchange, which produces a decrease in osmolality of the medullary interstitium. Although the relative importance of decreased proximal tubular absorption and defective thin descending limb of Henle and vasa recta function (for countercurrent exchange) was not determined directly, the vasa recta seemed more important based on the inability of DDAVP to increase urine osmolality (3Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) and the compensatory decrease in glomerular filtration rate in AQP1 null mice (10Schnermann J. Chou C.L. Ma T. Traynor T. Knepper M.A. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The polyuria in AQP1 null mice and their inability to produce concentrated urine probably results from a maximal medullary osmolality of 600–700 mosm. If AQP3 deletion affects renal cortical function (collecting duct water permeability, for review see Ref. 13Ma T. Song Y. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and the countercurrent system, it is predicted that urine osmolality in well hydrated mice should be very low and increase slightly in response to DDAVP administration or water deprivation. We found that compared with the results in well hydrated AQP3 null mice, urine osmolality was mildly reduced, and urine output was increased in the AQP1/AQP3 double knockout mice. The combined effects of low medullary interstitial osmolality and reduced collecting duct water permeability would account for this observation. Interestingly, urine osmolality in water-deprived AQP1/AQP3 null mice increased substantially, albeit to a level just lower than that in water-deprived AQP1 null mice. The submaximal increase in transepithelial water permeability in the AQP3-deficient cortical collecting duct in water-deprived AQP1/AQP3 double knockout mice permitted osmotic extraction of water in the collecting duct lumen to produce a urine with osmolality >500 mosmol. Together these results indicate distinct renal defects involving medullary countercurrent exchange (AQP1) and cortical collecting duct water permeability (AQP3). These data should be very useful in testing mathematical models of the urinary-concentrating mechanism. We thank Liman Qain for mouse breeding and genotype analysis."

There are two remarkable facts about PDI. It is a very abundant protein in the cell; its concentration in the ER lumen has been estimated to be 100–200 μm (8Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The other remarkable fact about PDI is its uncanny ability to bind things. Ligands range from peptide/protein substrates to hormones and calcium. Peptide/protein interactions are essential for effective catalysis of disulfide formation and isomerization. PDI interacts covalently with substrate cysteines (9Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8845-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), but it also binds a variety of peptide/protein substrates (10Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). There are few strict sequence/structure requirements for binding (11Morjana N.A. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4985-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Noiva R. Freedman R.B. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol.

Winther J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24992-24999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PDI activity can be inhibited by a number of peptides (11Morjana N.A. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4985-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), including the cyclic peptide antibiotic, bacitracin (14Roth R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A tripeptide affinity probe, which originally identified PDI as a glycosylation site binding protein (16Geetha-Habib M. Noiva R. Kaplan H.A. Lennarz W.J. Cell. 1988; 54: 1053-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) localized one peptide binding site near the C terminus of PDI (12Noiva R. Freedman R.B. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19210-19217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but deletion of the C-terminal binding site has little effect on the oxidase and isomerase activities (17Dai Y. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27572-27576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Binding of radiolabeled peptides to various fragments of PDI has recently suggested that multiple sites exist that may interact with various peptides/proteins (10Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and that a distinct structural domain (b′) that is N-terminal to one of the two active sites contributes significantly to peptide binding. Noncovalent interactions with protein substrates can suppress substrate aggregation during protein refolding. The chaperone activity of PDI is observed with proteins that form disulfides (18Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and proteins that do not (19Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1515-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol.

By interacting with multiple sites on aggregation-prone substrates, PDI can facilitate substrate aggregation under certain conditions, a behavior we have termed anti-chaperone activity (18Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19128-19135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to unfolded protein substrates, PDI associates tightly with some folded proteins. It serves as the β subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (23Koivu J. Myllyla R. Helaakoski T. Pihlajaniemi T. Tasanen K. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6447-6449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as a subunit of the microsomal triglyceride-transfer complex (24Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. McLean L.R. Spinner S.N. Aggerbeck L.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9728-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The level of PDI present in the ER is considerably higher than either of these complexes, suggesting that PDI is involved in the folding, stability, or assembly of the complex and in its retention in the ER through the C-terminal KDEL signal of PDI (25Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R. Pihlajaniemi T. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In addition to peptides and proteins, PDI binds hormones. It was identified by photoaffinity labeling as a thyroid-hormone binding protein (26Kitagawa S. Obata T. Hasumura S. Pastan I. Cheng S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3903-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Displacement of radiolabeled T3 from PDI purified from liver suggested a high affinity for T3 (27Horiuchi R. Yamauchi K. Hayashi H. Koya S. Takeuchi Y. Kato K. Kobayashi M. Takikawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, Guthapfel et al. (28Guthapfel R. Gueguen P. Quemeneur E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the high affinity binding of T3 (Kd = 21 nm) has very low capacity (0.002 mol of T3/mol of PDI), implying that high affinity binding is due to an impurity rather than PDI itself. PDI also binds β-estradiol (E2), and although the number of estrogen binding sites has not been determined, estrogen has been reported to inhibit isomerase activity (29Tsibris J.C. Hunt L.T. Ballejo G. Barker W.C. Toney L.J. Spellacy W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13967-13970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A short segment of the PDI sequence exhibits some similarity to the estrogen receptor, but this sequence does not appear to constitute an independent structural domain (30Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Scheek R.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Finally, like many ER-resident proteins, PDI binds calcium with low affinity (2–5 mm) and high capacity (19 mol Ca2+/mol protein) (31Lebeche D. Lucero H.A. Kaminer B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Calcium affects the chaperone activity of PDI (20Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) but has no influence on the isomerase function (20Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Rowling P.J. Freedman R.B. Proteins. 1992; 14: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The relationships between the hormone and peptide/protein binding sites are not at all clear. The interactions of PDI with hormone ligands might be due to specific binding sites, or it may be a reflection of nonspecific binding site(s) that are normally involved in PDI/substrate interactions. There have been no systematic attempts to determine the number of binding sites for individual ligands, nor have there been any attempts to examine overlap in the interaction sites. We have used competitive ligand binding of 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS), radiolabeled E2, and T3 along with various unlabeled peptide inhibitors to probe the various interactions these ligands make with PDI. The results show that PDI has multiple binding sites for hormones. Binding occurs at two different hormone binding sites. Both sites bind T3, whereas only one of them interacts with estradiol. These sites are distinct from peptide/protein binding sites. Thus, the hormone binding capacity of PDI appears to be a discrete function of the molecule and not coupled to its catalytic activity in disulfide isomerization. Because of its high local concentration in the ER, PDI could serve as an intracellular reservoir for these hormones despite its relatively low affinity. Based on the relative concentrations and affinities of PDI and the estrogen receptor, more than 90% of the intracellular T3 and estradiol would be expected to be bound to PDI. This high capacity intracellular reservoir would tend to raise the cellular levels of hormone that are necessary to cause receptor occupancy, even when the estrogen and T3 receptors have nm affinity for hormones. Recombinant rat PDI was expressed and purified as described previously (34Gilbert H.F. Kruzel M.L. Lyles M.M. Harper J.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The concentration of PDI monomers (55 kDa) was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (E0.1%= 0.94 cm−1 ml/mg) (35Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 29: 7298-7305Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). bis-ANS was obtained from Molecular Probes, and its concentration was determined by absorbance at 385 nm using an extinction coefficient of 16,790 cm−1m−1 (36Farris F.J. Weber G. Chiang C.C. Paul I.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 4469-4474Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). E2, T3, DTT, HEPES, equine liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), bacitracin, insulin chain B (oxidized, sulfonated), calcium chloride, and magnesium chloride were purchased from Sigma. ADH concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.455 cm−1 ml/mg (37Cannon D.J. McKay R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 35: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Bacitracin is a mixture of multiple peptides, with the prominent species being bacitracin-A (38Siegel M.M. Huang J. Lin B. Tsao R. Edmonds C.G. Biol. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 23: 186-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39Ikai Y. Oka H. Hayakawa J. Matsumoto M. Saito M. Harada K. Mayumi Y. Suzuki M. J. Antibiot. 1995; 48: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of bacitracin-A (1421) was used for estimating bacitracin concentration. Tritiated E2 (2,4,6,7-[3H]E2; specific activity, 84 Ci/mmol) and labeled T3(l-5-[125I]T3, 230 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences with purity checked by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Measurements were made in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm DTT at 25 °C using various concentrations of PDI and bis-ANS. The excitation wavelength was 370 nm, and emission was scanned from 425 to 575 nm using a PerkinElmer LS-5 fluorescence spectrometer. ADH aggregation upon thermal denaturation was followed by measuring the apparent absorbance at 360 nm caused by light scattering because of increasing turbidity (20Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Temperature was controlled at 40 °C using a circulating water bath connected to a Beckman DU 7500 spectrophotometer. Initiation of the assay was by addition of ADH (final concentration, 11 μmdimer) to a 50 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm DTT and PDI at various concentrations. The apparent velocity of aggregation (A360/min) was measured after any lag as the maximum change in absorbance with time. Oxidative refolding of RNase in the presence and absence of inhibitors was followed by an established continuous assay (8Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F.

Reduced, denatured RNase (final concentration, 8 μm) was added to PDI (1.4 μm) in a buffer containing 4.5 mm cCMP, 1 mm glutathione, 0.2 mm glutathione disulfide, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. RNase was reduced and denatured by overnight incubation at 10 mg/ml in denaturing buffer (140 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 6 m GdnHCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Denaturing buffer was exchanged for 0.1% acetic acid using a Bio-Gel P6 spin column. Reduced, denatured RNase concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 9300 cm−1m−1. Microdialysis cells from Bel-Art Products were used with two 100 μl cavities separated by 12–14 kDa molecular mass cut-off dialysis membrane (Spectra/Por). Experiments were performed at 25 °C and incubated for 18–24 h, sufficient time to ensure equilibrium as determined by following the time course for approach to equilibrium in control experiments. Dialysis buffer contained 10 mm DTT, 10 mmNaCl, and 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0. Bis-ANS concentration after equilibrium dialysis was determined by absorbance at 385 nm. [3H]E2 and 125[I]T3concentrations were determined by scintillation counting calibrated against standard concentrations of [3H]E2 and125[I]T3. There was no detectable degradation of PDI during equilibration as detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. PDI binds a diverse set of ligands (Fig.1), interacting with unfolded and folded proteins, E2, T3, peptide-like antibiotics such as bacitracin, and peptides such as oxidized insulin chain B (InB). Despite this promiscuity in interacting with potential ligands, the relationships among these sites have not previously been determined. PDI has been shown to bind hydrophobic ligands such as β-estradiol (27Horiuchi R. Yamauchi K. Hayashi H. Koya S. Takeuchi Y. Kato K. Kobayashi M. Takikawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and T3 (28Guthapfel R. Gueguen P. Quemeneur E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); however, the numbers of E2 and T3 binding sites have not been determined. Equilibrium dialysis using purified, recombinant rat PDI (Fig.2) shows that there is a single E2 binding site but two T3 sites, both of which have modest affinity (Table I). Individual Kd values cannot be resolved for the two T3 binding sites, suggesting that the Kd values are similar.Figure 2Binding of T3 and β-estradiol to PDI.

Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 41Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When bound to hydrophobic sites, bis-ANS exhibits enhanced fluorescence and a characteristic blue shift in the emission maximum. PDI binds bis-ANS with μm affinity, and the fluorescence of the bound probe is enhanced and blue-shifted (∼30 nm shift in maximum emission), indicating that the bis-ANS is binding to a hydrophobic site(s) on the protein (Fig.3 and Table I). The fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS bound to PDI was determined by titrating a limited amount of bis-ANS (0.5 μm) with increasing concentrations of PDI (0–20 μm) (40Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). When calibrated in this way, the fluorescence intensity observed at excess, saturating bis-ANS suggests the binding of 0.9 ± 0.2 mol of bis-ANS/mol of PDI (Table I). Calcium, yet another PDI ligand (31Lebeche D. Lucero H.A. Kaminer B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), enhances the fluorescence of PDI-bound bis-ANS by ∼1.6-fold with half-maximal enhancement occurring at 0.9 ± 0.1 mm calcium (data not shown). Magnesium, which like calcium affects PDI-chaperone/anti-chaperone activity, has a similar effect, but sodium chloride does not. Competition experiments show that T3 inhibits bis-ANS binding (Fig. 4). The maximum concentration of T3 is limited by solubility; however, extrapolation by fitting the data to a hyperbola suggests that T3 displaces (>87%) bis-ANS fluorescence with half-maximal inhibition occurring at 69 ± 5 μm at a bis-ANS concentration of 10 μm. None of the other known PDI ligands compete for this site; neither E2 (up to 64 μm), InB (up to 250 μm) nor bacitracin (up to 500 μm) significantly affects bis-ANS binding to PDI. Thus, PDI has one hydrophobic site that binds bis-ANS or T3, and the other ligands must bind at different sites. Equilibrium dialysis shows that there are two T3 binding sites (Fig. 2). Although one of these also binds bis-ANS, the other accommodates E2. Of all the ligands tested, only T3 affects E2 binding (Fig.5). Half-maximal inhibition occurs at 8.5 ± 3.2 μm T3, and T3 can displace E2 completely (≤95%). By contrast, neither bis-ANS, bacitracin, nor InB has any effect on E2 binding. T3 displaces both E2 and bis-ANS from their binding sites, but E2 and bis-ANS do not compete with each other. This also implies that there must be at least two independent binding sites for T3, consistent with the observed stoichiometry of T3 binding. E2 inhibits the PDI-catalyzed refolding of reduced RNase; however, the inhibition in only partial, and saturating E2 inhibits the isomerase activity by only half (Fig. 6). Although T3and E2 bind to the same site, T3 has no significant effect on PDI activity up to a concentration of 70 μm. Guthapfel et al. (28Guthapfel R. Gueguen P. Quemeneur E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported that T3 also partially inhibits PDI with a Ki of 1.3 μm; however, under very similar conditions, we repeatedly failed to observe significant (±10%) inhibition of the isomerase activity. InB has previously been shown to inhibit the isomerase activity with an inhibition constant of 230 ± 40 μm (11Morjana N.A. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4985-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Bacitracin, at concentrations that have previously been reported to inhibit PDI (42Mizunaga T. Katakura Y. Miura T. Maruyama Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 846-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), does inhibit PDI-catalyzed RNase refolding. However, at the same concentrations bacitracin also inhibits spontaneous RNase A refolding in the absence of PDI to the same extent (data not shown). The effects of bacitracin on PDI activity may reflect its interactions with the RNase substrate and/or its interaction with PDI. At high concentrations, PDI inhibits the aggregation of unfolded proteins. This chaperone activity, which has been attributed to the interaction of PDI and the unfolded protein substrate (8Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 19Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1515-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 43Quan H. Fan G. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17078-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), is observed during the folding of proteins that have disulfides as well as proteins that do not form disulfides. Under certain conditions and with certain substrate proteins, PDI exhibits what has been termed anti-chaperone activity. When it functions in its anti-chaperone mode, PDI facilitates rather than inhibits substrate aggregation (18Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have suggested that the chaperone/anti-chaperone functions of PDI result from multiple, noncovalent interactions between PDI and an aggregation-prone substrate (20Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These interactions cross-link substrate aggregates until the PDI concentration is sufficiently high to inhibit cross-linking, much like the inhibition of classical immunoprecipitation under conditions of antibody excess. Both chaperone and anti-chaperone activity are observed during the thermal aggregation of ADH (20Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). At lower concentrations of PDI, increasing PDI enhances substrate aggregation, but at higher PDI concentrations, increasing PDI inhibits substrate aggregation. At concentrations that should result in significant occupancy of their binding sites, neither E2 nor T3 have significant effects on the chaperone or anti-chaperone activity (Fig.7). These ligands also have no effect on PDI chaperone activity using citrate synthase as a substrate (20Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Both InB and bis-ANS inhibit ADH aggregation in the absence of PDI, so that their effect on PDI chaperone and anti-chaperone activities could not be determined. By contrast, relatively low concentrations of bacitracin inhibited the chaperone activity without having a large effect on substrate aggregation in the absence of PDI (Fig. 7). PDI has been repeatedly isolated from cells based on its propensity to bind a surprisingly diverse group of ligands. It is the β-subunit of prolyl hydroxylase (23Koivu J. Myllyla R. Helaakoski T. Pihlajaniemi T. Tasanen K. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6447-6449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a subunit of an ER triglyceride transferase (24Wetterau J.R. Combs K.A. McLean L.R. Spinner S.N. Aggerbeck L.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9728-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), although its catalytic activity is not required for the function of these complexes (25Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R. Pihlajaniemi T. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). PDI was also identified in a screen for proteins that interact with a potential glycosylation binding site present on a small peptide photo-affinity label (44LaMantia M. Miura T. Tachikawa H. Kaplan H.A. Lennarz W.J. Mizunaga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4453-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), although it was subsequently found that PDI does not participate directly in glycosylation (45Noiva R. Kimura H. Roos J. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19645-19649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a search for thyroid hormone binding proteins, PDI was identified through photoaffinity labeling as a major T3 binding protein (46Obata T. Kitagawa S. Gong Q., H. Pastan I. Cheng S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 782-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PDI, like some other folding assistants (47Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), must interact with a large number of different substrates with few recognizable sequence cues except for a small preference for peptides that contain cysteine (10Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Morjana N.A. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4985-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, Winther and colleagues (13Westphal V. Spetzler J.C. Meldal M. Christensen U. Winther J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24992-24999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) found that peptide sequence can affect the rate at which PDI reacts with peptide disulfides with some preference for a sequence that has the features, small/helix breaker-Cys-X-hydrophobic/basic-hydrophobic. Peptide binding sites have been difficult to localize on PDI. Early indications with a photo-affinity label suggested that a peptide binding site was located near the C terminus (12Noiva R. Freedman R.B. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19210-19217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of this region has little effect on isomerase activity, but it does eliminate chaperone activity (17Dai Y. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27572-27576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Klappa et al. (10Klappa P. Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have recently found that interaction between PDI and peptides involves a single domain (b′), but other sites are involved in the binding of large, protein substrates. Thus, multiple sites with limited specificity are involved in the interaction of PDI with its protein substrates. The competition binding experiments reported here show that PDI has multiple ligand binding sites (Fig. 8), some of which display overlapping specificity. However, the sites involved in hormone binding are distinct from those involved in peptide and substrate binding. Peptides and peptide analogs do not displace hormones from their binding sites, and the binding of hormones is noncompetitive with protein substrate. The partial inhibition by E2 means that protein substrates can still interact with PDI, even when E2 is bound. The lack of an observable effect on chaperone/anti-chaperone behavior also argues that the hormone sites are not utilized during the interaction between PDI and its unfolded protein substrates. Previous measurements of T3 and E2 binding to PDI have been performed by displacement of a small amount of labeled hormone by unlabeled competitor. Affinities estimated in this way suggested that PDI binds both hormones with nm affinity (26Kitagawa S. Obata T. Hasumura S. Pastan I. Cheng S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3903-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tsibris J.C. Hunt L.T. Ballejo G. Barker W.C. Toney L.J. Spellacy W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13967-13970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although lower affinity sites were observed as backgrounds. Guthapfel et al. (28Guthapfel R. Gueguen P. Quemeneur E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) has recently shown that high affinity (nm) T3 binding is not stoichiometric (<0.01 mol hormone/mol PDI), implying that tight binding is from impurities rather than from PDI itself. By contrast, the low affinity (μm) binding we observe for T3 and E2 (Table I) is stoichiometric. Although PDI does not exhibit high affinity for these hormone ligands, it does have a limited number of reasonably specific sites for their interaction that do not interfere significantly with the catalytic or chaperone activities of the molecule. Thus, hormones are not binding to sites that interact with protein substrates. With dissociation constants of 2–4 μm (Table I), it would be tempting to conclude that hormone binding by PDI does not have any physiological relevance because the Kd values for hormone binding to their cellular receptors are in the low pm range (Kd = 10–300 pm) (48Neff S Sadowski C Miksicek RJ. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1215-1223PubMed Google Scholar, 49Walent J.H. Gorski J. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2383-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 50Danel L. Cordier G. Revillard J.P. Saez S. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4701-4705PubMed Google Scholar). However, the local concentration of PDI in the ER is quite high, estimated at ∼200 μm (51Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of hormone to PDI will be driven by the high, local concentration of PDI despite the low Kd value. A specific example illustrates how the presence of a high capacity, low affinity reservoir will affect the location of hormone (Fig.9). With a Kd for hormone binding to PDI of 2 μm and a concentration of 200 μm PDI, simple equilibrium binding tells us that ratio [HR-PDI]/[HR]free will be 100, and 99% of the E2 in the endoplasmic reticulum will be bound to PDI. If the ER represents 10% of the cell volume, then about 90% of the intracellular E2 would be bound to PDI at any given free concentration of hormone. At a free cytosolic concentration of hormone (10 pm) that is sufficient to half-saturate the estrogen receptor, hormone binding to PDI would require a total intracellular concentration of 100 pm to generate a free hormone concentration of 10 pm. The total concentration of hormone bound to PDI would be ∼90 pm, whereas the free concentration of hormone would be 10 pm. With a high capacity reservoir for hormone binding, the concentration of hormone necessary to generate a physiological response would be significantly higher than the Kd for equilibrium hormone binding. Physiological concentrations of T3 range from about 10 pm in serum (52Butler J, Moore P, Mieli-Vergani G, Moniz C. (1988) Ann. Clin. Biochem. 25536–539Google Scholar) to 75 pm in brain cytosol (53Ferreiro B. Pastor R. Bernal J. Acta Endocrinol. 1990; 123: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The physiological E2 concentrations are larger, from 0.2–2 nmin human serum (54Gabrielsson J. Wallenbeck I. Birgerson L. Acta Obstet. Gynecol. Scand. Supp. 1996; 163: 26-31PubMed Google Scholar), to 0.4 μm in placenta (55Nachtigall L. Bassett M. Hogsander U. Levitz M. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1968; 101: 638-648Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and up to 3–5 μm in developing follicles in the ovary (56Erickson G.F. Semin. Reprod. Med. 1986; 4: 233-254Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All of these are significantly higher than the Kd measured in vitro (48Neff S Sadowski C Miksicek RJ. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1215-1223PubMed Google Scholar, 49Walent J.H. Gorski J. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2383-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 50Danel L. Cordier G. Revillard J.P. Saez S. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4701-4705PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that there must be some mechanism for modulating the response of hormone receptor to physiological concentrations of hormone. The function of high capacity reservoirs of low affinity may be to balance the need for high specificity and regulation. Tight binding is essential for high specificity and for discriminating between similar structures. For very high affinity receptors, such as the estrogen and T3 receptors, cell volume may limit the number of molecules present in a given cell. For example, with a cell volume of 6000 μ3 (32Korchev Y.E. Gorelik J. Lab M.J. Sviderskaya E.V Johnston C.L. Coombes C.R. Vodyanoy I. Edwards C.R. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 451-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), at a concentration of 10 pm, there would be only 40 molecules of hormone/cell. A stochastic fluctuation in the distribution of hormone molecules in the cells would raise the possibility that some cells would not have any hormone molecules. By increasing the number of molecules in the cell by 10-fold or more, a low affinity, high capacity reservoir of hormone binding could significantly increase the number of hormone molecules/cell and decrease the probability that a cell would, by chance, find itself without hormone when a response was warranted.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28400-28404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).N-Glycosylation of proteins has been demonstrated to play a variety of roles including modulation of biological activity, regulation of intracellular targeting, protein folding, and maintenance of protein stability. In the case of GLYT1, we have previously shown that glycosylation is necessary for proper trafficking of the protein, but it is not indispensable for the transport activity itself (16Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28400-28404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of transporters seems to be an important determinant of the impact of transport activity on synaptic function. In this sense, various transporters show a differential distribution among membrane domains of the cells where they are expressed. For instance, the GABA transporter, GABA transporter 1, the transporters for biogenic amines, and the glycine transporter GLYT2 are concentrated in presynaptic terminals (17Minelli A. Brecha N.C. Karschin C. DeBiasi S. Conti F. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7734-7746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nirenberg M.J. Chan J. Pohorille A. Vaughan R.A. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J. Pickel V.M. J.

Todd A.J. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In non-neural cells, the betaine transporter, a member of the GABA transporter subfamily, is expressed in the basolateral membrane of epithelial MDCK cells (21Pietrini G. Suh Y.J. Edelmann L. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific mechanisms of such a nonuniform distribution have been studied in experimental systems of polarized cultured cells, especially in the epithelial MDCK cell line, since somatodendritic neuronal proteins use to be localized in the basolateral domain, whereas axonal proteins are in the apical one (22Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). N-Glycosylation has been shown to be involved in the apical localization of a number of secretory and membrane proteins (23Ikonen E. Simons K. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanisms on apical delivery are yet unclear. In the present report we have analyzed the consequences of the disruption of the potential N-glycosylation sites of GLYT2 on the transport of solute, in transport of the protein to the cell surface, and in the asymmetrical distribution of GLYT2 in a model of polarized cells. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and G418 were from Life Technologies, Inc. BHK medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine serum albumin was from Sigma. [2-3H]Glycine (1757.5 GBq/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Recombinant N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) was from New England Biolabs. Transwell inserts were from Costar. Culture dishes were from Nunc (Denmark). All other reagents were obtained in the purest form available. All mutants were performed as described previously (16Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28400-28404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mutant and wild type cDNAs were cloned in theHindIII/XbaI or XhoI/XbaI restriction sites of pcDNA3 for expression in MDCK cells. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a modification of the method of Higuchi (25Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar) as described (24Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mutants and wild type cDNAs were subcloned downstream from the cytomegalovirus promoter of pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). To disrupt the glycosylation sequences (NX(S/T)), codons coding for Asn were mutagenized to Asp. Glycosylation sites were eliminated sequentially, starting with single mutations as follows: N345D, N355D, N360D, and N366D. Mutants devoid of two, three, and four glycosylation sites were generated, using as a template DNA sequences mutated at one, two, or three glycosylation sites, respectively. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Transient expression in COS cells, was carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the procedure indicated by the supplier. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and then used to assay transport activity, surface expression, and immunofluorescence. The parental MDCK type II cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C, 7% CO2. MDCK cells were transfected by electroporation with cDNAs encoding the transporters cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 that carries the neomycin resistance gene for selection. After selection with 0.6 g/liter G418 for 12–15 days, single colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders and tested for transporter expression by immunocytochemistry. Clones stably transfected were then assayed for transport activity and maintained in DMEM without glycine, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.6 g/liter G418. Transport assays in transfected COS-7 cells were performed at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm Ca2Cl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose) as described previously (26Casado M. Bendahan A. Zafra F. Danbolt N.C. Aragón C. Giménez C. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27313-27317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for the indicated times in 0.3 ml of an uptake solution that contained an isotopic dilution of3H-labeled glycine in the former solution yielding a 10 μm final glycine concentration (or the desired concentration). Kinetic analysis was performed by varying glycine concentration in the uptake medium between 10 μm and 1 mm. Transport into reconstituted liposomes was measured at room temperature using an inwardly directed NaCl gradient in the presence of a negative membrane potential, as described (27López-Corcuera B. Vázquez J. Aragón C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24809-24814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28López-Corcuera B. Aragón C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nonspecific transport was defined as the glycine transport shown by mock-transfected cells or proteoliposomes obtained from mock-transfected cells. Parental and transfected MDCK cells were plated at 50% confluence on Transwell tissue culture inserts (6.5 mm diameter, 0.4 μm filter pore size, Costar Co., Cambridge, MA) and grown for 5–7 days. Glycine uptake was performed at room temperature according to a modification of the method of Yamauchiet al. (29Yamauchi A. Kwon H.M. Uchida S. Preston A.S. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F197-F202PubMed Google Scholar). After one wash of each chamber with complete phosphate-buffered saline (PBS/Ca/Mg: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.89 mm CaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3) and another wash with uptake buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mmd(+)-glucose, 10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4), the cells were incubated with 0.2 μm[3H]glycine in uptake buffer either in the upper or in the lower chamber for 10 min. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS/Ca/Mg three times from the side they were incubated with the 3H-labeled substrate and once from the opposite side. The cells were dried and lysed in 0.2 mNaOH. Aliquots were taken and counted in scintillation fluid, and protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Basal glycine uptake was defined as glycine transport shown by nontransfected MDCK cells. For each reconstitution experiment, transfected cells from one dish (10-cm diameter) were used. Cells were scraped, collected by centrifugation, and adjusted at a protein concentration of 5–10 mg/ml with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3). Solubilization of cells was performed using sodium cholate at a 1:1 detergent/protein ratio. After 10 min on ice, solubilized proteins were reconstituted with asolectin/brain lipids (28López-Corcuera B. Aragón C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and proteoliposomes were kept on ice until used. Wild type GLYT2 protein transiently transfected in COS cells was solubilized and reconstituted into liposomes as described above. Proteoliposomes were treated with or without PNGaseF (150 units/μg protein) in the presence of protease inhibitors (4 μm pepstatin A and 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 3 h at 37 °C with gentle agitation. After treatment, proteoliposomes were washed and immediately used for glycine transport assays or for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. MDCK cells were plated at 50% confluence on 0.4-μm pore size, 25-mm Transwell cell culture filter inserts for 6-well plates and grown for 7 days. After 3 washes with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS/Ca/Mg, cell surface proteins of either apical or basolateral domains of cell plasma membrane were biotinylated by exposing that side of the cell monolayer to 1 ml of sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin) (Pierce) (1 mg/ml in PBS/Ca/Mg) for 20 min on ice. Cells were then washed with 2 ml of PBS/Ca/Mg plus 100 mm lysine for 20 min to quench the reagent. After three more washes with PBS/Ca/Mg, filters were excised, and cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmHEPES-Tris, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) for 30 min. The cell lysate was clarified by sedimentation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. COS cell proteins were labeled following the same procedure except they were plated on regular culture dishes. Biotinylated proteins were recovered by adding streptavidin-agarose beads to a portion of the cell lysate followed by incubation for 2 h with gentle agitation at room temperature. Beads were pellet by centrifugation. After three washes with 1 ml of lysis buffer, proteins bound to the beads were eluted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with antibodies recognizing GLYT2 (10Zafra F. Aragón C. Olivares L. Danbolt N.C. Giménez C. Storm Mathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3952-3969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zafra F. Gomeza J. Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1342-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) as described previously (10Zafra F. Aragón C. Olivares L. Danbolt N.C. Giménez C. Storm Mathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3952-3969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bands were visualized with the ECL detection method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant version 3.0) by using film exposures that were in the linear range. The procedure used to prepare Triton X-100-insoluble membranes by centrifugation to equilibrium in sucrose density gradients was essentially as described by Brown and Rose (30Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). Cells grown to confluency in four 100-mm dishes were rinsed with PBS and lysed for 20 min in 1 ml of 150 mmNaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. The lysate was scraped from the dishes with a rubber policeman, and the dishes were rinsed with 1 ml of the same buffer at 4 °C, and the lysate was homogenized by passing the sample through a 22-gauge needle. The lysate was brought to 40% sucrose in a final volume of 4 ml and placed at the bottom of an 8-ml 5–30% linear sucrose gradient. Samples were centrifuged for 18 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 41 rotor. Fractions of 1 ml were harvested from the bottom of the tube, and aliquots were subjected to immunoblot analysis. MAL proteolipid was detected by the dot-blot technique by spotting 100 μg of protein onto a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was probed with a highly specific antibody for MAL kindly provided by Dr. M. A. Alonso (Centro de Biologı́a Molecular) and previously characterized (31Puertollano R. Martin-Belmonte F. Millan J. de Marco M.C. Albar J.P. Kremer L. Alonso M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). GLYT2 is an axonal glycoprotein involved in the re-uptake of the neurotransmitter glycine in the glycinergic synapses. Based on its deduced amino acid sequence, the protein has four consensus sites (NX(T/S)) for N-glycosylation in the second extracellular loop (Asn-345, Asn-355, Asn-360, and Asn-366) as depicted in Fig. 1. Glycosylation has been shown to play a functional role in other members of the sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family (24Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,33Nguyen T.T. Amara S.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To address the role of the carbohydrate moiety on different functional aspects of GLYT2, we disrupted the glycosylation consensus sequences by site-directed mutagenesis replacing the asparagine residues with aspartate. Then we analyzed the effects of these mutations on transport activity, on transport of the protein from the intracellular compartments to the cell surface, and on asymmetrical distribution of the protein in the surface of polarized cells. First, we produced a series of mutants by progressive removal of the potential glycosylation sites. We prepared four single mutants (N345D, N355D, N360D, and N366D), a double mutant (N355D/N360D), a triple mutant (N345D/N355D/N360D), and the quadruple mutant (N345D/N355D/N360D/N366D). Wild type or mutant forms of GLYT2 were then transiently transfected into COS cells, and their transport activities were assayed. As shown in Fig. 2, mutants deficient in one glycosylation site sustained glycine transport activities similar to those displayed by wild type transporter, indicating that no single N-linked carbohydrate chain is specifically required for the GLYT2 function. The double and triple mutants retained 74 and 58% of wild type glycine transport activity, respectively. When all four potential glycosylation sites were mutated, a complete lost of activity was observed. These results indicate that the effects of disrupting N-glycosylation sites on GLYT2 activity are cumulative. The progressive decrease in transport activity was not due to a change in the affinity of the transporter for the substrate, as deduced from kinetic analysis of the triple mutant. The calculated K m for glycine was nearly identical in wild type and triple mutant of GLYT2 (102 ± 4 and 93 ± 3 μm, respectively). However, there were decreases in theV max values (3.3 ± 0.5 and 2.0 ± 0.2 nmol of glycine/mg of protein/6 min, respectively).Figure 2Transport activity ofN-glycosylation-deficient mutants. Each of the seven asparagine replacement mutants were assayed for transport activity 48 h after transfection in COS-7 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activities are shown as a percentage of GLYT2 transport activity that was 1.2 ± 0.3 nmol glycine/mg of protein/6 min. Error bars represent S.E. of three determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the impaired transport of the mutants was due to a poor expression or to a deficient transport of the protein to the plasma membrane, we performed cell surface biotinylation experiments followed by immunodetection (Fig. 3). Plasma membrane proteins were labeled with the membrane-impermeant reagent Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin. The biotinylated proteins were precipitated with immobilized streptavidin and immunodetected by Western blot using a previously characterized specific antibody against the NH2-terminal domain of GLYT2 (10Zafra F. Aragón C. Olivares L. Danbolt N.C. Giménez C. Storm Mathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3952-3969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zafra F. Gomeza J. Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1342-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In the total cell lysate the antibody recognized two protein bands either for the wild type or for the mutants, except in the case of the quadruple mutant that was expressed as a single band (Fig. 3 A). The upper band was very diffuse, a characteristic of heavily glycosylated proteins. In the triple mutant this smeared band was very faint and could be barely detected with longer exposures of the film. Only the upper bands were biotinylated when exposed to the biotin reagent (Fig.3 B), indicating that these forms of the protein correspond to extracellularly accessible, and therefore plasma membrane inserted, mature transporters. However, the lower bands were not biotinylated as expected for partially processed intracellular transporters. The electrophoretic mobility of the lower band slightly increased with every single mutation and increased stepwise as more mutations were progressively introduced. The size of the lower bands ranged from around 71 kDa in the wild type to 63 kDa in the quadruple mutant. This indicates that the four consensus N-glycosylation sites located in the large hydrophilic loop of GLYT2 are in fact glycosylated and that the location of this loop is consistent with GLYT2 predicted topology. We quantified the relative amounts of the mutants on the plasma membrane compared with their total amount in cell extracts by a densitometric analysis considering as 100% the fraction of total wild type protein that reached the membrane (Fig. 3 C). For the mutants, a parallelism between the difficulty to arrive to the cell surface and the decrease in transport activity was observed. No significant differences were detected in cell and membrane expression of all single and double mutants as compared with the wild type. However, mutants devoid of three or four N-glycosylation sites showed low expression levels and difficulties reaching the plasma membrane. The quadruple mutant was not detected in the surface, which is consistent with the absence of transport activity shown when this protein is expressed in COS cells (Fig. 2). The subcellular localization of mutants was additionally examined by immunocytochemistry on transfected COS cells. Whereas the plasma membrane of wild type transfected cells was clearly labeled, a poor presence or total absence of labeling was observed at the surface of cells expressing the triple and quadruple mutants, respectively. 2R. Martı́nez-Maza, B. López-Corcuera, and C. Aragón, unpublished results. Immunofluorescence together with biotinylation experiments led us to conclude that, although each carbohydrate chain considered individually is not specifically essential for GLYT2 function, the progressive removal of carbohydrate chains produced an accumulative decrease in surface expression and, consequently, in transport activity of the glycine transporter. Similar results have been described for the norepinephrine transporter (33Nguyen T.T. Amara S.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and GLYT1 (24Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inactivation and intracellular retention of the transporter produced by the total disruption ofN-glycosylation sites could be explained by misfolding of the protein, the quadruple mutant and the wild type form of GLYT2 were expressed in COS cells, solubilized with detergent, and reconstituted into liposomes. Fig. 4 A shows that whereas the reconstituted wild type was fully active, the quadruple mutant was completely inactive after reconstitution. Moreover, when the wild type was deglycosylated by treatment with PNGaseF after being reconstituted into liposomes, the transporter reduced the transport activity by 35–40%. The removal ofN-linked sugar chains by PNGaseF produced a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of GLYT2 protein as shown on Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 2). The size of the band (63 kDa) corresponding to the nonglycosylated protein (Fig. 4 B, lane 2) agrees with that of the quadruple mutant (Fig. 4 B, lane 3), indicating that there are no additional sites for N-glycosylation on GLYT2. This rules out the use of the N-glycosylation consensus sites located at the extracellular loop VI and those of the amino terminus of the transporter (Fig. 1). These results indicated that the loss of carbohydrates renders a GLYT2 transporter that is in an inactive conformation, probably misfolded, and that is unable to reach the cell surface. The importance of glycosylation for a proper surface delivery has been previously stated for other transporters (24Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 33Nguyen T.T. Amara S.G. J.

Sci. 1996; 21: 308-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Moreover, the reduction in the wild type GLYT2 activity after enzymatic deglycosylation indicates that the oligosaccharide chains stabilize the optimal active conformation of the transporter once it has been synthesized. Interestingly, these results contrast with those reported for GLYT1, norepinephrine transporter, and serotonin transporter where surface trafficking but no transport activity impaired in the nonglycosylated mutant (24Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 33Nguyen T.T. Amara S.G. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but are consistent with results obtained with a glycine transporter purified from pig spinal cord (15Núñez E. Aragón C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16920-16924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GLYT2 is expressed mainly in axons and terminals of neurons in the spinal cord and other glycinergic areas but is absent in most of dendrites and cell bodies. A number of transporters of this gene family also show an asymmetrical distribution on the surface of cells where they are expressed, and thus, it is supposed that the specific subcellular distribution of transporters must be essential to accomplish their biological functions. To study the molecular mechanism involved in asymmetrical distribution of neuronal proteins, a frequently used experimental model is found in the epithelial MDCK cell line. We recently developed MDCK cell lines constitutively expressing GLYT2 in which most of the wild type transporters were localized in the apical domain of polarized cells (39Poyatos I. Ruberti F. Martinez-Maza R. Giménez C. Dotti C.G. Zafra F. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because glycosylation is known to be an apical determinant for a number of secreted and membrane proteins (40Rodriguez-Boulan E. Gonzalez A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we decided to analyze the distribution of deglycosylated GLYT2 mutants in this experimental system. However, in transiently transfected MDCK cells, like in COS cells, the quadruple mutant remained accumulated in intracellular compartments (not shown), and thus, this mutant could no be further analyzed. Again like in COS cells, the triple mutant was partially active, and thus we generated stable cell lines with this construct. The distribution of the protein between the apical and basolateral domains was analyzed by vectorial transport assays and by biotinylation experiments (Fig.5). In agreement with our previous observations, 80 ± 8% of the transport activity determined in MDCK cells stably transfected with wild type GLYT2 was located in the apical side (Fig. 5 A), and most of the protein (89 ± 6%) was labeled when the Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin reagent was added from the apical side (Fig. 5 B). However, in MDCK cells transfected with the triple GLYT2 mutant, the transport activity and the labeled protein were detected at about the same levels at both cell surfaces (60 ± 3% apical in transport assays and 55 ± 7% apical in biotinylation experiments) (Fig. 5, A andB). The high intracellular retention of this mutant precluded the production of reliable confocal microscopy images. These results clearly indicate that full glycosylation is not only necessary for proper conformation and cell surface delivery but also for asymmetrical distribution in polarized cells, a property that must be physiologically relevant for neuronal proteins that need to be asymmetrically distributed. The mechanisms for apical sorting are diverse, and signals have been found in the extracellular (41Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), in the transmembrane (42Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), and in the intracellular protein domains (43Alonso M.A. Fan L. Alarcon B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30748-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 44Muth T.R. Ahn J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25616-25627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate moiety is involved in apical localization of other proteins (45Gut A. Kappeler F. Hyka N. Balda M.S. Hauri H.P. Matter K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1919-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), but this has not been reported for neurotransmitter transporters. In fact, the mechanism for apical localization of the GABA transporter GABA transporter 3 in MDCK cells has been investigated, and it was shown to depend on a THF motif located in the intracellular carboxyl end of the protein (44Muth T.R.

However, intracellular ends of GLYT2 have been previously shown not to be important in its apical distribution (39Poyatos I. Ruberti F. Martinez-Maza R. Giménez C. Dotti C.G. Zafra F. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Some apically directed membrane proteins are associated with specialized membrane domains that are rich in glycosphingolipids and are detergent-insoluble (46Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8048) Google Scholar). These structures, termed “rafts,” can be recovered from low density fractions after centrifugation to equilibrium in sucrose density gradients. To investigate whether GLYT2 used this sorting mechanism, we centrifuged Triton X-100 extracts from MDCK cells stably transfected with the wild type GLYT2 to equilibrium (30Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, GLYT2 was completely solubilized by a brief treatment of the cells with Triton X-100 at 4 °C and appeared in higher density fractions (fractions 1–4) (Fig.6 A). As a control of the fractionation procedure, we analyzed in parallel the distribution of the proteolipid MAL (Fig. 6 B), a protein associated with detergent-insoluble membranes that was found in the buoyant, membrane-insoluble fractions (fractions 7–8). These experiments indicated that GLYT2 is not associated with membrane rafts and must be polarized by an alternative mechanism. Proteins that utilize the glycolipid pathway are heterogeneous in their apical sorting signal that can be found in N-linked carbohydrates, in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, or even in transmembrane domains. Among them, there are a number of N-glycosylated intestinal hydrolases (47Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the alkaline phosphatase (48Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), or the influenza virus hemagglutinin (42Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Also this pathway is used by other integral membrane proteins like the MAL proteolipid (31Puertollano R. Martin-Belmonte F. Millan J. de Marco M.C. Albar J.P. Kremer L. Alonso M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or caveolin (49Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). However, other membrane proteins including both glycosylated (enteropeptidase) (50Zheng X. Lu D. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1596-1605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and nonglycosylated proteins (CD3-ε) (43Alonso M.A. Fan L. Alarcon B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30748-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) are apically sorted by a proteolipid-independent pathway. The nature of the molecular machinery involved in the recruitment of glycoproteins to the apical membrane is largely unknown. A first model propose that N-glycans constitute the apical signal by themselves. Indeed the insertion of ectopic glycosylation sites in secretory or membrane proteins converted nonpolarized secretory proteins or intracellularly retained membrane proteins into apical ones (41Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 45Gut A. Kappeler F. Hyka N. Balda M.S. Hauri H.P. Matter K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1919-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this model N-glycans would interact with lectins sorters in the trans-Golgi network that would mediate incorporation of glycosylated proteins into apical transport vesicles. Although some candidate lectins have been identified (51Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Etzold T. Simons K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 52Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), their role in this process is still unclear. Our observation that the triple GLYT2 mutant is distributed in a nonpolarized manner despite the presence of a glycosylation site would not support this model for GLYT2 except that the massive reduction in the glycosylation observed in this mutant would also reduce the affinity for lectins and, consequently, the efficiency of apical recruitment. Indeed, a similar observation has been performed for erythropoietin, a secretory protein where not all its glycosylation sites are equally effective in promoting apical sorting (53Kitagawa Y. Sano Y. Ueda M. Higashio K. Narita H. Okano M. Matsumoto S. Sasaki R. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 213: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). An alternative model where N-glycans would not constitute a sufficient sorting signal per se but would play an indirect role by allowing the correct folding and structural stabilization of proteinaceous sorting signals has been proposed (40Rodriguez-Boulan E. Gonzalez A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Our observation on the triple GLYT2 mutant would also be compatible with this alternative model. In summary, in this report we describe the importance of the sugar moiety of GLYT2 for the transport of the solute and for the arrival to the membrane in a polarized manner. This could be relevant for the physiology of the glycinergic neuron, as GLYT2 has to be asymmetrically distributed to be finally settled in the axonal domain where it develops its biological function."

The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors are dimeric proteins involved in the activation of a large number of genes in response to inflammatory stimuli. We report the involvement of a novel member of the ETS transcription factor, ESE-1, in mediating vascular inflammation. ESE-1 is induced in response to inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide in vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. This induction occurs within hours of stimulation and is mediated by NF-κB transactivation of the ESE-1 promoter. We have identified the inducible form of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS2) as a putative target for ESE-1. ESE-1 can bind to the p50 subunit of NF-κB, and cotransfection of ESE-1 with the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB synergistically enhances transactivation of theNOS2 promoter by ESE-1. An ESE-1-binding site within theNOS2 promoter has been identified, the site-directed mutagenesis of which completely abolishes the ability of ESE-1 to transactivate the NOS2 promoter.

The most common vascular disease, atherosclerosis, begins when lipoproteins, and in particular low density lipoprotein, enter the subendothelium and become oxidized. Oxidized low density lipoprotein stimulates the production of interleukin-1 and other inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines activate adhesion molecules, including VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin, on the endothelial surface, which promote the attachment of and transmigration of monocytes. The expression of the inducible form of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS2)1 has also been shown to be up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines and endotoxin in cultured cells found in the atherosclerotic plaque including macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells (1Esaki T. Hayashi T. Muto E. Yamada K. Kuzuya M. Iguchi A. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 128: 39-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2Xu R. Morales J.A. Muniyappa R. Skafar D.F.

Furthermore, immunohistological studies have demonstrated the expression of NOS2 in the atherosclerotic lesions in these cell types as well (1Esaki T. Hayashi T. Muto E. Yamada K. Kuzuya M. Iguchi A. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 128: 39-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Buttery L.D. Springall D.R. Chester A.H. Evans T.J. Standfield E.N. Parums D.V. Yacoub M.H. Polak J.M. Lab. Invest. 1996; 75: 77-85PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of the NOS2 is also associated with more acute forms of vascular inflammation such as endotoxemia. The generation of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide by NOS2 is at least in part responsible for the hypotension seen in association with bacterial sepsis (5Wei X.Q. Charles I.G. Smith A. Ure J.

Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q.W. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). NOS2 expression is also induced in other types of vascular inflammation including restenosis and in the accelerated atherosclerosis associated with heart transplantation (7Lafond-Walker A. Chen C.L. Augustine S. Wu T.C. Hruban R.H. Lowenstein C.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 919-925PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ikeda U. Maeda Y. Shimada K. Clin. Cardiol. 1998; 21: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Upon binding of cytokines or other inflammatory mediators to their corresponding receptors, several classes of transcription factors are involved in the induction of these stimuli. For example, within minutes of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) treatment, the expression of the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun are induced. These transcription factors are the constituent proteins for AP-1 (9Conca W. Auron P.E. Aoun-Wathne M. Bennett N. Seckinger P. Welgus H.G. Goldring S.R. Eisenberg S.P. Dayer J.M. Krane S.M. J. Biol.

One of the target genes of IL-1β, the collagenase gene, can be activated by AP-1 alone (11Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Multiple signaling pathways have been implicated in the activation of these immediate early genes by IL-1β including the Janus kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and protein kinase A (12Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 13Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar). The propagation of inflammation is dependent on several other transcription factors for the activation of multiple genes. The Rel/NF-κB transcription factor family is another set of genes, members of which are critical mediators of gene expression during inflammation. Activation of these factors does not require protein synthesis, as these factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm bound noncovalently to Iκ-B proteins, their endogenous inhibitors. Upon stimulation by inflammatory cytokines or endotoxin, these inhibitors are proteolytically degraded, allowing NF-κB to be translocated to the nucleus where it binds to the regulatory regions of target genes as a heterodimer. Although originally described as being important in lymphoid cells and lymphoid-specific genes, NF-κB has clearly been shown to play an important role in a whole host of other cell types and target genes. The p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB bind to other transcription factors through protein interactions often resulting in synergistic transactivation of the target genes of NF-κB (17Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2943) Google Scholar, 18DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar) The ETS genes are a family of at least 30 members that function as transcription factors (19Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). All ETS factors share a highly conserved 80–90-amino acid DNA binding domain, the Ets domain. ETS factors play a central role in regulating genes involved in development, cellular differentiation, and proliferation. Many macrophage, B-, and T-cell-specific genes are regulated by ETS factors. The role of ETS factors in the immune system has been substantiated by experiments in mice where the genes encoding several ETS factors have been disrupted by homologous recombination. The PU.1 knockout is characterized by a lack of immune system development (20Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). T-cell apoptosis and increased terminal B-cell differentiation are characteristics of the Ets-1 knockout mice (21Muthusamy N. Barton K. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We recently identified a novel member of the ETS factor ESE-1 that is the prototype member of a new subclass of ETS factors (22Oettgen P. Carter K.C. Augustus M. Barcinski M. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Genomics. 1997; 445: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ESE-1 has several interesting features when compared with other ETS family members. First, unlike other ETS factors that are either ubiquitously expressed or primarily expressed in lymphoid cells, ESE-1 appears to have an epithelial specific expression pattern under basal conditions. Second, unlike all other ETS factors, ESE-1 has two DNA binding domains, a classical ETS domain and, in addition, an A/T hook domain also found in HMG proteins. In this report we demonstrate that ESE-1 is inducible in vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage, in response to inflammatory stimuli. This induction appears to be mediated via NF-κB. ESE-1 is able to bind directly to the p50 subunit of NF-κB and can augment the NF-κB-mediated activation of genes that are induced during inflammation. Finally, we have identified the NOS2 gene as a target for ESE-1 and have demonstrated the induction of ESE-1 in the mouse aorta in vivo during acute inflammation. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells and primary human smooth muscle cells were obtained from Clonetics and grown according to the manufacturer's recommendations. THP-1 and RAW 264.7 (monocytic cell lines) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) were harvested from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic dissociation according to the method of Gunther et al. (23Gunther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). Northern blots were hybridized with random prime-labeled ESE-1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and were washed at 50 °C with 0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS. cDNAs were generated from 1 μg of mRNA isolated from different cells or tissues using oligo(dT)12–18 priming (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in deoxyribonuclease I (Life Technologies, Inc.)-treated samples. Each PCR used equivalent amounts of 0.1 ng of cDNA, 4 ng/μl of each primer, 0.25 units of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), 150 μm of each dNTP, 3 mm of MgCl2, reaction buffer, and water to a final volume of 25 μl and were covered with mineral oil. The sequences of the ESE-1 primers are as follows: sense, 5′-CTGAGCAAAGAGTACTGGGACTGTC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCATAGTTGGGCCACAGCCTCGGAGC-3′, with an expected amplification product of 188 bp. The sequences of the primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are as follows: sense, 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′, with an expected amplification product of 200 bp. RT-PCR amplifications were carried out using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermal cycler 480 as follows: 20–30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C followed by 15 min at 72 °C. Lower numbers of cycles were used to verify linearity of the amplification signal. 10 μl of the amplification product was analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Full-length cDNA encoding the whole open reading frame of p50 and p65 were inserted downstream of the T7 promoter into the pCRII TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). Coupled in vitro transcription/translation reactions were performed as described previously (24Lopez M. Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Dendorfer U. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3292-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These were performed as described previously (25Dube A. Akbarali Y. Sato T.N. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In brief, 2 μl of in vitro translation product and 0.1–0.2 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (5,000–20,000 cpm) in the presence or absence of competitor oligonucleotides (1 and 10 ng) were run on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing as buffer 0.5× TGE as described. Oligonucleotides used as probes and for competition studies are as follows: 1) murine PSP promoter wild type oligonucleotide, 5′-TCGACGAACATCCAGGAAATAGGGCTC-3′ and 3′-GCTTGTAGGTCCTTTATCCCGAGAGCT-5′; 2) NOS2 ETS site, 5′-GGCGACCAGGAAGAGATGG-3′ and 3′-CCATCTCTTCCTGGTCGCC-5′. A 1516- and 265-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides −1485 to +31 and −234 to +31 of the murineNOS2 gene promoter were subcloned into the PGL2 luciferase reporter (Promega) (26Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of theNOS2 promoter was performed using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, PCR primers encoding theNOS2 promoter ETS site, −190 to −180, and flanking sequences, with TTAA substituted for GGAA were used. PCR was performed with Turbo polymerase using the wild type NOS2 promoter luciferase reporter construct as a template. The PCR reaction was digested with Dpn I and the undigested plasmids were transformed into DH5α bacteria. Individual minipreps were sequenced to verify incorporation of the ETS site mutation. Cotransfections of 2 × 105 RAW cells or RASMCs were carried out with 0.6 μg of reporter gene construct DNA and 0.6 μg of expression vector DNA using 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (27Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5091-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 16 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity. Transfections for every construct were performed independently in duplicates and repeated 3 times with two different plasmid preparations with similar results. Cotransfection of a second plasmid for determination of transfection efficiency was omitted because potential artifacts with this technique have been reported and because many commonly used viral promoters contain potential binding sites for ETS factors (28Farr A. Roman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 920Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A series of GST-ESE-1 fusion proteins were generated by PCR with specific primers to contain in frame restriction enzyme sites and sequenced to confirm that there were no mutations introduced by the PCR. GST-ESE-1 fusion proteins were prepared as described previously (29Oettgen P. Finger E. Sun Z. Akbarali Y. Thamrongsak U. Boltax J. Grall F. Dube A. Weiss A. Brown L. Quinn G. Kas K. Endress G. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1216-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled and in vitro translated full-length p50 and p65 were incubated with equal amounts of GST-ESE-1 fusion proteins or GST on agarose beads in 200 μl of NETN (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Bound p50 or p65 proteins were then eluted after three washings with NETN buffer and analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The model used is as described previously (30Pellacani A. Chin M.T. Wiesel P. Ibanez M. Patel A. Yet S.F. Hsieh C.M. Paulauskis J.D. Reeves R. Lee M.E. Perrella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1525-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, C57/B6 mice were injected withSalmonella typhosa LPS (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Aortas were harvested at 4 h after injection, fixed, and stained for ESE-1 protein expression as described below. Using the models described above, the mice were euthanized after 4 h of LPS treatment, and the blood vessels were perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde via the left ventricle. Following fixation, the blood vessels were paraffin-embedded. Deparaffined 5-μm sections were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-ESE-1 antibody. The primary antibody was applied at a concentration of 1/200 for 1 h at room temperature and then left overnight at 4 °C. After washing, sections were incubated with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Vectastain ABC, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) at 1.5 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.4% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. After they were incubated with avidin, the sections were developed with a peroxidase 3,3′-diaminobenzadine kit (Vector Laboratories). The ESE-1 antibody was generated in our laboratory, and the NOS2 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. We have previously shown that under basal conditions ESE-1 expression is restricted to cells of epithelial origin (22Oettgen P. Carter K.C. Augustus M. Barcinski M. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Genomics. 1997; 445: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To examine whether ESE-1 could be induced in nonepithelial cells, ESE-1 expression was evaluated in human aortic smooth muscle cells, human umbilical endothelial cells, and the human monocyte-macrophage cell line (THP-1). As shown in Fig.1 A, ESE-1 expression is induced in response to the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and TNF-α and endotoxin. Interestingly, depending on the cell type, ESE-1 expression was induced as early as 1 h in the THP-1 cells to as late as 4 h in the human aortic smooth muscle cells. In all cells tested ESE-1 expression was almost completely absent by 24 h after stimulation, suggesting that ESE-1 expression in these cell types is strongly linked to stimulation by inflammatory stimuli. To confirm the results obtained by RT-PCR, we performed Northern blot analysis of ESE-1 using total RNA derived from human aortic smooth muscle cells stimulated with interleukin-1β. As shown in Fig. 1 B, ESE-1 expression is absent prior to induction with IL-1β, and expression peaks about 4 h after stimulation. We have previously isolated and characterized the humanESE-1 promoter (31Oettgen P. Barcinski M. Boltax J. Stolt P. Akbarali Y. Libermann T.A. Genomics. 1999; 55: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, the ESE-1 promoter contains a putative NF-κB-binding site, in addition to sites for other known transcription factors such as AP-1, ETS, and CRE. To test whether the ESE-1 promoter was responsive to an inflammatory stimulus, a luciferase reporter construct containing theESE-1 promoter was transfected into the mouse monocytic RAW 264.7 cell line. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the ESE-1 promoter is inducible to LPS in the RAW cells, and a mutation in the NF-κB-binding site significantly reduces the inducibility suggesting that binding of NF-κB or related Rel proteins is required for inducible ESE-1 expression (Fig. 2 C). The same results were obtained in the rat aortic smooth muscle cells (data not shown). To identify the specific proteins binding to the ESE-1 NF-κB site, EMSAs were performed using whole cell extracts derived from human aortic smooth muscle cells stimulated with IL-1β. As shown in Fig.3 A, Il-1β stimulation is associated with an inducible change in binding pattern to theESE-1 NF-κB-binding site. Interestingly, this binding occurs as early as 1 h, despite the fact that ESE-1 expression was only detected in Il-1β stimulated HASMCs at about 4 h. To identify the proteins specifically binding to this site, EMSAs were performed in the presence or absence of antisera to the different Rel family members. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the only two proteins recognized in this complex are p50 and p65. This suggests that the induction of ESE-1 is mediated by inducible binding of the dimeric NF-κB proteins p50 and p65 to the ESE-1 promoter. In an attempt to identify target genes for ESE-1, the ability of ESE-1 to transactivate the promoters of several genes that are induced in response to inflammatory stimuli were tested. As shown in Fig.4 A, ESE-1 significantly transactivates the NOS2 promoter (5-fold) but not E-selectin, CD44, or the interleukin-6 promoters. Transactivation of the ICAM-2 promoter by ESE-1 led to a 3.5-fold induction. The promoter of another gene, Flt-1, which is known to be regulated by ETS factors, Flt-1, but is not induced in response to inflammatory cytokines was used as another control was mildly induced by ESE-1. We have also recently identified the COX-2 gene as another target for ESE-1. 2F. Grall, X. Gu, L. Tan, T. Thamrongsak, B. Choy, C. Manning, Y. Akbarali, P. Stolt, S. Goldring, E. Gravallese, M. B. Goldring, P. Oettgen, and T. A. Libermann, submitted for publication. The NOS2 gene promoter has two important regulatory regions, one that is upstream (−1100 to −800) and one that is in the downstream region proximal to the transcription start site (−234 to +31). To test whether ESE-1 transactivation occurred principally through the upstream region or through the region near the transcription start site, cotransfections were performed with ESE-1 and reporter constructs encoding either a long fragment of the NOS2 promoter containing both regions or one containing just the downstream promoter region. As shown in Fig. 4 B, transactivation by ESE-1 was similar with both NOS2 promoter constructs tested, suggesting that most of transactivation by ESE-1 occurs through the promoter region near the transcription start site (−234 to +31). By having identified putative targets for ESE-1, we were also interested to determine whether ESE-1 could specifically bind to ETS sites within the NOS2 promoter. An ETS-binding site was identified that is highly homologous to the ETS consensus binding site for ESE-1 (33Oettgen P. Kas K. Dube A. Gu X. Grall F. Thamrongsak U. Akbarali Y. Finger E. Boltax J. Endress G. Munger K. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29439-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). By using in vitro translated ESE-1 protein, EMSA was performed comparing the potential binding of ESE-1 to the NOS2 ETS site with an ETS site in the epithelial specific PSP gene previously shown to bind to ESE-1 (33Oettgen P. Kas K. Dube A. Gu X. Grall F. Thamrongsak U. Akbarali Y. Finger E. Boltax J. Endress G. Munger K. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29439-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, ESE-1 binds equally well to both ETS sites. To determine the functional importance of the NOS2 promoter ESE-1-binding site (−190 to −180), site-directed mutagenesis of this site, substituting “TTAA” for the core “GGAA” sequence, was performed. Two independent constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The effect of this mutation upon the ability of ESE-1 to transactivate the mutated NOS2 promoter was first examined. As shown in Fig. 6 A, this mutation completely abolished the ability of ESE-1 to transactivate theNOS2 promoter. The functional importance of this mutation was next evaluated in the context of induction with an inflammatory stimulus. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the same mutation led to a 60% reduction in inducibility of the promoter with LPS. This reduction is similar to that seen with mutation of the NF-κB or OCT sites (34Perrella M.A. Pellacani A. Wiesel P. Chin M.T. Foster L.C. Ibanez M. Hsieh C.M. Reeves R. Yet S.F. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9045-9052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because p50 and p65 are also activated in response to inflammatory stimuli, we were interested to examine whether the interaction of the Rel domain proteins with ESE-1 has any functional effect upon transactivation. Cotransfection experiments with ESE-1, p50, and p65 were performed with the NOS2 promoter in RAW264.7 and rat aortic smooth muscle cells. As shown in Fig.7, although both ESE-1 and the combination of p50 and p65 were able to transactivate theNOS2 promoter, there was a marked synergistic response with the combination of p50, p65, and ESE-1 in both cell types tested. Thus, ESE-1 substantially augments the NF-κB-mediated transcriptional response to inflammatory stimuli. It has previously been shown that both ETS factors and HMG proteins are capable of binding to the Rel family members (35Bassuk A.G. Anandappa R.T. Leiden J.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3563-3573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Zhang X.M. Verdine G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20235-20243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding regions where these protein-protein interactions occur are within the DNA binding domain of both types of transcription factors. For the HMG(I)Y protein, this region of interaction has been precisely mapped within one of the A/T hook domains (36Zhang X.M. Verdine G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20235-20243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). There is significant protein sequence homology between the A/T hook domain of ESE-1 and the region responsible for binding with p50 in the HMG(I)Y protein. Although the ETS domain is known to interact with p50, the precise region within this domain has not been determined. To identify whether ESE-1 can bind to either the p50 or p65 Rel domain proteins, [35S]methionine-labeled p50 and p65 were generated byin vitro translation (See Fig.8 A). Several GST-ESE-1 fusion constructs and the GST protein alone were made. A diagram of the constructs is shown in Fig. 8 C. The GST fusion binding studies demonstrate that not only does the full-length ESE-1 protein bind to p50 but both the A/T hook and the ETS domain were capable of interacting with p50 (Fig. 8 B). In contrast, there was no significant binding of any of the constructs to p65 (data not shown). To examine the vascular expression of ESE-1 in response to an inflammatory stimulus, ESE-1 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis in a rodent model of endotoxemia in which marked vascular inflammation occurs within hours of endotoxin administration. As shown in Fig. 9, ESE-1 expression was markedly induced 4 h after exposure to endotoxin. Intense expression of ESE-1 is shown in the vascular endothelium (see arrows) and first layer of the vascular smooth muscle cells. Some expression is also evident in some of the other layers of vascular smooth muscle cells. In contrast, minimal to no ESE-1 expression was observed in the mouse aorta at base line. To determine whether ESE-1 has a similar expression pattern as NOS2 in this model of inflammation, we examined the same aortic specimens using a NOS2-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 9, NOS2 is expressed in the endothelium and first layer of vascular smooth muscle cells, similar to ESE-1 expression. These studies confirm the inducibility of ESE-1 in response to inflammatory stimuli, in vivo as well as in vitro, and further support the role of ESE-1 in regulating NOS2 expression. The ETS transcription factor family has been shown to regulate a wide variety of normal cellular responses, including cellular growth and differentiation. The promoters of several genes that are induced in response to inflammatory cytokines have conserved binding sites for ETS factors that are functionally important. The tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) gene promoter contains ETS-binding sites that are functionally important for inducibility by phorbol esters (37Kramer B. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6577-6583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Induction of JunB by interleukin-6 has been demonstrated to require binding to a conserved ETS site (38Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The induction of both the macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1α) and the chemokine regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed by inflammatory cytokines has been shown to be at least in part"

Here, we report the identification of four new Cdc42-binding proteins that, along with MSE55, constitute a new family of effector proteins. These molecules, designated CEPs, contain three regions of homology, including a Cdc42 binding domain and two unique domains called CI and CII. Experimentally, we have verified that CEP2 and CEP5 bind Cdc42. Expression of CEP2, CEP3, CEP4, and CEP5 in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts induced pseudopodia formation. Fibroblasts coexpressing dominant negative Cdc42 with CEP2 or expressing a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain mutant of CEP2 did not induce pseudopodia formation. In primary keratinocytes, CEP2- and CEP5-expressing cells showed reduced F-actin localization at the adherens junctions with an increase in thin stress fibers that extended the length of the cell body. Keratinocytes expressing CEPs also showed an altered vinculin distribution and a loss of E-cadherin from adherens junctions. Similar effects were observed in keratinocytes expressing constitutively active Cdc42, but were not seen with a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain mutant of CEP2. These results suggest that CEPs act downstream of Cdc42 to induce actin filament assembly leading to cell shape changes.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Cdc42 regulates actin polymerization to induce the assembly of filopodia, which are thin actin filaments that project from cells (2Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

As to its role in cell polarity, Cdc42 regulates polarization of Drosophila wing epithelial cells by inducing actin polymerization at the apical cortex of these cells (6Eaton S. Wepf R. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Cdc42 regulates a number of polarized responses, including actin localization (7Clayton L. Hall A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that Cdc42 regulates cell shape and polarity changes by coordinating actin changes with altered cell membrane assembly.The ability of Cdc42 to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell polarity in mammalian cells stems from its interaction with a large number of downstream effector proteins (14Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). One such effector protein, N-WASP, induces actin polymerization leading to filopodia formation (15Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). N-WASP mediates these actin changes by directly binding actin (15Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), the Arp2/3 complex (16Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The p21-activated protein kinases (PAK)1 also mediate actin reorganization required for filopodia formation (18Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Unlike N-WASP, PAKs mediate their biological activities by phosphorylating a number of cytoskeletal targets (20Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 21Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H. Otey C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Despite what is known about Cdc42 and effector interactions, the molecular details of how Cdc42 regulates actin and cell polarity changes in different cell types are only beginning to emerge.We recently characterized MSE55 as a nonkinase Cdc42 effector that mediates actin reorganization leading to the formation of pseudopodia (24Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify four additional proteins CEP2, CEP3, CEP4, and CEP5 that share homology with MSE55. These proteins contain a CRIB domain that is homologous to that of MSE55 (24Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Two other domains, designated CI and CII, are also found in MSE55/CEP1, CEP2, CEP3, and CEP4, whereas CEP5 lacks a CI domain but instead contains a proline-rich region. Using in vitro binding assays, CEP2 and CEP5 interacted with Cdc42, but not Rac. Similar to our previous results with MSE55 (24Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), expression of all the CEP members induced long pseudopodia in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. In contrast, only background levels of pseudopodia were observed in fibroblasts expressing a CRIB mutant of CEP2 or coexpressing dominant negative Cdc42 with CEP2. In primary keratinocytes, expression of Cdc42-Q61L, CEP2, and CEP5 all decreased F-actin staining in the adherens junction, but increased the number of cytoplasmic actin stress fibers. Unlike Rho-induced stress fibers, the cytoplasmic stress fibers seen in the Cdc42- and CEP-expressing cells were greater in number, were thinner, and transversed the entire cell body. In many cases, keratinocytes expressing CEPs also showed cell elongation in the direction of the actin filaments. These results suggest that CEPs act downstream of Cdc42 to induce actin filament assembly leading to cell shape changes.DISCUSSIONHere we report the structure and function of a new family of Cdc42 effector proteins that we have called CEPs. This family contains five members: CEP1/MSE55, CEP2, CEP3, CEP4, and CEP5. CEP1 through CEP4 all contain a previously identified CRIB domain (25Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) and two new domains, designated CI and CII. CEP5 is structurally different because it lacks a CI domain. Transfection experiments indicate that CEPs induce actin reorganization and cell shape changes that lead to pseudopodia formation in fibroblasts. Interestingly, pseudopodia normally occur in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and are increased in cells overexpressing v-Fos (39Lamb R.F. Ozanne B.W. Roy C. McGarry L. Stipp C. Mangeat P. Jay D.G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 682-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), CD-44 (40Lamb R.F. Hennigan R.F. Turnbull K. Katsanakis K.D. MacKenzie E.D. Birnie G.D. Ozanne B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 963-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), or an F-actin-bundling protein (41Spence H.J. Johnston I. Ewart K. Buchanan S.J. Fitzgerald U. Ozanne B.W. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the biological relevance of the CEP-induced pseudopodia with relation to Cdc42 signaling is still unclear, there are several possible explanations. The CEP-induced pseudopodia in fibroblasts may represent an exaggerated activity of these molecules, producing a phenotype that is not generally observed with endogenous levels of CEPs. Previous studies have shown that inducible recruitment of Cdc42 to the membrane induces a single filopodium (42Castellano F. Montcourrier P. Guillemot J.C. Gouin E. Machesky L. Cossart P. Chavrier P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 351-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) rather than the array of filopodia that is conventionally seen with expression of wild type Cdc42. Based on these findings, CEPs might function in fibroblasts at specific membrane sites resulting in a net effect of directed membrane protrusion. CEPs may also represent targets of other Cdc42-related GTPases that normally function in fibroblasts to generate pseudopodia formation rather than filopodia formation. Consistent with this model, Cdc42 homologues such as TC10 (43Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Tatsis N. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TCL (44Vignal E. De Toledo M. Comunale F. Landopoulou A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Blangy A. Fort B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36457-36464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) interact with CRIB-containing proteins in vitro and induce actin structures that are distinct from Cdc42.Recently Joberty et al. (30Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) identified and characterized a set of Cdc42-binding proteins, termed Borgs, which are identical to the CEPs. Although they observed similar morphological changes following overexpression in fibroblasts, they suggested that Borgs/CEPs function to inhibit Rho activity, leading to the production of retraction fibers. Our results are difficult to reconcile with this retraction fiber model. First, CEP-induced pseudopodia and retraction fibers are morphologically distinct and are formed in different ways. Retraction fibers appear as dendritic-like processes (45Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and are formed following collapse of the cytoskeletal architecture. The pseudopodia formed in our studies were produced by an active process leading to the formation of single or bipolar membrane protrusions, as visualized by time-lapse videography (24Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The CEP-induced pseudopodia are also not dendritic-like, but are limited to one or two extensions per cell without much branching. CEP-expressing cells did not show cell body rounding or collapse, which is normally seen in cells exhibiting retraction fibers. Second, in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, CEPs had no noticeable effect on stress fiber formation. Third, we were unable to reproduce the finding (30Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that coexpression of constitutively active Rho reverses CEP-induced morphological changes in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. 2D. S. Hirsch and P. D. Burbelo, unpublished data. The reason for this is unknown, but could be due to differences in cell culture conditions. Fourth, in keratinocytes, CEPs induced thin actin stress fibers that were similar to what was observed following transfection with an activated mutant of Cdc42. Thus, we propose an alternative model in which CEPs, acting as classical Cdc42 effector molecules, increase actin filament assembly to cause cell shape changes.Although less is known about the function of Rho GTPases in epithelial cells as compared with fibroblasts, recent studies indicate that they function in the assembly of adherens junctions (36Kodama A. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3996-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Stoffler H.-E. Honnert U. Bauer C.A. Hofer D. Schwarz H. Muller R.T.

For example, overexpression of constitutively active Rho or Rac in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells increases F-actin at the adherens junctions while dominant negative constructs block the formation of adherens junctions (46Braga V.M.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 47Jou T.-S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Likewise, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells overexpressing constitutively active Cdc42 show increased F-actin at adherens junctions along with other associated molecules such as β-catenin and E-cadherin (36Kodama A. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3996-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Stoffler H.-E. Honnert U. Bauer C.A. Hofer D. Schwarz H. Muller R.T. Drenckhahn D. Bahler M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies using primary keratinocytes implicate CEPs in Cdc42-mediated assembly of thin actin stress fibers that extend across the cell body length. The phenotype observed here with both Cdc42 and CEPs resembles that of early stage adherens junction formation, where actin filaments radiate across the cell body to drive adherens junction formation and would have been missed using immortalized epithelial cells (38Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Although Cdc42-Q61L and CEPs induced the formation of fine actin stress fibers, Rho induced short stress fibers with thicker actin bundles. Vinculin staining in the Cdc42- and CEP-expressing cells was also less prominent than in Rho-expressing cells. These results are in agreement with studies in fibroblasts, demonstrating that Cdc42 and Rho induce distinct actin and focal adhesion reorganization (3Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). CEPs and Cdc42 also interfered with E-cadherin localization to adherens junctions thus providing further support that they may function in actin reorganization during the early stages of adherens junction formation.In fibroblasts and keratinocytes, CEP-induced actin changes were dependent on Cdc42. In NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, coexpression of dominant negative Cdc42 with CEP2 or expression of a CEP2 CRIB mutant blocked pseudopodia formation. Similarly, CEP2-induced cytoskeletal and morphological changes were also abrogated in keratinocytes expressing the CEP2-CRIB mutant. Based on these observations, we propose a model in which Cdc42 binding to the CRIB domain of CEPs induces conformational changes leading to exposure of the previously inaccessible CI, CII, and/or other domains. Further clues to the normal function of these molecules may come from the observation that the Drosophila CRIB-containing ACK-like tyrosine kinase , DPR2 /DACK, also contains a CII-like domain downstream of a similar CRIB domain and functions to phosphorylate a SH3-containing adapter molecule (31Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). These results suggest the possibility that the CII domain recruits additional actin-binding proteins or other signaling molecules and/or acts as an autoinhibitory domain as seen in the WASP proteins (48Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In the case of CEP5, we propose that the unique proline-like adapter sequences replace the function of the CI domain to induce similar biological activities. Like the proline-rich sequences found in N-WASP (17Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), these sequences may bind profilin and/or SH3-containing molecules. Cdc42 is a member of the p21 Rho family of small GTPases that act downstream of cell surface receptors to regulate the formation of different F-actin-containing structures (1Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Cdc42 regulates actin polymerization to induce the assembly of filopodia, which are thin actin filaments that project from cells (2Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 3Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). Cdc42 can also regulate other biological processes such as cytokinesis (4Dutartre H. Davoust J. Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 367-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Drechsel D.N.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). As to its role in cell polarity, Cdc42 regulates polarization of Drosophila wing epithelial cells by inducing actin polymerization at the apical cortex of these cells (6Eaton S. Wepf R. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Cdc42 regulates a number of polarized responses, including actin localization (7Clayton L. Hall A. Johnson M.H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 205: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Stowers L. Yelon D. Berg L.J. Chant J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that Cdc42 regulates cell shape and polarity changes by coordinating actin changes with altered cell membrane assembly. The ability of Cdc42 to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell polarity in mammalian cells stems from its interaction with a large number of downstream effector proteins (14Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). One such effector protein, N-WASP, induces actin polymerization leading to filopodia formation (15Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). N-WASP mediates these actin changes by directly binding actin (15Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), the Arp2/3 complex (16Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar), and by interacting with the actin-binding protein profilin (17Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The p21-activated protein kinases (PAK)1 also mediate actin reorganization required for filopodia formation (18Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 19Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Unlike N-WASP, PAKs mediate their biological activities by phosphorylating a number of cytoskeletal targets (20Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 21Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H. Otey C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Despite what is known about Cdc42 and effector interactions, the molecular details of how Cdc42 regulates actin and cell polarity changes in different cell types are only beginning to emerge. We recently characterized MSE55 as a nonkinase Cdc42 effector that mediates actin reorganization leading to the formation of pseudopodia (24Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify four additional proteins CEP2, CEP3, CEP4, and CEP5 that share homology with MSE55. These proteins contain a CRIB domain that is homologous to that of MSE55 (24Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Two other domains, designated CI and CII, are also found in MSE55/CEP1, CEP2, CEP3, and CEP4, whereas CEP5 lacks a CI domain but instead contains a proline-rich region. Using in vitro binding assays, CEP2 and CEP5 interacted with Cdc42, but not Rac. Similar to our previous results with MSE55 (24Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), expression of all the CEP members induced long pseudopodia in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. In contrast, only background levels of pseudopodia were observed in fibroblasts expressing a CRIB mutant of CEP2 or coexpressing dominant negative Cdc42 with CEP2. In primary keratinocytes, expression of Cdc42-Q61L, CEP2, and CEP5 all decreased F-actin staining in the adherens junction, but increased the number of cytoplasmic actin stress fibers. Unlike Rho-induced stress fibers, the cytoplasmic stress fibers seen in the Cdc42- and CEP-expressing cells were greater in number, were thinner, and transversed the entire cell body. In many cases, keratinocytes expressing CEPs also showed cell elongation in the direction of the actin filaments. These results suggest that CEPs act downstream of Cdc42 to induce actin filament assembly leading to cell shape changes. DISCUSSIONHere we report the structure and function of a new family of Cdc42 effector proteins that we have called CEPs. This family contains five members: CEP1/MSE55, CEP2, CEP3, CEP4, and CEP5. CEP1 through CEP4 all contain a previously identified CRIB domain (25Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) and two new domains, designated CI and CII. CEP5 is structurally different because it lacks a CI domain. Transfection experiments indicate that CEPs induce actin reorganization and cell shape changes that lead to pseudopodia formation in fibroblasts. Interestingly, pseudopodia normally occur in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and are increased in cells overexpressing v-Fos (39Lamb R.F. Ozanne B.W. Roy C. McGarry L. Stipp C. Mangeat P. Jay D.G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 682-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), CD-44 (40Lamb R.F. Hennigan R.F. Turnbull K. Katsanakis K.D. MacKenzie E.D. Birnie G.D. Ozanne B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 963-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), or an F-actin-bundling protein (41Spence H.J. Johnston I. Ewart K. Buchanan S.J. Fitzgerald U. Ozanne B.W. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the biological relevance of the CEP-induced pseudopodia with relation to Cdc42 signaling is still unclear, there are several possible explanations. The CEP-induced pseudopodia in fibroblasts may represent an exaggerated activity of these molecules, producing a phenotype that is not generally observed with endogenous levels of CEPs. Previous studies have shown that inducible recruitment of Cdc42 to the membrane induces a single filopodium (42Castellano F. Montcourrier P. Guillemot J.C. Gouin E. Machesky L. Cossart P. Chavrier P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 351-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) rather than the array of filopodia that is conventionally seen with expression of wild type Cdc42. Based on these findings, CEPs might function in fibroblasts at specific membrane sites resulting in a net effect of directed membrane protrusion. CEPs may also represent targets of other Cdc42-related GTPases that normally function in fibroblasts to generate pseudopodia formation rather than filopodia formation. Consistent with this model, Cdc42 homologues such as TC10 (43Neudauer C.L. Joberty G. Tatsis N. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TCL (44Vignal E. De Toledo M. Comunale F. Landopoulou A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Blangy A. Fort B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36457-36464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) interact with CRIB-containing proteins in vitro and induce actin structures that are distinct from Cdc42.Recently Joberty et al. (30Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) identified and characterized a set of Cdc42-binding proteins, termed Borgs, which are identical to the CEPs. Although they observed similar morphological changes following overexpression in fibroblasts, they suggested that Borgs/CEPs function to inhibit Rho activity, leading to the production of retraction fibers. Our results are difficult to reconcile with this retraction fiber model. First, CEP-induced pseudopodia and retraction fibers are morphologically distinct and are formed in different ways. Retraction fibers appear as dendritic-like processes (45Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and are formed following collapse of the cytoskeletal architecture. The pseudopodia formed in our studies were produced by an active process leading to the formation of single or bipolar membrane protrusions, as visualized by time-lapse videography (24Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The CEP-induced pseudopodia are also not dendritic-like, but are limited to one or two extensions per cell without much branching. CEP-expressing cells did not show cell body rounding or collapse, which is normally seen in cells exhibiting retraction fibers. Second, in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, CEPs had no noticeable effect on stress fiber formation. Third, we were unable to reproduce the finding (30Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that coexpression of constitutively active Rho reverses CEP-induced morphological changes in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. 2D. S. Hirsch and P. D. Burbelo, unpublished data. The reason for this is unknown, but could be due to differences in cell culture conditions. Fourth, in keratinocytes, CEPs induced thin actin stress fibers that were similar to what was observed following transfection with an activated mutant of Cdc42. Thus, we propose an alternative model in which CEPs, acting as classical Cdc42 effector molecules, increase actin filament assembly to cause cell shape changes.Although less is known about the function of Rho GTPases in epithelial cells as compared with fibroblasts, recent studies indicate that they function in the assembly of adherens junctions (36Kodama A. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3996-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Stoffler H.-E. Honnert U. Bauer C.A. Hofer D. Schwarz H. Muller R.T.

For example, overexpression of constitutively active Rho or Rac in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells increases F-actin at the adherens junctions while dominant negative constructs block the formation of adherens junctions (46Braga V.M.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 47Jou T.-S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Likewise, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells overexpressing constitutively active Cdc42 show increased F-actin at adherens junctions along with other associated molecules such as β-catenin and E-cadherin (36Kodama A. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3996-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Stoffler H.-E. Honnert U. Bauer C.A. Hofer D. Schwarz H. Muller R.T. Drenckhahn D. Bahler M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies using primary keratinocytes implicate CEPs in Cdc42-mediated assembly of thin actin stress fibers that extend across the cell body length. The phenotype observed here with both Cdc42 and CEPs resembles that of early stage adherens junction formation, where actin filaments radiate across the cell body to drive adherens junction formation and would have been missed using immortalized epithelial cells (38Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Although Cdc42-Q61L and CEPs induced the formation of fine actin stress fibers, Rho induced short stress fibers with thicker actin bundles. Vinculin staining in the Cdc42- and CEP-expressing cells was also less prominent than in Rho-expressing cells. These results are in agreement with studies in fibroblasts, demonstrating that Cdc42 and Rho induce distinct actin and focal adhesion reorganization (3Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar).

Based on these observations, we propose a model in which Cdc42 binding to the CRIB domain of CEPs induces conformational changes leading to exposure of the previously inaccessible CI, CII, and/or other domains. Further clues to the normal function of these molecules may come from the observation that the Drosophila CRIB-containing ACK-like tyrosine kinase , DPR2 /DACK, also contains a CII-like domain downstream of a similar CRIB domain and functions to phosphorylate a SH3-containing adapter molecule (31Clemens J.C.

These results suggest the possibility that the CII domain recruits additional actin-binding proteins or other signaling molecules and/or acts as an autoinhibitory domain as seen in the WASP proteins (48Kim A.S.

For example, overexpression of constitutively active Rho or Rac in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells increases F-actin at the adherens junctions while dominant negative constructs block the formation of adherens junctions (46Braga V.M.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 47Jou T.-S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Likewise, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells overexpressing constitutively active Cdc42 show increased F-actin at adherens junctions along with other associated molecules such as β-catenin and E-cadherin (36Kodama A. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3996-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Stoffler H.-E. Honnert U. Bauer C.A. Hofer D. Schwarz H. Muller R.T. Drenckhahn D. Bahler M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies using primary keratinocytes implicate CEPs in Cdc42-mediated assembly of thin actin stress fibers that extend across the cell body length. The phenotype observed here with both Cdc42 and CEPs resembles that of early stage adherens junction formation, where actin filaments radiate across the cell body to drive adherens junction formation and would have been missed using immortalized epithelial cells (38Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Although Cdc42-Q61L and CEPs induced the formation of fine actin stress fibers, Rho induced short stress fibers with thicker actin bundles. Vinculin staining in the Cdc42- and CEP-expressing cells was also less prominent than in Rho-expressing cells. These results are in agreement with studies in fibroblasts, demonstrating that Cdc42 and Rho induce distinct actin and focal adhesion reorganization (3Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). CEPs and Cdc42 also interfered with E-cadherin localization to adherens junctions thus providing further support that they may function in actin reorganization during the early stages of adherens junction formation. In fibroblasts and keratinocytes, CEP-induced actin changes were dependent on Cdc42. In NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, coexpression of dominant negative Cdc42 with CEP2 or expression of a CEP2 CRIB mutant blocked pseudopodia formation. Similarly, CEP2-induced cytoskeletal and morphological changes were also abrogated in keratinocytes expressing the CEP2-CRIB mutant. Based on these observations, we propose a model in which Cdc42 binding to the CRIB domain of CEPs induces conformational changes leading to exposure of the previously inaccessible CI, CII, and/or other domains. Further clues to the normal function of these molecules may come from the observation that the Drosophila CRIB-containing ACK-like tyrosine kinase , DPR2 /DACK, also contains a CII-like domain downstream of a similar CRIB domain and functions to phosphorylate a SH3-containing adapter molecule (31Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). These results suggest the possibility that the CII domain recruits additional actin-binding proteins or other signaling molecules and/or acts as an autoinhibitory domain as seen in the WASP proteins (48Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In the case of CEP5, we propose that the unique proline-like adapter sequences replace the function of the CI domain to induce similar biological activities. Like the proline-rich sequences found in N-WASP (17Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), these sequences may bind profilin and/or SH3-containing molecules.

In contrast, mutation of the exposed hydrophobic side chains had a less severe effect on DNA binding. This suggests that the Arg-111 side chain may contribute to sequence-specific recognition of the CpG site rather than simply making nonspecific contacts with the phosphate backbone.

A family of methyl-CpG binding proteins, which are thought to mediate the biological consequences of DNA methylation, has been identified and characterized (1Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), of which the founder member is the transcriptional repressor MeCP2. These proteins contain a conservedmethyl-CpG binding domain (MBD),1 which is 70–75 amino acids in length and exhibits 50–70% similarity between the proteins. The MBD of MeCP2 is necessary and sufficient for DNA binding in vitro and allows MeCP2 to recognize a single symmetrically methylated CpG dinucleotide in diverse sequence contexts (2Nan X. Meehan R.R. Bird A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 25: 4886-4892Crossref Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Of the other MBD-containing proteins, MBD1 and MBD2 also bind to single symmetrically methylated CpG dinucleotides in vitro and act as transcriptional repressors (3Ng H.-H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1394-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Repression by MeCP2 can act at a distance from a promoter and involves the targeting of histone deacetylases via a C-terminal transcription repression domain, which interacts with the corepressor mSin3 (5Nan X.

Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar), although a deacetylase-independent mechanism may also contribute to repression (5Nan X. Ng H.-H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D.

Targeting of histone deacetylases is probably also important in transcriptional repression by MBD1 and MBD2 (3Ng H.-H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 53-61Crossref Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 4Ng H.-H. Jeppesen P. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1394-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Mammalian MBD3 is found in a histone deacetylase complex, the Mi-2 or NuRD complex (8Zhang Y. Ng H.-H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), but does not bind specifically to methylated DNA in vitro and is not localized to methylated chromosomal regions in vivo (1Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). MBD4 is probably a methyl-CpG-TpG mismatch-specific glycosylase (9Hendrich B. Hardeland U. Ng H.-H. Jiricny J. Bird A. Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Recently, an indication of the role of MeCP2 in human development has been provided by the linking of mutations in the MeCP2 gene to the human neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (10Amir R.E. Van den Veyver I.B. Wan M. Tran C.Q. Francke U. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3859) Google Scholar). This disorder is a childhood-onset regressive disease that causes loss of speech and hand movement, coupled with autistic behavior, microencephaly, and growth retardation and affects one in every 10,000–15,000 live female births (11Hagberg B. Aicardi J. Dias K. Ramos O. Ann. Neurol. 1983; 14: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar, 12Hendrich B. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 60-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations found in the DNA of Rett syndrome patients include frameshift mutations generating truncations within the MBD, the transcription repression domain, or the C terminus of MeCP2, nonsense mutations preceding and immediately downstream of the MBD or within the transcription repression domain, or most interestingly, missense mutations within the MBD and transcription repression domain domains (10Amir R.E.

J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is of particular interest to determine what effects this latter class of mutations might have on the ability of the MeCP2 protein to carry out its functions of methylated DNA binding and transcriptional repression. We have recently solved the solution structure of the MeCP2 MBD by NMR spectroscopy (19Wakefield R.I.D. Smith B.O. Nan X. Free A. Soteriou A. Uhrin D. Bird A.P. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The domain has a novel fold that forms a wedge-shaped structure, comprising an N-terminal four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet on one face of the wedge and a C-terminal α-helix and small turn on the other face. At the thin end of the wedge, a large, flexible loop region (the B-C loop) between the second and third β-strands appears, together with the exposed faces of the second, third, and fourth β-strands (strands B, C, and D), to form a binding surface for methylated DNA. Based on this information and the surface of the DNA binding region mapped by NMR studies, a model was proposed in which a conserved solvent-accessible hydrophobic patch composed of the side chains of Tyr-123, Ile-125, and possibly Ala-131 might recognize the methyl groups of the methylated cytosine residues in the major groove (19Wakefield R.I.D. Smith B.O. Nan X. Free A. Soteriou A. Uhrin D. Bird A.P. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A second NMR study on the MBD of the related repressor MBD1 (20Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6653-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) revealed a highly similar fold, suggesting that all the MBD-containing proteins are likely to recognize DNA in an equivalent manner. These authors also proposed a similar model for DNA recognition and confirmed that mutations in the conserved tyrosine and charged side chains within the binding face affected methyl-DNA recognition in mobility shift assays. In this study, we have employed rationally designed site-directed mutant proteins in quantitative mobility shifts to test more thoroughly the model for DNA recognition by the MBD domain of MeCP2. In particular, we have defined the critical role of surface-exposed residues and the large flexible loop on the DNA binding face of the protein in recognition of methylated DNA. In contrast, we find that the conserved hydrophobic side chains in the binding face play a less crucial role in the interaction. We have also investigated the effects that certain missense mutations within the MeCP2 MBD associated with Rett syndrome have on the folding of the domain and on DNA binding and have used our structural information on the MBD to account for the phenotypic effects of a number of such mutations. This leads us to propose that the majority of missense mutations within the MeCP2 MBD associated with Rett syndrome affect the ability of the domain to interact with methylated CpG dinucleotides via a disruption of the domain fold rather than direct mutation of side chains involved in DNA recognition. The MeCP2 MBD was amplified from the plasmid pET6HMBD (21Cross S.H. Charlton J.A. Nan X. Bird A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-CTAGCAGCCATGGCCTCTGCTTCTCCCAAACA-3′ and 5′-CTAGCAGGATCCTTACCCTCTCCCAGTTACAGTGA-3′, and the resulting amplification product was digested with Nco I andBam HI and cloned intoNco I-Bam HI-digested pET6H to generate pAFB105. This plasmid therefore encodes residues 77–164 of MeCP2 with the heterologous N-terminal sequence MHHHHHHAM. The portion of MeCP2 encoded is that previously defined as the minimum required for recognition of methyl-CpG (2Nan X. Meehan R.R. Bird A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 25: 4886-4892Crossref Scopus (493) Google Scholar) and is identical to that used for determination of the NMR structure of the MBD (19Wakefield R.I.D. Smith B.O. Nan X. Free A. Soteriou A. Uhrin D. Bird A.P. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) except that it lacks the heterologous, unstructured C-terminal residues GSGC. To generate site-directed mutants of the MBD, the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) was employed with 20–25-mer primers and pAFB105 as a template, according to the manufacturer's instructions. An overnight culture of a fresh transformant of Escherichia coli BL21 (λDE3)/pLysS was diluted 1:100 into 1 liter of LB medium and grown at 37 °C to anA 600 of 0.5, whereupon the cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and grown for 3 h more. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, 0.1 m NaCl, harvested again, and resuspended in binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Cells were lysed by sonication, and debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 20 min. Clarified supernatants were loaded onto 10 ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow-agarose columns (Qiagen) equilibrated with binding buffer, washed with 2 × 10 ml binding buffer plus 30 mm imidazole, and eluted with 5 ml of binding buffer plus 0.5 m imidazole. Elution fractions were loaded onto 10 ml Fractogel EMD SO32− 650(M) columns (Merck), washed with 2 × 10 ml binding buffer, and step-eluted with 5 ml of binding buffer plus 0.25 m NaCl followed by 5 ml of binding buffer plus 0.5 m NaCl; the majority of the protein eluted in the first of these fractions. The pooled eluates were dialyzed against 2 liters of 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and the resulting material was >95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were quantified by the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). For the production of labeled protein for NMR spectroscopy, cells were grown instead in M9 medium supplemented with 0.4% (w/v) glucose and 1.5 g/liter [15N](NH4)2SO4 and induced as above. Protein from the harvested cells was purified as above, except that binding buffer lacking both Triton X-100 and imidazole was used. The eluates from the Fractogel column were buffer-exchanged into 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl and concentrated to a final concentration of ≈1 mm. A double-stranded 27-mer oligonucleotide pair, symmetrically methylated (mC) at a single site on each strand (5′-TCAGATTCGCGCmCGGCTGCGATAAGCT-3′ and its reverse complement; Ref. 1Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) was end-labeled with digoxygenin-dideoxy-UTP using an oligonucleotide end-labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An unmethylated version of the same oligonucleotide pair was labeled similarly. Purified proteins were incubated with 2 nmlabeled duplex oligonucleotide plus 50 ng/μl poly[d(A-T)] (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as a nonspecific competitor in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2% Tween® 20, 30 mm KCl in a final volume of 30 μl at room temperature for 15 min. Loading buffer (60% 0.25× Tris-borate EDTA (TBE), 40% glycerol; 7.5 μl) was added, and the samples were electrophoresed on pre-run 0.25× TBE, 6% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide-bisacrylamide) gels at 250 V for 3.5 h in 0.25× TBE buffer at 4 °C. Gels were blotted onto Hybond-N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.25× TBE buffer overnight, and the membranes were fixed by UV cross-linking followed by baking at 80 °C for 10 min. Digoxygenin-labeled probes were detected using a nonradioactive DNA detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Scanned images were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Spectra were collected on a 1 mm sample in 90% H2O, 10% D2O at 18 °C in a 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 6.0. Two-dimensional 15N-HSQC and three-dimensional15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometers using 5-mm probes. All NMR data were processed with the AZARA package (see the CCPN website at the University of Cambridge) with the application of an 80° sinebell-squared window function. ANSIG (22Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar, 23Kraulis P.J. Domaille P.J. Campbell-Burk S.L. Van Aken T. Laue E.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (3331): 3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) was used to display spectra and maintain cross-peak lists for resonance assignment. The resonance assignment for wild-type MBD of MeCP2 was described previously (19Wakefield R.I.D. Smith B.O. Nan X. Free A. Soteriou A. Uhrin D. Bird A.P. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). By overlaying two-dimensional 15N-HSQC spectra collected on mutant MeCP2 MBD proteins, it was possible to assign the majority of peaks. Backbone1HN and 15N atoms of the G114P mutant were sequence-specifically assigned from three-dimensional15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments (75-ms mixing time) on the mutant. The chemical shift perturbations for assigned peaks were quantitatively measured using weighted averaging δAv = ([δHN2 + (δN/5)2]½), where δAv is the weighted average shift difference, and δHN and δN are the differences in ppm between wild-type and mutant chemical shifts. The ratio of 15N heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effects obtained from experiments with a 3.01-ms saturation pulse and without a saturation pulse was used to probe the backbone dynamics of the G114P MBD mutant (24Stone M.J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Reizer J. Saier M.E. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4394-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We generated a set of point mutations within the MBD that included solvent-exposed charged and hydrophobic residues, core residues, and side chains predicted to be important for the conformation of the peptide backbone within the domain (TableI). These mutant proteins were assayed for binding to a methylated 27-mer duplex oligonucleotide containing a single, symmetrically methylated CpG dinucleotide (see “Experimental Procedures”) at fixed protein and DNA concentrations of 30 and 2 nm, respectively. At this protein concentration, the wild-type MBD is >80% bound. As quantified in Table I, the mutant proteins exhibited a range of binding activities from severely compromised to wild-type affinity; none of the mutants nor the wild type showed any affinity for the unmethylated oligonucleotide under these conditions (data not shown). Of the mutations causing a significant reduction in DNA binding, the G114P and D121A or D121E mutants were of particular interest. Gly-114 is located at the tip of the disordered B-C loop, which otherwise seems fairly amenable to substitution (see K112M and S113A, Table I). Residue Asp-121, which we had previously predicted to be involved in bridging interactions with arginine side chains on the DNA binding face (19Wakefield R.I.D. Smith B.O. Nan X. Free A. Soteriou A. Uhrin D. Bird A.P. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), was shown to be critical for binding, as its mutation to alanine or even glutamate severely affected the DNA interaction. The mutation S134A was also seen to cause a moderate reduction in binding affinity. Ser-134 was found to be mutated to cysteine in cases of Rett syndrome (14Bienvenu T. Carrie A. de Roux N. Vinet M.C. Jonveaux P. Couvert P. Villard L. Arzimanoglou A. Beldjord C. Fontes M. Tardieu M. Chelly J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1377-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 16Huppke P. Laccone F. Kramer N. Engel W. Hanefeld F. Hum. Mol.

Open table in a new tab N/A, not applicable. As noted above, a mutation of residue Gly-114 within the disordered B-C loop region to proline had a major effect on DNA binding (Table I). This is in contrast to the mild effects of other mutations within this loop examined, including the adjacent S113A. The replacement of the flexible residue glycine with a structurally constrained proline is predicted to preclude certain conformations of the B-C loop when the MBD domain binds to DNA. To quantify the magnitude of the effect of this change on binding, we carried out a quantitative EMSA analysis with the G114P mutant (Fig.1 A). Minimal binding (10%) was detectable at the highest protein concentration used (128 nm), indicating that binding was ≈25-fold weaker than that of the wild-type MBD, which showed 10% binding at ≈5 nm protein under these conditions. Thus it appears that flexibility in the B-C loop region is a critical component of DNA recognition by the MBD, possibly reflecting the ability of this region to fit into the major groove of DNA and make multiple contacts with the phosphate backbone (19Wakefield R.I.D. Smith B.O. Nan X. Free A. Soteriou A. Uhrin D. Bird A.P. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional 15N-HSQC NMR analysis of the structure of the G114P mutant indicated major changes in the loop region from residues 110–121, consistent with the structural constraint of this loop as a result of the mutation (Fig.1 B). In contrast, the structure of the rest of the MBD remained unaffected, indicating that the overall fold remained intact as predicted. However, analysis of the backbone dynamics of the loop region in the G114P mutant revealed that it is still relatively disordered (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that the proline substitution precludes specific conformations rather than imposing a general reduction in flexibility. It is also possible that the proline substitution introduces a steric clash with the DNA in the mutant. Either possibility is, however, inconsistent with “docking models” that show a lack of close contact between the B-C loop and the target DNA (20Ohki I. Shimotake N. Fujita N. Nakao M. Shirakawa M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6653-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Ballestar E. Yusufzai T.M. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7100-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Instead, we suggest that an induced conformational change in this region of the protein upon DNA interaction contributes to the binding affinity. Because the mutagenesis screen suggested that residue Asp-121 was particularly critical for DNA binding and it had previously been suggested that this side chain might form an important bridging interaction with the Arg-111 or Arg-133 side chains (19Wakefield R.I.D. Smith B.O. Nan X. Free A. Soteriou A. Uhrin D. Bird A.P. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the D121A mutant was compared with the wild-type domain by two-dimensional 15N-HSQC NMR spectroscopy. An analysis of the backbone amide chemical shift differences between the wild-type and mutant proteins for residues throughout the domain (Fig.2 A) showed that this mutation causes significant changes in the environment of the B-C loop region and toward the C terminus of the domain, which folds on top of strand C, of which Asp-121 is a part. Moreover, the Arg-111 backbone amide could not be assigned in the mutant by two-dimensional15N-HSQC, whereas the Arg-133 chemical shift was not greatly affected. Likewise, the Arg-111 side chain Hεatoms were significantly perturbed by the D121A mutation and moved from an abnormal chemical shift to a position in the spectrum occupied by the majority of arginine side chain Hε atoms (Fig.2 B). This suggests that the primary interaction of Asp-121 is with Arg-111 and that the effect of the D121A and D121E mutations on DNA binding may largely be due to the abolition of this interaction given the critical role of Arg-111 in DNA binding (see below). It seems probable that the Asp-121–Arg-111 interaction positions the basic arginine side chain so that it can interact correctly with the DNA target. We mutated the Arg-111 residue of the MeCP2 MBD to glycine (TableII) and examined the effect of the mutation on DNA binding. The mutant protein exhibited no affinity for methylated DNA at the concentrations tested (Fig.3 A), although the mutated domain remained structured with only local perturbations in the vicinity of Arg-111 and the B-C loop (Fig. 3 B). We also observed that the mutant protein, unlike all other MBD derivatives tested, bound very poorly to Fractogel SO32− resin during purification (data not shown). These are the most severe phenotypes seen for any single MBD missense mutation and indicate that the positive charge provided by the Arg-111 side chain is crucial for the interaction of the domain with both DNA and the negatively charged resin. It also suggests that the reduced binding affinities seen for the D121A and G114P mutants (above) may in part be due to their disruptive effects on the environment of this arginine side chain. A second arginine side chain, that of Arg-133, also projects from the DNA binding face of the domain, is conserved in the MBD family, and undergoes a large chemical shift change upon DNA binding (19Wakefield R.I.D. Smith B.O. Nan X. Free A. Soteriou A. Uhrin D. Bird A.P. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This latter residue is found mutated (to cysteine) in a case of Rett syndrome (10Amir R.E. Van den Veyver I.B. Wan M. Tran C.Q. Francke U. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3859) Google Scholar). We made a mutant MBD containing the R133C mutation (Table II) and compared its effect on binding to that of R111G. Unlike the Arg-111 mutant, R133C showed weak binding to methylated DNA at a concentration of 2 μm(Fig. 3 A) and had minimal effects on the overall structure of the domain (Fig. 3 C). Also unlike the R111G mutation, the R133C mutation did not affect the chemical shift of the Asp-121 backbone amide, confirming that Asp-121 interacts with Arg-111 rather than Arg-133. We also observed that mutation of Arg-133 to glycine had a less significant effect on binding than the cysteine substitution at this position (Table I), suggesting that the positive charge of this arginine side chain does not contribute substantially to the DNA interaction. Thus, although the reduced binding affinity of the R133C mutant probably accounts for its phenotype as manifested in Rett syndrome, this side chain is not of comparable importance to Arg-111 in binding DNA.Table IIDNA binding by arginine, hydrophobic patch, and Rett syndrome-associated mutants of the MeCP2 MBDResidue2-aAmino acids mutated are indicated by their single letter codes with numbering for full-length MeCP2.

To determine the type of G protein mediating M3 mAChR-PLD coupling in comparison to M3 mAChR-PLC coupling, we expressed various Gα proteins and regulators of the G protein signaling (RGS), which act as GTPase-activating proteins for Gq- or G12-type G proteins. PLD stimulation by the M3 mAChR was enhanced by the overexpression of Gα12 and Gα13, whereas the overexpression of Gαq strongly increased PLC activity without affecting PLD activity. Expression of the RGS homology domain of Lsc, which acts specifically on Gα12 and Gα13, blunted the M3 mAChR-induced PLD stimulation without affecting PLC stimulation. On the other hand, overexpression of RGS4, which acts on Gαq- but not Gα12-type G proteins, suppressed the M3 mAChR-induced PLC stimulation without altering PLD stimulation. We conclude that the M3 mAChR in HEK-293 cells apparently signals to PLD via G12- but not Gq-type G proteins and that G protein subtype-selective RGS proteins can be used as powerful tools to dissect the pertussis toxin-resistant G proteins and their role in receptor-effector coupling.

Interestingly, almost every G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) known to stimulate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) also stimulates PLD activity. This concomitant activation of the two phospholipases may be caused at several levels of signal transduction by these GPCRs. First, stimulation of PLD activity may be secondary to PLC stimulation, and the cellular signals generated by the PLC reaction specifically increase in the cytosolic Ca2+concentration and activation of protein kinase C isoforms. In fact, evidence has been provided for some GPCRs in different cell types that PLD stimulation is apparently a consequence of the primary PLC stimulation (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 3Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Second, the same receptor-activated G protein may stimulate both PLC and PLD. There is ample evidence that one type of G protein can regulate different effectors (6Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 7Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Two distinct G protein subtypes mediate GPCR-PLC coupling, the pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive Gq-type G proteins and the PTX-sensitive Gi-type G proteins (2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 8Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Studies on stimulation of PLD activity by chemoattractants in neutrophils suggest that in these cells GPCRs couple to PLD and PLC via the same Gi-type G proteins (4Jones D. Morgan C. Cockcroft S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 9Fensome A. Whatmore J. Morgan C.P. Jones D. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13157-13164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PLC-independent coupling of GPCRs to PLD via Gq-type G proteins has not yet been reported. However, it has recently been reported that the expression of constitutively active Gq can strongly increase PLD activity (10Plonk S.G. Park S.-K. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4823-4826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting that this possibility should be considered. Third, the receptor may couple to PLC and PLD by activating two distinct types of heterotrimeric G proteins. For example, GPCR-PLC coupling may be mediated by Gq proteins and GPCR-PLD coupling may be mediated by Gi proteins or vice versa. Other potential candidates for mediating specific GPCR-PLD coupling are the PTX-insensitive G12-type G proteins G12 and G13, which are not directly involved in GPCR-PLC coupling (2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 11Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell.

Expression of constitutively active Gα12 and Gα13 has been shown to strongly increase the activity of a coexpressed PLD1 enzyme like the constitutively active Gαq (10Plonk S.G. Park S.-K. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4823-4826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) stably expressed in HEK-293 cells is coupled to both PLD and PLC (13Sandmann J. Peralta E.G. Wurtman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6031-6034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and stimulation of either phospholipase by this GPCR is resistant to the treatment of the cells with PTX (14Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that Gi-type G proteins are not involved in coupling M3 mAChR to either PLC or PLD. Previous studies furthermore demonstrate that the M3 mAChR-induced PLD stimulation is not affected by protein kinase C inhibition or down-regulation or by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ (15Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Wahn F. Tapp E. Granass A. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is not secondary to PLC stimulation. Thus, because the M3 mAChR coupled to Gq-type G proteins in these cells (14Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar), we had to consider that the receptor coupled to PLD and PLC via the same type of G proteins, i.e. Gqproteins, or that two distinct PTX-insensitive G proteins mediate GPCR coupling to the two phospholipases. To resolve this question, we took advantage of the regulators of G protein signaling (RGS). These are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that accelerate GTP hydrolysis by Gα proteins and thereby attenuate signaling via heterotrimeric G proteins (17Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 18Wieland T. Chen C.-K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1529-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). RGS4 exhibits GAP activity for Gαi- and Gαq-type G proteins but not for Gα12-type proteins (21Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, structural data suggest that an interaction of either Gα12 or Gα13 with RGS4 is unlikely (23Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Recently, an NH2-terminal RGS homology domain has been identified in the Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), p115 RhoGEF, its murine homolog Lsc, and some closely related RhoGEFs (25Kozasa T. Jiang X.J. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). This RGS homology domain exhibited GAP activity for Gα12 and Gα13 but not for other Gα proteins. Thus, the use of the RGS homology domain of these RhoGEFs inactivating G12-type G proteins in comparison to RGS4 inactivating Gq-proteins should help to clarify whether Gq- and/or G12-type G proteins mediate M3 mAChR-PLD coupling in HEK-293 cells. Using this approach in combination with the overexpression of relevant Gα proteins, strong evidence is provided that G12 but not Gqproteins mediate M3 mAChR-PLD coupling. The pCis vectors carrying cDNAs for wild-type Gαq, Gα12, Gα13, and the constitutively active Gαq mutant, Gαq R183C, were described previously (26Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

FLAG-tagged RGS4 in a pCMV-based expression vector and the anti-RGS4 antibody were kind gifts of Dr. J. H. Kehrl. cDNA encoding Lsc was donated by Dr. R. Kay. For the expression of a Myc-tagged variant of Lsc containing the amino terminus with the RGS homology domain but lacking the Dbl and pleckstrin homology domains (Lsc-RGS, amino acids 1–283), the corresponding cDNA fragment was subcloned into pCMV3-Tag3 expression vector (Stratagene). HEK-293 cells stably expressing the M3 mAChR were cultured as reported previously (15Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U. Sandmann J. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For experiments, cells were grown to about 50% confluence on 145-mm culture dishes and transfected with the indicated amounts of either plasmid DNA or empty expression vectors using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. As studied by the expression of the green fluorescent protein, transfection efficiency ranged from 50 to 70%. All assays were performed 48 h after transfection. Expression of the proteins was verified by the immunoblotting of cell lysates with specific antibodies. The antibodies against Gαq, Gα12, Gα13, and His6 were from Santa Cruz, the anti-Myc antibody was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and the anti-FLAG antibody was from Stratagene. For construction of the recombinant adenoviruses encoding human RGS4 or mouse Lsc-RGS, the Adeasy system kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein was used (28He T.-C. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T., Yu, J.

The constructs were transfected into HEK-293 cells using LipofectAMINE, and recombinant viruses were amplified in several steps of this cell line. After purification over a CsCl2 gradient, high titer viral stocks of 3–4 × 108 plaque-forming units/μl were obtained. Infection of subconfluent monolayers of HEK-293 cells stably expressing the M3 mAChR was performed at a multiplicity of infection of 30 for 24 h before labeling. Before the PLC and PLD assays, infected cells were visualized and quantified by fluorescence microscopy as the constructs additionally expressed green fluorescent protein under the control of an independent CMV promoter. For control, an adenovirus encoding bacterial β-galactosidase LacZ, a kind gift of Dr. T. Eschenhagen, was used. Synthesis and purification of [γ-32P]GTP-azidoanilide were performed as described previously (29Gsell S. Eschenhagen T. Kaspareit G. Nose M. Scholz H. Behrends O. Wieland T.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 60 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 60 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP-azidoanilide. Incubation was for 5 min at 30 °C in the absence and presence of 1 mmcarbachol. Solubilization of irradiated membranes and immunoprecipitation of Gαq and Gα12 were exactly as described previously (30Wieland T. Nürnberg B. Ulibarri I. Kaldenberg-Stasch S. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H.

Offermanns). Immunoprecipitates were eluted from protein A-Sepharose with sample buffer and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9% acrylamide plus 6 m urea). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and dried. Labeled proteins were visualized by phosphoimaging (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics) (29Gsell S. Eschenhagen T. Kaspareit G. Nose M. Scholz H. Behrends O. Wieland T. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For measurement of PLD and PLC activities, the transfected cells were replated 24 h after transfection on 145-mm culture dishes. Cellular phospholipids were labeled by incubation for 20–24 h with [3H]oleic acid (2 μCi/ml) and myo-[3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml) in inositol-free growth medium. Thereafter, the cells were detached from the dishes, washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution (118 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmd-glucose buffered at pH 7.4 with 15 mm HEPES), supplemented with 10 mm LiCl, and resuspended at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Then phospholipase activities were measured for 30 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl containing 100 μl of the cell suspension (1 × 106 cells), 1.75% ethanol, and the indicated stimulatory agents. Alternatively, the transfected cells were split to poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm dishes, and after labeling PLD and PLC activities were determined in adherent cells (15Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B.

Stop of the enzyme reactions and analysis of [3H]inositol phosphates and labeled phospholipids including the specific PLD product [3H]phosphatidylethanol were carried out as described previously (15Schmidt M.

Protein levels were measured by the Bradford method in separate culture dishes. The formation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol was expressed as the percentage of total labeled phospholipids. The formation of [3H]inositol phosphates was given as counts/min per 106 cells or per mg of protein. Similar results were obtained whether the cells were in suspension or were adherent. Data shown are means ± S.D. from one representative experiment performed in triplicate and repeated as indicated or means ± S.E. with n providing the number of independent experiments. Concentration response curves were analyzed using iterative nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPAD Prism, GraphPAD Software for Science, San Diego, CA). Agonist activation of the M3 mAChR stably expressed in HEK-293 cells results in rapid and strong stimulation of PLD and PLC activities that are insensitive to PTX treatment (13Sandmann J.

As a first approach to determine the type of G proteins mediating M3 mAChR-PLD coupling in comparison to M3mAChR-PLC coupling, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for wild-type Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq as well as the constitutively active Gαq R183C. In cells overexpressing either Gα12 or Gα13, the stimulation of PLD activity by carbachol (1 mm) was increased by 60–100% compared with vector-transfected control cells (Fig.1 A), whereas the overexpression of Gαq did not alter PLD activity (Fig.1 B). In contrast to M3 mAChR-mediated PLD stimulation, basal PLD activity and PLD stimulation by 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were not affected by the overexpression of Gα12 or Gα13 (Fig.2). On the other hand, basal and carbachol-stimulated PLC activities were not altered by the overexpression of Gα12 or Gα13 (Fig.3 A) but were enhanced by 3–4-fold in cells overexpressing Gαq (Fig.3 B). Expression of the constitutively active Gαq R183C caused an even larger increase in basal PLC activity, which was not further enhanced by carbachol (Fig.4 A). However, despite this marked PLC stimulation, neither basal nor carbachol-stimulated PLD activities were altered by the expression of Gαq R183C (Fig. 4 B).Figure 2Lack of effect of Gα12 and Gα13 on PLD stimulation by PMA.

In line with previous findings (14Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar), the addition of carbachol (1 mm) strongly increased the incorporation of [γ-32P]GTP-azidoanilide into Gαq proteins (Fig.5 A). Binding of the GTP analog to Gα12 was also, but less efficiently, enhanced by carbachol (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the M3 mAChR stably expressed in HEK-293 cells can activate both Gq- and G12-type G proteins. To determine the endogenous G protein subtype involved in the coupling of M3 mAChR to the stimulation of PLD and PLC, we made use of the two RGS proteins, RGS4 and the RGS homology domain of Lsc (Lsc-RGS), which act as GAPs for Gαq and Gα12 family members, respectively (17Berman D.M.

As shown in Fig. 6 A, M3 mAChR-stimulated PLD activity was strongly reduced (by about 50%) in cells transiently expressing Lsc-RGS, whereas the expression of RGS4 was without effect. On the other hand, the expression of RGS4 markedly reduced (by about 50%) 1 mmcarbachol-stimulated PLC activity, whereas the expression of Lsc-RGS was without effect (Fig. 6 B). In contrast to M3mAChR-mediated PLD stimulation, expression of Lsc-RGS did not alter 100 nm PMA-induced PLD stimulation (Fig.7).Figure 7Lack of effect of Lsc-RGS on PMA-induced PLD stimulation. M3 mAChR-expressing HEK-293 cells were transfected with empty expression vector (Control, open bar) or with expression plasmid for Lsc-RGS (dotted bar) (100 μg each).

Data are representative of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The extent of inhibition of carbachol-stimulated PLD and PLC activities observed upon the transient expression of Lsc-RGS and RGS4, respectively, roughly reflects the transfection efficiency. However, a small effect of Lsc-RGS and RGS4 on PLC and PLD activities, respectively, may have escaped detection. Therefore, the expression of RGS proteins was increased by a second approach, i.e.infection of cells with recombinant adenoviruses encoding Lsc-RGS or RGS4. As judged by the expression of green fluorescent protein, the efficiency of adenoviral gene transfer into HEK-293 cells was >95% (data not shown). The expression of RGS4 by adenoviral infection was without any effect on M3 mAChR-stimulated PLD activity (Fig. 8 A). Neither the maximal extent nor the concentration dependence of carbachol-induced PLD stimulation was altered in RGS4 expression compared with control cells infected with an adenovirus encoding LacZ. In contrast, the carbachol-induced PLD stimulation was blunted (by about 80%) by the expression of Lsc-RGS. On the other hand, adenoviral expression of Lsc-RGS did not affect the stimulation of PLC activity at any carbachol concentration that had been examined, whereas PLC stimulation was strongly reduced (by about 70%) by the expression of RGS4 (Fig.8 B). A large variety of GPCRs that stimulate phosphoinositide-hydrolyzing PLC also activates PLD. This concomitant stimulation of the two phospholipases may be a sequential reaction in that the receptor initially leads to PLC stimulation followed by the increase in PLD activity that is caused by intracellular Ca2+ and/or activated protein kinase C, consequences of the PLC reaction that are in fact reported for some GPCRs (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev.

Alternatively, PLC and PLD enzymes are independently regulated by the receptor either by activating one heterotrimeric G protein that then leads to the stimulation of both PLC and PLD or two distinct G proteins, one responsible for PLC stimulation and the other responsible for mediating PLD stimulation. The M3 mAChR expressed in HEK-293 cells is a prototypical example of a GPCR that stimulates both PLC and PLD (13Sandmann J. Peralta E.G. Wurtman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6031-6034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that PLD stimulation is apparently independent of changes in intracellular Ca2+ and protein kinase C activation (15Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D. Rümenapp U.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is not a consequence of the PLC stimulation. Thus, two other possibilities were considered for mediating M3 mAChR-PLD coupling. As the M3 mAChR couples to Gq-type G proteins in HEK-293 cells and stimulation of either phospholipase is resistant to PTX (14Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar), we first studied whether Gq proteins may mediate M3 mAChR-PLD coupling. However, as shown here, the basal PLD activity and its stimulation by the M3 mAChR were not affected by the overexpression of Gαq (wild type or constitutively active), which on the other hand strongly increased PLC activity. Furthermore, overexpression (transient or by infection with a recombinant adenovirus) of RGS4, which is known to act as a GAP for Gq proteins (17Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

These results are in line with previously published data on the regulation of PLC stimulation by Gαq and RGS4 (2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 12Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar,17Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J.

As the M3 mAChR couples to PLD but apparently not by activating the PLC-stimulatory Gq proteins, we examined whether the PTX-resistant G12-type G proteins may act as specific transducers for PLD stimulation. The overexpression of Gα12 or Gα13 enhanced PLD stimulation by the M3 mAChR by up to 2-fold. On the other hand, the expression of Lsc-RGS, the murine homolog of the RGS domain of p115 RhoGEF that acts as a specific GAP for Gα12 and Gα13 (25Kozasa T. Jiang X.J. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), suppressed the M3 mAChR-mediated PLD stimulation. In contrast, the basal and M3mAChR-stimulated PLC activities were not altered by the overexpression of Gα12 or Gα13 or by the expression of Lsc-RGS. These results are in line with our knowledge that G12-type G proteins do not directly influence the activities of PLC enzymes (2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 11Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and indicate that the expression of the PLD-inhibitory Lsc-RGS does not unspecifically inhibit the M3 mAChR. As the expression of Gα12, Gα13, or Lsc-RGS did not alter phorbol ester-stimulated PLD activity, it can be concluded that these proteins, such as Gα12 and Gα13, specifically enhance or interfere, such as Lsc-RGS, with M3 mAChR-PLD coupling. Thus, together with the finding that the M3 mAChR induced the incorporation of [γ-32P]GTP-azidoanilide into G12 proteins, these results strongly suggest that G12-type G proteins specifically mediate the coupling of the M3 mAChR to the PLD signaling pathway in HEK-293 cells. Recently, the G protein specificities for coupling of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor to PLD and PLC in vascular smooth muscle cells were reported (34Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Lyons P.R. Lassègue B. Griendling K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 35Ushio-Fukai M. Griendling K.K. Akers M. Lyons P.R. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19772-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Stimulation of PLD activity by this GPCR was inhibited (by 50%) by antibodies against Gα12 but not Gαq/11. However, both types of antibodies suppressed in an additive manner angiotensin II stimulation of PLC-β1. Thus, in contrast to the specific function of G12-type G proteins in M3 mAChR-PLD coupling in HEK-293 cells, G12proteins are apparently involved in GPCR-induced stimulation of both phospholipases, PLD and PLC, in vascular smooth muscle cells. As direct activation of PLD enzymes by heterotrimeric G proteins including G12-type G proteins has not been observed (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 3Exton J.H.

J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), these G proteins most probably activate intermediate signaling pathways and proteins, finally leading to PLD stimulation. The best characterized intermediates involved in receptor-induced PLD stimulation are small GTPases of the ADP-ribosylation factor and Rho families as well as protein kinase C isoenzymes (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev.

Signal. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), PLD stimulation by these G proteins most probably is not caused by protein kinase C activation. Many of the diverse cellular responses observed upon expression of constitutively active Gα12 or Gα13 including PLD1 stimulation, actin stress fiber formation, neurite retraction, activation of Na+-H+-exchanger, and serum response element-dependent gene transcription were inhibited by dominant-negative Rho GTPases (10Plonk S.G.

However, from the finding that Rho GTPases are involved in a cellular response, it cannot be concluded that G12-type G proteins mediate the receptor action as Rho-dependent cellular actions as well as direct Rho activation can also be induced by activated Gαq proteins (37Katoh H.

Also, in HEK-293 cells, the expression of mutationally activated Gα12 and Gαq family members caused strong and comparable stimulation of serum response factor-mediated gene transcription that was sensitive to Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase (data not shown), indicating the involvement and probably activation of Rho by either type of heterotrimeric G protein. Thus, although Gq proteins can cause Rho activation, the Rho-dependent PLD stimulation by the M3 mAChR in HEK-293 cells (44Schmidt M. Rümenapp U. Bienek C. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2422-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) is apparently independent of this reaction but mediated by G12-type G proteins. In combination with the finding that the M3 mAChR activates PLC and protein kinase C (data not shown) but stimulates PLD that is apparently independent of this reaction, these data suggest that the M3 mAChR-PLD coupling occurs in a highly organized subcellular compartment. PLD stimulation by the M3 mAChR-expressed HEK-293 cells is dependent on Rho GTPases apparently acting via Rho kinase (44Schmidt M. Rümenapp U. Bienek C. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H.

Thus, from the data discussed above and those data presented in this study, it seems reasonable to assume that the M3 mAChR activates endogenous G12-type G proteins, which then through an unidentified GEF activate Rho and subsequently PLD. In addition to and apparently independent of Rho proteins, ADP-ribosylation factor GTPases are required for M3mAChR-induced PLD stimulation in HEK-293 cells (46Rümenapp U. Geiszt M. Wahn F.

As PLD stimulation was not affected by the inactivation of Gqproteins (by expression of RGS4), it has to be concluded that the activation of ADP-ribosylation factor GTPases is probably also mediated by G12-type G proteins. Experiments are in progress to study whether both G12-type G proteins, G12 and G13, are involved in M3 mAChR-induced PLD stimulation and may even exhibit selectivity for coupling the receptor to the activation of Rho and ADP-ribosylation factor GTPases. In summary, our data indicate that distinct heterotrimeric G proteins couple the M3 mAChR to the stimulation of PLD and PLC in HEK-293 cells. Whereas Gq-type G proteins mediate M3 mAChR-PLC coupling, the stimulation of PLD activity is apparently mediated specifically by G12-type G proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that G protein subtype-specific RGS proteins can be used as powerful tools to dissect the PTX-resistant G protein families, Gq and G12, and their role in receptor-effector coupling.

https://openalex.org/W2052102093,"Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat coding for a polyglutamine stretch within the huntingtin protein. Currently, the function of normal huntingtin and the mechanism by which expanded huntingtin causes selective neurotoxicity remain unknown. Clues may come from the identification of huntingtin-associated proteins (HAPs). Here, we show that huntingtin copurifies with a single novel 40-kDa protein termed HAP40. HAP40 is encoded by the open reading frame factor VIII-associated gene A (F8A) located within intron 22 of the factor VIII gene. In transfected cell extracts, HAP40 coimmunoprecipitates with full-length huntingtin but not with an N-terminal huntingtin fragment. Recombinant HAP40 is cytoplasmic in the presence of huntingtin but is actively targeted to the nucleus in the absence of huntingtin. These data indicate that HAP40 is likely to contribute to the function of normal huntingtin and is a candidate for involvement in the aberrant nuclear localization of mutant huntingtin found in degenerating neurons in Huntington's disease.

The genetic defect underlying HD is an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat encoding a polyglutamine stretch within the huntingtin protein (1The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6995) Google Scholar). Normally, huntingtin's CAG repeat codes for 6–35 consecutive glutamines, whereas in HD, it is expanded beyond 35. At least seven other progressive neurodegenerative diseases result from polyglutamine repeat expansions within otherwise unrelated host proteins (2Wells R.D. Warren S.T. Genetic Instabilities and Hereditary Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). In each disorder, polyglutamine expansion causes a toxic gain of function, with longer repeats resulting in increased severity. Accumulating data are consistent with the hypothesis that expanded polyglutamine repeats adopt a conformation that facilitates toxic protein-protein interactions and aggregation (3Perutz M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 58-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 4Perutz M.F. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 718-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite sharing similar pathogenic mechanisms, polyglutamine repeat disorders display distinctive neuropathologies. In each disease, a different subset of central nervous system neurons is targeted that cannot be attributed to the expression pattern of the expanded protein. For example, HD most severely affects medium spiny neurons in the striatum (5Ross C.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1147-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 6Sharp A.H.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 1065-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), whereas spinocerebellar ataxia 1 targets cerebellar Purkinje cells, although both cell types express the huntingtin and ataxin-1 proteins (for further review, see Ref. 7Gusella J.F. NeuroScience News. 2000; 3: 15-22Google Scholar). Thus, the selective vulnerability to polyglutamine toxicity is influenced by properties of the host protein. Protein characteristics known to alter polyglutamine toxicity in animal and cellular models include nuclear localization, high local protein concentration, protein-protein interactions, and protein size or truncation. Each of these features is likely to be determined by the protein's normal function. Thus, it may be necessary to identify huntingtin's normal cellular roles to understand how polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin results in the selective toxicity characteristic of HD. Huntingtin is a 348-kDa protein that lacks close similarity to known proteins and has no known function (1The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6995) Google Scholar). It is expressed in all tissues, with the highest levels found in brain and testis (6Sharp A.H. Loev S.J. Schilling G. Li S.H. Li X.J. Bao J. Wagster M.V. Kotzuk J.A. Steiner J.P. Lo A. Hedreen J.

Yeast two-hybrid screens have identified a number of proteins that interact with huntingtin, known as huntingtin-interacting proteins (HIPs), huntingtin-yeast partners (HYPs), and huntingtin-associated proteins (HAPs). These associated proteins implicate huntingtin in a number of cellular processes (reviewed in Refs. 7Gusella J.F. NeuroScience News. 2000; 3: 15-22Google Scholar and 14Jones L.

The known huntingtin-associated proteins are likely to represent only a partial list of proteins that complex with huntingtin in vivo. All 18 of the huntingtin-interacting proteins identified in yeast bind to the N-terminal 18% of huntingtin. The absence of proteins binding the central and C-terminal regions may reflect technical limitations of expressing large proteins in yeast. The central 1500 amino acids of huntingtin comprise 10 HEAT repeats that are likely to form a single extended structure and mediate protein-protein interactions. No domain information is available to guide the design of small yeast baits from within the C-terminal 1500 amino acids of huntingtin. Thus, to identify proteins that associate with full-length huntingtin in vivo, we purified huntingtin complexes from rat brain extracts and identified the protein components. Rat brain extracts were prepared in a glass/Teflon homogenizer in 10 volumes of PBS containing Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Homogenates were successively centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, 10,000 ×g for 20 min, and 100,000 × g for 1 h. Pellets were washed once and resuspended in PBS. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Antibodies were prepared according to standard procedures (Cocalico Biological). A goat polyclonal antibody was generated against a fusion, HntΔex1, corresponding to amino acids 1–23 and 69–92 of human huntingtin. For immunization, a HntΔex1-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was expressed, purified on glutathione-agarose, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and injected as a Coomassie Blue-stained gel slice. A purified HntΔex1-His-tagged fusion protein was used for affinity purification of huntingtin antibodies from serum and anti-glutathioneS-transferase antibodies. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (rAbs) were prepared against peptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through a terminal cysteine. Huntingtin rAbs were generated against the peptides MATLEKLMKAFESLKSFQC and CITEQPRSQHTLQ corresponding to amino acids 1–18 and 497–508, respectively. HAP40 rAbs were prepared against peptides CRY- RQVSNKLKKRFLRKPN, CPQPPSGPQPPLSGPQPRP, and CDGHGQDTSGQLPEE corresponding to amino acids 25–42, 226–243, and 314–326, respectively. With the exception of the crude antisera used for the immunoprecipitation in Fig. 5 A, all antibodies were affinity-purified using antigen coupled to Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad) as described previously (33Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). MAP2 and PYK2 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The huntingtin monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2166 was purchased from Chemicon. The M2 anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma. The HAP1 antibody was obtained from Alan Sharp, the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. The HIP2 antibody was a gift of Cecile Pickart, the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. Protein complexes were purified from rat brain (Pel-Freez, Rogers, AZ). Brains were homogenized in 10 volumes of PBS, 1% Triton X-100. Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This homogenization buffer was modified with either 1 mm EDTA or 2 μmCa2+, with or without phosphatase inhibitors, and with or without detergent added after 100,000 × g centrifugation. In all experiments, extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. For immunoaffinity purification, 20 ml of cleared brain extract was combined with antibody resins prepared by coupling 5 mg of affinity-purified antibody to 2 ml of Affi-Gel-10. Beads and brain extract were mixed in batch for 2 h and collected in a column. Beads were successively washed with 50 ml of PBS/1% Triton X-100, 10 ml of PBS/0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 ml of PBS. Proteins were eluted with 5 ml of 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5. Samples were concentrated by lyophilization or trichloroacetic acid precipitation. For immunoprecipitation, 2 μl of antibody was combined with 1 ml of extract according to the standard procedures (34Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–15% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Proteins were excised, and sequence analysis was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility, Cambridge, MA by microcapillary reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. For two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing was performed in tube gels (Kenderick Laboratories, Madison, WI) or on pH 3–10 linear IPGphor strips. Duplicate two-dimensional gels were run for all samples. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (33Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A mouse EST known to contain at least the 5′ 763 nucleotides of the F8A/HAP40 open reading frame was obtained from the Japanese National Institute of Infectious Disease (Tokyo, Japan) (EST MNCb-6402, GenBank accession numberAU035947). The 1589-base insert was subcloned into theEco RI/Xba I sites in pcDNA3.1 and sequenced on both strands. An epitope-tagged construct was prepared by cloning oligonucleotides encoding the C-terminal 21 amino acids of HAP40 and a FLAG tag into the Blp I and Xba I sites. The amino acids KKR in the putative nuclear localization signal were changed to STS. HEK293 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) and immunolabeled as described previously (35Peters M.F. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Kushi J. Seaman H.C. Cooper J.K.

Genet. 1999; 8: 397-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or littermate nontransgenic controls were immunostained using the Vectastain ABC labeling system (Vector Laboratories). Biochemical enrichment of huntingtin aggregates from post-mortem human brains was performed by homogenizing aggregates in PBS and centrifuging them at 1,000 ×g for 5 min. Pellets were collected, boiled in 2% SDS, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting with anti-peptide antibodies against huntingtin but not HAP40 clearly detected proteins in the stacking gel from HD patients (data not shown). To prepare quantities of antibody suitable for immunoaffinity purification, we immunized goats with a fusion protein corresponding to huntingtin exon 1 with an in-frame deletion of part of the polyglutamine and polyproline regions. We chose this immunogen because N-terminal fusion proteins with deletions have been shown to generate rabbit antibodies that strongly label native huntingtin, especially with an expanded polyglutamine (37Li H. Li S.H. Cheng A.L. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P. Li X.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). 2J. D. Wood and C. A. Ross, unpublished data. Consistent with previous observations in rodents (38Wood J.D. MacMillan J.C. Harper P.S. Lowenstein P.R. Jones A.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we noted that rat huntingtin was found predominately in the soluble fraction (Fig.1 A). Lower levels of huntingtin were consistently detected in particulate fractions, suggesting specific association with membranes, the nucleus, or other cellular structures. To extract the maximum amount of soluble huntingtin for purification, we used rat brain homogenates treated with Triton X-100. Immunoaffinity purification with the anti-HntΔex1 antibody dramatically enriched for huntingtin (Fig. 1 B). Purification was specific because immunoblotting did not detect huntingtin in samples eluted from goat IgG columns (Fig. 1 B). As expected from a one-step preparation, Coomassie Blue-stained gels revealed that huntingtin samples were highly enriched in a ≈350-kDa protein but were not pure (Fig. 1 C). Compared with the proteins present in control samples, four major proteins of ≈40, 70, 115, and 350 kDa were consistently enriched in the anti-huntingtin samples (Fig. 1 C; data not shown). Several variations in the extraction conditions (see “Materials and Methods”) did not significantly alter the proteins that specifically coenriched in huntingtin samples (data not shown). The four protein bands were identified by mass spectroscopy/mass spectroscopy sequencing of tryptic peptides. The 350-kDa band yielded 71 nonoverlapping peptide sequences corresponding to huntingtin and 5 peptides corresponding to MAP2(a/b). The 115-kDa band was comprised of PYK2. The 70-kDa band contained MAP2(c). The sequence from the 40-kDa protein band corresponded to open reading frame F8A located on chromosome X within intron 22 of the factor VIII gene (39Levinson B. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Metzenberg A. Kenwrick S. Chapman V. Gitschier J. Genomics. 1992; 13: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We refer to this 40-kDa huntingtin-associated protein as HAP40. Immunoblot analysis with commercial antibodies to PYK2 and MAP2 and newly prepared HAP40 antibodies (described below) confirmed that each protein was highly enriched in samples eluted from anti-HntΔex1 columns compared with those eluted from goat IgG columns (data not shown). However, sequence comparisons revealed a common proline-rich sequence, PPPX P, in the HntΔex1 fusion protein, PYK2, and MAP2(a/b/c). This raises the possibility that both PYK2 and MAP2 were enriched by binding to antibodies against huntingtin's proline-rich region rather than by associating with the huntingtin protein. To distinguish between these possibilities, we prepared new antibodies against huntingtin peptides 1–18 and 497–508, which lack consecutive prolines. Immunoaffinity purification with each of these antibodies greatly enriched for huntingtin and HAP40 but not for PYK2 or MAP2. With long exposures, PYK2 and MAP2 could be detected nonspecifically in both anti-huntingtin and rabbit IgG samples (Fig.2 A). In contrast, HAP40 was highly enriched in both rAb Hnt1–18 and rAb Hnt497–508 samples in comparison with the IgG control (Fig. 2 A). Thus, we conclude that HAP40 is tightly associated with huntingtin after Triton X-100 solubilization. To identify additional proteins copurifying with huntingtin in our assay, we immunoblotted for the previously identified huntingtin-interacting proteins. Immunoblots for HAP1 and HIP2 clearly detected proteins migrating at the predicted size in crude soluble fractions. However, neither protein was found to copurify with huntingtin despite increasing the amount of sample loaded by 20-fold compared with that needed to saturate the immunoblot signal for huntingtin (Fig. 2 B). Similar immunoblots probed for other huntingtin-binding proteins including HIP1, SH3GL3, symplekin (HYP-I), α-adaptin (HYP-J), calmodulin, epidermal growth factor receptor, and the nuclear corepressor failed to reveal any enrichment in huntingtin samples (data not shown). We conclude that none of these proteins form Triton X-100-resistant complexes with soluble huntingtin (see “Discussion”). To search for additional interacting proteins that may be present at levels too low to be detected by Coomassie Blue staining or obscured by comigrating contaminate proteins, we analyzed immunoaffinity-purified huntingtin samples by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Samples eluted from rAb Hnt1–18, rAb Hnt497–508, goat polyclonal antibody HntΔex1, rabbit IgG, and goat IgG columns were compared (Fig. 3; data not shown). The pattern of protein spots was highly similar in all samples and reproducible in several experiments. Each of the five samples contained some proteins that were unique to that antibody column (Fig. 3, compare double arrows). Two 40-kDa protein spots were detected in all three huntingtin samples but were not detected in either IgG control (Fig. 3,single arrows). No other potential HAPs were identified in more than one huntingtin sample and absent in IgG samples. Immunoblotting similar gels with HAP40 antibodies revealed a pair of 40-kDa spots in a pattern indistinguishable from the two silver-stained spots (Fig. 3 D). The reason for two HAP40 spots is unknown. We conclude that HAP40 is a major component of the huntingtin protein complex. For expression analysis, we obtained mouse EST MNCb-6402, which was previously reported to code for at least the N-terminal 254 amino acids of HAP40/F8A. Complete sequencing of this EST revealed a Kozak start site followed by an open reading frame encoding 381 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 40,472.78 Da. This EST sequence differed from the previously reported mouse F8A sequence (39Levinson B. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Metzenberg A. Kenwrick S. Chapman V. Gitschier J. Genomics. 1992; 13: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) by one amino acid insertion and two substitutions (Fig.4). These changes are unlikely to result from errors in the mouse EST sequence because each of these three residues in the mouse EST was identical to human ESTs. None of the differing residues were confirmed by mass spectroscopy/mass spectroscopy peptide sequences (Fig. 4). To further test the huntingtin-HAP40 association, we prepared anti-HAP40 peptide antibodies. Two HAP40 antisera coimmunoprecipitated huntingtin from mouse brain extracts (Fig.5 A). This was judged to be specific because preimmune serum failed to coimmunoprecipitate huntingtin. When considered together, the coimmunoprecipitation of huntingtin with two anti-HAP40 antibodies and the copurification of HAP40 with three anti-huntingtin antibodies strongly indicate that huntingtin and HAP40 form a stable complex. To determine the region of huntingtin required for association with HAP40, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with HAP40 and huntingtin constructs of various lengths. Full-length huntingtin specifically coimmunoprecipitated with HAP40 (Fig. 5 B). Despite being expressed at levels higher than full-length huntingtin, a construct corresponding to the N-terminal 513 amino acids failed to coimmunoprecipitate with HAP40 (Fig. 5 B). HAP40 is the first protein known to require either the central or C-terminal regions of huntingtin for association. Although additional experiments will be needed to prove that the HAP40-huntingtin interaction is direct, it seems unlikely that other proteins mediate this interaction because none were detected in the purified huntingtin complexes (Fig.3). To compare the subcellular localization of HAP40 and huntingtin, we immunolabeled sections of mouse brain and transfected cells. None of the anti-peptide antibodies against HAP40 labeled normal brain sections. Because each antibody recognized native protein in transfected cells, these data are consistent with low expression levels of HAP40 proteins in normal brain. On sections of HD-N171–82Q transgenic mouse brain, the anti-huntingtin antibodies but not the anti-HAP40 antibodies labeled inclusions (data not shown). In HEK293 cells transiently transfected with full-length huntingtin and HAP40, immunostaining for both proteins showed a similar cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 6, top panels). Cotransfection of either normal (23Q) or expanded (82Q) full-length huntingtin with HAP40 resulted in similar colocalization in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Surprisingly, in cells that lack detectable endogenous huntingtin, HAP40 transfected alone was concentrated in the nucleus, both diffusely and in punctate nuclear structures (Fig. 6, bottom panels). The HAP40 nuclear dots did not overlap with staining for a splicing factor (mAb SC35) or promyelocytic leukemia protein oncogenic domains detected with anti-PML antibodies (data not shown). Although the nature of HAP40 nuclear structures remains unclear, they are unlikely to result from nonspecific aggregation of overexpressed protein because they were observed in individual cells expressing lower levels of protein (Fig.6). HAP40 is smaller than the ≈ 45-kDa threshold for passive diffusion through nuclear pores. However, passive diffusion alone would not be expected to result in the relative concentration of HAP40 in the nucleus. To test the possibility that HAP40 is actively targeted to the nucleus, we examined the localization of a 68-kDa HAP40-GFP fusion protein. The HAP40-GFP fusion was concentrated in the nucleus (Fig. 7,upper panels). Mutation of a lysine/arginine-rich region resembling a nuclear localization signal (NLS) resulted in a significant redistribution of HAP40-GFP to the cytoplasm (Fig. 7, lower panels). Low levels of HAP40-GFP mutant NLS were detectable in the nucleus, suggesting that HAP40 may be actively targeted to the nucleus by multiple mechanisms (Fig. 7). We immunoaffinity-purified huntingtin and characterized the associated proteins. We found that most rat huntingtin is soluble and that soluble huntingtin associates with a novel protein, HAP40. None of the previously identified huntingtin-associated proteins were found to copurify with huntingtin in our assay. This result may be due to several reasons, the most notable of which is that our purification system requires soluble huntingtin and the presence of detergent to reduce nonspecific protein associations. Thus, we would not expect to purify huntingtin-associated protein complexes that were either detergent-sensitive or detergent-insoluble. Interestingly, HAP1 and SH3GL3 have been shown to form detergent-resistant complexes with huntingtin from transfected cells (15Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A.

The stable association of HAP40 with huntingtin suggests that it is likely to hold important clues to the cellular role of huntingtin. Peptide sequencing of HAP40 revealed that it is encoded by an open reading frame previously termed F8A. F8A was identified as a putative gene located within intron 22 of the factor VIII gene but transcribed in the direction opposite factor VIII. In humans, a portion of factor VIII intron 22 including F8A is duplicated with two additional copies located nearer to the Xq telomere. Intrachromosomal recombination between intron 22 and either of these two copies interrupts the factor VIII gene and underlies almost half of all severe hemophilia A cases (40Naylor J.A. Buck D. Green P. Williamson H. Bentley D. Giannelli F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1217-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our data prove that the single F8A sequence in mouse is expressed. However, because the three intron 22 sequences in human are 99% identical, it remains unclear which of the three human F8A sequences are expressed. F8A/HAP40 mRNA is expressed in a wide range of mouse tissues, similar to huntingtin (39Levinson B. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Metzenberg A. Kenwrick S. Chapman V. Gitschier J. Genomics. 1992; 13: 862-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When recombinant HAP40 and huntingtin are coexpressed in cells, they colocalize in the cytoplasm. In the absence of huntingtin, HAP40 is concentrated in the nucleus, where it is both diffuse and in punctate nuclear structures. We found that a HAP40-GFP fusion protein too large to diffuse through nuclear pores was concentrated in the nucleus. Mutation of a NLS largely redistributed HAP40-GFP to the cytoplasm, indicating that HAP40 is actively targeted to the nucleus. Future experiments will be needed to determine the function of nuclear HAP40. The mechanism by which huntingtin redistributes HAP40 to the cytoplasm in transfected cells is unclear. Huntingtin is normally concentrated in the cytoplasm and may simply anchor HAP40. Alternatively, several lines of evidence are consistent with regulated active nuclear transport of huntingtin. Huntingtin contains several consensus NLSs (41Bessert D.A. Gutridge K.L. Dunbar J.C. Carlock L.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 33: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and >10 sequences matching leucine-rich nuclear export signals. 3M. F. Peters and C. A. Ross, unpublished observations. Huntingtin is comprised of 10 HEAT repeats (42Andrade M.A. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 115-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) plus an additional flanking sequence highly similar to β-importin, a key component of the nuclear transport machinery.3 Low levels of full-length huntingtin have been detected in purified nuclei from brain (43Wheeler V.C.

Genet. 1996; 5: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, under various conditions, huntingtin may import and export HAP40 through nuclear pores. HAP40 is unlikely to be directly involved in the toxic gain of function caused by huntingtin's expanded polyglutamine. HAP40 does not associate with the N-terminal region of huntingtin that contains the repeat and is not easily detected in huntingtin aggregates of either mice transgenic for an expanded N-terminal fragment or HD post-mortem brain. However, events that regulate nuclear localization of the huntingtin-HAP40 protein complex are candidates for contributing to the selective neuronal vulnerability in HD. In mouse models of HD generated by inserting an expanded polyglutamine stretch into mouse huntingtin, full-length (43Wheeler V.C. White J.K. Gutekunst C.A. Vrbanac V. Weaver M. Li X.J. Li S.H. Yi H.

Nuclear targeting exacerbates the toxicity of both expanded huntingtin and ataxin-1 (35Peters M.F. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Kushi J. Seaman H.C. Cooper J.K. Herring W.J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate the transcription repression activity of Hes1. It is shown here that Hes1 associates with the nuclear matrix, the ribonucleoprotein network of the nucleus that plays important roles in transcriptional regulation. Nuclear matrix binding is mediated by the same Hes1 C-terminal domain that is also required for transcriptional repression.

The mechanisms regulating the commitment of these progenitor cells to the neuronal fate are controlled by either positive or negative regulators belonging to separate families of transcription factors containing the basic helix loop helix (bHLH)1 motif. Proteins that promote neuronal differentiation include a number of evolutionarily conserved transcriptional activators, generally referred to as the proneural proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Kageyama R.

Factors that antagonize neuronal differentiation include bHLH proteins which mediate transcriptional repression rather than transactivation.

The best characterized member of the mammalian Hes family is the Hes1 gene (14Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 5: 2620-2634Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar). In the nervous system, Hes1is highly expressed during the progenitor-to-neuron transition, and its expression then decreases during the developmental maturation of postmitotic neurons (14Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 5: 2620-2634Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar).

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Conversely, targeted disruption of Hes1 causes premature neuronal differentiation and up-regulation of proneural genes, in addition to other developmental defects (16Ishibashi M. Ang S.L. Shiota K.

Similar to Drosophila Hes proteins, Hes1 is a transcriptional repressor that acts as a nuclear effector of the Notch signaling pathway during mammalian neurogenesis (14Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y.

Together, these findings demonstrate that Hes1 is a crucial negative regulator of neuronal differentiation in mammals and underscore the importance of understanding how its cellular functions are regulated. Although little is presently known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie transcriptional repression by Hes1, studies in Drosophila show that invertebrate Hes proteins interact with the general transcriptional corepressor, Groucho (11Paroush Z.

Mutations that inhibit the Groucho·Hes interaction interfere with the ability of Drosophila Hes proteins to repress transcription, suggesting that Groucho acts a transcriptional corepressor for these factors (11Paroush Z.

These findings first raised the possibility that mammalian homologs of DrosophilaGroucho, designated as transducin-like Enhancer of split (TLE) or Groucho-related genes (Grg) 1 through 4 (hereafter referred to as TLE1–4) (22Stifani S.

Consistent with this notion, Hes1 and TLEgenes are coexpressed in the nervous system (14Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S.

Biol. 1999; 45: 687-708PubMed Google Scholar), and perturbations that force a persistent expression of Hes1 or TLE1 in the mammalian forebrain result in similar phenotypes characterized by neuronal loss (15Ishibashi M.

Taken together with the demonstration that TLE proteins provide a transcriptional corepressor function to a number of different DNA-binding factors (30Levanon D. Goldstein R.E. Bernstein Y. Tang H.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), these observations suggest that transcriptional repression by Hes1 is regulated by interactions with TLE family members. It remains to be determined, however, whether Hes1 and TLE proteins functionally interact in vivo and, if so, how their transcriptional functions are regulated. Here we describe experiments that demonstrate that Hes1 interacts with TLEs in mammalian cells and localizes to the nuclear matrix, where TLEs are also found. Both the nuclear matrix association and transcription repression activity of Hes1 are inhibited by deletion of the same C-terminal domain, indicating a correlation between nuclear matrix binding and transcriptional repression. This observation is in agreement with previous studies showing that the nuclear matrix is functionally involved in the regulation of gene expression by concentrating and localizing transcription factors and/or facilitating the formation of appropriate chromatin structures (reviewed in Ref.34Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1999; 9: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our results also show that the ability of Hes1 to interact with TLEs is required for both nuclear matrix association and transcriptional repression, indicating that TLEs act as transcriptional corepressors for Hes1. The involvement of TLEs in Hes1 function is not regulated by the AES1/Grg5 (hereafter referred to as Grg5) protein. Grg5 is a naturally occurring factor related to the first 200 amino acids of Groucho/TLEs and has been regarded as a dominant-negative regulator of at least certain TLE transcriptional corepressor functions (33Ren B.

Hes1 is coexpressed with TLE proteins in a number of mammalian cell types (14Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S.

These findings suggest that TLEs may form transcription repression complexes with Hes1 in vivo. To begin to examine this possibility, we first asked whether Hes1 and TLE proteins would interact in cultured mammalian cells. Rat ROS17/2.8 osteoblastic cells, which express high levels of endogenous TLEs (31McLarren K.W. Lo R. Grbavec D. Thirunavukkarasu K. Karsenty G. Stifani S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 530-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), were transfected with an expression construct for a fusion protein of GST and Hes1. After isolation of GST-Hes1 on glutathione-Sepharose beads, Western blotting analysis with panTLE monoclonal antibodies (22Stifani S. Blaumueller C.M. Redhead N.J. Hill R.E. Artavanis- Tsakonas S. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 43Husain J. Lo R. Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) revealed that endogenous TLE proteins coprecipitated with GST-Hes1 (Fig.1 A, lane 2). In contrast, TLEs did not coprecipitate with a fusion protein of GST and Hes1-(1–275), which lacks the last six amino acids containing the WRPW motif (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). GST-Hes1 and GST-Hes1-(1–275) were expressed at equivalent levels (Fig.1 B, lanes 2 and 4). These results show that TLEs and Hes1 interact with each other in mammalian cells and that this interaction requires the WRPW motif of Hes1. To determine whether Hes1 and TLE proteins might colocalize to a common nuclear compartment, it was then asked whether Hes1 could associate with the nuclear matrix, where TLE proteins are known to localize (46Javed A. Guo B. Hiebert S. Choi J.Y. Green J. Zhao S.C. Osborne M.A. Stifani S. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2221-2231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other Hes1-binding proteins, like RUNX family members, also associate with the nuclear matrix (45Merriman H.L. van Wijnen A.J. Hiebert S. Bidwell J.P. Fey E. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13125-13132Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 47Zeng C. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Meyers S. Sun W. Shopland L. Lawrence J.B. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This filamentous ribonucleoprotein network of the nucleus is thought to play important roles in the regulation of gene expression by mediating the colocalization and interaction of transcription factors and/or facilitating the establishment of appropriate chromatin structures. ROS17/2.8 cells were transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged Hes1 and then subjected to two different kinds of biochemical fractionation to determine the subnuclear localization of Hes1. In one procedure, nuclei were isolated and high salt-soluble and -insoluble nuclear fractions were obtained as described previously (43Husain J. Lo R. Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hes1 was poorly extracted from nuclei by high ionic strength conditions (Fig. 2 A,cf. lanes 1 and 2). This behavior is similar to that of other nuclear matrix proteins, including RUNX family members (45Merriman H.L. van Wijnen A.J. Hiebert S. Bidwell J.P. Fey E. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13125-13132Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 47Zeng C. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Meyers S. Sun W. Shopland L. Lawrence J.B. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Hiebert S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6746-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and suggests that Hes1 is tightly associated with internal nuclear compartments. To confirm this possibility, the nuclear matrix isolation procedure of Merriman et al. (45Merriman H.L. van Wijnen A.J. Hiebert S. Bidwell J.P. Fey E. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13125-13132Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) was utilized to test the possibility that Hes1 might associate with this compartment. Cytoplasmic proteins were extracted, and the remaining insoluble fraction was treated with DNase I and RNase A, followed by ammonium sulfate to release chromatin components and nuclear proteins that are not bound to the nuclear matrix. The remaining pellet was then extracted in disassembly buffer to yield nuclear matrix proteins (45Merriman H.L. van Wijnen A.J. Hiebert S. Bidwell J.P. Fey E. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13125-13132Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of this fractionation procedure was confirmed by Western blotting analysis of cytoplasmic, nuclease-treated, and nuclear matrix fractions. The chromatin component, histone H3 was present only in the nuclease-treated fraction (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), whereas the nuclear matrix protein, lamin B1 was only recovered in the nuclear matrix fraction (Fig. 2 C,lane 3). A significant amount of Hes1 immunoreactivity was found in both the nuclease-treated and nuclear matrix fractions (Fig.2 D, lanes 2 and 3), in agreement with the tight association of Hes1 with the high salt-resistant nuclear fraction described above. Because TLE proteins have been shown previously to be associated with both chromatin and the nuclear matrix (44Palaparti A. Baratz A. Stifani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26604-26610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 46Javed A. Guo B. Hiebert S. Choi J.Y. Green J. Zhao S.C. Osborne M.A. Stifani S. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2221-2231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these findings show that Hes1 has a subnuclear distribution similar to that of TLEs. Elimination of the TLE binding ability of Hes1 by removal of the last six amino acids containing the WRPW motif (resulting in the truncated protein Hes1-(1–275)) almost completely abolished the nuclear matrix association of Hes1 (Fig. 2 E, lane 3). This situation was correlated with an increase in the amount of Hes1 found in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 2 E, lane 1). A smaller form of Hes1-(1–275), retaining the amino-terminal FLAG epitope, was also observed under the experimental conditions used to prepare non-nuclear and nuclear fractions (Fig. 2 E,lane 1). This faster-migrating species, likely representing the product of a C-terminal proteolytic degradation, was predominantly found in the cytoplasmic fraction. These findings demonstrate a correlation between the ability of Hes1 to associate with the nuclear matrix and its ability to inter"

We investigated the mechanism of Fas2 inhibition by studying hydrolysis of cationic and neutral substrates and by determining the kinetics of interaction for fast equilibrating cationic and neutral reversible inhibitors with the AChE·Fas2 complex and free AChE. Catalytic parameters, derived by eliminating residual Fas2-resistant activity, reveal that Fas2 reducesk cat/K m up to 106-fold for cationic substrates and less than 103-fold for neutral substrates. Rate constants for association of reversible inhibitors with the active center of the AChE·Fas2 complex were reduced about 104-fold for both cationic and neutral inhibitors, while dissociation rate constants were reduced 102-to 103-fold, compared with AChE alone. Rates of ligand association with both AChE and AChE·Fas2 complex were dependent on the protonation state of ionizable ligands but were also markedly reduced by protonation of enzyme residue(s) with pK a of 6.1–6.2. Linear free energy relationships between the equilibrium constant and the kinetic constants show that Fas2, presumably through an allosteric influence, markedly alters the position of the transition state in the reaction pathway. Since Fas2 complexation introduces an energetic barrier for hydrolysis of substrates that exceeds that found for association of reversible ligands, Fas2 influences catalytic parameters by a more complex mechanism than simple restriction of diffusional entry and exit from the active center. Conformational flexibility appears critical for facilitating ligand passage in the narrow active center gorge for both AChE and the AChE·Fas2 complex.

Inhibition of residual catalytic activity of both complexes by conjugation of the active center serine by either organophosphate or trifluoroacetophenone (TFK) inhibitors, showed only a 1-order of magnitude reduction in reaction rates of cationic inhibitors for the AChE·Fas2 complex when compared with uncomplexed AChE (5Radić Z.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8491-8499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) found that human AChE contained Fas2-resistant esterase activity in purified preparations. Monitoring the phosphorylation rates of fluorescent organophosphates, which exhibit negligible dephosphorylation of the enzyme, enabled these investigators to show that reactions of organophosphates with AChE·Fas2 were 2–3 orders of magnitude slower than those for uncomplexed AChE, a reduction greater than observed in earlier studies (4Eastman J.

Although mouse AChE·Fas2 complex appeared to contain only 0.09% activity resistant to Fas2 inhibition (5Radić Z. Quinn D.M. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol.

By employing an irreversible inhibitor to inhibit selectively the residual Fas2 resistant activity, we demonstrate here that mouse AChE·Fas2 complex retains only about 0.004% catalytic activity at 1 mm ATCh instead of the previously reported 0.09% (5Radić Z.

Stopped-flow techniques with fluorescent detection enabled us to determine rates of association and dissociation of several reversible inhibitors that equilibrate with AChE in a subsecond time frame. Furthermore, we have developed a competitive binding assay utilizing a fluorescent carbamate, M7C, to measure binding rates of nonfluorescent inhibitors to both mouse AChE and the AChE·Fas2 complex. Utilizing these procedures, we present a quantitative characterization of interaction of substrates and reversible inhibitors with the mouse AChE·Fas2 complex. We find that the second order rate constants for reaction of substrates (kcat/K m) and rate constants for association of reversible ligands are significantly reduced, and the transition state barrier is altered for the AChE·Fas2 complex. While the rates of ligand association were reduced around 4 orders of magnitude, catalytic throughput for substrate, kcat/K m, was decreased between 2 and 6 orders of magnitude, thus enabling us to distinguish the rate-limiting steps for catalysis by the AChE·Fas2 complex. Wild-type mouse AChE was expressed in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with cDNA encoding a monomeric form of the enzyme truncated at its carboxyl terminus at position 548.

Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21513) Google Scholar) or at 405 nm for p-nitrophenol. Activities of AChE·Fas2 complexes were measured following a 10-min incubation of 640 nm AChE with 1.3 μm Fas2 to form the complex and 30-min incubation of the complex with 530 nm S P-3,3-dimethylbutyl methylphosphonothiocholine to inhibit hydrolytic activity not originating from the complex. The very slow reaction of the charged organophosphate with the active center of the Fas2·AChE complex gives rise to selective inhibition. Kinetic constants for hydrolysis of the above substrates by AChE and AChE·Fas2 complex were determined as described previously (5Radić Z. Quinn D.M. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20391-20399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The time course of AChE inhibition by trifluoroacetophenones was monitored by measuring ATCh hydrolysis in aliquots from the reaction mixture. Typically, 0.96-ml aliquots were drawn from 10 ml of the reaction mixture and mixed with 30 μl of DTNB (10 mm) and 10 μl of ATCh (100 mm) at specified time intervals to stop inhibition and determine residual enzyme activity. Both the inhibitory reaction and the assessment of residual activity were conducted in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. First order rate constants for inhibition (k) were obtained by fitting fractional enzyme inhibition to the following equation, f=f0+(f∞−f0)(1−e−kt)Equation 1 where f, f 0, andf ∞ are fractions of enzyme inhibited at timest, t = 0, and t = ∞, respectively. Second order inhibition rate constants were derived from plotting the first order rate constants for inhibition against inhibitor concentration and extrapolating to infinite dilution. Association and dissociation rate constants for fast equilibrating fluorescent inhibitors were determined using a SX.18 MV stopped-flow instrument equipped with fluorescence detection (Applied Photophysics). Excitation wavelengths were selected to achieve maximum signal amplitude. Acridine, 9-aminoacridine, and N-methyl acridinium were excited at wavelengths between 250 and 260 nm, coumarin at 220 nm, and propidium at 288 nm. For experiments with nonfluorescent inhibitors BW286C51, edrophonium, and decamethonium, but also for selected fluorescent ligands, AChE or AChE·Fas2 complex was excited at 276 nm (11Bolger M.B. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3622-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Quenching of ligand or AChE fluorescence upon complex formation was monitored using a 305-nm cut-off filter, and for 9-aminoacridine a 335-nm cut-off filter was used. Tacrine association was detected by excitation at 323 nm, with a 335-nm cut-off filter for emission. Linear plots of observed first order rate constants versus ligand concentrations gave second order association rate constants from the slope of the line and a first order dissociation rate constant from the ordinate intercept (11Bolger M.B. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3622-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Nair H.K. Seravalli J. Arbuckle T. Quinn D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8566-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The time courses of TFK, (−)-huperzine, and BW286C51 association with AChE and the AChE·Fas2 complex were followed using N,N-dimethyl carbamoylN-methyl-7-hydroxy-quinolinium (M7C). This nonfluorescent dimethyl carbamoyl ester reacts covalently with the AChE active serine releasing a fluorescent N-methyl-7-quinolinium leaving group (M7H) (λexcitation = 410 nm; λemission = 510 nm; Ref. 13Rosenberry T.L. Bernhard S.A. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4114-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), thus allowing one to monitor both the rate of M7C reaction with the serine and the number of binding sites. The rate of binding of nonfluorescent covalent inhibitors to AChEs was followed by monitoring a decrease in number of AChE binding sites available for M7C reaction resulting from prior covalent reaction with the nonfluorescent inhibitor. Forty μl of 1.0 mm M7C was added to 0.4-ml aliquots drawn at different time intervals from 4 ml of reaction mixture containing buffered solution of an AChE (10–70 nm) with or without Fas2 (650 nm) and the nonfluorescent inhibitor. Aliquots were quickly transferred into a spectrofluorometric cuvette, and the fluorescence increase was followed at λemission = 510 nm (λexcitation = 410 nm) for 20 s in the absence of Fas2 or for 100 s in the presence of Fas2. The fluorescence signal exponentially approached a maximum value, which was diminished with increasing times of prior exposure to the nonfluorescent inhibitor, indicating progress of its reaction. The first order rate constant of binding of nonfluorescent inhibitors was determined by fitting the time dependence of relative change in maximal fluorescence to Equation 1. Equilibrium dissociation constants for several fluorescent reversible ligands were determined by titration with increasing concentrations of AChE or AChE·Fas2 complex, resulting in quenching of ligand fluorescence. Concentrations of free fluorophores during titrations were determined from corresponding calibration curves constructed for each fluorophore, limiting fluorescence quenching in the bound state. Corrections were made for small changes in reaction volume due to the addition of titrant. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) were determined from the reciprocal of the slopes of Scatchard plots. UV-visible spectra of fast equilibrating reversible AChE inhibitors with ionizable functional groups were recorded in buffers of varying pH. Changes of peak absorbances as a function of buffer pH were analyzed using the following equations (rearranged from Ref. 14Aldridge W.N. Reiner E. Enzymes Inhibitors as Substrates: Interactions of Esterases with Esters of Organophosphorus and Carbamic Acids. In Frontiers of Biology. North Holland, Amsterdam Elsevier-North Holland, Amsterdam1972Google Scholar), A=Amin+(Amax−Amin)/(1+Ka/[H+])Equation 2 orA=Amin+(Amax−Amin)/(1+[H+]/Ka)Equation 3 where A min andA max are minimal and maximal peak absorbances and K a is the equilibrium proton dissociation constant. The following buffers were used: 0.10 m citric acid plus 0.20 m sodium phosphate (pH 2.6–7.8) and 0.050m sodium phosphate plus sodium pyrophosphate (pH 5.0–12). Time courses of the M7C reaction with the AChE and the AChE·Fas2 complex are shown in Fig.1. M7C added at a concentration of 100 μm binds to AChE at a rate too fast for measurement by conventional mixing and detection by spectrofluorometry. Hence, the carbamoylation step is reflected in a rapid burst of fluorescence. The reaction of M7C with the AChE·Fas2 complex was slower but was virtually complete within 100 s. The final fluorescence intensities upon carbamoylation and release of M7H were linearly dependent on AChE and AChE·Fas2 concentrations (Fig. 1, B and C). The rapid and stoichiometric reaction of M7C with AChE or the AChE·Fas2 complex enabled us to develop a fluorescent assay for monitoring of binding rates for nonfluorescent ligands. The assay is based on consecutive, rapid M7C titrations of residual catalytically active AChE during the course of its reaction with nonfluorescent ligands. The first order rate constants for reaction were determined by fitting to Equation 1 the fluorescence intensities obtained in subsequent titrations. Good agreement between rate constants for ligand reaction measured from the decrement in the M7C reaction and ligand inhibition of ATCh hydrolysis is evident in TableI.Table ISecond order reaction (kr) and inhibition (ki) rate constants for covalent inhibitors of mouse wild-type AChEInhibitorkr (M7C reaction assay)k i (inhibition of ATCh hydrolysis)m−1s−1m−1 s−1TFK+2.8 × 1093.5 × 109 (Ref. 5Radić Z.

Catalytic hydrolysis of three cationic (ATCh, PTCh, and BTCh) and two neutral (S-PhAc and p NPAc) esters by AChE and AChE·Fas2 was compared. Substrate concentration dependences of AChE hydrolysis deviate from Michaelis kinetics at millimolar substrate concentrations, with ATCh, PTCh, and BTCh inhibiting their own hydrolysis. The kinetics of hydrolysis is characterized by substrate inhibition constants (K ss) and relative activities of enzyme-substrate ternary complexes (b), in addition to Michaelis constants (K m) and maximum turnover rates (k cat) (Table II; Refs. 16Radić Z.

Hydrolysis of neutral substrates by AChE obeyed Michaelis kinetics (Table II), but with K m values up to 2 orders of magnitude larger than for cationic substrates, thus emphasizing the importance of electrostatic interactions in formation of Michaelis complexes. k cat of S-PhAc was similar tok cat values for charged substrates and significantly greater than k cat forp NPAc. A similar relationship between catalytic constants for PhAc and p NPAc has been well described forElectrophorus electricus AChE (20Rosenberry T.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1975; 43: 103-218PubMed Google Scholar). Although the AChE·Fas2 complex hydrolyzed all substrates significantly more slowly than AChE, cationic substrates with high turnover rates were most affected. Hydrolysis of both cationic and neutral substrates by AChE·Fas2 obeyed Michaelis kinetics. Our earlier published curve of ATCh hydrolysis by AChE·Fas2 was biphasic, indicating substrate activation (5Radić Z. Quinn D.M. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20391-20399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The first phase, due to the presence of residual, Fas2-resistant, esterase activity, was inhibited selectively using the organophosphate,S P-3,3-dimethylbutyl methylphosphonothiocholine. Hence with this correction, the ATCh hydrolysis profile for the Fas2·AChE complex shows typical Michaelis kinetics. kcat/K m values for ATCh and PTCh were reduced by 5–6 orders of magnitude, whereask cat/K m for BTCh was reduced by only 3 orders of magnitude. Neutral substrates S-PhAc andp NPAc exhibited much smaller reductions in kcat/K m (680 and 96 times, respectively). The reduction ink cat/K m for the five substrates by AChE·Fas2 resulted in distinct clusters of values for charged and neutral substrates.

In yeast, whereas IMP and AMP synthesis are coregulated, we found that the GMP synthesis pathway is specifically regulated. Transcription of the IMD genes, encoding the yeast homologs of IMP dehydrogenase, was repressed by extracellular guanine. Only this first step of GDP synthesis pathway is regulated, since the latter steps, encoded by the GUA1 and GUK1 genes, are guanine-insensitive. Use of mutants affecting GDP metabolism revealed that guanine had to be transformed into GDP to allow repression of the IMD genes.IMD gene transcription was also strongly activated by mycophenolic acid (MPA), a specific inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase activity. Serial deletions of the IMD2 gene promoter revealed the presence of a negative cis-element, required for guanine regulation. Point mutations in this guanine response element strongly enhanced IMD2 expression, also making it insensitive to guanine and MPA. From these data, we propose that the guanine response element sequence mediates a repression process, which is enhanced by guanine addition, through GDP or a GDP derivative, and abolished in the presence of MPA.

IMP dehydrogenase hydroxyurea mycophenolic acid guanine response element polymerase chain reaction base pair Purine nucleotides are involved in many important cellular processes, and therefore a balanced synthesis of AMP and GMP is required. Cells can synthesize purine nucleotides through the de novo pathway, a 10-step pathway that produces IMP, which in turn serves as the common precursor for AMP and GMP nucleotide biosynthesis (Fig. 1). In yeast, the regulation of the ADE genes involved in AMP biosynthesis has been characterized (1Daignan-Fornier B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2Denis V. Boucherie H. Monribot C. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Expression of the ADE genes is repressed by extracellular adenine and activated by the transcription factors Bas1p and Bas2p. However, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, GMP biosynthesis regulation has not received much attention and is therefore poorly understood. IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH),1 catalyzing the first step of de novo guanine nucleotide synthesis, has a key role on growth of many cell types, including lymphocytes and rapidly proliferating cells (see Ref. 3Zimmermann A.G. Gu J.J. Laliberte J. Mitchell B.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 181-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a recent review).GMP synthesis and its regulation appear to play a crucial role in cell proliferation, since an increased level of IMPDH activity has been observed in rapidly proliferating cells (4Jackson R.C.

Lancet. 1975; 2: 1179-1183Abstract PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Indeed, substances blocking IMPDH activity, such as mycophenolic acid (MPA), act as immunosuppressive drugs and are used to prevent allograft rejection (11–16; see Ref. 17Jain A. Khanna A. Molmenti E.P. Rishi N. Fung J.J. Surg. Clin. North Am. 1999; 79: 59-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar for recent reviews). Moreover, it was recently shown that a low level of IMPDH activity is necessary for p53-dependent growth suppression. Indeed, constitutive expression of IMPDH abolishes p53-dependent growth suppression (18Liu Y. Bohn S.A. Sherley J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), although the exact mechanism is not known.To assess the molecular mechanisms governing guanylic nucleotide synthesis, we have proceeded to study the regulation of GTP synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this yeast, GMP synthetase, GMP kinase, and NDP kinase, required for catalysis of the latter steps of guanylic nucleotide biosynthesis, are encoded by the GUA1, GUK1, and YNK1 genes, respectively (Fig. 1) (19Dujardin G.

By using these features and the complete sequencing of the S. cerevisiaegenome, we have identified four yeast homologs for IMPDHs,YAR073w, YHR216w, YLR432w, and YML056c, that we named IMD1, IMD2,IMD3, and IMD4 genes, respectively. These genes encode proteins with more than 80% amino acid identity to each other and that share about 60% amino acid residues with human IMPDHs type I and type II.In this paper we have studied the regulation of the yeast GMP synthesis genes, and we found that GMP synthesis is differently regulated from IMP and AMP synthesis. We show that the IMD genes transcript levels are impaired by guanine but not by adenine. IMDstranscriptional expression is strongly activated by MPA. Mutational analysis of the sequences upstream of IMD2 ATG allowed us to identify a cis-element (TATAAATA), named guanine response element (GRE), affecting guanine regulation; several trans-mutations affecting regulation of IMDs are also presented. We propose that IMD2 regulation by MPA and guanine takes place through the cis-acting GRE, in response to intracellular concentrations of GDP or a derivative of GDP.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we show that the IMD genes, encoding the S. cerevisiae homologs of IMPDH, are transcriptionally repressed by guanine, which has to be metabolized into GDP or a derivative of GDP to exert its regulatory role. Expression of IMD2 is highly enhanced in the presence of MPA. A cis-negative element, necessary to both guanine and MPA regulation, was found in the IMD2 gene promoter. A simple explanation could be that in response to guanylic nucleotides levels, a repressor could bind to the IMD2 promoter and regulate its transcription. A model for yeast regulation of the guanylic nucleotide synthesis genes is presented in Fig.9.Figure 9Model for IMD2 regulation by MPA and guanine.

Denis and B. Daignan-Fornier, unpublished results. i.e. the signal and transcription factors involved in regulation of IMP and AMP synthesis pathways (1Daignan-Fornier B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2Denis V. Boucherie H. Monribot C. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results establish that AMP and GMP synthesis are differentially regulated in S. cerevisiae.Mechanisms of purine biosynthesis regulation have been elucidated in two bacteria, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. In E. coli, all the genes for AMP and GMP synthesis are repressed by the PurR repressor in the presence of the corepressors hypoxanthine and/or guanine (39Meng L.M. Nygaard P. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2187-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 40Meng L.M. Kilstrup M. Nygaard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, synthesis of AMP and GMP is repressed independently by adenine and guanine nucleotides, whereas adenine nucleotides regulate transcription initiation (via the PurR repressor) (41Weng M. Nagy P.L. Zalkin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7455-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and guanine nucleotides regulate transcription termination by an anti-termination mechanism (42Ebbole D.J. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8274-8287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in these bacteria, regulation of both AMP and GMP biosynthesis pathway genes respond to AMP and GMP precursors, either through a common transcription factor as in E. colior through independent mechanisms as in B. subtilis. The situation is clearly different in yeast where AMP synthesis genes is poorly repressed by guanine (35Guetsova M.L. Lecoq K. Daignan-Fornier B. Genetics. 1997; 147: 383-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and where GMP synthesis genes is not affected by adenine (this study). This differential regulation could be a general feature for eukaryotic organisms since it has been shown that expression of human IMPDH is repressed in the presence of guanosine but not adenosine (43Glesne D.A. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5417-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Negative Regulation of IMPDH Synthesis by Guanylic Nucleotide Levels Is Conserved among EukaryotesExtracellular guanine led to a 3–7-fold decrease of IMD2 transcription, depending on the experiment. The reasons for such variations of the repression factor, which occurred both with Northern blot and β-galactosidase experiments, are unclear. In the fcy2, hpt1, or guk1 mutant strains, guanine failed to repress the IMD genes, indicating that levels of GDP or a GDP derivative negatively regulate IMD gene expression. Deletion of the YNK1 gene, encoding NDP kinase, did not affect guanine repression of IMD genes. Nevertheless, GTP cannot be totally excluded from the guanine signaling pathway, since the ynk1disrupted strain retained 10% of GDP to GTP conversion capacity, when compared with wild-type cells (21Fukuchi T. Nikawa J. Kimura N. Watanabe K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 129: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Inhibition of dNDPs biosynthesis by a severely growth-inhibiting dose of hydroxyurea did not affect guanine regulation of IMD2 gene. Therefore, whereas guanylic ribonucleotide levels regulate IMDs expression, guanylic deoxyribonucleotides apparently do not participate in the guanine repression transduction pathway.In the hpt1 or fcy2 mutant strains,IMD-lacZ fusions were expressed at wild-type levels in the absence of guanine, whereas in the guk1 strain,IMD-lacZ fusions were 2-fold more expressed. We interpret this result as follows: whereas the hpt1 or fcy2mutations affect only preformed purine utilization, the guk1mutation affects both salvage and de novo GDP synthesis. Consequently, GDP levels might be more limiting in a guk1mutant than in a hpt1 or fcy2 mutant strains. Consistently, a pur5 mutant, which is allelic to GUK1 (36Lecoq K. Konrad M. Daignan-Fornier B. Genetics. 2000; 156: 953-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was previously shown to affect IMPDH activity (see the Discussion in Ref. 34Woods R.A. Roberts D.G. Friedman T. Jolly D. Filpula D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 191: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).MPA addition resulted in a 7-fold increase of IMD2transcription, suggesting that blocking XMP synthesis severely depletes guanylic nucleotide supplies and consequently increases IMDsexpression. Guanine addition overcomes this effect, since it allows guanine nucleotides supply through the salvage pathway. Accordingly, in the fcy2, hpt1, or guk1 mutant strains, guanine can no longer bypass MPA effect on the IMDgenes.Therefore, a decrease in guanine nucleotide pools (by MPA or the guk1 mutation) causes an increase in the expression of IMD genes, whereas an increase in these pools (by guanine addition) causes a decrease in IMD genes expression.A similar negative regulation by guanylic nucleotide levels was reported in mammalian cells. Glesne and coworkers (43Glesne D.A. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5417-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have shown that MPA induced a 4-fold increase in the IMPDH mRNA level, whereas guanosine addition decreased it to 20% of the control levels. Moreover, these authors suggested that changes in the levels of guanine ribonucleotide pools, and not deoxyguanine nucleotide pools, are the primary determinant regulating IMPDH gene expression (43Glesne D.A. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5417-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of guanylic nucleotide synthesis appears strongly conserved between yeast and mammals.The GRE cis-Negative Element of IMD2Mapping of the regulatory cis-elements present in the promoter of the IMD2 gene allowed us to identify a GRE, localized 308 to 301 pb upstream of the ATG start codon. Single substitutions of each of the GRE nucleotides to a C prevented guanine regulation of the IMD2 gene and led to an increased transcription of IMD2. Surprisingly, the GRE sequence, TATAAATA, is very similar to the TATA box consensus sequence. Moreover, the TATA-binding protein was shown to bind to the TATAAATA sequence in vitro, although with reduced affinity as compared with binding to the TATATAA consensus sequence (44Wong J.M. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, since the GRE in IMD2is a negative element, it is not expected to behave as a regular TATA box. Therefore, even if TATA-binding protein binds in vivoto the GRE sequence, it should have a different function than in the basal transcription initiation complex. Interestingly, the GRE sequence is also found in the IMD3 and IMD4 genes, at about 300 and 200 bp upstream from their respective ATGs, suggesting that IMD3 and IMD4 might also be regulated through a GRE cis-element. Mutations in the GRE sequence lead to an increased expression of IMD2 gene, suggesting that a repressor transcription factor could bind to the GRE box and repress IMD2 expression. Mutations in the TUP1gene, encoding a corepressor involved in many different repression processes (45Keleher C.A. Redd M.J. Schultz J. Carlson M. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 46Mukai Y. Harashima S. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3773-3779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Zhang M.

Biol. 1990; 10: 6500-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), did not affect guanine regulation of the IMD genes (data not shown). Also, electrophoretic mobility shift assays attempting to show binding of a trans-acting factor to a wild-type GRE, but not to a mutant GRE, were unsuccessful. This could be due to the low concentration of transcription factors in the crude extract used as a protein source.In mammals, increased expression of IMPDH is observed in rapidly proliferating and deregulated cells, suggesting that in normal mammalian cells, IMPDH encoding genes are regulated by a repression mechanism. Moreover, it has recently been shown that in murine cells, p53 needs to repress IMPDH to exert its normal tumor suppression role (18Liu Y. Bohn S.A. Sherley J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet known whether the p53 factor directly binds to human IMPDH-encoding genes. Even though S. cerevisiae does not have any p53 homolog, the overall regulation mechanisms could be conserved between yeast and mammals. Identification of this factor is now necessary to unravel the mechanisms by which IMD2 transcription is controlled. Purine nucleotides are involved in many important cellular processes, and therefore a balanced synthesis of AMP and GMP is required. Cells can synthesize purine nucleotides through the de novo pathway, a 10-step pathway that produces IMP, which in turn serves as the common precursor for AMP and GMP nucleotide biosynthesis (Fig. 1). In yeast, the regulation of the ADE genes involved in AMP biosynthesis has been characterized (1Daignan-Fornier B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2Denis V. Boucherie H. Monribot C. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Expression of the ADE genes is repressed by extracellular adenine and activated by the transcription factors Bas1p and Bas2p. However, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, GMP biosynthesis regulation has not received much attention and is therefore poorly understood. IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH),1 catalyzing the first step of de novo guanine nucleotide synthesis, has a key role on growth of many cell types, including lymphocytes and rapidly proliferating cells (see Ref. 3Zimmermann A.G. Gu J.J. Laliberte J. Mitchell B.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 181-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a recent review). GMP synthesis and its regulation appear to play a crucial role in cell proliferation, since an increased level of IMPDH activity has been observed in rapidly proliferating cells (4Jackson R.C. Weber G. Morris H.P. Nature. 1975; 256: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), including human leukemic cell lines (6Nakamura H. Natsumeda Y. Nagai M. Takahara J. Irino S. Weber G.

Lancet. 1975; 2: 1179-1183Abstract PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Indeed, substances blocking IMPDH activity, such as mycophenolic acid (MPA), act as immunosuppressive drugs and are used to prevent allograft rejection (11–16; see Ref. 17Jain A. Khanna A. Molmenti E.P. Rishi N. Fung J.J. Surg. Clin. North Am. 1999; 79: 59-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar for recent reviews). Moreover, it was recently shown that a low level of IMPDH activity is necessary for p53-dependent growth suppression. Indeed, constitutive expression of IMPDH abolishes p53-dependent growth suppression (18Liu Y. Bohn S.A. Sherley J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), although the exact mechanism is not known. To assess the molecular mechanisms governing guanylic nucleotide synthesis, we have proceeded to study the regulation of GTP synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this yeast, GMP synthetase, GMP kinase, and NDP kinase, required for catalysis of the latter steps of guanylic nucleotide biosynthesis, are encoded by the GUA1, GUK1, and YNK1 genes, respectively (Fig. 1) (19Dujardin G. Kermorgant M. Slonimski P.P. Boucherie H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Konrad M. J. Biol.

IMPDH, catalyzing the first committed step in guanylic nucleotide biosynthesis, has been isolated from a variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources and exhibits a high level of amino acid conservation (22Collart F.R.

https://openalex.org/W2073009787,"Although it is clear that solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex plays an essential role in synaptic vesicle fusion, the dynamics of SNARE assembly during vesicle fusion remain to be determined. In this report, we employ fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique to study the formation of SNARE complexes. Donor/acceptor pair variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) are fused with the N termini of SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin, respectively. In vitro assembly of SNARE core complex in the presence of syntaxin shows strong fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the CFP-SNAP-25 and YFP-synaptobrevin. Under the same conditions, CFP fused to the C terminus of SNAP-25, and YFP- synaptobrevin have no FRET. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer is used to express the fusion proteins in PC12 cells and cultured rat cerebellar granule cells. Strong FRET is associated with neurite membranes and vesicular structures in PC12 cells co-expressing CFP-SNAP-25 and YFP-synaptobrevin. In cultured rat cerebellar granule cells, FRET between CFP-SNAP-25 and YFP-synaptobrevin is mostly associated with sites presumed to be synaptic junctions. Neurosecretion in PC12 cells initiated by KCl depolarization leads to an increase in the extent of FRET. These results demonstrate that significant amounts of stable SNARE complex exist prior to evoked synaptic vesicle fusion and that the assembly of SNARE complex occurs during vesicle docking/priming stage. Moreover, it demonstrates that FRET can be used as an effective tool for investigating dynamic SNARE interactions during synaptic vesicle fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2090105093,"In this study, we sought to investigate the mechanism of the proapoptotic function of Egr-1 in relation to p53 status in normal isogenic cell backgrounds by using primary MEF cells established from homozygous (Egr-1−/−) and heterozygous (Egr-1+/−) Egr-1 knock-out mice. Ionizing radiation caused significantly enhanced apoptosis inEgr-1+/− cells (22.8%; p < 0.0001) when compared withEgr-1−/− cells (3.5%). Radiation elevated p53 protein in Egr-1+/− cells in 3–6 h. However, in Egr- 1−/− cells, the p53 protein was down-regulated 1 h after radiation and was completely degraded at the later time points. Radiation elevated the p53-CAT activity in Egr-1+/− cells but not inEgr-1−/− cells. Interestingly, transient overexpression of EGR-1 in p53−/−MEF cells caused marginal induction of radiation-induced apoptosis when compared with p53+/+ MEF cells. Together, these results indicate that Egr-1 may transregulate p53, and both EGR-1 and p53 functions are essential to mediate radiation-induced apoptosis. Rb, an Egr-1 target gene, forms a trimeric complex with p53 and MDM2 to prevent MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. Low levels of Rb including hypophosphorylated forms were observed inEgr-1 −/− MEF cells before and after radiation when compared with the levels observed inEgr-1 +/− cells. Elevated amounts of the p53-MDM2 complex and low amounts of Rb-MDM-2 complex were observed inEgr-1 −/− cells after radiation. Because of a reduction in Rb binding to MDM2 and an increase in MDM2 binding with p53, p53 is directly degraded by MDM2, and this leads to inactivation of the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway inEgr-1 −/− MEF cells. Thus, the proapoptotic function of Egr-1 may involve the mediation of Rb protein that is essential to overcome the antiapoptotic function of MDM2 on p53. In this study, we sought to investigate the mechanism of the proapoptotic function of Egr-1 in relation to p53 status in normal isogenic cell backgrounds by using primary MEF cells established from homozygous (Egr-1−/−) and heterozygous (Egr-1+/−) Egr-1 knock-out mice.

Thus, the proapoptotic function of Egr-1 may involve the mediation of Rb protein that is essential to overcome the antiapoptotic function of MDM2 on p53. early growth response early growth response-1 gene, CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, EBS, EGR-1-binding site, MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast gray cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase-PCR terminal transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end labeling tumor necrosis factor-α platelet-derived growth factor retinoblastoma gene The apoptotic pathways consist of an early component that includes molecular events specific for an inducer or a group of inducers and of downstream effector components common to diverse apoptotic signals (1Chinnaiyan A.M.

Ionizing radiation alters the expression of specific genes, the products of which may contribute to the events leading to apoptotic cell death.

TheEgr family shows a high degree of homology in the amino acids constituting the zinc finger domain and binds to the same GC-rich consensus DNA sequence (13Christy B. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Structure-function mapping studies on EGR-1 protein suggest that the amino acids constituting the zinc finger motif confer DNA binding function, whereas the NH2- terminal amino acids confer transactivation function (16Gashler A.L.

It is interesting to note that within this family of transcription factors, EGR-1 was found to be a positive activator of transcription, whereas WT1 is a transcriptional repressor, both acting via binding to the same GC-rich consensus sequence in reporter constructs (20Drummond I.A.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6100-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).It has also been speculated that x-ray induction of PDGF, transforming growth factor-β1, and TNF-α may be regulated by Egr-1 and c-jun (6Hallahan D.E. Sukhatme V.P. Sherman M.L. Virudachalam S. Kufe D. Weichselbaum R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2156-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Apart from being a potential transcriptional regulator, Egr-1 has a radiation-inducible promoter. Through these distinct induction pathways, Egr-1 has been linked to signaling events initiating cell phenotypic response to radiation injury.On the other hand, wild type p53 has been shown to be functionally necessary for growth inhibition and apoptosis following exposure to ionizing radiation, and p53 mutations have been reported to increase resistance to apoptosis (34Lee J.M. Bernstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5742-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In our previous report, using melanoma cells, which contain wild type p53, a dose-dependent increase in EGR-1 expression with dose-dependent growth inhibition was observed when exposed to ionizing radiation (35Ahmed M.M. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S.M. Muthukkumar S. Wood Jr., D.P. Sells S.F. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29231-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Transfectant melanoma cells stably expressing the dominant-negative mutant protein of EGR-1 showed significantly reduced (<50%) sensitivity to radiation-inducible growth inhibition, and this resistance was found to be dose-dependent. These observations suggest that the EGR-1 induction is involved in the regulation of radiation-inducible apoptosis despite the presence of wild type p53. Recently, we used a p53 null prostate cancer cell line (PC-3), which was found to be moderately resistant to ionizing radiation-inducible apoptosis (36Ahmed M.M. Sells S.F. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S.M. Muthukkumar S. Harp C. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33056-33061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry studies indicate that EGR-1 is induced in the PC-3 cells by ionizing radiation. Experiments with the Egr-1 dominant-negative mutant or Egr-1 overexpression suggest that Egr-1 function is required for the radiation-inducible apoptosis. Despite the absence of wild type functional p53 protein, the transfected cells expressing the dominant-negative mutant of EGR-1 were resistant to ionizing radiation, and cells overexpressing EGR-1 protein were sensitive to ionizing radiation. Our findings strongly suggested that the radiation-induced apoptotic response in PC-3 cells is elicited through up-regulation of TNF-α protein via EGR-1-mediated transactivation. Thus, EGR-1 is an important mediator of radiation responsiveness irrespective of p53 functional status. However, in a recent report, it was found that EGR-1 protein transactivates the promoter of p53 gene and up-regulates p53 mRNA and protein levels in response to apoptotic stimuli (32Nair P. Muthukkumar S. Sells S.F. Han S.S. Sukhatme V.P. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20131-20138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate further the interactive role of Egr-1 with p53 during the process of apoptosis. We sought to investigate this mechanism in a normal cell background using isogenic normal primary culture cells derived from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) with varied genomic status for Egr-1 gene (cells with both intact Egr-1 alleles,Egr-1 +/+; cells with homozygous deletion ofEgr-1 alleles,Egr-1 −/−; and heterozygous deletion of one Egr-1 allele,Egr-1 +/−). Based on findings from these isogenic normal cells with varied genomic status of Egr-1, we suggest that EGR-1 function is necessary for enhanced sensitivity to radiation-induced apoptosis and that the radiation-induced proapoptotic function of Egr-1 is directly mediated by the target genesp53 and Rb.DISCUSSIONExposure to ionizing radiation is associated with the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates causing direct damage to DNA (44Ward J.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). These reactive oxygen intermediates target the sequence CC(A/T)6GG to mediate the activation of EGR-1 (4Datta R. Taneja N. Sukhatme V.P. Qureshi S.A. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2419-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory (35Ahmed M.M. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S.M. Muthukkumar S. Wood Jr., D.P. Sells S.F. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29231-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have suggested that despite the presence of wild type p53 background, inhibition of the expression or function of EGR-1 causes a diminution of radiation-induced growth inhibition in melanoma cells. In the absence of p53, radiation-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells was found to be mediated by EGR-1 via TNF-α transactivation (36Ahmed M.M. Sells S.F. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S.M. Muthukkumar S. Harp C. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33056-33061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These results suggest thatEgr-1 induction is involved in the radiation-induced signaling of the cascades of apoptosis pathway.In this study, in contrast to Egr-1+/− MEF cells, Egr-1−/− MEF cells were significantly resistant to radiation-inducible apoptosis and showed no elevation of p53 protein after radiation. These observations indicate that radiation-induced EGR-1-mediated transactivation of downstream genes is essential for radiation sensitivity. Thus, in support of previous reports, the present study demonstrates that EGR-1 is the upstream mediator for the initiation of the radiation-induced signaling cascade leading to cell death.The tumor suppressor gene p53 is a central mediator of apoptotic pathways in diverse model systems (45Huang R.P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar, 46Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 47Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 48Owen-Schaub L.B.

The p53 protein can cause transcriptional up-regulation of a number of downstream genes, such as mdm-2, p21waf1/cip1, bax, fas/apo1, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3, which are implicated in growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death (46Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 47Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 48Owen-Schaub L.B. Zhang W. Cusack J.C. Angelo L.S. Santee S.M. Fujiwara T. Roth J.A. Deisseroth A.B. Zhang W.W. Kruzel E. Radinsky R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3032-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In this study, it was found that mRNA levels ofp53, p21waf1/cip1, mdm-2, andbax were elevated after irradiation inEgr-1+/− cells but not inEgr-1−/− cells. In addition, the basal levels of these mRNAs were high inEgr-1−/− MEF cells when compared with Egr-1+/− cells. Loss of radiation-induced elevation of p53 may be attributed to the loss of Egr-1 mediated transregulation of p53 inEgr-1−/− MEF cells, and this may have led to the loss of up-regulation of p53 target genes, p21waf1/cip1, mdm-2, and bax.Radiation caused degradation of p53 protein inEgr-1−/− cells, and this led to enhanced resistance to radiation-inducible apoptosis. Transient overexpression of EGR-1 protein inEgr-1−/− cells restored radiation sensitivity and stabilized the p53 protein levels. Thus, this observation suggests that EGR-1 protein is necessary for the up-regulation and the stability of p53 protein and radiation sensitivity. Moreover, radiation elevated the p53-CAT reporter activity in Egr-1+/− cells but not inEgr-1−/− cells. This observation is supported by a recent study that EGR-1 can directly bind with thep53 promoter at two consensus EGR-1-binding sites and induce the p53 mRNA and protein (32Nair P. Muthukkumar S. Sells S.F. Han S.S. Sukhatme V.P. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20131-20138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, Egr-1 is an important transregulator of p53. However, at this point we cannot rule out the possibility that other genes that are also regulated byEgr-1 may play a role in the stability of p53 protein.A marginal induction of radiation-induced apoptosis observed in p53−/−/CMV-EGR-1 MEF transfectants when compared with p53+/+/CMV-EGR-1 MEF cells suggests that p53 played an important downstream role in regulation ofEgr-1-mediated radiation-induced apoptosis. It also suggests that the absence of p53 may not contribute toward complete abrogation of EGR-1-mediated radiation-induced apoptosis. This is supported by our previous data that in p53 null prostate cancer cell line PC3, EGR-1 overexpression caused super induction of radiosensitivity (36Ahmed M.M. Sells S.F. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S.M. Muthukkumar S. Harp C. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33056-33061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The degree of induction of apoptosis was much higher in p53 null PC3 cells when compared with p53−/−/CMV-EGR-1 MEF transfectant cells in this study. The difference may be due to the tumor cell background versus the normal cell background. Thus, in the absence of p53, EGR-1 may mediate the proapoptotic action of radiation via TNF-α (36Ahmed M.M. Sells S.F. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S.M. Muthukkumar S. Harp C. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33056-33061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or other downstream cell-death effector genes.p53 can bind to the promoter region of MDM2 and activate its transcription, forming an autoregulation loop between the expression and function of p53 and MDM2 (49Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). It is also reported that MDM2-p53 interaction can target p53 for degradation (43Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Rb can regulate the apoptotic function of p53 through binding to MDM2, thus preventing MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 (42Hsieh J.K. Chan F.S. O'Connor D.J. Mittnacht S. Zhong S. Lu X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 181-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Rb can also prevent MDM2 from inhibiting p53-mediated apoptosis. In addition, Rb can protect p53 from MDM2-mediated degradation by forming a trimeric complex with p53 via binding to MDM2 (42Hsieh J.K. Chan F.S. O'Connor D.J. Mittnacht S. Zhong S. Lu X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 181-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To understand further the mechanism of p53 degradation in irradiated Egr-1−/−MEF cells, we investigated the expression and functional interaction of Rb with p53 and MDM2 in Egr-1+/− andEgr-1−/− MEF cells. The rationale for analyzing the Rb function in this normal isogenic cell system is that (a) Rb regulates the apoptotic function of p53 by mitigating MDM2 mediated degradation (42Hsieh J.K. Chan F.S. O'Connor D.J. Mittnacht S. Zhong S. Lu X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 181-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and (b) the Rb gene promoter contains EGR-1-binding sites that conform to the GC-rich consensus (30Day M.L. Wu S. Basler J.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5597-5599PubMed Google Scholar). Low expression levels of hypophosphorylated forms of Rb and decreased Rb-CAT reporter activity were found inEgr-1−/− MEF cells before and after irradiation when compared with Egr-1+/−MEF cells. Relatively higher levels of Rb-MDM2-bound complex and lower levels of p53-MDM2-bound complex were observed in irradiatedEgr-1+/− MEF cells. In contrast, higher amounts of p53-MDM2 complex and low bound forms of the Rb-MDM2 complex were observed in Egr-1−/− cells. Lower amounts of the Rb-MDM2 complex along with higher amounts of p53-MDM2 inEgr-1−/− MEF cells might have contributed to p53 degradation after radiation. Thus, apoptosis caused by ionizing radiation requires the induction of EGR-1 protein, which then transregulates the expression of p53 protein and also indirectly regulates the stability of p53 via Rb. The apoptotic pathways consist of an early component that includes molecular events specific for an inducer or a group of inducers and of downstream effector components common to diverse apoptotic signals (1Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis has also been reported in a variety of experimental tumor systems following exposure to radiation (2Meyn R.E. Stephens L.C. Ang K.K. Hunter N.R. Brock W.A. Milas L. Peters L.J. Int. J.

Ionizing radiation alters the expression of specific genes, the products of which may contribute to the events leading to apoptotic cell death. Ionizing radiation exposure is associated with activation of certain immediate-early genes that function as transcription factors (4Datta R. Taneja N. Sukhatme V.P. Qureshi S.A. Weichselbaum R.

https://openalex.org/W2015913423,"L1 is a neural cell adhesion molecule critical for neural development. Full-length L1 (L1FL) contains an alternatively spliced cytoplasmic sequence, RSLE, which is absent in L1 expressed in nonneuronal cells. The RSLE sequence follows a tyrosine, creating an endocytic motif that allows rapid internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We hypothesized that L1FL would internalize more rapidly than L1 lacking the RSLE sequence (L1ΔRSLE) and that internalization might regulate L1-mediated adhesion. L1 internalization was measured by immunofluorescence microscopy and by uptake of125I-anti-rat-L1 antibody, demonstrating that L1FL is internalized 2–3 times faster than L1ΔRSLE. Inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis slowed internalization of L1FL but did not affect initial uptake of L1ΔRSLE. To test whether L1 endocytosis regulates L1 adhesion, cell aggregation rates were tested. L1ΔRSLE cells aggregated two times faster than L1FL cells. Inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis increases the aggregation rate of the L1FL cells to that of L1ΔRSLEcells. Our results demonstrate that rapid internalization of L1 dramatically affects L1 adhesion. L1 is a neural cell adhesion molecule critical for neural development.

Many cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)1 participate in these events. Although CAM expression appears to be rather static in the adult nervous system, CAM expression is both spatially and temporally dynamic during development. An important question in developmental neurobiology is how expression of CAMs is regulated to allow for the precise adhesive events necessary for proper neural development. The CAMs are responsible for mediating homophilic and heterophilic binding events and, in turn, cell-cell or cell-substrate interactions (1Brümmendorf T. Rathjen F.G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Many CAMs interact with signaling molecules (2Schaefer A. Lemmon V. Sonderegger P.

The importance of proper L1 function is demonstrated by the severe complications resulting from mutations in the human L1 molecule (20Fransen E. Lemmon V. Van Camp G. Vits L. Coucke P. Willems P.J.

Mutations in L1 can disrupt proper L1 adhesive function, which in turn causes mistakes in cell migration and axon extension. Alternative RNA splicing results in two L1 isoforms (22Miura M. Kobayashi M. Asou H. Uyemura K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Neurons express the full-length form, L1FL. Non-neuronal L1-positive cells express L1 lacking the cytoplasmic sequence, RSLE, as well as a short extracellular sequence (22Miura M. Kobayashi M. Asou H. Uyemura K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The presence of RSLE in L1FL creates the sequence YRSL in the cytoplasmic domain. This corresponds to a tyrosine-based clathrin recognition motif, Y XXA, where A is any hydrophobic amino acid (23Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The YRSLE sequence is necessary for proper sorting of L1 to axons (24Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3749-3756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The YRSLE sequence in L1FL is recognized by the μ2 subunit of AP-2 (25Kamiguchi H. Long K.E. Pendergast M. Schaefer A.W. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a clathrin-associated adaptor protein used in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. L1FL, but not L1ΔRSLE, is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (25Kamiguchi H. Long K.E. Pendergast M. Schaefer A.W. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the most rapid form of receptor-mediated endocytosis. We hypothesized that L1FL is internalized more rapidly than L1ΔRSLE. Using either immunofluorescence techniques or radioactively labeled antibodies, we found that L1FL is internalized significantly faster than L1ΔRSLE. Using dominant negative dynamin adenovirus infection or intracellular potassium deprivation, we showed that the difference in internalization is due to clathrin-mediated endocytosis of L1FL. Next we examined how endocytosis influences L1 adhesiveness. L1FL and L1ΔRSLE cells with similar L1 cell surface expression levels were allowed to aggregate over time. L1FL cells aggregated more slowly than L1ΔRSLE cells, but when clathrin-mediated endocytosis was inhibited, the L1FL cells aggregated more rapidly, at a rate indistinguishable from L1ΔRSLE cells. This demonstrates that alterations in L1 internalization can regulate L1-mediated adhesion. L cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), sodium pyruvate (Sigma), antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mm glutamine and maintained in a 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humid air incubator in plastic tissue culture flasks. Stably transfected L cells expressing full-length rat L1FL (L3-2 cells) or L1ΔRSLEcells lacking the RSLE sequence (L4-2 cells) were obtained (26Miura M. Asou H. Kobayashi M. Uyemura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10752-10758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Takeda Y. Asou H. Murakami Y. Miura M. Kobayashi M. Uyemura K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2338-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Expression of L1 in the transfected L cells was maintained using 60 μg/ml G418 (CLONTECH). Populations of L1FL or L1ΔRSLE cells expressing equal levels of surface L1 were obtained by flow cytometery based on immunofluorescence of cells labeled on ice with rabbit anti-rat-L1 antibody (28Brittis P.A. Lemmon V. Rutishauser U. Silver J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 433-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 2-well slide chambers (Nalge-Nunc Labtek) 12–24 h before the experiment. Warm culture medium containing a 1:250 dilution of rabbit anti-L1 antibody was added, and dishes were incubated at 37 °C. After 10 or 60 min, cells were placed on ice and rinsed three times with 4 °C culture medium and fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Sigma). Cell surface antibody was detected with a 1:500 dilution of Texas Red goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. Then cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with 0.25 mg/ml of unlabeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) to block cell surface anti-L1 antibody. The cell surface secondary antibody was post-fixed for 5 min using formaldehyde. After washing, cells were blocked and permeabilized with 10% horse serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. To label internalized L1, cells were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of Oregon Green goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) in 5% horse serum, PBS, 0.02% Triton X-100. Then slides were rinsed three times with PBS and mounted with Slow Fade Light Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Slides were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope using a 100× lens. To standardize the collection of images, the cell z-axis heights were measured, and optical slices were collected through the middle of the cells. The average brightness of at least 30 cells from each experimental group was measured using the Metamorph image analysis program. Each experiment was performed a minimum of three times. All cells in randomly selected images were analyzed. Average brightness measurements were statistically analyzed to determine the mean, S.D., and outcomes of relevant two-sided t tests. Average brightness measurements were normalized to the brightness value of L1FL cells incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Adenovirus expressing either hemagglutinin-tagged dominant negative mutant K44A dynamin or β-galactosidase were the gift of J. E. Pessin (29Ceresa B.P. Kao A.W. Santeler S.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

Cells were incubated with anti-rat-L1 antibody and stained as described above except that unconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was bound to cell surface anti-L1 antibody. To identify virus-infected cells, fixed-permeabilized cells were labeled with anti-hemagglutinin (Sigma) antibody to detect dominant negative dynamin or anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Only hemagglutinin-positive or β-galactosidase-positive cells were analyzed for internalized L1. Cells were rinsed three times with K+-free HEPES-buffered saline (HBSK−; 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 g/literd-glucose). Then cells were hypotonically shocked by incubating them for 10 min in a 1:1 solution of HBSK− and water. Cells were rinsed three times with HBSK− and allowed to recover in HBSK− for 10 min at 37 °C (30Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). L1FL or L1ΔRSLE cells were plated on 0.01% poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) at 1–2 × 105 cells/well. Cells were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then 0.5 ml was added of either HBSK+ (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 g/liter glucose, 5 mm KCl) with 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) or HBSK− with 5% fetal bovine serum dialyzed against 1 m NaCl to remove potassium. Plates were placed in a 37 °C water bath and incubated with 13.4 nm125I-anti-rat-L1 IgG (876 cpm/fmol). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold HBSK+ or HBSK−. To determine the amount of cell-associated radioactivity, sextuplicate samples were dissolved in 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 n NaOH and then collected and counted in a γ counter. To determine the amount of internalized radioactivity, sextuplicate samples were incubated for 15 s with ice-cold 0.25 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.7, to strip cell surface radioactivity. Cells were rinsed three times with HBSK+, and samples were dissolved and counted to determine radioactivity. Data are presented as percent radioactivity internalized, which represents the internalized radioactivity divided by the total cell-associated radioactivity. Cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in calcium- and magnesium-free, HBSK+ or HBSK− supplemented with 1 mm EDTA. Next, 0.002% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells in medium containing trypsin were collected in the presence of 2% dialyzed K+-free fetal bovine serum and centrifuged at 180 ×g for 5 min. Cells were chilled on ice and suspended briefly in 1 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4containing DNase I (Sigma). Cells were further diluted in ice-cold calcium- and magnesium-free HBSK+ or HBSK− and divided into scintillation vials chilled on ice. At time 0, cells were placed in a 37 °C incubator and rotated at 55 rpm. At various times, samples were fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Fixed samples were counted in a Coulter Counter to determine particle number. Percent aggregation was determined from the particle number at time zero (N0) and the particle number at time t (Nt) using the formula ((N0− Nt)/(N0)) × 100. Paired t tests of the mean were performed on samples incubated for 20 and 30 min for the following groups: L1FL versus L1ΔRSLE cells, K+-deprived L1FL versusL1FL cells, and K+-deprived L1ΔRSLE versusL1ΔRSLE cells. To study the time course of internalization of different L1 isoforms, L1FL cells or L1ΔRSLE cells were incubated in the presence of rabbit anti-L1 antibody for 10 or 60 min at 37 or at 4 °C for 30 min. At the end of the incubations, cells were fixed but not permeabilized, and their cell surface L1 was stained with a Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody followed by unconjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Then cells were permeabilized, and internalized L1 was labeled with Oregon green-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The experiment was also performed at 4 °C, which inhibits all forms of endocytosis (33Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Cells incubated at 4 °C showed no green internal fluorescence after a 30-min incubation (Fig.1). This demonstrates that our immunofluorescence method discriminates between cell surface and internalized L1. After 10 min at 37 °C, both L1FL cells and L1ΔRSLE cells had internalized anti-L1 antibody, seen as green punctate staining. However, L1FLcells had many more green-labeled vesicles than L1ΔRSLE cells (Fig. 1, C and D). At 60 min, both L1-expressing cell types contained similar amounts of green-labeled vesicles (Fig. 1, E and F). Image analysis revealed that after a 10-min incubation, L1FL cells had internalized approximately 3 times more L1 than L1ΔRSLE cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2). After 60 min, both L1FL cells and L1ΔRSLE cells had similar amounts of internalized L1 (Fig. 2). The internalized L1 is probably similar at 60 min because the internalized antibody in both cell lines has reached steady state, balancing uptake and recycling to the cell surface.Figure 2Average brightness (pixel intensity) of internalized L1 in confocal micrographs from the experiment shown in Fig. 1. After 10 min at 37 °C, there was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) between L1FL and L1ΔRSLE cells (asterisk). After 60 min, no statistically significant difference was seen between the two L1-transfected cell lines. Data is from one representative experiment.

Dynamin is required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (34van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar,35Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and K44A dominant negative dynamin expression blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis specifically (29Ceresa B.P. Kao A.W. Santeler S.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3862-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 36Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Cells were infected with adenovirus expressing mutant dynamin or with adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase as a control. Twelve to sixteen hours after virus infection, the uptake of anti-L1 antibody over 10 min at 37 °C was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. As expected, L1ΔRSLE cells internalized 40% of the L1 of L1FL cells (Fig. 3). After infection with K44A dominant negative dynamin, L1FL cells and L1ΔRSLE cells internalized equal amounts of L1. This suggests that the difference between L1FL and L1ΔRSLE internalization was due to clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the L1FL isoform. Surprisingly, both the infected L1FL cells and L1ΔRSLE cells internalized approximately twice as much L1 as uninfected L1ΔRSLE cells (Fig. 3.) This effect has been reported previously and has been attributed to a compensatory up-regulation of clathrin-independent endocytosis (36Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 37Damke H. Baba T. van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We also analyzed cells infected with β-galactosidase adenovirus that should not affect internalization. After 10 min at 37 °C, infected L1FL cells had internalized twice as much L1 as infected L1ΔRSLE cells, similar to uninfected cells. These results indicate that adenovirus infection itself did not affect internalization rates. To further examine whether L1 was internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we deprived cells of potassium by hypotonic shock in K+-free medium. Depletion of K+ has been shown to inhibit clathrin-coated pit formation and receptor-mediated endocytosis (31Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) as well as some forms of clathrin-independent endocytosis (38Carpentier J.L. Sawano F. Geiger D. Gorden P. Perrelet A. Orci L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We found that K+deprivation of L1FL cells reduced internalization of L1 by ∼40% compared with untreated L1FL cells during a 10-min incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 4), equaling that of L1ΔRSLE. In contrast, K+depletion did not affect the low level of internalization in L1ΔRSLE cells. The inhibition of L1FL uptake by K+ depletion suggests that this molecule is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The low level of uptake in K+-depleted L1FL cells suggests that L1FL can also be taken up by a clathrin-independent process. L1ΔRSLE is also taken up by this process, since uptake of this protein was low and was not inhibited by K+ depletion. To confirm the immunohistochemistry results demonstrating that L1FL internalizes more rapidly than L1ΔRSLE in transfected L cells, we quantified the uptake of radioactive anti-L1 antibody. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 125I-anti-L1 antibody. At various times, both cell-associated and intracellular radioactivity were determined. Levels of cell-associated IgG showed similar time-dependent increases in the two cell lines (data not shown). However, the internalization of antibody was different (Fig.5). Antibody internalization was more rapid in L1FL cells than in L1ΔRSLE cells. At the earliest time (5 min), L1FL cells internalized nearly twice as much antibody as L1ΔRSLE cells. Analysis of three experiments revealed that the difference between L1FL and L1ΔRSLE cells was statistically significant (p < 0.05) at the 5- and 10-min times. The effect of K+ deprivation on internalization of125I-anti-L1 antibody was evaluated. K+-depleted L1FL cells internalized less than half as much L1 as untreated cells after 5 and 10 min (Fig. 5). K+ depleted L1FL cells internalized similar amounts of L1 as K+-deprived L1ΔRSLE cells. The effect of potassium deprivation on L1ΔRSLE cells was not statistically significant in the 5- or 10-min incubation samples compared with untreated L1ΔRSLE cells. However, the effect of K+ deprivation on L1ΔRSLE internalization was larger than expected. Furthermore, potassium deprivation reduced L1 internalization of L1ΔRSLE cells significantly (p < 0.01) after the 30-min incubation. The effect of K+ deprivation on L1ΔRSLEinternalization is probably because potassium deprivation also inhibits some forms of clathrin-independent endocytosis (38Carpentier J.L. Sawano F. Geiger D. Gorden P. Perrelet A. Orci L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To examine the role of L1 endocytosis on adhesiveness, cells were tested for their ability to aggregate via L1-L1 homophilic binding. Cells were removed from tissue culture plates, and single cell suspensions were placed in a rotary shaker to aggregate and then counted in a Coulter Counter to assess particle number. L1ΔRSLE cells aggregated significantly more rapidly than L1FL cells (Fig.6). At 20 and 30 min, the L1ΔRSLE aggregation was approximately twice that of L1FL cells. The 2-fold difference in aggregation rates between the two L1-expressing cell types was statistically significant (Fig. 6.) To examine the role of endocytosis on L1-mediated adhesion, the aggregation of K+-depleted cells was examined (31Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Interestingly, inhibition of endocytosis dramatically increased the aggregation rate of L1FL cells. After 20 and 30 min, K+-deprived L1FL cells aggregated almost identically to L1ΔRSLE cells. This represents a 2-fold increase in aggregation rate compared with control L1FL cells. The aggregation rate of L1ΔRSLE cells after K+ depletion was not different from the untreated L1ΔRSLEcell aggregation rate. To rule out the possibility that inhibition of endocytosis affected the aggregation rate by changing cell surface L1 levels (39Hoffman S. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5762-5766Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), these levels were measured by confocal microscopy. L1FL and L1ΔRSLE cells with and without K+ depletion all had similar levels of cell surface L1 (data not shown), demonstrating that measurable changes in surface L1 expression are not responsible for the effect of K+depletion on cell adhesion. Consequently, we conclude that clathrin-mediated endocytosis directly regulates L1-mediated cell adhesion. Our results demonstrate that L1FL is internalized more rapidly than L1ΔRSLE in transfected L cells and that inhibition of L1 clathrin-mediated endocytosis results in elimination of the differences in internalization rates of the two L1 isoforms. Blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis also completely eliminates the difference in aggregation between L1FL and L1ΔRSLE cells. The differences in internalization and adhesion of the two L1 forms are due to the alternatively spliced cytoplasmic sequence. The RSLE sequence is the only difference between the L1FL and the L1ΔRSLE used in our experiments. The sequence that is spliced out of the extracellular sequence in non-neuronal L1-positive cells (27Takeda Y. Asou H. Murakami Y. Miura M. Kobayashi M. Uyemura K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2338-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was present in the L1ΔRSLE cells. The complete amino acid conservation in the cytoplasmic domain among mammalian forms of L1 indicates that it has a critical function. The fact that mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of human L1 cause mental retardation and axon guidance errors further supports this idea (21Yamasaki M. Thompson P. Lemmon V. Neuropediatrics. 1997; 28: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that the L1 cytoplasmic domain is phosphorylated by several kinases (40Wong E.V. Schaefer A. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 41Wong E.V. Schaefer A.W. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37965-37973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and that it interacts with both actin (43Dahlin-Huppe K. Berglund E.O. Ranscht B. Stallcup W.B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 144-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and ankyrin (3Garver T.D. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Studies of integrins have shown that phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domains can influence CAM adhesion by altering the conformation of the extracellular domain (44Blystone S.D. Williams M.P. Slater S.P. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28757-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our studies show that a different mechanism may work to regulate L1-mediated adhesion. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis after L1FL binding could reduce L1-mediated adhesion. The current results indicate that differences in L1 internalization rate between L1FL and L1ΔRSLEexplains the slower aggregation of L1FL versusL1ΔRSLE cells. It was shown previously that L1FL cells aggregate more slowly than L1ΔRSLE cells (27Takeda Y. Asou H. Murakami Y. Miura M. Kobayashi M. Uyemura K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2338-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The difference in aggregation rate was difficult to explain for two reasons. First, the cells expressed similar amounts of cell surface L1. Not surprisingly, reduced L1FL cell surface expression has been shown to reduce cell adhesion in other aggregation studies (45Wong E.V. Cheng G. Payne H.R. Lemmon V. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Second, two earlier reports demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain is not required by L1 or by the Drosophila homologue neuroglian for homophilic adhesion (45Wong E.V. Cheng G. Payne H.R. Lemmon V. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 46Hortsch M. Wang Y. Marikar Y. Bieber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18809-18817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since the extracellular domain is necessary and sufficient for L1-mediated adhesion (27Takeda Y. Asou H. Murakami Y. Miura M. Kobayashi M. Uyemura K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2338-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), it was difficult to explain how a sequence difference in the cytoplasmic domain affects L1 adhesion. We found that inhibiting endocytosis of L1 molecules increases the L1FL cell aggregation rate to that of L1ΔRSLE cells. However, as expected, inhibition of endocytosis does not affect L1ΔRSLE cell aggregation rate. The deletion of the RSLE sequence in L1ΔRSLE eliminates the YRSL sequence, which is required for L1 clathrin-mediated endocytosis (25Kamiguchi H. Long K.E. Pendergast M. Schaefer A.W. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two observations indicate that L1 adhesion is regulated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been shown to regulate the cell surface expression of many proteins including the epidermal growth factor receptor (47Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) and low density lipoprotein receptor (48Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as CAMs (49Bailey C.H. Chen M. Keller F. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 256: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). For example, cell surface expression of E-cadherin, another CAM, is regulated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (30Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). How might a difference in L1 internalization rate regulate its adhesion? Early modeling studies of homophilic CAM binding suggested that after CAM binding, individual pairs of bound molecules rapidly cycle between the bound and unbound states (50Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). Other studies indicate that L1 homophilic binding events trigger internalization (42Schaefer A.W. Kamiguchi H. Wong E.V. Beach C.M. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37965-37973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 51Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 3676-3686Crossref Google Scholar). An increased internalization rate for L1FL would cause it to be more rapidly removed from the membrane after L1 homophilic binding than L1ΔRSLE. Although momentarily unbound, more L1FL molecules would be endocytosed from the cell surface in response to CAM trans-binding events. L1ΔRSLE would remain on the surface longer because of slower internalization and reengagement in L1 trans binding. This effect of internalization is consistent with studies of the transferrin receptor, where its endocytosis occurs at a rate similar to transferrin binding. As a consequence, the apparent Kd for transferrin binding is 20-fold higher at 37 °C, when endocytosis can occur, than at 0 °C, when endocytosis is blocked (52Davis R.J. Faucher M. Racaniello L.K. Carruthers A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13126-13134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies raise the possibility that L1 adhesion can be regulated by modulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis of L1FL. Phosphorylation or dephosphorylation has been shown to control clathrin-mediated endocytosis of many proteins and to be necessary for initiation of cell signaling events (53Holbrook M.R. O' Donnell J.B. Slakey L.L. Gross D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9348-9356Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 54Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Numerous reports demonstrate features of the L1 cytoplasmic domain that might affect L1 adhesion via regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. For example, casein kinase II, a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase, phosphorylates the L1 cytoplasmic domain at serine 1181 in rat brain extracts (41Wong E.V. Schaefer A.W. Landreth G. Lemmon V. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The serine is located directly C-terminal to the tyrosine-based motif YRSL in the L1 cytoplasmic domain. It is known that casein kinase II phosphorylation at serine residues C-terminal to tyrosine-based motifs is required for or enhances binding of μ2 of AP-2, a clathrin adaptor protein, before endocytosis (55Mauxion F. Le Borgne R. Munier-Lehmann H. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2171-2178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 56Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Previous studies of furin endocytosis demonstrate that casein kinase II phosphorylation on two different serines C-terminal to its tyrosine-based sorting signal enhances its internalization (57Teuchert M. Berghofer S. Klenk H. Garten W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36781-36789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), regulating sorting to degradation or recycling pathways (58Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1399-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine in the CTLA-4 receptor tyrosine-based sorting signal by src kinase prevents μ2 binding and, therefore, inhibits endocytosis (59Bradshaw J.D. Lu P. Leytze G. Rogers J. Schieven G.L. Bennett K.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15975-15982Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). L1 clathrin-mediated endocytosis also might be inhibited by phosphorylation of tyrosine 1176 in the YRSL signal. Rapid clathrin-mediated endocytosis of L1FL may participate in the adhesive changes necessary for proper cellular migration and axon outgrowth. Modeling studies demonstrate that rapid changes in adhesion are necessary for axon outgrowth (60Schmidt C.E. Dai J.W. Lauffenburger D.A. Sheetz M.P. Horwitz A.F. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3400-3407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that L1 is internalized at the rear of growth cones (25Kamiguchi H. Long K.E. Pendergast M. Schaefer A.W. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This internalization may allow for rear de-adhesion of the growth cone. After internalization, L1 is recycled to the front of the growth cone and reinserted into the membrane for adhesion (25Kamiguchi H. Long K.E. Pendergast M. Schaefer A.W. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 3676-3686Crossref Google Scholar). The more rapid internalization of L1FL is likely responsible for the increased cell migration rate of L1FL cells on an L1 substrate compared with L1ΔRSLE cells (27Takeda Y. Asou H. Murakami Y. Miura M. Kobayashi M. Uyemura K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2338-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Upon L1-L1 binding during migration, L1FL cells can migrate faster because, after adhesion to the substrate, the rear of the cell can de-adhere. Testing this in neurons is challenging due to difficulties of expressing mutated proteins on nondividing cells and combining this with neurite outgrowth studies. However, this may be possible with recent advances in transfection methods. We have shown that L1FL internalizes faster than L1ΔRSLE in transfected L cells due to clathrin-mediated endocytosis of L1FL. Blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis eliminated the difference in L1 internalization between the two isoforms. Inhibition of endocytosis by depletion of intracellular potassium dramatically increases L1FL cell adhesion but has no effect on L1ΔRSLE cell adhesion. Blocking endocytosis did not affect overall L1 cell surface expression. Rather, we hypothesize that rapid clathrin-mediated endocytosis affects the dwell time of L1FL on the cell surface and causes it to be internalized more rapidly after L1-L1 binding. Restricting the location of endocytic machinery in growth cones (25Kamiguchi H. Long K.E. Pendergast M. Schaefer A.W. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Lemmon V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5311-5321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of critical residues in the L1 cytoplasmic domain may provide key mechanisms for regulating L1-dependant axon growth. Internalization of CAMs via clathrin may be a general mechanism by which cell migration and axon growth is regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2002600941,"We have previously generated a mouse strain with a defect in its heparin biosynthesis by targeting the gene forN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-2 (NDST-2). The NDST-2−/− mice show reduced levels of various mast cell mediators such as histamine and various heparin-binding mast cell proteases, including chymases, tryptases, and carboxypeptidase A. In this work we have addressed the possible functional consequences of the lack of sulfated heparin. Peritoneal cells were harvested from normal and NDST-2−/− mice. After culturing the cells, conditioned media were collected and were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Several differences in the protein patterns were observed, including the presence of large amounts of a ∼250-kDa protein in medium from NDST-2−/− mice that was absent in normal controls. Peptide microsequencing revealed identity of this protein with fibronectin. Western blot analysis showed the presence of fibronectin degradation products in cell cultures from normal mice, which were absent in cultures from NDST-2−/− animals. Further experiments showed that the degradation of fibronectin observed in cell cultures from NDST-2+/+ mice was catalyzed by mast cell chymase in a strongly heparin-dependent manner. This report thus indicates a biological function for chymase/heparin proteoglycan complexes in fibronectin turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2010958617,"p53 plays a pivotal role in transmitting signals from many forms of genotoxic stress to genes and factors that control the cell cycle and apoptosis. We have previously shown that the human T-lymphotropic virus type I Tax protein can inhibit p53 function. Recently we reported that Tax inhibits p53 function in Jurkat cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts through a mechanism involving the nuclear factor κB pathway and correlates with phosphorylation on serines 15 and 392 of p53. However, several groups have also observed a mechanism that correlates with p300 binding of Tax. To address this controversy and to determine the mechanism by which Tax inhibits p53 function, we examined the activation functions of Tax required for p53 inhibition. In HeLa and H1299 cells the cAMP-response element-binding protein/activating transcription factor activation function is essential, as demonstrated by the Tax mutants M47 and K88A. In addition, expression of exogenous p300 in H1299 cells allows full recovery of p53 transactivation in the presence of Tax. Consistent with p300 being a limiting factor in H1299, Saos-2, and HeLa cells, we found that the level of endogenous p300 is relatively low in these cells compared with Jurkat cells or the human T-lymphotropic virus type I-infected C81 and MT2 cells. Thus our data suggests that Tax utilizes distinct mechanisms to inhibit p53 function that are cell type-dependent. p53 plays a pivotal role in transmitting signals from many forms of genotoxic stress to genes and factors that control the cell cycle and apoptosis.

The principal target for HTLV-I infection in the lymphoid system is mature CD4+ CD45RO+ T lymphocytes, although other cell types of lymphoid origin have been infected by HTLV-I in vitro, including CD8+ T cells, B cells, and macrophages (5Hollsberg P.

Several groups have, however, established that the viral transcriptional activator protein, Tax, plays a critical role in cellular transformation (5Hollsberg P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

This is underscored by the fact that the p53 gene is mutated in about 60% of all human cancers. Interestingly, the p53 protein is functionally inactive in the majority of adult T-cell leukemia patients although wild-type in sequence (15Reid R.L. Lindholm P.F. Mireskandari A. Dittmer J.

Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We do not see a correlation between HTLV-I LTR activation or p300/CBP binding and Tax-mediated p53 inhibition. Moreover, in Jurkat cells expression of exogenous p300 fails to rescue p53 activity in the presence of Tax. These results argue against the recent model proposed by Kaida et al., Suzuki et al., and Van Orden et al. (26Kaida A. Ariumi Y. Ueda Y. Lin J.Y. Hijikata M. Ikawa S. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Suzuki T. Uchida-Toita M. Yoshida M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4137-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 28Van Orden K.

In an attempt to address the discrepancies that exist in the mechanism of Tax-mediated p53 inhibition, we investigated whether there was a cell type dependence for the mechanism of Tax-mediated inhibition. Unlike what was observed in Jurkat T cells, Tax-mediated p53 inhibition in the p53 null fibroblast cell lines, HeLa, Saos-2, and H1299, was dependent on CREB/ATF activation. In addition, using p53 site-specific mutants, we found that the CREB/ATF-dependent p53 inhibition did not correlate with phosphorylation on Ser-15 or Ser-392. Interestingly in H1299 cells, expression of exogenous p300 but not PCAF allows recovery of p53 activity in the presence of Tax. Of importance, endogenous levels of p300 in HeLa, Saos-2, and H1299 cells are relatively low as compared with Jurkat cells and the HTLV-I-transformed cells C81 and MT2. Our results are consistent with a model in which Tax utilizes two distinct mechanisms for inhibiting p53 function. In lymphocytes, the in vivo target for HTLV-I, Tax-mediated p53 inhibition is NF-κB-dependent and correlates with p53 phosphorylation on Ser-15 and Ser-392. In contrast, in cells where p300 is limiting, Tax-mediated p53 inhibition is CREB/ATF-dependent and does not correlate with p53 phosphorylation. Whereas exogenous expression of p300 in the nonlymphoid cells can restore p53 transactivation function, Tax binding to p300 is not sufficient to explain the defect of M47 in p53 inhibition, indicating a more complex mechanism for Tax-mediated p53 inhibition in these cells. Jurkat and HTLV-I-transformed MT2 and C81 cells were maintained at 2 × 105 to 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfection of Jurkat cells was performed as described previously (20Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6348-6355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The following antibodies were used in Western blot analysis of transfections and nuclear extracts: anti-DO-1 (Oncogene Research Products) for p53, anti-Tax (TAb172), anti-p300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-flag (Sigma), and anti-tubulin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Western blot procedures were performed as described previously (16Pise-Masison C.A. Choi K.S. Radonovich M. Dittmer J. Kim S.J. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (16Pise-Masison C.A. Choi K.S. Radonovich M. Dittmer J. Kim S.J. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a Berthold luminometer. All graphs were generated using the Prism Graphics program. Nuclear extracts were prepared. Briefly, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and pellets were suspended in cytoplasmic lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), swelled on ice for 15 min, and vortexed for 10 s after addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.6%.

Several mutations in Tax have been described that selectively abrogate the ability of Tax to activate transcription through the CREB/ATF and NF-κB transcriptional activation pathways (21Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 22Harrod R. Tang Y. Nicot C. Lu H.S. Vassilev A. Nakatani Y. Giam C.Z. Mol. Cell.

To compare the functions of Tax required for p53 inhibition in HeLa, H1299, and Jurkat cells, the well characterized Tax mutants M22, M47, and K88A (21Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 22Harrod R. Tang Y. Nicot C. Lu H.S. Vassilev A. Nakatani Y. Giam C.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5052-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) were used. Consistent with our previous report (23Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Jiang H. Ashcroft M. Radonovich M. Duvall J. Guillerm C. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), transient transfection of Jurkat T cells with Tax-wild type, -M47, and -K88A inhibits p53 transactivation (Fig. 1 A). Expression of the NF-κB-deficient Tax mutant M22 did not inhibit p53 transactivation. Similar results were obtained in mouse embryo fibroblasts, which contain an endogenous wild-type p53 (23Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Jiang H. Ashcroft M. Radonovich M. Duvall J. Guillerm C. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, in H1299 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1 A), Tax-wild type and -M22 inhibited p53 transactivation, but the CREB activation-deficient mutants M47 and K88A did not. Similar results were observed in Saos-2 cells (data not shown). We next analyzed the level of p53 and Tax protein expression. In contrast to our published results in Jurkat cells (23Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Jiang H. Ashcroft M. Radonovich M. Duvall J. Guillerm C. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), inhibition of p53 transactivation correlates with increased steady state levels of p53 protein in HeLa and H1299 cells (Figs. 1 B and 2 B). Importantly, as shown in Fig.1 B, the Tax constructs were expressed to similar levels and therefore do not account for the differences seen on p53 function. These results are consistent with the recent report by Mulloy et al. (30Mulloy J.C. Kislyakova T. Cereseto A. Casareto L. LoMonico A. Fullen J. Lorenzi M.V. Cara A. Nicot C. Giam C. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8852-8860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which the M47 Tax mutant failed to inhibit p53 function in U2OS, Calu-6, and HeLa/Tat cells. We have previously reported that in Jurkat cells, Tax-mediated p53 inhibition is dependent on phosphorylation of serines 15 and 392 of p53 (23Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Jiang H. Ashcroft M. Radonovich M. Duvall J. Guillerm C. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because the properties of Tax required of p53 inhibition differed in the different cell types, it is also possible that the phosphorylation-related inhibition of p53 is also different. Using p53 site-specific mutants, we examined whether phosphorylation of p53 in H1299 cells correlated with p53 inhibition. Jurkat and H1299 cells were transiently cotransfected with either wild-type p53 or the p53 mutant constructs S9A, S15A, S392A, and S15A,S392A in the absence or presence of Tax. As reported previously, in Jurkat cells Tax could efficiently inhibit wild-type p53 or the p53 mutants S15A or S392A (Fig.2 A). Tax did not inhibit the p53 mutant S15A,S392A (23Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Jiang H. Ashcroft M. Radonovich M. Duvall J. Guillerm C. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, in H1299 cells Tax inhibited p53 transactivation of all p53 constructs examined (Fig.2 B). These results suggest that p53 inhibition in H1299 cells is not dependent on phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-392. Consistent with the results presented above (Fig. 1 B), expression of Tax increased the steady state level of wild-type p53 as well as p53 site-specific mutant constructs (Fig. 2 B). As seen above, we find that inhibition of p53 by Tax correlates with increased steady state levels of p53 (Fig. 2 B). The p300 coactivator has been shown to play an important role in transcriptional activation for a growing list of DNA-binding transactivator proteins (31Blobel G.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 745-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 33Manteuffel-Cymborowska M. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1999; 46: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Several groups have proposed that Tax-mediated p53 inhibition is due to p300 squelching by Tax (26Kaida A. Ariumi Y. Ueda Y. Lin J.Y. Hijikata M. Ikawa S. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Suzuki T. Uchida-Toita M. Yoshida M.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although we did not find that Tax/p300 interaction played an important role in Tax-mediated p53 inhibition in Jurkat cells (23Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Jiang H. Ashcroft M. Radonovich M. Duvall J. Guillerm C. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the K88A mutant, which fails to bind p300, failed to inhibit p53 function in H1299 cells (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, we examined whether p300 (Fig. 3 A) is involved in Tax-mediated p53 inhibition in these cells. H1299 cells were transiently cotransfected with wild-type p53 in the presence or absence of Tax and increasing amounts of p300. Interestingly, expression of exogenous p300 allowed recovery of p53 transcriptional activity in the presence of Tax (Fig. 3 A). We have recently shown that PCAF is an important factor in Tax-mediated activation of the HTLV-I LTR and is responsible for the defect in M47 activation of the viral LTR (35Jiang H. Lu H. Schiltz R.L. Pise-Masison C.A. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8136-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Likewise, PCAF has been shown to acetylate p53, which then increases the DNA binding affinity of p53 (36Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 37Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Because the M47 Tax mutant failed to inhibit p53 function, we examined whether expression of exogenous PCAF could also restore p53 transcriptional activity. Unlike p300, exogenous PCAF did not fully restore p53 transactivation in the presence of Tax (Fig. 3 B,lanes 6–8). Western blot analysis shows that the transfected PCAF protein was expressed, as detected by the anti-flag antibody (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–8). Because the level of PCAF does not increase as the level of PCAF expression plasmid is increased, it seems that the level of cellular PCAF may be tightly regulated. The transfected PCAF was active, because, consistent with previous reports (35Jiang H. Lu H. Schiltz R.L. Pise-Masison C.A. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8136-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), exogenous PCAF was capable of cooperating with Tax on the HTLV-I LTR (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3–5). Based on these overexpression assays, it appears that, unlike p300, PCAF is not limiting in these cells. In addition, the level of endogenous PCAF appears to be similar for all cell types (data not shown). The lack of p53 inhibition by the M47 Tax mutant clearly shows, however, an important role for PCAF in Tax-mediated p53 inhibition in H1299 cells. Because we observed a differential dependence of p300 for Tax-mediated p53 inhibition, we examined the level of endogenous p300 from nuclear extracts in Jurkat, H1299, HeLa, Saos-2, and HTLV-I-infected MT2 and C81 cells (Fig.4). A significant difference in the level of endogenous p300 can be seen. The level of p300 is relatively high in lymphocytes as compared with the other cell lines. It is interesting to note that in lymphocytic cells where there are higher levels of p300 (Fig. 4, lanes 4–7), Tax inhibition of p53 function is not due to p300 squelching but is dependent on NF-κB activation and correlates with p53 phosphorylation on serines 15 and 392 (23Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Jiang H. Ashcroft M. Radonovich M. Duvall J. Guillerm C. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, in cell lines containing low levels of p300 (Fig. 4,lanes 1–3), Tax inhibits p53 function through a CREB/ATF-dependent pathway, in part because of squelching of the coactivator p300. It is important to point out, however, that p300 binding does not sufficiently explain Tax-mediated p53 inhibition in these cells because the M47 Tax mutant that binds p300 (38Harrod R. Kuo Y.L. Tang Y. Yao Y. Vassilev A. Nakatani Y. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11852-11857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) cannot inhibit p53 function. This suggests that an M47 function of Tax, perhaps the ability of PCAF to stabilize the CREB-Tax-p300 complex or CREB/ATF activation, is required for p53 inhibition. The tumor suppressor p53 has been termed the guardian of the genome for its critical role in guarding cells against transformation. p53 is a short-lived, latent sequence-specific transcription factor that is activated and stabilized in response to a wide range of cellular stress including DNA damage and oncogenic activation (39Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 40Anderson C.W. Appella E. Sakaguchi K. J. Protein Chem. 1998; 17: 527PubMed Google Scholar, 41Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7666-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Once activated, p53 acts as a master switch to integrate the cellular stress signals with coordinated gene expression that leads to either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. However, the precise mechanisms by which p53 responds to different external stimuli are not fully understood. The p53 protein has been shown to be a target of several viral transforming proteins including SV-40 large T antigen, hepatitis B X protein, adenovirus E4orf6, cytomegalovirus IE2, and human papillomavirus E6 protein (42Demers G.W. Halbert C.L. Galloway D.A. Virology. 1994; 198: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 43Dobner T. Horikoshi N. Rubenwolf S. Shenk T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3534-3540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Our laboratory and others have shown that the HTLV Tax protein inhibits p53 function. In this report we addressed the recent controversy over the mechanism by which Tax inhibits p53 function. Suzuki et al. (27Suzuki T. Uchida-Toita M. Yoshida M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4137-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), Van Orden et al. (28Van Orden K. Giebler H.A. Lemasson I. Gonzales M. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26321-26328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), Kaida et al. (26Kaida A. Ariumi Y. Ueda Y. Lin J.Y. Hijikata M. Ikawa S. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and Ariumi et al. (34Ariumi Y. Kaida A. Lin J.Y. Hirota M. Masui O. Yamaoka S. Taya Y. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) suggest that the Tax-p300 interaction is responsible for p53 inhibition. These groups used wild-type Tax and the Tax mutant K88A in their analyses. The K88A mutant fails to bind p300/CBP and fails to activate the viral LTR. Importantly, we demonstrate here using additional Tax mutants M22 and M47 that in cells where p300 is limiting (H1299, HeLa, and Saos-2 cells), the CREB/ATF activation function of Tax is responsible for Tax-mediated p53 inhibition. Tax-mediated p53 inhibition does not appear to be due simply to squelching of p300 by Tax, because the Tax-M47 mutant can still bind p300 but fails to inhibit p53 function. These results are in agreement with those obtained by Mulloy et al. (30Mulloy J.C. Kislyakova T. Cereseto A. Casareto L. LoMonico A. Fullen J. Lorenzi M.V. Cara A. Nicot C. Giam C. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8852-8860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One distinct difference in our report versus Mulloy et al. (30Mulloy J.C. Kislyakova T. Cereseto A. Casareto L. LoMonico A. Fullen J. Lorenzi M.V. Cara A. Nicot C. Giam C. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8852-8860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is in Jurkat cells. Because we see a clear dependence on p300 levels in the Tax-mediated p53 inhibition pathway, one possible explanation for the differing results is in p300 levels in our Jurkat cells versus those used by Mulloy et al. (30Mulloy J.C. Kislyakova T. Cereseto A. Casareto L. LoMonico A. Fullen J. Lorenzi M.V. Cara A. Nicot C. Giam C. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8852-8860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in cell culture could directly effect the level of endogenous p300. We have recently shown that PCAF is an important factor in Tax-mediated activation of the HTLV-I LTR and is responsible for the defect in M47 activation of the viral LTR (35Jiang H. Lu H. Schiltz R.L. Pise-Masison C.A. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8136-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). PCAF does not appear to be a limiting factor in our system, because we observe only a modest increase of p53 activity with exogenous expression of PCAF. In contrast, exogenous PCAF significantly enhanced viral LTR expression. At present the role of PCAF in Tax-mediated p53 inhibition is unclear. It is possible that PCAF could be involved in CREB-Tax-p300 promoter complex stability, which would be consistent with a p300-squelching model. Alternatively, although we consider it less likely, the Tax-CREB/ATF transcriptional activation function may be required to increase expression of cellular genes that inhibit p53 function. Further investigation is required to determine the exact mechanism. Our studies clearly show that there is a cell type dependence on the mechanism used by Tax for p53 inhibition. Whereas the CREB/ATF pathway is clearly important for p53 inhibition in HeLa, H1299, and Saos-2 cells, the NF-κB pathway is important for p53 inhibition in Jurkat cells as well as mouse embryo fibroblasts (23Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Jiang H. Ashcroft M. Radonovich M. Duvall J. Guillerm C. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this report (Fig. 1) and in a recent publication (23Pise-Masison C.A. Mahieux R. Jiang H. Ashcroft M. Radonovich M. Duvall J. Guillerm C. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3377-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that in cells that have a high level of p300 Tax-mediated p53 inhibition involves phosphorylation on serines 15 and 392 by a processes that involves NF-κB activation. This is not the first report of a cell type-specific dependence for Tax function. In recent reports by Courtois et al. (47Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Harhaj et al. (48Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera-Walsh I. Sun S.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1448-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), they found that in B cells the IKKγ component of the IKK complex is not necessary for NF-κB activation, whereas in T cells and rat embryo fibroblasts it is essential. More recently, Ohtani et al.(49Ohtani K. Iwanaga R. Arai M. Huang Y. Matsumura Y. Nakamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11154-11163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have also shown a cell type-specific E2F activation that is also linked to the M22 mutant of Tax. It is well known that the NF-κB/Rel proteins play important roles in the regulation of lymphocyte activation and proliferation, and these proteins have been implicated in the development of a number of human leukemias and lymphomas (50Rayet B.

Consistent with our findings on p53 inhibition, several groups have demonstrated a clear link between NF-κB activation by Tax and virus-induced cellular transformation (13Robek M.D. Ratner L. J.

Perhaps the link between p53 inhibition, p300 expression levels, and cell type-dependent pathways could explain the differences observed in these systems. It is also interesting to speculate that these two distinct mechanisms of Tax-mediated p53 inhibition may be reflected in HTLV-I-associated pathologies. HTLV-I infection has long been linked not only with lymphocytic transformation but also with inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases (6Franchini G. Blood. 1995; 86: 3619-3639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kashanchi F. Pise-Masison C.A. Brady J.N. Ahmed R. Chen I. Persistent Viral Infections.

Perhaps the CREB/ATF-mediated inhibition of p53 function by either viral infection or soluble Tax contributes to the pathologies seen in diseases such as tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-I-associated myelopathy. In contrast, we would argue that the NF-kB-mediated inhibition of p53 by Tax is linked to lymphocytic transformation. At present, more investigation is required to pinpoint the exact mechanism by which Tax inhibits p53 and the importance of p53 inhibition to disease outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2143455036,"It has recently been shown that the monoclonal antibody JAQ1 to murine glycoprotein VI (GPVI) can cause aggregation of mouse platelets upon antibody cross-linking and that collagen-induced platelet aggregation can be inhibited by preincubation of platelets with JAQ1 in the absence of cross-linking (Nieswandt, B., Bergmeier, W., Schulte, V., Rackebrandt, K., Gessner, J. E., and Zirngibl, H. (2000) J. Biol. Chem.275, 23998–24002). In the present study, we have shown that cross-linking of GPVI by JAQ1 results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the same profile of proteins as that induced by collagen, including the Fc receptor (FcR) γ-chain, Syk, LAT, SLP-76, and phospholipase Cγ2. In contrast, platelet aggregation and tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins were inhibited when mouse platelets were preincubated with JAQ1 in the absence of cross-linking and were subsequently stimulated with a collagen-related peptide (CRP) that is specific for GPVI and low concentrations of collagen. However, at higher concentrations of collagen, but not CRP, aggregation of platelets and tyrosine phosphorylation of the above proteins (except for the adapter LAT) is re-established despite the presence of JAQ1. These observations suggest that a second activatory binding site, which is distinct from the CRP binding site on GPVI on mouse platelets, is occupied in the presence of high concentrations of collagen. Although this could be a second site on GPVI that is activated by a novel motif within the collagen molecule, the absence of LAT phosphorylation in response to collagen in the presence of JAQ1 suggests that this is more likely to be caused by activation of a second receptor that is also coupled to the FcR γ-chain. The possibility that this response is mediated by a receptor that is not coupled to FcR γ-chain is excluded on the grounds that aggregation is absent in platelets from FcR γ-chain-deficient mice.

Platelets can also be activated through GPVI via interaction with the snake venom toxin convulxin (Cvx), isolated from the venom of the tropical rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus (19Jandrot-Perrus M.

We have recently shown that a monoclonal antibody (JAQ1) to murine GPVI can cause aggregation of mouse platelets upon antibody cross-linking and that collagen-induced platelet aggregation can be inhibited by preincubation of platelets with JAQ1 (1Nieswandt B.

In the present study, we demonstrate that JAQ1 inhibits aggregation by low concentrations of collagen and CRP, and this effect is overcome by high concentrations of collagen, but not CRP. This study presents a novel motif within collagen that is mediating platelet activation. Specific pathogen-free mice (NMRI strain) 6–10 weeks of age were obtained from Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany or (CD1 strain) from Harlan SERA-LAB Ltd (Belton, Leics., UK). Convulxin was obtained from the venom of the tropical rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus, which was kindly donated by Drs. Mireille Leduc and Cassian Bon (Unite des Venins, Insitut Pasteur, Paris, France). Collagen (predominantly type 1, derived from Equine achilles tendon) was from Nycomed (Munich, Germany). CRP (GKO(GPO)10GKOG, single letter amino acid code where O is hydroxyproline) was synthesized by Tana Laboratories, L.C., TX and was cross-linked with 0.25% glutaraldehyde for 3 h on ice and then dialysed into phosphate-buffered saline. All salts and Nonidet P-40 were purchased from BDH-Merck. PP1 was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Nottingham, UK). The mAb JAQ1 was produced as described previously (1Nieswandt B. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Rackebrandt K. Gessner J.E. Zirngibl H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23998-24002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Anti-SLP-76 sheep polyclonal anti-serum was generously provided by Dr. Gary Koretsky (Abramson Family Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania). All other reagents were from previously described sources (15Pasquet J.M. Gross B. Quek L. Asazuma N. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Judd B. Lee J.R. Koretzky G. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Watson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8326-8334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modification of antibodies was performed as follows. Fab fragments from JAQ1 were generated by 12-hour incubation of 10 mg/ml mAb with immobilized papain (Pierce, Rockford, IL), and the preparations were then applied to an immobilized protein A column followed by an immobilized protein G column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove Fc fragments and any undigested IgG. The purity of the Fab fragments was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and silver staining of the gel. Mice were bled under ether anesthesia from the retro-orbital plexus. Blood was collected in a tube containing 7.5 units/ml heparin, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Isolated platelets did not show any signs of activation as shown by flow cytometry (staining for P-selectin and surface-bound fibrinogen). Alternatively, blood was taken by cardiac puncture following carbon dioxide asphyxiation using acidic citrate dextrose (120 mm sodium citrate, 110 mmglucose, 80 mm citric acid) as anticoagulant. Blood was diluted with 200 μl of modified Tyrodes-HEPES buffer (134 mm NaCl, 0.34 mmNa2HPO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.6) and centrifuged at 200 × g for 8 min at room temperature. Platelets were removed from PRP by pipetting the cells above the plasma/red blood cell interface. PRP was centrifuged at 1000 ×g in the presence of prostacyclin (0.1 μg/ml) for 7 min at room temperature. Pelleted platelets were resuspended in modified Tyrodes-HEPES buffer pH 7.3 to the required concentration and left for 30 min at 30 °C prior to stimulation. All experiments were performed at 37 °C in siliconized glass tubes with continuous stirring. Agonists were added as 10–100-fold concentrates. Platelet aggregation was monitored in PRP and in washed platelets. Similar results were obtained in both cases. To determine aggregation, light transmission (200 μl with 0.5 × 106 platelets/μl) was measured relative to platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Transmission was recorded on a Fibrintimer 4-channel aggregometer (APACT Laborgeräte und Analysensysteme, Hamburg, Germany) over 10 min and was expressed as percent transmission relative to PPP. Platelet aggregation was induced by addition of collagen (1–30 μg/ml) or CRP (1–100 μg/ml). Platelet stimulation was carried out using 500 μl of platelet suspension containing between 0.7–1 × 108 cells/ml. All experiments were performed in the presence of EGTA (100 μm) and indomethacin (10 μm) to prevent secondary events and facilitate protein isolation. Reactions were stopped by addition of an equal volume of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.3). Antibody (4 μl of anti-LAT antibody or 1 μl of anti-SLP-76 antiserum or 2 μl of anti-PLCγ2 antiserum or 2 μl of anti-Syk antibody per sample) was added to the lysate followed by 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating carousel and centrifuged to pellet the protein-A-Sepharose. The pellets were washed in lysis buffer followed by Tris-buffered saline (TBS-T; 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6) before the addition of Laemmli sample treatment buffer in preparation for SDS-PAGE. A GST fusion protein containing the tandem SH2 domains of Syk was prepared and used to precipitate the FcR γ-chain as described previously (12Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.L. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels under reducing or nonreducing conditions and transferred to PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked by incubation with TBS-T containing 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer (dilutions: 4G10, 1:1000; anti-Syk, 1:1000; anti-PLCγ2, 1:1000; anti-SLP-76, 1:500) and incubated with blots for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed twice for 30 min in TBS-T before incubation for 1 h with an appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:10,000 in TBS-T. Following washing in TBS-T as above, the membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system. Densitometric analysis of the results was performed using Quantity One (version 4) densitometry software (Bio-Rad). We recently reported the generation of the first mAb (JAQ1, rat IgG2a) against mouse GPVI and demonstrated that JAQ1 inhibits platelet aggregation in response to collagen (5 μg/ml). Whereas binding of JAQ1 alone did not induce platelet activation, cross-linking of the surface bound antibody induced irreversible platelet aggregation (1Nieswandt B. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Rackebrandt K. Gessner J.E. Zirngibl H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23998-24002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Subsequent to this first report, we performed a series of studies to further characterize the interaction of JAQ1 with GPVI on platelets. To our surprise, we found that the inhibitory effect of JAQ1 against collagen could be overcome by increasing the concentration of the adhesion molecule. Thus, in the presence of intact JAQ1 (10 μg/ml) or monovalent Fab fragments of the mAb (10 μg/ml), collagen at a concentration of 10 μg/ml stimulated partial aggregation, which reached almost maximal levels at 20 μg/ml (Fig.1, A and B). Flow cytometric preincubation studies demonstrated that bound fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled JAQ1 (JAQ1FITC) was not displaced by a 50-fold excess of unlabeled JAQ1 for at least 30 min (not shown), indicating that JAQ1 binds essentially irreversibly to GPVI over the time course of this study. Therefore, collagen must be able to bind either to a second site on GPVI or to a second surface receptor to mediate activation. To help distinguish between these two possibilities, we investigated the effect of JAQ1 on collagen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of key proteins in the GPVI signaling cascade. We found that in the absence of cross-linking JAQ1-IgG, but not control IgG2a (not shown), stimulated a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the adapters, LAT and SLP-76, and PLCγ2 (Fig. 1 C), despite the fact that it inhibits aggregation to low concentrations of collagen. JAQ1 alone also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain and Syk as shown later in this manuscript. A similar low level of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of aggregation is induced in human platelets by a mAb to the FcγRIIA receptor, IV.3, in the absence of cross-linking (not shown); FcγRIIA also signals through an ITAM-regulated pathway. JAQ1-Fab did not induce detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of any of these proteins (not shown), suggesting that antibody-mediated dimerization of GPVI is required to induce this subliminal signaling. Despite this low level of stimulation, JAQ1 inhibited collagen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT, SLP-76, and PLCγ2 (Fig.1 C). This inhibition was more clearly seen at higher concentrations of collagen because of the weak stimulatory effect of the antibody itself. Nevertheless, higher concentrations of collagen (10 and 30 μg/ml) were able to stimulate significant tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 and PLCγ2 in the presence of JAQ1, consistent with the restoration of aggregation to collagen under these conditions (Fig. 1, A and B). Densitometric analysis demonstrated that the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and SLP-76 induced by high concentrations of collagen was similar in the presence or absence of JAQ1 (not shown). However, this was not the case for LAT, which did not increase in phosphorylation in response to higher concentrations of collagen in the presence of JAQ1 (Fig. 1, C and D). These observations demonstrate that higher concentrations of collagen are able to overcome the inhibitory effect of JAQ1 on aggregation and phosphorylation. The minimal tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT, however, in contrast to the substantial phosphorylation of SLP-76 and PLCγ2 that is observed in the presence of JAQ1, raises the possibility that this is mediated by a receptor other than GPVI. In this context, it is noteworthy that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and platelet activation in response to CRP are heavily reduced but not abolished in LAT-deficient platelets (15Pasquet J.M. Gross B. Quek L. Asazuma N. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Judd B. Lee J.R. Koretzky G. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Watson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8326-8334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is a pathway of regulation of PLCγ2 and platelet activation by collagen which is independent of LAT. These results provide evidence for a second epitope on the collagen molecule that is capable of binding to GPVI in the presence of JAQ1 or that the adhesion molecule is binding to a second activatory receptor. In the latter case, it is possible that binding is mediated through the same epitope in the collagen molecule. To investigate this, we examined the effect of JAQ1 on responses to the collagen-related peptide (CRP), which is made up of repeat GPO motifs cross-linked via lysine residues in the N- and C-terminals. We have previously shown that CRP is a more powerful agonist than collagen on phosphorylation and functional responses in platelets, presumably because of the greater number of GPO repeat motifs that enables a greater degree of cross-linking of GPVI (16Asselin J. Gibbins J.M. Achison M. Lee Y.H. Morton L.F. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Watson S.P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intact JAQ1 as well as Fab fragments (10 μg/ml) completely blocked platelet aggregation in response to CRP at concentrations up to 100 μg/ml (Fig. 2, A and B). CRP stimulated a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in the whole cell lysate, which was reduced to basal in the presence of the antibody (Fig. 2 C). These results demonstrate that JAQ1 is able to fully inhibit responses to CRP, in contrast to the result for collagen, despite the fact that CRP is generally recognized as a stronger agonist than collagen (16Asselin J. Gibbins J.M. Achison M. Lee Y.H. Morton L.F. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Watson S.P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result rules out the possibility that the high concentrations of collagen overcome the inhibitory effect of JAQ1 through interaction of the GPO motif with a second site on GPVI or on a receptor other than GPVI. This demonstrates the presence of a second epitope in collagen that mediates activation in the presence of a saturating concentration of JAQ1. This epitope could bind either to a second site in GPVI or to a second receptor for collagen. Bearing in mind that aggregation in response to collagen is completely inhibited in mice deficient in the FcR γ-chain (not shown) and that tyrosine phosphorylation is predominantly inhibited (8Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), it would appear that this second receptor is also associated with the FcR γ-chain. We have previously reported that cross-linking of JAQ1 by addition of anti-rat IgG antibodies (10 μg/ml) stimulates platelet aggregation (1Nieswandt B. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Rackebrandt K. Gessner J.E. Zirngibl H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23998-24002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In view of the ability of JAQ1 alone to stimulate a minimal increase in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and also the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT in response to high concentrations of collagen in the presence of JAQ1, we were interested in examining the effect of cross-linking JAQ1 on phosphorylation. The aim of this set of studies was to examine whether cross-linking JAQ1 induces a similar pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation to that seen in response to classical activation of GPVI, and specifically whether LAT is phosphorylated. Cross-linking of surface-bound JAQ1 on platelets stimulated a similar pattern and time course of tyrosine phosphorylation in whole cell lysates to those detected in platelets activated by the GPVI selective agonist, convulxin (5 μg/ml), albeit with a lower intensity of phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A). Phosphorylation in response to convulxin was maintained for all proteins up to 90 s, with the exception of a band of 25 kDa (nonreducing conditions), which comigrates with FcR γ-chain. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation in response to cross-linking of JAQ1 declined more rapidly, most notably for protein bands of 25 and 36 kDa (Fig. 3, B and C). Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that cross-linking of JAQ1 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the same pattern of proteins as seen with convulxin, including namely FcR γ-chain, Syk, SLP-76, LAT, and PLCγ2 (Fig.4). Tyrosine phosphorylation of all of these proteins was less than that seen in response to convulxin and was particularly weak for FcR γ-chain, which may partly be explained by the more rapid decline in tyrosine phosphorylation in response to cross-linking of JAQ1. Aggregation and protein phosphorylation in response to cross-linking of JAQ1 were completely inhibited in the presence of the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP1 (not shown), as previously reported for activation by CRP (10Briddon S.J. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These results confirm that cross-linking of GPVI by JAQ1 stimulates a similar pattern of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and aggregation to that seen in response to activation of GPVI by convulxin.Figure 4JAQ1 and convulxin induce tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain, Syk, SLP-76, LAT , and PLCγ2. Washed platelets were incubated as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Samples for immunoprecipitations (IP) were lysed after 2 min by addition of an equal volume of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 buffer and were immunoprecipitated for FcR γ-chain, Syk, SLP-76, LAT, and PLCγ2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After separation by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, nonreducing conditions) and transfer to PVDF membranes, the proteins were incubated with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (anti-PY) and were detected by anti-mouse IgG-HRP and ECL. The membranes were stripped and reprobed for the immunoprecipitated proteins.

This strongly suggests that there is a second activatory sequence within collagen, which is able to mediate platelet activation. It appears that the binding site for this novel epitope within collagen is located on a receptor that is coupled to the FcR γ-chain bearing in mind that aggregation to collagen is completely inhibited in FcR γ-chain-deficient platelets. This site could be located on GPVI or on a novel receptor, which also signals through the FcR γ-chain. Evidence for the latter is provided by the distinct profile of tyrosine phosphorylation, characterized by the absence of phosphorylation of LAT that is seen in response to high concentrations of collagen in the presence of JAQ1. Studies on mice platelets in which GPVI has been depleted through gene targeting are required to confirm this conclusion."

Intracellularly, triple-helical monomers align in an antiparallel manner with the C-terminal globular domains attached to the adjacent helix by disulfide bonds. These dimers then align with their ends in register to form tetramers, which are the secreted form of the molecule. End to end accretion of tetramers leads to microfibril formation in the extracellular matrix (6Timpl R. Chu M.-L. Yurchenko P.D. Birk D. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 207-242Crossref Google Scholar).Tissue extraction and biosynthetic studies have demonstrated that α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains occur in stoichiometric proportions in a 1:1:1 ratio (6Timpl R.

Bonaldo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13105-13111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the case of recombinant expression studies, it was shown that, when cell lines were stably transfected with either the α1(VI) or α2(VI) chain, only single polypeptides were secreted. Cells transfected with all three chains, however, produced a pepsin-resistant type VI collagen (10Colombatti A. Mucignat M.T. Bonaldo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13105-13111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The human osteosarcoma cell line (SaOS-2), under certain growth conditions, is deficient in α3(VI), and although these cells have an abundance of α1(VI) and α2(VI) mRNAs, collagen VI was not detected in the medium by 4 weeks of culture (9Lamande S.R.

Stable transfection of these cells with the α3(VI) cDNA enabled formation of type VI collagen dimers and tetramers, which were secreted and deposited into an extensive network (9Lamande S.R.

These results suggest that the α3(VI) chain contains the sequences that enable chains to associate in the endoplasmic reticulum and form a triple helix.Triple helix formation in collagen involves chain association, registration, nucleation, and propagation (11Bulleid N.J. Curr. Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 667-672Google Scholar). Proper chain selection and registration is initiated by association of the C-propeptide. Sequences have been defined for the fibrillar collagens in the C-propeptide that are essential for chain selection (12Bulleid N.J. Dalley J. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the NC1 domains of both type VIII and X collagens have been shown to be critical in chain association (13Marks D.S.

Shuttleworth C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22091-22095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). By analogy, it is likely that the C-terminal domains in the α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains of type VI collagen play essential roles in chain association and selection.We have been interested in understanding what regulates and controls chain association in type VI collagen and have produced constructs of the human α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains, which contain the N1 and C1 with and without the C2 domains, and a near full-length α3(VI) chain and have used them in an in vitrotranscription/translation system supplemented with semipermeabilized cells. This system has been used successfully to show correct folding of correctly aligned triple helices (15Wilson R. Lee J.F. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9637-9643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), to identify molecular recognition sequences that determine chain association (16Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and to highlight the importance of C-terminal (NC1) sequences to short chain collagens (14Illidge C. Kielty C.M. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22091-22095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our results show that the recombinant α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains can, indeed, form triple-helical monomers, and subsequently dimers and tetramers when the C2 domains were present, but not when only the C1 domain was present. Interestingly, the α3(VI) chains could form monomers but were unable to form dimers and tetramers, although they were able to facilitate dimer and tetramer assembly in cotranslation experiments.DISCUSSIONThe semipermeabilized cells in conjunction with in vitro transcription/translation have been shown to recapitulate the early events of protein folding and assembly of multisubunit proteins destined for secretion (12Bulleid N.J. Dalley J. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Illidge C. Kielty C.M. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Biol.

The present results have shown for the first time that the α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains of type VI collagen can assemble intracellularly into triple-helical monomers and that dimers and tetramers subsequently form in a time-dependent manner. This is similar to the events that occur normally in the formation of type VI collagen, where tetramers are subsequently secreted from the cell and aggregate in the extracellular space end to end to form double-beaded microfibrils. The finding of defined molecular intermediates in the present study supports the contention that the semipermeabilized cells allow correct folding and chaperone association to occur and shows that dimer and tetramer formation occurs early in the secretory pathway of the cell. It is well known that chain selection and helix formation occur in the endoplasmic reticulum, but once sufficient monomers are present then dimer and tetramer formation follows.A variety of studies have shown the importance of C-terminal interactions in chain selection and helix formation (11Bulleid N.J. Curr. Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 667-672Google Scholar, 12Bulleid N.J. Dalley J. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Illidge C. Kielty C.M. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22091-22095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the case of type VI collagen, the implications from a number of studies were that α3(VI) is an important determinant of chain association, although no information was available about the relative importance of the C1, C2, C3, C4, or C5 domains of this chain in that process. Interestingly, this study has shown that each of the three chains of type VI collagen can form monomers if the C1 domain is present, but the C2 domain appears to be essential to form higher molecular mass assemblies. The importance of the C2 domain to dimer and tetramer formation is shown dramatically for the α2(VI) chain when the alternatively spliced C2 variant, C2a, was used. When the C2 was compared with the C2a variant it was clear that whereas constructs containing the full-length C2 could form dimers and tetramers, those containing the C2a variant could not. It has been suggested that production of α2(VI) isoforms may be a mechanism for controlling the amount of mature type VI collagen (23Saitta B. Stokes D.G. Vissing H. Timpl R. Chu M.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6473-6480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present result would support this suggestion, as failure to produce dimers would result in recognition and removal by intracellular proteinases. Interestingly, the presence of the C2 domain in the α3(VI) chain did not facilitate dimer and tetramer formation, which suggests that whatever sequence mediates antiparallel alignment in the C2 domains of the α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains is either not present or obscured in the α3(VI) chain.Structural studies have shown A-domains to be composed of a central β-sheet flanked on each side by three α-helices, which is highly reminiscent of the Rossmann dinucleotide-binding fold (24Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 25Deleted in proof.Google Scholar) The A-domains in type VI collagen have low (∼15%) amino acid similarity to A-domains in other proteins, such as von Willebrand factor, complement, and integrin subunits. Identity between certain collagen VI A-domains is relatively high (47% for N7 and N9) but between others is much lower (18.5% for N1 and C1 of α3(VI)).Sequence studies have shown that the C1 domains of the α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains all have the residues in the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) sequence conserved, but this is not the case for C1 of the α3(VI) chain. In the case of the C2 domain the α1(VI) chain contains DXSXSTX, whereas the α2(VI) chain contains DXSXXXD, although interestingly threonine is replaced by serine in this latter motif. No conservation of this sequence occurs in the α3(VI) C2 domain. Metal ion coordination has been one means of generating protein-protein interactions, because it has been shown that the sixth coordination position of magnesium in the α-subunit of integrin CR3 is taken up by a carboxylate oxygen atom in another A-domain (24Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). However, the A3 domain of human von Willebrand factor binds collagen without metal binding (25Deleted in proof.Google Scholar) and highlights that there are other forms of A-domain interactions.Of the A-domains for which there is high resolution structural data, the C2 domain of the α1(VI) chain has most homology to the vWFA3 (Fig. 10). This domain also has a conserved MIDAS motif, but there is no evidence of metal ion binding, and this has been shown to bind to the collagen helix. It is interesting to speculate that binding occurs with the α1(VI) C2 domain and the adjacent, antiparallel type VI triple-helical region when dimers form. Comparison of the models for the C2 domains of the α1(VI) and α2(VI) with that of the α3(VI) suggest that there may be subtle changes in secondary folding that impact the ability of this domain to interact with collagen and hence form dimers (Fig.11). In particular, there is a 10-amino acid insertion between the second and third β-strand motifs in α3C2 that may overlap and disrupt interactive residues at the MIDAS site (see Figs. 10 and 11).Figure 11A cartoon representation of the model of α2C2. β-Strands are shown asribbons, and α-helices are shown as cylinders. 10-Amino acid insertion in the α3C2 domain is sketched inblue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The finding that α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains can form monomers, dimers, and tetramers suggests that one might expect to find these species secreted from cells and assembled into microfibrils. However, previous studies have suggested that although chains can be secreted, all three chains of type VI collagen are required for secretion and assembly of type VI collagen microfibrils (9Lamande S.R.

Bonaldo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13105-13111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).The literature is strewn with a veritable melange of reports on the fate of individual chains of type VI collagen. These range from stating that the α1(VI) is secreted as a chain (26Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Bucciotti F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) to its being secreted as monomers, dimers, and/or tetramers (27Bonaldo P. Mucignat M.T. Colombatti A. Matrix. 1990; 10: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). There are reports that the α1(VI) can be found extracellularly in disulfide (28Crawford S.W. Featherstone J.A. Holbrook K. Yong S.L. Bornstein P. Sage H. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or nondisulfide form (29Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In SaOS-2 cells, which are deficient in α3(VI) production, the majority, but not all, of the α1/α2(VI) is apparently retained in the cell, although chains did appear to get disulfide-bonded (9Lamande S.R.

In our hands immunoprecipitation of labeled medium from SaOS-2 cells showed a distinct monomer on agarose electrophoresis (data not shown). In contrast, following transfection of 293 cells with either α1(VI) or α2(VI) cDNAs, there was efficient secretion of polypeptide monomers and dimers (30Tillet E. Wiedemann H. Golbik R. Pan T. Zhang R. Mann K. Chu M. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Although transfection experiments may overload cellular function, it is surprising that there is so much variation and variability in the fate of single-chain transcripts or indeed why collagen appears to be able to avoid the cellular quality control mechanism (31Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). Early reports suggested that basal levels of collagen degradation were about 15% (32Bienkowski R.S. Gotkin M.G. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 209: 118-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and that as much as 30% of collagen was secreted from the cell in a nonhelical form (33Kuo W.W. Prockop D.J. Berg R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2234-2238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that up to a third of unfolded collagen chains may not be removed intracellularly. Although these results were obtained looking at fibrillar collagens, data on type VI collagen (26Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Bucciotti F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 27Bonaldo P. Mucignat M.T. Colombatti A. Matrix. 1990; 10: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 28Crawford S.W.

Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) would suggest that a similar level of secretion occurs for this collagen. The present findings, showing that homotrimers can form into tetramers, suggests that these correctly folded assemblies escape quality control detection and are secreted. Their fate in the extracellular space is unknown, but findings with knockout mice would suggest that these assemblies are not as stable as heterotrimers, as no microfibrils are detected. Our cotransfection studies with all three chains of type VI collagen showed an increased rate of formation of dimers and tetramers and suggests, as previously reported, that the presence of α3(VI) is an important determinant of type VI collagen formation.The system used in the present study folds and assembles protein chains and shows clearly that, where α1(VI) and/or α2(VI) chains are present, the chains contain the information to allow formation of physiological monomers, dimers, and tetramers. We are currently investigating how these assemblies are handled in the cell and why homotrimer assemblies do not appear to form recognizable microfibrils. Type VI collagen appears to have a ubiquitous distribution throughout connective tissues, and although it has been suggested that it links cells and other matrix components, its precise role in the matrix has still to be determined.

Tissue extraction and biosynthetic studies have demonstrated that α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains occur in stoichiometric proportions in a 1:1:1 ratio (6Timpl R. Chu M.-L. Yurchenko P.D. Birk D.

These early observations have been confirmed by using cell lines deficient in one of the chains (9Lamande S.R. Sigals E. Pan T.-C. Chu M.L. Dziadek M. Timpl R. Bateman J.F. J. Biol.

Bonaldo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13105-13111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the case of recombinant expression studies, it was shown that, when cell lines were stably transfected with either the α1(VI) or α2(VI) chain, only single polypeptides were secreted. Cells transfected with all three chains, however, produced a pepsin-resistant type VI collagen (10Colombatti A. Mucignat M.T. Bonaldo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13105-13111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The human osteosarcoma cell line (SaOS-2), under certain growth conditions, is deficient in α3(VI), and although these cells have an abundance of α1(VI) and α2(VI) mRNAs, collagen VI was not detected in the medium by 4 weeks of culture (9Lamande S.R.

Stable transfection of these cells with the α3(VI) cDNA enabled formation of type VI collagen dimers and tetramers, which were secreted and deposited into an extensive network (9Lamande S.R.

These results suggest that the α3(VI) chain contains the sequences that enable chains to associate in the endoplasmic reticulum and form a triple helix. Triple helix formation in collagen involves chain association, registration, nucleation, and propagation (11Bulleid N.J. Curr. Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 667-672Google Scholar). Proper chain selection and registration is initiated by association of the C-propeptide. Sequences have been defined for the fibrillar collagens in the C-propeptide that are essential for chain selection (12Bulleid N.J. Dalley J. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the NC1 domains of both type VIII and X collagens have been shown to be critical in chain association (13Marks D.S.

By analogy, it is likely that the C-terminal domains in the α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains of type VI collagen play essential roles in chain association and selection. We have been interested in understanding what regulates and controls chain association in type VI collagen and have produced constructs of the human α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains, which contain the N1 and C1 with and without the C2 domains, and a near full-length α3(VI) chain and have used them in an in vitrotranscription/translation system supplemented with semipermeabilized cells. This system has been used successfully to show correct folding of correctly aligned triple helices (15Wilson R. Lee J.F. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol.

Previous studies have shown that Sec61β is inessential for ribosome binding and protein translocation, but translocation is impaired by the absence of Sec61β, and it has been proposed that Sec61β assists in the insertion of nascent proteins into the translocation pore.

Translocation is preceded by a targeting phase in which ribosomes bearing pre-secretory nascent chains are selectively recruited to the ER membrane through the reciprocal action of at least two cytosolic factors, the signal recognition particle (SRP) (1Walter P.

Tranlocation has been reconstituted in vitro (18Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) with membranes containing Sec61p in addition to only two other components as follows: SRP receptor and the translocating chain associated membrane protein (TRAM) (19Görlich D. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), whose presence does not appear to be required for the transport of all pre-secretory proteins (19Görlich D. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 20Voigt S. Jungnickel B. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Photocross-linking experiments have shown that the nascent chain is adjacent to Sec61α throughout its transit of the ER membrane (21Mothes W. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3973-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Sec61p thus appears to form the hydrophilic translocation pore in the ER membrane. The ribosome-ER interaction depends on contacts between the body of the ribosome and protein components of the ER membrane, in addition to the interaction of the nascent chain and the translocation pore. Treatment of rough microsomes (RM) with puromycin causes the expulsion of nascent chains into the ER lumen (22Redman C.M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), but the release of ribosomes from the membrane requires additional exposure to high salt concentrations (23Adelman M.R. Sabatini D.D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 206-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar); nontranslating ribosomes can rebind to puromycin/high salt-stripped RM (PKRM) at physiological salt concentrations (24Borgese N. Mok W. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 559-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Nontranslating ribosomes also bind with high affinity to artificial liposomes reconstituted with the Sec61p complex alone (25Kalies K.U. Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, Sec61p is believed to serve as both a translocation pore and a ribosome-binding site. The isolated Sec61p complex forms a roughly pentagonal doughnut-shaped structure (17Hanein D. Matlack K.E. Jungnickel B. Plath K. Kalies K.U. Miller K.R. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 26Beckmann R. Bubeck D. Grassucci R. Penczek P. Verschoor A. Blobel G. Frank J. Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), whose assembly in lipid membranes is induced by the presence of ribosomes (17Hanein D. Matlack K.E. Jungnickel B. Plath K. Kalies K.U. Miller K.R. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The yeast Sec61p complex has been visualized in the ribosome-bound state in detergent solution, where the central pore of the complex appears to align with the presumed nascent chain exit site on the large ribosomal subunit (26Beckmann R. Bubeck D. Grassucci R. Penczek P. Verschoor A. Blobel G. Frank J. Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In this reconstruction, the connection between the ribosome and Sec61p is restricted to a thin stalk, suggesting that other proteins may contribute to the tight ER-ribosome seal in vivo or that the actively translocating ribosome-ER complex assumes a different conformation. The identity of the Sec61p components or domains involved in ribosome binding remains open to speculation. Previous results suggest that the β subunit is the least essential for the overall function of the complex. Sec61β can be proteolytically degraded in rough microsomes without release of bound ribosomes, whereas Sec61α remains protected (25Kalies K.U. Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and limited proteolysis of stripped RM has led to the identification of Sec61α domains that may be required for ribosome binding and translocation (48Raden D. Song W. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although yeast mutants lacking either the α or the γ subunit are inviable (11Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27478-27485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a deletion of both yeast Sec61β homologues (Sbh1p and Sbh2p) is not lethal and causes a reduction in growth rate only at elevated temperatures (27Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Disruption of Sec61β in Drosophila, however, is lethal and causes embryonic defects consistent with impaired secretion (28Valcarcel R. Weber U. Jackson D.B. Benes V. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. Mlodzik M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4389-4396PubMed Google Scholar). Sec61β-depleted proteoliposomes bind ribosomes with an affinity comparable to that of proteoliposomes containing intact Sec61p (29Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Sec61β-depleted proteoliposomes showed impaired translocationin vitro, but the impairment could be overcome by allowing the SRP-dependent targeting step to occur at reduced temperature, in the absence of ongoing translation. It was proposed that Sec61β affects the kinetics of nascent chain insertion and that in the absence of Sec61β insertion proceeds at a reduced rate, allowing the competing process (elongation in the cytosol) to take precedence. Proteolytic digestion of Sec61β in stripped rough microsomes did not abolish their ability to translocate preprolactinin vitro (30Song W. Raden D. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. Cell. 2000; 100: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The present study addressed the physical interaction between ER membrane proteins and core components of the ribosome. We found that the purified Sec61β cytoplasmic domain (Sec61βc) competes for ribosome binding to stripped ER membranes; Sec61βc also binds to ribosomes directly, with an affinity comparable to the affinity of ribosomes for stripped ER membranes. Based on these observations we propose that Sec61β may participate in ribosome binding and translocation by interacting directly with the body of the ribosome. This interaction may occur after, or concurrently with, an initial contact between the ribosome and other domains of Sec61p, and it does not preclude an interaction between Sec61β and the nascent chain. To construct pET28a-GST, the GST-coding sequence of pGEX-EF, containing the Schistosoma japonicum GST cDNA sequence, was amplified by PCR using primers GST(+)/NcoI/SalI/Thr (5′-CATGCCATGGGCGTCGACCTGGTGCCGCGCGGCAGCATGTCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTGG-3′) and GST(−)/XhoI (5′-CCGCTCGAGTTATTTTGGAGGATGGTCGCCACCACC-3′); the PCR product was inserted into pET28a(+) (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) atNcoI/XhoI sites. Primer GST(+)/NcoI/SalI/Thr introduces a thrombin cleavage site (Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser) upstream of GST. The sequence encoding the first 70 amino acids of Sec61β was amplified with Sec61β(+)/NcoI (5′-CATGCCATGGGCATGCCTGGTCCGACCCCCAGTTGGC-3′) and Sec61βc(−)/SalI (5′-ACGCGTCGACAGGGCCAACTTTGAGCCCAGGTGA-3′), and the PCR product was inserted into pET28a-GST atNcoI/SalI sites to generate pET28a-βc/GST. The Sec61βc sequence in the resulting clone was confirmed by sequencing of both DNA strands. Plasmids pET28a-GST and pET28a-GST/Sec61βc were used to transformEscherichia coli strain BL-21(DE3), and the corresponding fusion proteins were expressed by induction of the liquid cultures with 1 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside for 1 h at 37 °C. The fusion protein was purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) according to standard procedures (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar) and stored at 4 °C for up to 1 month. To elute GST fusion proteins, a volume of beads was transferred to a disposable column (Bio-Rad) and eluted with 5 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein concentration of each fraction was estimated by Bradford assay (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar), using GST alone as a standard and using the value 1 A 280 = 0.5 mg/ml to obtain the concentration of GST. Eluted fusion proteins were stored at −70 °C. Canine pancreatic RM were prepared as described (33Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). RM were stripped of ribosomes using puromycin/KCl (9Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and the ribosomal and membranous components were collected separately and used in subsequent experiments. To prepare large and small ribosomal subunits, RM were incubated with puromycin/KCl as described (9Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and 2-ml aliquots of the suspension were layered on continuous density gradients (36 ml of total) of 7–20% sucrose in high salt buffer (HSB: 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.5 mKCl, 10 mm MgCl2) in Beckman SW-28 tubes. The samples were centrifuged for 9 h, 25,000 rpm, 4 °C, in the SW-28 rotor. 2-ml fractions were collected manually from the top of the gradient. The RNA content of each fraction was determined byA 260 measurement. The pooled small and large subunit fractions were each diluted with 1.5 volumes of HKM (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2), and 10-ml volumes of the sample were layered over 0.5 ml of 1 m sucrose in ribosome binding buffer (RBB: 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mKOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mmdithiothreitol) and 50 μl of 1.9 m sucrose/RBB in a Beckman SW-41 tube. Each tube was topped off with HKM, and the samples were centrifuged for 20 h, 34,000 rpm, 4 °C in the SW-41 rotor. Pellets were resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose/RBB and stored at −70 °C. Both the small subunit and the large subunit preparations hadA 260:A 280 ratios of 2.0. The purity of each preparation was assessed by Western blotting using antibodies against the ribosomal proteins S3 and L5. The small subunit preparation was virtually free of large subunits, whereas the large subunit preparation was slightly contaminated (20% or less) with small subunits. Ribosomes were surface-labeled witht-butoxycarbonyl-l-[35S]methionineN-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (35SLR; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (25Kalies K.U. Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The labeled ribosomes were stored in 0.25 m sucrose/RBB and added directly to binding experiments. The specific activity of the ribosome preparation was typically about 5 × 106 cpm per mg of ribosomes (34Tashiro Y. Siekevitz P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 11: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Binding of ribosomes to puromycin/KCl-stripped rough microsomes (PKRM) was measured according to an established method (24Borgese N. Mok W. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 559-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 35Lauring B. Sakai H. Kreibich G. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5411-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled ribosomes were mixed with 5–10 eq (33Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) of PKRM in 20 μl of RBB. After 30 min on ice, the sample was mixed with 180 μl of 2.3 msucrose/RBB and overlaid with 360 μl of 1.9 m sucrose/RBB in a 5 × 41-mm open top centrifuge tube (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). The samples were topped off with RBB and centrifuged (75 min, 40,000 rpm, 4 °C, Beckman SW-50.1 rotor). The tubes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and sectioned at points 1.5 and 2.5 cm from the top of the tube. The ribosome content of the resulting top, middle, and bottom fractions was determined by scintillation counting. The top and bottom fractions were counted as bound and unbound, respectively, whereas the middle fraction, containing negligible radioactivity, was not included in subsequent calculations. To test the effect of GST or Sec61βc/GST as competitors in the ribosome binding assay, the purified protein (after elution from glutathione-agarose; see above) was added to the binding assay in the amounts indicated in the figure legends. The fusion protein was mixed with labeled ribosomes before the addition of membranes. Compensating volumes of elution buffer (5 mm glutathione/50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) were added so that each 20-μl reaction contained 2.5 μl of fusion protein and/or elution buffer. The presence of elution buffer alone in this amount did not affect ribosome binding. Direct binding of ribosomes to GST or Sec61βc/GST immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads was measured as follows. 20 μl of beads with bound fusion protein were equilibrated in RBB and mixed with SLR-labeled ribosomes in a final volume of 0.1 ml. In some experiments additional agents were added as described in the figure legends. Each reaction was incubated on ice for 10 min with intermittent agitation to resuspend the beads; the samples were then incubated for 10 min on a rotating wheel at 4 °C and stored on ice again for 10 min with intermittent agitation as before. 0.4 ml of RBB was added to each sample to improve the separation of bound and unbound material in the following step. The tubes were mixed once by inversion and immediately spun for 30 s in a microcentrifuge at room temperature. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and residual liquid was removed with a Hamilton syringe. Equivalent volumes of the bead fraction and the supernatant were measured by scintillation counting. For calculations, 0.1 ml was taken as the reaction volume. (In control experiments, addition of 0.4 ml of buffer at the end of the initial binding reaction caused a relatively slow re-equilibration of ribosomes that did not affect the calculated values substantially.) The results presented here developed out of a screen for the ability of potential ribosome receptor domains to interfere with thein vitro binding of ribosomes to stripped rough microsomes when expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. The Sec61β cytoplasmic domain ((Sec61βc) was placed upstream of GST, with an intervening thrombin cleavage site (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the resulting fusion protein, the C-terminus of Sec61βc is fused to GST, whereas the N terminus of Sec61βc is free; this corresponds to the predicted disposition of the native Sec61β, whose C terminus is thought to be anchored in the ER membrane (10Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Gorlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was expressed in bacteria and purified using glutathione-agarose beads as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A construct encoding GST without the added Sec61βc sequence was used in parallel as a negative control. Fig. 1 Ashows the purified GST and Sec61βc/GST with or without thrombin protease cleavage. The intact Sec61βc/GST fusion protein without thrombin cleavage was used in all subsequent experiments presented here. After elution from glutathione-agarose, the GST and Sec61βc/GST fusion proteins, respectively, were mixed with labeled nontranslating ribosomes (∼100-fold molar excess of fusion protein over ribosomes) before addition of stripped rough microsomes. Ribosomes were chemically surface-labeled with sulfur labeling reagent (SLR); this did not measurably affect the membrane-binding properties of the ribosomes. The ribosome binding assay was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The presence of GST alone in the reaction did not affect the extent of ribosome binding appreciably, compared with a sample in which no competitor was present (not shown). By contrast, the fraction of membrane-bound ribosomes in the Sec61βc/GST-containing sample was reduced to ∼50% of the value obtained when GST alone was added as a competitor (Fig. 1 B). To get an estimate of the amount of the fusion protein required to inhibit binding, we performed competition assays with increasing amounts of Sec61βc/GST. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the inhibition of binding did not follow a linear relation to the amount of fusion protein added; up to a 16-fold excess of Sec61βc/GST over binding sites (25-fold excess over ribosomes) resulted in only a minor reduction in binding, whereas a 64-fold excess over binding sites caused a more substantial reduction (fraction bound = 52% of the control value). GST normally dimerizes in solution (36Lim K. Ho J.X. Keeling K. Gilliland G.L. Ji X. Ruker F. Carter D.C. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2233-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and under the conditions used in our ribosome binding experiments a significant portion of free GST formed aggregates large enough to be recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h (not shown). This behavior may account partially for the relatively large excess of free Sec61βc/GST needed to affect the binding of ribosomes to stripped rough microsomes. Because the Sec61βc/GST fusion protein was able to prevent the binding of ribosomes to stripped rough microsomes, we suspected that the fusion protein might act by binding directly to ribosomes at the site where the native Sec61β normally binds. We therefore investigated the direct binding of labeled ribosomes to the GST fusion proteins. The Sec61βc/GST fusion protein was again expressed in bacteria and purified using glutathione-agarose beads, but rather than eluting the fusion protein from the beads (as in the competition experiment shown in Fig. 1), we tested the Sec61βc/GST-coated glutathione-agarose beads as a solid substrate for ribosome binding. By using different inputs of SLR-labeled ribosomes, we obtained a Scatchard plot for binding to Sec61βc/GST immobilized on glutathione-agarose, as shown in Fig. 2 (open squares). The affinity value (K D ) obtained by this method was 1.2 × 10−8m, a value identical to that obtained by Borgese et al. (24Borgese N. Mok W. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 559-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) for the binding of tritium-labeled nontranslating ribosomes to stripped rough microsomes at low salt concentrations (25 mm KCl) and within the range of values reported by Kalies et al. (25Kalies K.U. Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) for the binding of SLR-labeled nontranslating ribosomes to stripped rough microsomes at 25 and 150 mm KCl, respectively. We emphasize that the very close correspondence between our affinity value for ribosome binding to Sec61βc/GST and measured values for ribosome binding to stripped rough microsomes may be fortuitous, given the inherent differences in the methods of measurement; however, we conclude that the affinity of ribosomes for the fusion protein is roughly on the same order as their affinity for stripped rough microsomes. Glutathione-agarose beads coated with GST alone (Fig. 2,closed squares) possessed a much lower ribosome binding activity; this binding was unspecific, as indicated by the flat profile of the Scatchard plot. Based on the X intercept of the Scatchard plot, we calculated that ∼875 molecules of Sec61βc/GST are required per ribosome bound. This high figure may be accounted for by the additive effect of at least three considerations as follows: 1) the ribosome may have multiple binding sites for Sec61β, as evidenced by the estimate of 3–4 Sec61p heterotrimers per translocon (17Hanein D. Matlack K.E. Jungnickel B. Plath K. Kalies K.U. Miller K.R. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar); 2) the large size of the ribosome (M r ∼4.5 × 106) relative to Sec61βc/GST (M r ∼3.2 × 104) means that a single bound ribosome may shield access to many Sec61βc/GST molecules on the beads that are not actively involved in binding; and 3) due to the porosity of the glutathione-agarose, a large fraction of the Sec61βc/GST may be bound in interior spaces that are not accessible to ribosomes. The cytoplasmic domain of Sec61β has a predicted isoelectric point of 12.0, with ∼10% basic residues and a predicted net charge of +8 at neutral pH. This raised the possibility that the ribosome binding activity of Sec61βc/GST might result from a relatively unspecific charge-based interaction with ribosomal RNA. If this were the case, yeast transfer RNA would be expected to compete efficiently with labeled ribosomes for binding to Sec61βc/GST-coated glutathione-agarose beads. In Fig. 3, yeast transfer RNA was added to the direct binding assay at a molar excess of up to 2500-fold relative to inactive labeled ribosomes. Given that the ratio of the masses of total ribosomal RNA to tRNA (per mol) is ∼125:1, an unspecific binding of ribosomal RNA should have been reduced 40–50% by a 100-fold molar excess of tRNA, even if all the ribosomal RNA was available for binding. In actuality a substantial amount of the ribosomal RNA is likely to be buried within the particle (37Kuhlbrandt W. Unwin P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 431-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), so an even greater reduction of ribosome binding might be expected if the binding were simply charge-dependent. Instead, the reduction in the binding of labeled ribosomes to Sec61βc/GST does not approach 50% until a 2500-fold molar excess of tRNA is added (Fig. 3 , left panel). Unlabeled ribosomes, however, compete efficiently (Fig. 3, right panel). We also examined the salt dependence of ribosome binding to Sec61βc/GST. Stripped rough microsomes have a large ribosome binding capacity at low salt concentrations (25 mmKCl); the fraction of ribosomes bound in vitro falls off steeply as the salt concentration is increased to 0.5 m(24Borgese N. Mok W. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 559-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the affinity of binding is higher at a more physiological salt concentration (150 mm KCl) than at 25 mm KCl (25Kalies K.U. Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To examine the salt sensitivity of ribosome binding to the Sec61βc/GST fusion protein, we performed the direct binding assay described above, at a range of salt concentrations. As shown in Fig. 4, the ribosome binding activity of Sec61βc/GST (open squares) was stabilized by moderate salt concentrations and did not fall off appreciably unless the KOAc concentration was raised from 250 to 500 mm, a concentration at which the dissociation of nontranslating ribosomes from native rough microsomes is essentially complete (24Borgese N. Mok W. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 559-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The base-line level of binding obtained with GST alone (Fig. 4, closed squares) was insensitive to the salt concentration. The fact that the binding of ribosomes to Sec61βc/GST, unlike the binding of ribosomes to stripped rough microsomes, is actually favored at moderate versus low salt concentrations, may be due to the absence, in the Sec61βc/GST agarose beads, of low affinity interactions that account for much of the binding to stripped rough microsomes at low salt concentrations (25Kalies K.U. Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Ribosome binding to the ER membrane is believed to occur largely through the large ribosomal subunit; in some reconstructions, however, the subunits lie side-by-side on the membrane, and an interaction between the small subunit and the membrane remains possible (38Unwin P.N. Nature. 1977; 269: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Unwin P.N. Taddei C. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 40Unwin P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the studies of Borgese et al. (24Borgese N. Mok W. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 559-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), isolated large ribosomal subunits are capable of re-binding in vitro to stripped rough microsomes; small subunits also bind but to a lesser extent. We wished to test whether the Sec61βc/GST fusion protein binds preferentially to the large ribosomal subunit, as is the case with native rough microsomes. A fixed amount of labeled ribosomal monomers (80 S) was added to a binding reaction containing Sec61βc/GST-agarose beads (Sec61β c /GST, Fig.5, left panel) or stripped rough microsomes (PKRM, Fig. 5, right panel). An equimolar amount of unlabeled small (40 S) or large (60 S) subunits or monomers (80 S) was added as a competitor, and the extent of binding of the unlabeled component was inferred from the extent to which the binding of labeled monomers was reduced. In both stripped microsomes and Sec61βc/GST-agarose beads, unlabeled monomers (80 S) could compete efficiently for binding. Small subunits (40 S) had a more modest effect on binding. The effect of large subunits (60 S) was greater in stripped rough microsomes than in βc/GST-agarose beads, but this difference may not be significant in comparison to the effect of the other unlabeled competitors. In the case of Sec61βc/GST, the competitive activity of large subunits was consistently greater than that of small subunits, implying that Secβc/GST binds preferentially to large subunits. By using two complementary methods, we have obtained results suggesting physical contact between the Sec61 β subunit and the ribosome. First, the Sec61β cytoplasmic domain (Sec61βc) prevents ribosome attachment to ER membranes when it is added to an in vitro ribosome binding assay in the form of a GST fusion protein (Fig. 1). Second, the Sec61βc/GST fusion protein binds directly to ribosomes (Fig. 2), and the ribosome binding affinity of Sec61βc/GST is comparable to that of stripped rough microsomes. Our results are surprising in view of the work of Kalies et al. (29Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) showing that Sec61β-depleted proteoliposomes bind to nontranslating ribosomes with an affinity comparable to that of proteoliposomes containing intact Sec61p. Based on this it appears possible that the ribosome binding activity of Sec61β, as detected in our experiments, is merely redundant in vivo. However, the reported ribosome-binding affinities of the Sec61β-depleted and the mock-depleted preparations (50 and 45 nm, respectively) in the latter study, although comparable to each other, are both considerably weaker than the affinities measured for ribosome binding to native stripped microsomes in the work of the same authors (25Kalies K.U. Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 41Prinz A. Behrens C. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1900-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) which agree with the values from our own experiments (not shown; see also Ref. 24Borgese N. Mok W. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 559-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As we did not attempt to reproduce the depletion and reconstitution experiments in the present study, we cannot interpret this discrepancy with any confidence. It nonetheless leaves room for speculation that the effect of Sec61β depletion in the report by Kalies et al. (29Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) is masked by a general reduction in the affinity of both Sec61β-depleted and mock-depleted proteoliposomes and that the contribution of Sec61β to in vitro ribosome binding is more substantial than the latter results suggest. The difference in ribosome binding affinity between ER-derived reconstituted proteoliposomes and purified Sec61p-reconstituted membranes also leaves open the possibility that, in the former case, ribosome binding involves ER membrane proteins other than Sec61p. At least two ER membrane proteins with independent ribosome binding activity, p34 (42Yoshida H. Tondokoro N. Asano Y. Mizusawa K. Yamagishi R. Horigome T. Sugano H. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 43Tazawa S. Unuma M. Tondokoro N. Asano Y. Ohsumi T. Ichimura T. Sugano H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 89-98PubMed Google Scholar) and p180 (44Savitz A.J. Meyer D.I. Nature. 1990; 346: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), have been identified previously, although neither has been shown to associate with the translocon. Binding of ribosomes to membrane proteins other than Sec61p in reconstituted proteoliposomes might mask an effect of Sec61β depletion on the ribosome binding affinity of Sec61p itself. The study of Kalies et al. (29Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) also shows that the depletion of Sec61β impairs the in vitro transport of preprolactin into Sec61-reconstituted membranes, although this impairment can be overcome by allowing sufficient time for targeting of the ribosome-nascent-chain complex before resumption of translation. In the absence of a requirement for Sec61β in ribosome binding, the authors (29Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggest that Sec61β might be involved in a post-targeting step, possibly assisting in the insertion of the nascent chain into the translocation pore. This agrees with observations by Laird and High (45Laird V. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1983-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that the nascent chain can be chemically cross-linked to Sec61β at a point near its site of synthesis on the ribosome, presumably before it enters the translocation pore. In our study, the Sec61βc/GST fusion protein with high affinity to nontranslating ribosomes suggests that the physiological role of Sec61β is not limited to an interaction with the nascent chain. However, our results are not incompatible with the idea that Sec61β normally acts only at a post-targeting stage. If the ribosome normally binds first to another membrane component and then to Sec61β, depletion of Sec61β from membranes should not affect their apparent ribosome binding activity; presentation of Sec61β out of its normal context (as in our study) would reveal its latent ribosome binding activity. This would reconcile our findings with those of Kalieset al. (29Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), where depletion of Sec61β from the Sec61p complex did not affect its affinity for ribosomes. However, given that the cytoplasmic domain of Sec61β is large compared with the other cytoplasmic portions of the Sec61p complex, it seems unlikely that this domain is normally blocked or buried within the complex. Consistent with the idea that Sec61β is not essential for translocation, preliminary studies in our laboratory did not reveal an effect on the translocation of preprolactin when the Sec61βc/GST fusion protein was added to a reticulocyte lysate translation system in excess over ribosomes (not shown). The question of whether Sec61βc/GST binds primarily to ribosomal protein or to ribosomal RNA was not addressed in this study. The identity of the ribosomal components involved in ER membrane binding has not been firmly established. Although previous studies identified groups of ribosomal proteins that are relatively inaccessible to chemical modification in the membrane-boundversus the free state (46Lewis J.A. Sabatini D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Kisilevsky R. Gore J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 910: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the recent work of Prinzet al. (41Prinz A. Behrens C. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1900-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) indicates that the ribosome binds to the ER membrane through the 28 S ribosomal RNA and that extensive proteolysis of ribosomes does not affect their ability to bind ER membranes. However, the type of ribosome binding measured in these experiments was insensitive to the presence of Sec61β (29Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 41Prinz A. Behrens C. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1900-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and it remains possible that the binding of ribosomes to Sec61β reported here involves a different cognate ribosomal component. The in vitro binding of ribosomes to Sec61βc/GST is the most reductive system available at present for the study of the ER-ribosome junction, and further biochemical studies using this system may avoid some difficulties inherent in studies using native rough microsomes.

https://openalex.org/W1977082660,"Chloride channels belonging to the ClC family are ubiquitous and participate in a wide variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. To define sequence segments in ClC channels that contribute to the formation of their ion conduction pathway, we employed a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, heterologous expression, patch clamp recordings, and chemical modification of the human muscle ClC isoform, hClC-1. We demonstrate that a highly conserved 8-amino acid motif (P3) located in the linker between transmembrane domains D2 and D3 contributes to the formation of a wide pore vestibule facing the cell interior. Similar to a previously defined pore region (P1 region), this segment functionally interacts with the corresponding segment of the contralateral subunit. The use of cysteine-specific reagents of different size revealed marked differences in the diameter of pore-forming regions implying that ClC channels exhibit a pore architecture quite similar to that of certain cation channels, in which a narrow constriction containing major structural determinants of ion selectivity is neighbored by wide vestibules on both sides of the membrane."

Na+/H+ exchangers hemagglutinin polymerase chain reaction endoglycosidase H polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Mammalian Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE)1 are a ubiquitous family of transmembrane proteins that catalyze the antiport of Na+ and H+ at the plasma membrane. Under physiological conditions, NHE drive H+ out of the cell by coupling to the Na+ gradient, which is generated and maintained by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. NHE are implicated in a variety of important physiological functions, including intracellular pH regulation, cell volume control, and Na+ homeostasis. Hydropathy analysis of the NHE1 isoform predicts that 10 to 12 transmembrane helices comprise the N terminus and that the C terminus constitutes a large cytoplasmic domain (1Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). This structure delineates function; the N-terminal domain, which is highly conserved among the various NHE isoforms, confers transport activity of the exchanger, whereas the considerably divergent C-terminal tail corresponds to a regulatory domain (2Wakabayashi S.

Numerous studies have shown that NHE isoforms can be post-translationally modified in a variety of ways. The cytosolic C-terminal tail domain modulates exchanger activity by becoming phosphorylated in response to extracellular signals like growth hormones (4Sardet C. Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1990; 247: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and through association with a variety of regulatory molecules, such as Ca2+/calmodulin (5Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some NHE isoforms are glycosylated in extracellular loops between transmembrane segments, although the functional significance of such modifications is unclear (6Counillon L. Pouyssegur J.

Hydropathy analysis of Nhx1 reveals a domain structure similar to NHE isoforms, suggesting that the structure/function relationship for intracellular exchangers may be homologous to the plasma membrane-type antiporters. Here, we take a first step toward understanding how Nhx1 is regulated, specifically by investigating post-translational modification of the protein. We have determined that Nhx1 is an N-linked glycosylated protein and have shown that these glycosylations uniquely map to residues in the C-terminal hydrophilic tail portion of the exchanger. The presence of glycosylated asparagines in the C terminus predicts that at least some portion of the Nhx1 tail is exposed to the lumen of the late endosomal compartment. An earlier report demonstrated that epitopes within the NHE3 C-terminal tail were exposed to the exoplasmic side of the membrane (31Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12391-12396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), although there is no evidence for glycosylation of the tail region of NHE3 or any other NHE isoform. Taken together with the results of our study, these findings support an unpredicted topological arrangement for the C-terminal region of Na+/H+exchangers that warrants further study. Mammalian Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE)1 are a ubiquitous family of transmembrane proteins that catalyze the antiport of Na+ and H+ at the plasma membrane. Under physiological conditions, NHE drive H+ out of the cell by coupling to the Na+ gradient, which is generated and maintained by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. NHE are implicated in a variety of important physiological functions, including intracellular pH regulation, cell volume control, and Na+ homeostasis. Hydropathy analysis of the NHE1 isoform predicts that 10 to 12 transmembrane helices comprise the N terminus and that the C terminus constitutes a large cytoplasmic domain (1Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). This structure delineates function; the N-terminal domain, which is highly conserved among the various NHE isoforms, confers transport activity of the exchanger, whereas the considerably divergent C-terminal tail corresponds to a regulatory domain (2Wakabayashi S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that NHE isoforms can be post-translationally modified in a variety of ways. The cytosolic C-terminal tail domain modulates exchanger activity by becoming phosphorylated in response to extracellular signals like growth hormones (4Sardet C. Counillon L. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1990; 247: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and through association with a variety of regulatory molecules, such as Ca2+/calmodulin (5Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some NHE isoforms are glycosylated in extracellular loops between transmembrane segments, although the functional significance of such modifications is unclear (6Counillon L. Pouyssegur J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12954-12961Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Over the last several years, phenomenological evidence of intracellular Na+/H+ exchange has been documented in a variety of mammalian tissues (8Hilden S.A. Ghoshroy K.B. Madias N.E. Am. J.

Our laboratory recently identified and cloned a Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of mammalian NHE, called Nhx1 (11Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), which represents the founding member of a unique and growing subfamily of intracellular Na+/H+ exchangers, including proteins identified in Schizosaccharomyces pombe,Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and humans. Nhx1 localizes to a late endosomal/prevacuolar compartment where it mediates intracellular sequestration of Na+ in a pH-dependent manner (11Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol.

Deletion mutants of pTM-CAT plasmid revealed the presence of distal and proximal RA-responsive regions containing direct repeat with 4 spaces (DR4) and three of four Sp1 sites, respectively. Cotransfection of a pTM-CAT plasmid with expression plasmids of RA receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ) augmented the promoter activity under the condition of lower retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα) expression, whereas the activity was greatly diminished when RXRα was highly expressed. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay with cDNA containing the DR4 indicated that heterodimers of RAR and RXRα interacted with the DR4 site, although the interaction gradually disappeared with the increase in the ratio of RXRα/RAR. On the other hand, Sp1 protein interacted especially with the tandem Sp1 site corresponding to the first and second Sp1 sequences of the four Sp1 sites in the proximal RA-responsive region. The binding of Sp1 to Sp1 sites was independent of RAR-RXR heterodimer but increased with the increase in Sp1 concentration in the presence of unknown factor(s) of reticulocyte lysate. Upon treatment of the cells with RA, time-dependent increases in the ratio of RARβ to RXRα and the phosphorylated form of Sp1 were observed. We concluded that two genomic DNA regions, the DR4 site (−1531 to −1516) and the first and second Sp1-binding sites (−145 to −121), were involved in the RA-dependent augmentation of thrombomodulin gene expression through increased interactions of the two regions with heterodimer of RAR-RXRα and nuclear Sp1, respectively.

The direct effects of retinol and its derivatives (retinoids), such as t-RA and 9-cis-RA (9C-RA), on the expressions of many genes are apparently mediated by nuclear receptor proteins that are members of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) superfamily of transcriptional regulators (18Petkovich M.

However, the direct repeats of RARE separated by 4 base sequences (DR4) at −1531 to −1516 from the transcription start site of TM may not be a candidate for nuclear retinoid receptors, because the DR4 sequence has been shown to be specific for a heterodimer of RXR and TR (25Marks M.S.

It is also known that dimers of RA receptors such as homodimer of RXRα and heterodimers of RARs and RXR interact with repeated RAREs spaced by 1 base (DR1) and 5 bases (DR5), respectively (26Umesono K.

On the other hand, it is well known that the transcription factor Sp1 binds to GC boxes (GGGCGG or CCCGCC) and activates transcription of a subset of genes that contain those boxes in animal cells (29Dynan W.S.

However, there is no direct evidence concerning interactions between Sp1, RA receptor proteins, and the four Sp1 sequences in the TM gene, especially in the case of HUVE cells treated with retinoids. The results of transactivation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicate that up-regulation of TM gene expression by retinoid is associated with increases in the ratio of RARs to RXRs and in the amount of Sp1, followed by enhancement of the interactions between heterodimers of RARs-RXRα and the DR4 sequence and between Sp1 and the consensus binding sites of the TM gene. Furthermore, our results suggest that retinoid itself does not function directly as the accelerator of these bindings and that the bindings of Sp1 to the Sp1 sites is dependent on the phosphorylation of the protein. pMAM-neo and pMAM-neo-CAT plasmids were purchased from Toyobo Biochemicals, Osaka, Japan, and pGEM-4Z and pSV-β-galactosidase control plasmids and TransFast were fromPromega.

Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin were obtained from Vector Laboratories. The 5′-flanking DNA fragment of the TM gene was obtained by PCR from a genomic DNA template that was prepared from HUVE cells. The primers were designed based on the sequences reported by Shirai et al. (14Shirai T. Shiojiri S. Ito H. Yamamoto S. Kusumoto H. Deyashiki Y. Maruyama I. Suzuki K. J. Biochem.

The PCR products of 689- and 1319-bp fragments were ligated at the XhoI site to prepare a 1702-bp TM fragment (from −1730 to −29 with respect to the untranslated site, which corresponds to −1562 to +140 with respect to the transcription starting site). The DNA fragments were subcloned into the pGEM-4Z vector, and the sequences were determined by the 373S DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Expression plasmids, designated as pTM549-CAT and pTM1562-CAT, were constructed by inserting the TM cDNA (689 or 1702 bp) at the SalI site of a promoterless pMAM-CAT vector, which was prepared by the ligation of the CAT expression fragment derived from pMAM-neo-CAT vector and the neo gene-deleted pMAM-neo vector after deletion of the Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat sequences. The TM gene was systematically digested with exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease after treatments with NheI and SphI. Deletion end sites were confirmed by DNA sequencing with the 5′-DNA primers derived from pMAM plasmid. The deletion mutants of pTM-CAT plasmid were prepared by ligation of PCR products over the mutation sites. pTM346-CAT plasmid was digested with MluI and XhoI, and then the appropriate ligation fragment was introduced. To introduce a mutation at the DR4 site of the gene, pTM1562-CAT plasmid was digested withPstI and ligated after Klenow fragment treatment (the plasmid was designated as pTM1562-CAT d(−1524/−1521)). Amplified plasmid DNAs in JM109 cells were purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation in a Hitachi RP120VT rotor. BxPC-3 cells were cultured into 60-mm diameter noncoated dishes with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), and the medium was replaced with MCDB medium without FCS at ∼50% density. Plasmid DNAs treated with a cationic liposomes, TransFast, were prepared in polystyrene tubes and added to the cell cultures. They were allowed to stand for 2 h in a CO2 incubator, and then the culture medium was added to the cells. Plasmid DNA used amounted to 10 and 5 μg/dish for pTM-CATs and pSV-β-galactosidase, respectively, and various amounts for pCMX-RARs. 24 h after the addition of culture medium, t-RA (10 μm in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), final concentration) or 9C-RA (10 μm in 0.1% Me2SO, final concentration) was added to the DNA-transfected cells for 24 h. The cells were recovered and sonicated, and the resulting supernatants were used for determinations of CAT and β-galactosidase activities. HUVE cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% FCS without endothelial cell growth supplement and heparin, and secondary cultures on collagen-coated dishes were used for experiments (11Horie S.

For measurement of CAT activity, 1-deoxy[dichloroacetyl-1-14C]chloramphenicol was used as the substrate, and the 3′-acetylated form of chloramphenicol was detected by autoradiography following thin layer chromatography on a Silica Gel 60 plate using a solvent of chloroform/methanol (19:1, v/v). β-Galactosidase activity was measured according to Promega's protocol, and the activity was used as an internal control to normalize the transfection efficiency of individual pTM-CAT plasmids. Total TM antigen in HUVE and BxPC-3 cells was measured after solubilization of cells with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride for 30 min at 4 °C (12Ishii H. Horie S. Kizaki K. Kazama M. Blood. 1992; 80: 2556-2562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from HUVE and BxPC-3 cells (100-mm diameter dishes) with an ISOGEN kit according to the recommended protocol. Northern blot hybridization was performed as described previously (11Horie S. Kizaki K. Ishii H. Kazama M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For RARs and RXRα, RNAs were absorbed on a filter using a slot blotter after the confirmation of each specific transcript on 1% denatured agarose gel electrophoresis. A 2057-bp TM cDNA fragment (corresponding −188 to +1869, where +1 is the first translated base, subcloned into pUC 119 atHindIII and BamHI sites), which was cloned from a placenta cDNA library, was used as a probe. Hybridization probes for RARα, RARβ, RARγ, and RXRα were obtained by treatment of pCMX plasmids with appropriate endonucleases, whereas Sp1 (DNASIS accession number J03133) probe was prepared by PCR using specific primer and cDNA of HUVE cells as a template. The identification of probes was performed by means of endonuclease treatments. The lengths of the probes used were 823 (RARα), 882 (RARβ), 804 (RARγ), 1074 (RXRα), and 732 bp (Sp1). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using the random primer extension labeling system. Nuclear run-on study was performed using [α-32P]dUTP-labeled RNA of nuclear fraction of cells treated or not treated with 10 μm t-RA for 6 h. The labeled RNA probe was purified by DNase I and proteinase K treatments, then absorbed on a nitrocellulose filter, and further purified with trichloroacetic acid washing and additional DNase I treatment. The probe eluted by SDS treatment was recovered by ethanol precipitation. Linearized pCMX and pCMX-TM plasmids, of which the latter was constructed by insertion of the 2.6-kb TM cDNA fragment intoHindIII and BamHI sites of pCMX, were absorbed on a Hybond-N filter using a slot-blotter and fixed by a transilluminator. The filter was incubated with the labeled RNA probe for 36 h at 42 °C in the presence of 40% formamide and 10% dextran sulfate. The intensities of the signals developed by exposure of filters on x-ray films were determined using a Fuji BAS 1500 imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan) and expressed relative to the signal of the control band. BxPC-3 cells transfected with pCMX-hRARs and/or pCMX-hRXRα were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of t-RA (or 9C-RA). The cells were recovered with a cell scraper and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting pellet was homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem type homogenizer and further centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min to obtain the nuclear fraction. This fraction was suspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and stored at −80 °C until used as a nuclear extract. RARα, RARβ, and RXRα were also prepared in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system using linearized pCMX-hRARs and pCMX-hRXRα plasmids as templates for RNA synthesis with T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instruction. The amounts of translated proteins were estimated by Western blotting after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (25-mer each) containing DR4 or Sp1 sites were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The upper strand of oligonucleotides with consensus sequences underlined were 5′-CGTTTGGTCACTGCAGGTCAGTCCA-3′ for DR4; 5′-CTGTGTTGCACGTGCAAGCTCCGTA-3′ for scramble DR4; 5′-CCTGTCGGCCCCGCCCGAGAACCTC-3′ for the third Sp1 site; 5′-ATCCCATGCGCGAGGGCGGGCGCAA-3′ for the second Sp1 site; 5′-GCGCAAGGGCGGCCAGAGAACCCAG-3′ for the first Sp1 site; and 5′-GCGAGGGCGGGCGCAAGGGCGGCCA-3′ for the tandem Sp1 sites containing second and first Sp1 sites. The reaction mixtures for the EMSA contained 0.5 ng of labeled probe (1 × 105 cpm/ng), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 μl of nuclear retinoid receptors or 1 unit of Sp1 or AP2 in a final volume of 6 μl of 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmZnCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm spermidine, 0.008% Nonidet P-40, and 15% glycerol. As sources of nuclear retinoid receptors, nuclear extracts of BxPC-3 cells transfected with pCMX-hRARs and/or pCMX-hRXRα plasmids or in vitro translation products were used. As a reference, the preparation obtained by using the same procedure without any plasmid was employed. Competition experiments were performed with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled probe. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and subjected to 4% PAGE using a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm sodium acetate. For the supershift assay, 0.5 μg of the respective antibody was further added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 15 min at 25 °C. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried on filter paper and subjected to autoradiography. Nuclear extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE according to the method described previously (37Hamada H. Ishii H. Sakyo K. Horie S. Nishiki K. Kazama M. Blood. 1995; 86: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with polyclonal antibodies of RARs, RXRα, or Sp1. Detections of RA receptors and Sp1 were carried out using biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, and the resulting light emission developed by Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent was captured on Kodak X-Omat autoradiography film. In the present study, we used human pancreas BxPC-3 cells instead of HUVE cells, for the following reasons. 1) BxPC-3 cells show less damage than HUVE cells after treatment with cationic liposomes, one of the mildest transfection methods (38Gao X. Huang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar); 2) their characteristics of t-RA-dependent TM expression are similar to those of HUVE cells (see below); and 3) they can be easily maintained under homogeneous conditions. Fig. 1 shows the changes in antigen and mRNA levels of TM in BxPC-3 cells after treatment with t-RA. Total TM antigen in BxPC-3 cells was 14.1 ± 1.1 ng/1 × 105 cells (HUVE cells contained 17.3 ± 1.4 ng/1 × 105 cells) and increased to 2.8 times the control on treatment with 10 μm t-RA for 24 h (HUVE cells showed an increase to 2.5 times the control on similar treatment) (Fig. 1 A). The TM mRNA level of BxPC-3 cells was increased by t-RA treatment and reached 3.7 times the control at 10 μm t-RA for 24 h (Fig. 1 B). The time courses of the t-RA-dependent increase in TM antigen and in mRNA levels of BxPC-3 cells were also similar to those of HUVE cells (data not shown). These dose- and time-dependent increases in TM antigen and mRNA levels of BxPC-3 cells after t-RA treatment were in accordance with the result in HUVE cells reported previously (11Horie S. Kizaki K. Ishii H. Kazama M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of t-RA on TM gene transcription rate, a nuclear run-on study was performed on nuclei prepared from both HUVE and BxPC-3 cells treated or not treated with 10 μmt-RA for 6 h (Fig. 1 C). Treatment with t-RA increased the TM transcription rate to 310 and 325% of the respective control level for HUVE and BxPC-3 cells (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, TNF-α-dependent down-regulation of the TM antigen level in BxPC-3 cells was counteracted by synchronized treatment with t-RA (data not shown), as seen in HUVE cells (12Ishii H. Horie S. Kizaki K. Kazama M. Blood. 1992; 80: 2556-2562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the promoter activity of TM by transient expression assay using constructs of pTM-CAT plasmids. Although we could not clearly identify the transcription initiation site for human TM mRNA by S1 nuclease protection analysis, a faint signal at −168 base from the ATG codon of the translation site was consistent with one of the two sites reported by Yu et al. (15Yu K. Morioka H. Fritza L.M.A. Beeler D.L. Jackman R.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23237-23247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus the first untranscribed base −1 was defined as the −169 base from the ATG codon in this paper. Fig. 2 shows the sequence-specific promoter activity of TM as determined by measuring the CAT activity of BxPC-3 cells transfected with pTM-CAT plasmids, which have different TM 5′-flanking sequences. Compared with the CAT activity of BxPC-3 cells transfected with pTM1562-CAT, the activities of cells transfected with the deletion plasmids decreased gradually when the deletions of TM 5′-flanking sequences were extended to −549. Although the CAT activity of cells transfected with pTM549-CAT was half that in the case of pTM1562-CAT, plasmids with more extensive deletions, such as pTM479-CAT and pTM404-CAT, showed some recovery in CAT activity. When pTM213-CAT was transfected, the CAT activity was markedly increased as compared with that of pTM244-CAT, and a further deleted plasmid (pTM119-CAT) decreased the activity to a level less than that of pTM244-CAT plasmid. The results suggest that negative- and positive-acting elements are present in the sequences around −244 to −214 and −213 to −120, respectively, of the TM gene. The effect of t-RA on the promoter activity of TM was measured (Fig. 3). The ratio of increase of CAT activity by t-RA was different for each plasmid used. The 4.1-fold increase of the activity by t-RA treatment in the case of pTM1562-CAT decreased to ∼2.3-fold when pTM-CAT plasmids containing the 5′-site from −1491 to −213 of the TM sequence were transfected, and further deletion of the 5′-sequence abolished the t-RA-dependent increase in the activity. These results indicate the existence of two independent RA-responsive regions (one localized at −1562 to −1492 bp and the other localized at −213 to −120 bp of the transcription site) in the TM promoter sequence.Figure 3t-RA-dependent increase in transcriptional activity of the TM gene determined by transient CAT expression assay of BxPC-3 cells. The transfection procedure was the same as that in Fig. 2. At 24 h after the medium change, 10 μm t-RA or its vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) was added to the culture medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. The CAT activities normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activities were expressed as a percentage of that of BxPC-3 cells treated with 0.1% Me2SO after transfection of pTM1562-CAT plasmid. Open and closed bars show relative CAT activities of the transformed cells treated with 0.1% Me2SO or t-RA, respectively, and values inparentheses on the right indicate the ratio of the activity in each transformant. Open bars are the same data as the values in Fig. 2. Results are the average values of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure Viewer"

This antibody-antigen interaction is specific for the native dimeric form of the antigen only and results in the inhibition of the enzymatic activity, thus making MAK33 a valuable tool in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (1Buckel P. Hübner-Parajsz C. Mattes R. Lenz H. Haug H. Beaucamp K. Gene. 1987; 51: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In recent years, the Fab fragment of MAK33, consisting of the entire light chain and the two N-terminal domains of the heavy chain, has been used as a model for studies of protein folding for multidomain proteins (2Lilie H. Lang K. Rudolph R. Buchner J. Science. 1993; 2: 1490-1495Google Scholar, 3Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Buchner J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Slow steps in the folding process of the MAK33 Fab were found to be due to isomerizations of prolyl-peptide bonds, however, the structural basis for these phenomena remained unknown. Folding catalysts of the peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIase) family have been shown to catalyze these slow folding processes in vitro (2Lilie H. Lang K. Rudolph R. Buchner J. Science. 1993; 2: 1490-1495Google Scholar). The resultant isomeric state in turn has been shown to influence subunit association. Kinetic analyses of the folding pathway have demonstrated that the relative position of polypeptide chain association within the folding pathway leading to the native molecule is different for the Fab fragment and the CH3 dimer of the Fc fragment (4Lilie H. Rudolph R. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 190-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Thies M.J.W. Mayer J. Augustine J.G. Frederick C.A. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although the isomerization of key proline residues could occur at various stages relative to subunit association for the Fab (4Lilie H. Rudolph R. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 190-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), dimer prolyl isomerization had to take place before association in the case of the CH3 (6Thies M.J.W. Mayer J. Augustine J.G. Frederick C.A. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results indicate a complex relationship between prolyl isomerization and intermolecular association in the folding of the antibody molecule. During the biosynthesis of antibodies, the ER-specific hsp70 chaperone family member, BiP, plays an important role in the assembly of the mature antibody. BiP has been shown to bind to the variable domain of certain light chains to assist in folding or as a means of removing improperly folded chains from the secretory pathway (7Hendershot L. Bole D. Kohler G. Kearney J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition, binding to the newly synthesized heavy chain allows the polypeptide chain to remain soluble until the appropriate light chain is translated and available to form the complete antibody molecule (8Bole D.G. Hendershot L.M. Kearney J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 9Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Based on the screening of a phage display peptide library for BiP-binding sequences (10Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), an algorithm has been developed that allows for the prediction of potential protein sequences, which might constitute BiP-binding sites in proteins (11Knarr G.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29850-29857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary sequence of MAK33 as well as that of a related antibody indicated that binding does seem to require exposed hydrophobic residues. Notably leucine, but also tryptophan, residues are specifically enriched in BiP-binding sequences compared with the overall protein sequence. As evidenced from the stimulation of the ATPase activity of BiP upon heptapeptide binding in vitro, potential BiP-binding sites in vivo have been identified (11Knarr G. Gething M.-J.H. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Knarr G. Modrow S. Todd A. Gething M.-J. Buchner J. J. Biol.

In the present study, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the MAK33 Fab fragment by x-ray crystallography. This structure enables us to discuss the protein environment of thecis-proline peptide bonds as well as the position of BiP-binding sites identified biochemically using synthetic heptapeptides. In this way one can begin to address the critical questions of subunit recognition within the context of the complete folding pathway of a multidomain protein. The proteolytically derived Fab fragment of the murine monoclonal antibody MAK33 of subclass κ/IgG1 directed against dimeric muscle-specific human creatine kinase (CK-MM, E.C. 2.7.3.2) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH. The lyophilized Fab was resuspended to ∼6 mg/ml in 150 mm NaCl by gently rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. The solution was then dialyzed overnight against MilliQ water and subsequently concentrated to 30 mg/ml using Amicon microconcentrators. The final protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient of A 280 = 80,000 m−1 cm−1 (13Schmidt M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16829-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystals of MAK33 Fab were grown at 4 °C by vapor diffusion in 4-μl sitting drops made up of equal volumes of protein solution and a reservoir solution containing 50 mm citrate, pH 5.6, 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 1.0 m NaCl, and 16% glycerol. Large (0.25 × 0.20 × 0.80 mm3), single crystals were obtained after 8–10 weeks. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains two Fab molecules and ∼53% solvent with a Matthews coefficient of 2.64 Å3/dalton and a cell volume of 264,105.8 Å3 (14Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Diffraction data were collected at 4 °C from CuKα radiation generated by a Rigaku RTP500 RC rotating anode generator using a Marresearch imaging plate. Reflection files were indexed using the program DENZO (15Otwinowski, Z. (1993) Data Collection and Processing, Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend Daresbury, UKGoogle Scholar) and subsequently scaled by the program SCALEPACK (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). A summary of data collection statistics is shown in Table I. The structure of MAK33 Fab was solved by the molecular replacement method using the anti-influenza virus hemagglutinin Ha1 κ/IgG2A Fab fragment 17/9 (17Rini J.M. Schulze-Gahmen U. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 255: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) as a search model in the program AMoRe (18Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The sequence identity between the search model and MAK33 Fab was 98 and 53% identical for the constant and variable domains of the light chain, respectively, and 87 and 89% identical for the constant and variable domains of the heavy chain, respectively. A rotational search using the entire Fab fragment was carried out, resulting in a pair of clear solutions with correlation coefficients significantly higher than those of the next highest solutions. After an initial rigid body refinement based on this model, a 2F o − F c map was calculated yielding strong electron density, and the molecular packing was checked showing no conflicts between molecules related by translational symmetry. The elbow regions connecting the variable and constant domains of both the light and heavy chains could be easily discerned in the electron density map, yielding an intact molecule for structure refinement.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData collection Space groupP1 Unit cell dimensions (a,b,c) (Å)58.91, 65.66, 73.46 α, β, γ (°)109.14, 106.94, 95.91 Resolution range (Å)25.0–2.9 Unique reflections20,143 −fold redundancy3.9 Completeness (%)93.7 (87.1) R merge(%)1-aR merge = ∑ ‖I − 〈I〉‖/〈I〉.6.1 (27.9) 〈I/ς〉10.0 (2.5)Refinement No. of protein atoms3159/molecule Resolution range (Å)8.0–2.9 Reflections used18,312 Completeness (%)89.4 R factor (%)1-bR factor = ∑‖Fo − Fc‖/∑‖Fo‖.19.8 (28.1) FreeR factor (%)1-cFree R is as for R factor but calculated for a test set of 8% comprising reflections not used in the refinement.24.3 (32.9) Rmsd from ideal values1-dRoot-mean-squared deviations (Rmsd) are given from ideal values. : bond length (Å)0.014 Rmsd from ideal values1-dRoot-mean-squared deviations (Rmsd) are given from ideal values. : bond angles (°)1.9 Average B value (Å2): all atoms37.16 Average B value (Å2): mainchain atoms36.09 Average B value (Å2): sidechain atoms38.32 Residues within allowed regions of Ramachandran plot (%)99.4Values in parenthesis correspond to the highest resolution shell (2.90–2.97 Å).1-a R merge = ∑ ‖I − 〈I〉‖/〈I〉.1-b R factor = ∑‖Fo − Fc‖/∑‖Fo‖.1-c Free R is as for R factor but calculated for a test set of 8% comprising reflections not used in the refinement.1-d Root-mean-squared deviations (Rmsd) are given from ideal values.

Nonhomologous residues in β-strands were mutated to alanine, and the loops connecting the strands, including the six CDRs, were completely deleted to minimize model bias. Structure refinement was carried out using the program X-PLOR (19Brünger A.T. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR: X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) utilizing noncrystallographic symmetry restraints in the initial cycles. Side chains were rebuilt with the program O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Iterative cycles of manual rebuilding employingF o − F c and 2F o − F c maps in O were alternated with automated positional refinement and grouped B-factor refinement in X-PLOR in which the noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were gradually removed. In the case of the CDR H3, the longest loop in the heavy chain, the electron density was insufficient to allow refinement of this segment within either molecule in the asymmetric unit. Furthermore, residues His-133 through His-137, forming the loop-connecting strands A and B of the heavy chain constant domain, were also not included in refinement and model building due to weak electron density. The final model geometry was analyzed with PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Overall refinement statistics and final model parameters are given in Table I. Only 2 residues (0.6% of total) had phi-psi angle combinations that fall just outside of allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. These are both located in loop regions on the protein exterior. The final coordinates have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank and have been assigned PDB ID 1FH5 and Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics ID RCSB011583. The binding of MAK33 peptides by BiP was monitored by the measurement of BiP ATPase activity as described previously (11Knarr G. Gething M.-J.H. Modrow S. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27589-27594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). BiP used in this assay was purified from bovine pancreas as described (22Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann M. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7414-7421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the addition of gel filtration chromatography as a final purification step. The MAK33 peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-protected amino acids as described previously (23Atherton E. Fox H. Logan C.J. Harkiss D. Sheppard R.C. Williams S.B.J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1978; 13: 537-539Crossref Google Scholar). The standard assay contained 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 500 μm unlabeled ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and ∼4 μg of BiP in a total volume of 20 μl. Following different times of incubation at 37 °C, 3-μl aliquots were removed, and the amounts of ATP and ADP were determined by thin-layer chromatography and liquid scintillation. The three-dimensional structure of the MAK33 Fab fragment was determined using the molecular replacement method (see Table I). Two independent molecules were identified related by a pseudo 2-fold rotation. The final electron density maps were of high enough quality in most regions such that we could identify several previous DNA sequencing errors within the heavy chain (1Buckel P. Hübner-Parajsz C. Mattes R. Lenz H. Haug H. Beaucamp K. Gene. 1987; 51: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The MAK33 Fab fragment is comprised of four typical immunoglobulin domains, two each from the light and heavy chains (Fig. 1 A). Each domain is characterized by a β-barrel structure consisting of two β-sheets connected by an internal disulfide bridge. The orientation of the two interchain domain pairs with respect to each other is described by the elbow angle between the pseudo-dyads VL-VH and CL-CH1. In MAK33 the two molecules within the asymmetric unit have very similar domain orientations, assuming typical elbow angles of 161.9° and 161.3° for molecules 1 and 2, respectively. Surface loops extending from the N-terminal variable domains of both heavy and light chains form the antigen-binding site. The conformations of these loops can be classified according to the observations of Chothia and Lesk (24Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). They are typical for κ/IgG family members and belong to the same classes as those of the closely related antibody, 3D6, whose structure has been determined (25He X.M. Ruker F. Casale E. Carter D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7154-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The only possible exception is the H3 loop whose conformation appears disordered in our structure. Overall the surface comprised of the MAK33 CDR loops contains mostly neutral or uncharged residues (Fig. 1 B). However, two strongly charged zones of only a few residues each are localized in the heavy chain H1 and H2 loops. The only charged surface potential found in the light chain is part of the CDR L2, whose surface is partially directed away from the main antigen binding area of the other CDRs (Fig. 1 B). This antibody is distinct in that it recognizes only the native dimeric form of its antigen, CK-MM, and in contrast to many other antibodies it does not bind the denatured form of this protein. Therefore, antigen recognition is expected to be a conformation-specific, as opposed to a sequence-specific, interaction, i.e. requiring either a complex epitope comprising residues from both subunits or one whose key residues are influenced by the dimer formation. Comparison of the antigen-binding surface of MAK33 with those described in the complex structures of two sequence-specific antibodies directed against hen egg lysozyme reveals certain subtle differences. The contact surface of HyHel-10, an κ/IgG1 antibody, is a broad and relatively flat area with no obvious grooves or cavities but instead one extended region, comprising residues from CDRs H1 and H2, that appears to interact with the lysozyme active site (26Padlan E.A. Silverton E.W. Sheriff S. Cohen G.H. Smith-Gill S.J. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5938-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The CDR loop H3 is very short in this antibody and contributes only 1 residue to the interaction. The binding surface of monoclonal antibody F9.13.7, as seen in complex with a cross reacting antigen, Guinea fowl lysozyme, includes a shallow surface groove one side of which is mainly composed of the CDR H3 loop. In this antibody CDR H3 is relatively long and positioned such that its length and composition directly influence the binding interaction (27Lescar L. Pellegrini M. Souchon H. Tello D. Poljak R.J. Peterson N. Greene M. Alzari P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18067-18076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This longer CDR loop displays conformational changes upon antigen binding. In both native and complexed structures, the binding of anti-peptide Fab 17/9 to various segments from its antigen, influenza virus hemagglutinin, also utilizes a mostly wide flat surface. Comparison of these structures has shown that the CDR H3 loop exhibits a large conformational change upon antigen binding resulting in two very distinct structures for the bound and free H3 loop (28Schulze-Gahmen U. Rini J.M. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 243: 1098-1118Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contract to these antibodies, the analogous region in the MAK33 structure is slightly convex with a shallow groove or channel running the width of the molecule resulting in a bipartite binding surface. These structural differences suggest a possible alternate recognition mode for MAK33 consistent with its requirement for the dimeric form of the antigen. The longer CDR H3 loop contains 10 residues and, as seen in the lysozyme antigen/antibody complexes, would be expected to affect the surface presented for antigen binding. Although the corresponding electron density for this loop is weak in our structure, thus prohibiting the determination of its specific conformation, this disorder is suggestive of a possible direct interaction with the antigen such that upon binding this loop might assume a stable conformation. The molecular surfaces presented for complex formation between the light and heavy chain of any given antibody molecule comprises symmetrical arrangements of the β-strands of each individual domain (29Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the intersubunit contact surfaces of variable and constant domains differ despite the overall similarity in domain structure. In the MAK33 structure the variable domains interact along the edge of the sheet made up of β-strands HGCD such that the contact residues extend along βC and βH and include those of the adjacent loops. The constant domains, however, wrap around each other and interact face to face such that their respective β sheets comprising strands DEBA are at an angle of roughly 60 degrees. Direct contact extends along all these β-strands. These differential interactions are likely to influence the folding pathway of the intact antibody and might be related to differences in sequential ordering or rate-limiting effects of certain steps as compared for single domains or multidomain chains. Antibody molecules in general have a high degree of primary sequence conservation. In particular, they contain a number of conserved proline residues in both the light and heavy chain domains. These residues appear to play important structural roles by stabilizing the common scaffolding motifs that maintain the characteristic Ig domain secondary structure and also factor in the determination of the orientations of the hinge regions between individual domains. As observed in previous antibody structures, within the MAK33 Fab several of these conserved proline residues adopt the cis conformation. In general, the locations of the cis prolines can be broadly divided into those that are located near chain termini appearing on the molecular surface and those that are buried within the domain interfaces. The final assembly of the native Ig molecule must include steps to facilitate the isomerization process to the thermodynamically less stable cis form. Therefore, examination of the environment of these cis prolines within the context of the entire antibody molecule helps to differentiate them in terms of any potential roles they might play in protein folding or assembly, such as reactivity with respect to PPIases, the FK506 binding protein, or cyclophilin (2Lilie H. Lang K. Rudolph R. Buchner J. Science. 1993; 2: 1490-1495Google Scholar, 30Lang K. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1987; 329: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 31Harrison R.K. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3813-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In the MAK33 structure a conserved cis proline residue is found at position Pro-L9. 2Nomenclature for sequences: L, light chain; H, heavy chain; e.g. Pro-L9.This proline is in the N-terminal β segment of the light chain and is generally exposed to the solvent with a solvent-accessible surface of 18 Å2. The cis conformation appears to be stabilized by an additional H-bond to Oγ1 of Thr-L103 on an adjacent β strand (Fig. 3 A). The equivalent position in the heavy chain is occupied by a glycine residue that is also important in maintaining intradomain contacts. However, near the C terminus of the heavy chain there is a somewhat analogous cis proline residue at Pro-H191. This residue is also exposed to the solvent, with an accessible surface area of 17 Å2, and would appear to be able to readily interact with potential isomerases. The cis conformation of this residue is most likely stabilized by stacking on the preceding residue Trp H190 (Fig. 3 B). The only other cis proline within the light chain is found at position Pro-L142. This conserved residue is located in the loop connecting β-strands B and C of the constant domain and extends into the elbow region. The cis isomer is stabilized by an H-bond from the carbonyl to the neighboring His-L199. In addition, further stability is afforded by the improved stacking arrangement on the residue immediately preceding it, Tyr-L141 (Fig. 3 C). Thiscis proline residue has an accessible surface of only 10 Å2, suggesting that interaction with a PPIase is restricted once the light chain has assumed its tertiary fold. This highly conserved cis proline is critical for maintaining the intrastrand domain orientation. The two final cis proline residues, His-149 and His-151, are located in close proximity within the heavy chain. It has been previously suggested that the trans to cis isomerization of Pro-H151 3In earlier biochemical studies this proline is referred to as pro H159. is the rate-limiting step in the overall folding process of the MAK33 Fab (2Lilie H. Lang K. Rudolph R. Buchner J. Science. 1993; 2: 1490-1495Google Scholar). The present structure demonstrates that this cis isomer is stabilized by the structural constraints of its immediate neighborhood (Fig. 3 D). This residue is located in the upper edge of the constant domain of the heavy chain, where it protrudes into the elbow region and helps define the intrastrand angle between the VH and VCH1 domains. It is in an analogous location to that of Pro-L142 with respect to the secondary structure arrangement of the individual domains of each protein chain. However, the pairings of heavy and light chains occur in such a way that Pro-L142 is not directly involved in the interstrand constant domain contact site but is within ∼4–5 Å of the terminal residues (His-111 through His-113) of the heavy chain variable domain. The Pro-H151 residue, in the context of the heavy chain alone, has a large solvent accessible surface area of 23Å2, but in the intact Fab it is positioned within the constant domain subunit interface. These structural observations provide an explanation for the differential interplay of isomerization and association reactions of individual domains versus longer fragments (6Thies M.J.W. Mayer J. Augustine J.G. Frederick C.A. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, it is clear from this structure that a critical aspect of the stabilization of Pro-H151 comes from the presence of the othercis proline just 2 residues removed, at position H-149. This proline residue has a very small accessible surface area, 3 Å2, and is involved in numerous contacts. These include, stacking on Phe-H148 and the direct involvement in an intrachain contact with the His-H2O1 side chain (Fig. 3 D). Pro-H149 is also buried within a hydrophobic pocket formed by Leu-H8, Ala-H2O3, Thr-H123, and Pro-H151. This stacking pattern is observed in the closely related antibody, 3D6 (25He X.M. Ruker F. Casale E. Carter D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7154-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), as well as where, despite changes in individual residues, the overall structural interactions of this immediate region are conserved. BiP has for some time been an appealing target of studies to understand how chaperones identify denatured proteins. Antibodies are the best-studied natural substrate of this chaperone (7Hendershot L.

Biochemical studies have demonstrated that suboptimal core promoter recognition by TFIID might generate a substantial energetic barrier for initiating transcription, however, gene-specific activators should overcome this rate-limiting step by inducing conformational changes of TFIID (16Chi T.

Activator-bypass experiments, mostly performed in yeast, in which TBP or TAFs were physically connected to the heterologous DNA binding domain of gene-specific activators, showed that binding of TFIID (or TBP) to the core promoter was indeed a rate-limiting step in vivo that could be alleviated by artificial recruitment of TFIID (reviewed in Refs. 12Dorris D.R.

The recently developed DNA-cross-linking chromatin immunoprecipitation assay has made it possible to test directly whether binding of TFIID (or TBP) to the core promoter could be a bona fide regulatory step for activators in living cells (14Kuras L.

Whereas several yeast TAFs (e.g. TAF90, TAF68, TAF60, TAF25, and TAF17) as well as TBP are shared by TFIID and SAGA, histone acetyltransferase activities involved in coactivator function are encoded by distinct subunits, TAF145 and Gcn5, that are specific to TFIID and SAGA, respectively (36Grant P.A.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Spt3 and Spt8, which are SAGA-specific components, bind to TBP and inhibit TBP-TATA interactions as observed for TAND in TFIID (38Belotserkovskaya R. Sterner D.E. Deng M. Sayre M.H. Lieberman P.M. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although it remains to be determined whether Spt3- or Spt8-TBP interactions are regulated by activators or other factors, Spt8 appears to be dissociated from the SAGA complex under conditions of activation so that such inhibitory interactions can be alleviated (38Belotserkovskaya R. Sterner D.E. Deng M. Sayre M.H. Lieberman P.M. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mot1, a member of the SWI2/SNF2 helicase family, is the third intriguing factor that inhibits TBP-TATA interactions (39Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). It was originally identified as the mot1-1 allele that leads to increased basal expression of many genes in S. cerevisiae(40Davis J.L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Several lines of investigation uncovered it to be a 170-kDa component of the TBP-TAF complex distinct from TFIID (41van der Knaap J.A. Borst J.W. van der Vliet P.C. Gentz R. Timmers H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11827-11832Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 42Chicca J.J., II Auble D.T. Pugh B.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1701-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or as an ADI (ATP-dependent inhibitor of TBP binding to DNA) factor that dissociates TBP from the TATA element in an ATP-dependent manner (39Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 43Auble D.T. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 844-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recent studies provide evidence that Mot1 can not only repress but also stimulate transcription of certain genes presumably by regulating the distribution of a limiting pool of TBP between promoter and nonpromoter sites (44Muldrow T.A. Campbell A.M. Weil P.A. Auble D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2835-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 45Madison J.M. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was demonstrated that MOT1, SPT3, and TOA1, which encodes the larger subunit of TFIIA, interacted genetically with each other,i.e. toa1 and spt3 are synthetically lethal with mot1 and the Δspt3phenotype is partially suppressed by overexpression of Toa1 (45Madison J.M. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These observations strongly indicate that TBP-TATA interactions are intricately regulated in vivo by a wide variety of factors such as TFIID, SAGA, Mot1, and TFIIA. Here, to identify factors that are functionally related to the TAF N-terminal domain (TAND) of TAF145, we have screened for nsl(ΔTAND synthetic lethal) mutations that cause lethality in combination with the TAF145 gene that lacks TAND (taf145ΔTAND) in S. cerevisiae. Our screen identified two distinct temperature-sensitive (TS) alleles of the NSL1 gene, as alleles of the SPT15 gene which encodes TBP. Further characterization suggests that activation-defective TBP mutants tend to display synthetic lethal interactions with the taf145ΔTAND gene. This is in accordance with a hypothetical role of TAND in transcriptional regulation that we have recently proposed. Taken together with previous observations that the TS phenotype of TAND-lacking strains can be suppressed by overexpressing TBP or TFIIA, TAND is likely to assist TBP function rather than simply inhibit it, at least in vivo.

Holm C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TMY4-2 was generated by a recombination-mediated two-step gene replacement procedure (52Scherer S. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4951-4955Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), first by transforming CH1305 to Ura+ with pTM6 that had been linearized at the unique BglII site, and then by screening for a Ura−Ts+ segregant bearing the taf145ΔTAND allele on 5-FOA plates. The gene replacement was confirmed by PCR. TMY17-2c and TMY16-2c were made by mating-type interconversion from TMY4-2 and CH1305, respectively. The YEp13-HO plasmid, expressing the homothallic switching endonuclease endonuclease (53Russell D.W. Jensen R. Zoller M.J. Burke J. Errede B. Smith M. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4281-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was transformed into TMY4-2 and CH1305, both of which are MATa, to generate MATa/MATα diploid cells. After segregating the YEp13-HO plasmid away, cells were sporulated and dissected to isolate MATα haploid cells, i.e. TMY17-2c and TMY16-2c. The YTK271 strain was generated from H2440 (kindly provided by Dr. A. G. Hinnebusch) (30Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) by targeted disruption of the SPT15 gene using a marker cassette that has a URA3 gene between duplicated copies of a Salmonella hisG gene segment (54Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The cassette plasmid has the 5′-flanking sequence (∼500 bp upstream of the initiation codon) and 3′-flanking sequence (∼500 bp downstream of the termination codon) of the SPT15 gene on each side of URA3 marker. These flanking sequences were amplified by PCR with primers to create EcoRI-BglII and SalI-BamHI sites, respectively. The linear fragment digested with EcoRI and SalI was used to transform H2440. The structure of the disrupted gene was confirmed by Southern blotting. Since the SPT15 gene is essential for viability, we dissected heterozygously disrupted strains that had been transformed with the TRP1-marked plasmid carrying the SPT15 gene. Ura+ Trp+ haploid strains obtained from tetrad analysis were grown on 5-FOA plates to excise the URA3marker from the chromosome. The resulting Ura−Trp+ strains were subsequently transformed with the URA3-marked plasmid carrying the SPT15 gene (pYN11). The YTK271 strain (Ura+ Trp−) was selected by plasmid segregation. YAK289, 293, 493, 495, 582, 584, 586, 588, 620, 622, 633, 636, 938 strains were then generated from YTK271 by a plasmid shuffling technique. YTK271 (Δspt15 strain) was crossed with YKII1 (28Kotani T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32254-33264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Δtaf145 strain) and then dissected to obtain the haploid strain, YAK284, carrying double deletions of TAF145 and SPT15 genes. As TAF145 and SPT15 are both essential genes, the growth of YAK284 is supported by pYN11/SPT15 (URA3 marker) and pM11/TAF145 (TRP1 marker). YAK303 andYAK307 were constructed by replacing pM11 of YAK284 with pM3217 and pTM26, respectively. To perform an ade2 ade3 colony-sectoring assay for synthetic lethality (50Kranz J.E. Holm C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6629-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the TMY4-2 haploid strain was transformed with pTM17. The pTM17 plasmid was constructed by subcloning a 5.2-kb SalI-BamHI (partial) fragment of pYN2 (30Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) carrying the TAF145 gene and a 3.7-kb NheI-BamHI fragment of pDK255 (55Koshland D. Kent J.C. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1985; 40: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) carrying the ADE3 gene into the restriction enzyme sites between SalI and XbaI of pRS316 (56Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TMY4-2, bearing pTM17, was grown in liquid SD medium lacking uracil (SD-Ura) to an absorbance at 600 nm (A600) of around 0.7 and plated on YPD plates at a density of ∼4000 cells/plate. The plates were then UV-irradiated, resulting in ∼5–7.5% survival (200–300 cells/plate), and incubated for 5 days at 25 °C. Red colonies were restreaked three times on YPD plates. Colonies that remained red during this cultivation process were subsequently counter-selected on 5-FOA-containing plates. To exclude the possibility that nonsectoring and 5-FOA-sensitive phenotypes might be due to genomic integration of the pTM17 plasmid, mutant candidates were transformed with the plasmids bearing the TAF145 or taf145ΔTAND genes. True synthetic lethal mutants should show restored sectoring and growth on 5-FOA plates only upon transformation with the plasmid bearing the wild type TAF145 gene. From a total of ∼40000 colonies screened, 14 strains (A1, A6, A22, A38, B9, B16, C2, C40, C60, C72, D7, D16, E4, and E10) had the synthetic lethal phenotype with the taf145ΔTAND gene (i.e. nsl phenotype). C40 and D7 strains were further characterized in this study. C40 and D7 mutants were crossed to TMY17-2c bearing the taf145ΔTAND allele, and in both cases red to white sectoring was observed, indicating that these mutations were recessive. Diploids were sporulated, and 18 tetrads were dissected and analyzed phenotypically. When four spores were recovered, the sectoring phenotype and the 5-FOA lethality segregated 2:2, indicating that the synthetic lethality was presumably caused by mutation at a single locus. Crosses between mutant segregants from C40 and D7 assigned them to a complementation group. TMY4-2 is unable to grow at 35 °C due to the presence of the taf145ΔTAND allele but forms normal sized colonies at 25 °C. C40 and D7 strains also show the TS phenotype even though they contain the pTM17 plasmid expressing the wild type TAF145 gene. Multiple backcrosses with TMY17-2c allowed determination of whether the TS phenotype was linked to synthetic lethality. As both mutations are linked to the TS phenotype, mutant segregants derived from C40 and D7 were transformed with a low copy number plasmid library (ATCC77162) yielding ∼100,000 transformants on SD-Leu plates when grown at 25 °C for 12–18 h and then shifted to 35 °C and incubated for 7 days. Plasmids containing complementing genomic DNA fragments were recovered from the positive colonies and were amplified in Escherichia coli DH5α. These plasmids were retransformed into C40 and D7 strains to confirm the complementation of the red/white sectoring, 5-FOA lethality, and the TS phenotype. Insert DNA boundaries were sequenced and compared with the yeast genome data base. Overlapping regions from chromosome V were obtained in all cases, and subcloning indicated that the presence of the SPT15 ORF was sufficient to complement all mutant phenotypes shown by C40 and D7. The mutations in the SPT15 gene of C40 and D7 strains responsible for synthetic lethality were identified by sequencing. The 1.2-kb DNA fragment, including the entire SPT15 gene, was amplified by PCR using the primer pairs TK127 and TK128 from the isolated genomic DNA of these mutants. Direct sequencing of amplified DNA fragments using TK222, TK223, TK224, and TK225 as sequence primers revealed single C → T point mutations at 353 bp in C40 and at"

Such a response involves induction of antiviral gene expression by the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and the NF-κB transcription factor. In addition, dsRNA can also induce apoptosis by an incompletely understood mechanism that may serve to further limit viral replication. Here we demonstrate a novel role for the RelA subunit of NF-κB in inhibiting dsRNA-induced cell death. dsRNA treatment resulted in caspase 3 activation and apoptotic morphological transformations in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from RelA−/− mice but not from RelA+/+ mice. Such dsRNA-induced killing could be inhibited by expression of either a dominant-negative mutant of PKR or wild-type RelA. Interestingly, caspase 3 activated following dsRNA treatment of RelA−/− MEFs was essential for apoptotic nuclear changes but dispensable for cytotoxicity. A broader specificity caspase inhibitor was also unable to inhibit dsRNA-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting that caspase activation is not essential for the induction of cell death by dsRNA in MEFs. However, combined inhibition of caspase 3 and reactive oxygen species production resulted in complete inhibition of dsRNA-induced cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate an essential role for NF-κB in protecting cells from dsRNA-induced apoptosis and suggest that NF-κB may inhibit both caspase-dependent and reactive oxygen species-dependent cytotoxic pathways.

Such dsRNA-activated responses can be mediated by dsRNA-dependent enzymes such as the interferon-inducible protein kinase (PKR) which phosphorylates key cellular substrates (e.g. eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor-2α) (2Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). PKR can also activate the NF-κB transcription factor (see below) resulting in induction of type I interferon gene expression that can prevent further virus infection (3Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J.

In addition, dsRNA can also induce apoptosis in a PKR-dependent manner (4Kibler K.V. Shors T. Perkins K.B. Zeman C.C. Banaszak M.P. Biesterfeldt J. Langland J.O. Jacobs B.L. J.

Thus PKR is required for both dsRNA-mediated induction of gene expression and induction of apoptotic cell death. PKR-mediated apoptosis of virus-infected cells by dsRNA may thus limit virus infection by preventing virus replication within host cells. Apoptosis is a genetically controlled process that plays an essential role in regulating homeostasis and in protecting the host against microbial infections (7Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev.

Such necrosis can occur in cell lines that are normally resistant to TNFα killing, is accompanied by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROSs), and can be prevented by antioxidants (14Vercammen D.

Importantly, similar to TNFα, dsRNA also induces necrosis in the presence of caspase inhibitors in dsRNA-resistant wild-type fibroblasts (16Li M. Beg A.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7470-7477Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Both TNFα and dsRNA-induced necrosis may represent host strategies for eliminating cells infected with viruses encoding caspase inhibitors (16Li M. Beg A.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7470-7477Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The NF-κB family of transcription factors is a key regulator of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses (17Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4605) Google Scholar, 18Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5572) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also demonstrated a critical role for NF-κB in regulating apoptotic cell death. Mice deficient in the RelA (p65) subunit of NF-κB die prenatally because of massive hepatocyte apoptosis (19Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar), which appears related to the cytotoxic effect of TNFα (20Doi T.S. Marino M.W. Takahashi T. Yoshida T. Sakakura T. Old L.J. Obata Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts or macrophages derived from RelA−/− mice or cells overexpressing a super-repressor form of the inhibitory IκB protein are also highly susceptible to TNFα-killing (21Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 22Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated an essential role for NF-κB in protecting cells from TNFα-induced killing. In addition, NF-κB can also mediate pro-apoptotic effects. A recent report has shown that NF-κB is critically important for mediating p53-induced apoptosis (25Ryan K.M. Ernst M.K. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Our recent studies have demonstrated an essential role for RelA in induction of the death receptor Fas expression and in subsequent apoptosis after Fas ligation (26Ouaaz F. Li M. Beg A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 999-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that NF-κB-mediated anti-apoptosis and pro-apoptosis may be context-dependent. The NF-κB proteins also play a key role in mediating cellular responses to conserved microbial structures such as dsRNA and LPS (17Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4605) Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells with dsRNA or LPS results in rapid nuclear translocation of NF-κB proteins and induction of NF-κB target gene expression. Although both dsRNA-mediated NF-κB activation and apoptosis require PKR activity, less is known about mechanisms important for regulating dsRNA-induced apoptosis. Recent studies have suggested, however, that PKR-dependent induction of Fas expression may be involved in dsRNA-induced apoptosis (6Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 27Donze O. Dostie J. Sonenberg N. Virology. 1999; 256: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Gil J. Alcami J. Esteban M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4653-4663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since NF-κB regulates Fas expression, these studies suggest that NF-κB may play a pro-apoptotic role in dsRNA-induced cell death. To determine a possible role for NF-κB in dsRNA-induced apoptosis, we have utilized embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages from mice deficient in the RelA subunit of NF-κB. We show here that dsRNA-induced Fas expression was dramatically reduced in RelA−/− MEFs. Surprisingly, dsRNA specifically induced apoptosis in NF-κB RelA−/− but not in RelA+/+ MEFs. In addition, inhibition of macromolecule synthesis also rendered RelA+/+ MEFs susceptible to dsRNA-induced killing. These results suggest that dsRNA-induced apoptosis may be prevented by NF-κB mediated induction of anti-apoptotic gene expression, rather than induced by expression of pro-apoptotic genes, such as fas. These results demonstrate the existence of a novel anti-apoptotic role for NF-κB in the dsRNA-induced cell death pathway. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts, fetal liver macrophages, and 3T3 fibroblasts were derived as described previously (21Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing l-glutamate (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and calf serum (10%). Human TNFα was obtained from R & D Systems and used at concentration of 10 ng/ml in all experiments. dsRNA poly(I-C) was purchased from Sigma and used at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Caspase inhibitors, Z-DEVD-fmk, Z-VAD-fmk, and biot-VAD-fmk, (Enzyme System Products) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 20 mm and used at 100 and 1 μm, respectively. Actinomycin D and antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) were obtained from Sigma and used at 2 μg/ml and 100 μm, respectively. The nuclear dye 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and the reactive oxygen species dye dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) were obtained from Molecular Probes. pLPC expression vector was a gift from Dr. S. Lowe (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York). pRelA was constructed by cloning the mouse RelA cDNA into pLPC. pPKRDN, which has a six-amino acid deletion as described previously (29Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. A. Garcı́a-Sastre (Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York). Cells in tissue culture plates were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. They were then washed and incubated with a DAPI labeling solution (2 μg/ml in PBS) for 5 min and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Approximately 2 × 105 cells were plated on each well of a 6-well plate 1 day before the experiments. The caspase inhibitors, Z-DEVD-fmk or Z-VAD-fmk, or macromolecule synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D, was added 1 h before the addition of dsRNA. After the indicated periods, the cells were trypsinized (fibroblasts) or scraped (macrophages), and viable cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion. Four independent readings within a single experiment were used to calculate the S.D. RelA−/− MEFs were cotransfected with a GFP expression vector (0.5 μg) and pLPC, pRelA, or pPKRDN (0.5 μg) using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 24 h later, cells were either left untreated or treated with dsRNA for 12 h. Viable GFP-positive cells from four randomly chosen fields were counted and used to calculate S.D. DHR was added to a final concentration of 2 μmbefore RelA−/− MEFs were treated with the indicated agents. 12 h later, cells were trypsinized, washed and resuspended in PBS before FACS analysis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was carried out as described previously (19Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). RelA-specific antisera were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Northern blotting was carried out as described (26Ouaaz F. Li M. Beg A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 999-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) with probes generated from cDNA fragments by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using gene-specific primers. Affinity blotting was performed essentially as described previously (30Faleiro L. Kobayashi R. Fearnhead H. Lazebnik Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼5 × 106 cells were harvested after the treatments indicated. The cells were then washed once with PBS and pelleted, and the pellet was snap-frozen on dry ice. An equal volume of 1 μm biot-VAD-fmk in MDB buffer (50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7)) was added to the cell pellet, and the cells were lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. The lysates were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and centrifuged. 20 μg of protein lysates from the supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with TBST (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) supplemented with 2% nonfat dry milk for 30 min and then incubated in avidin-Neutralite (Molecular Probes) at 1 μg/ml in TBST supplemented with 1% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. The membrane was then washed and incubated in biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (Molecular Probes) at 25 ng/ml in TBST for 1 h. The labeled protein was visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Western blotting, membranes were blocked with TBST supplemented with 0.5% casein. Caspase 3-p17 antibody (New England Biolabs), which specifically recognizes the large subunit of activated caspase 3, was used at a 1 to 10,000 dilution in subsequent steps. Fifty 10-cm plates of RelA−/− 3T3 fibroblasts grown to 1–2 × 107/plate were either left untreated or treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 6 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, lysed in the presence of 1 μmbiot-VAD-fmk to label caspases, and the lysates clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein concentrations of the pooled supernatant were 4.7 mg/ml for untreated and 2.9 mg/ml for TNFα-treated samples. To remove unbound biot-VAD-fmk, the lysates were dialyzed with four changes of MDB buffer (see above) supplemented with a proteinase/inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Dialyzed extracts were run through an Immunopure Immobilized Streptavidin Column (Pierce). The column was washed with 150 ml of washing buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.4 m urea, 50 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7)), and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the washing buffer with 2% SDS. The eluted proteins were precipitated with 0.25 volume of trichloroacetic acid solution (100% trichloroacetic acid, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate) and washed twice with acetone. The precipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of the SDS-loading buffer. 5 μl of either the untreated or TNFα-treated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was silver-stained to test for the purity and amount of p18 (approximate 10 ng). The rest of the samples were also subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Problott, Applied Biosystem). p18 was excised and wet with 1 μl of methanol. The band was reduced and alkylated with isopropyl acetamide followed by digestion in 20 μl of 0.05 m ammonium bicarbonate containing 0.5% Zwittergent 3-16 (Calbiochem) with 0.2 μg of trypsin (Frozen Promega Modified) at 37 °C for 17 h. Peptides generated from in situtryptic digests were separated on a C18 0.18 × 150-mm capillary column (LC Packing, Inc.). The high pressure liquid chromatography consisted of a prototype capillary gradient high pressure liquid chromatography system (Waters Associates) and a model 783 UV detector equipped with a Z-shaped flow cell (LC Packing, Inc.). A 30-cm length of 0.025-mm ID glass capillary was connected to the outlet of the Z-shaped cell inside the detector housing to minimize the delay volume. Solvent A was 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of 0–80% solvent B in 60 min and detected at 195 nm. Fractions were collected automatically by a BAI Protocol onto pre-made spots of matrix (0.5 μl of 20 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinammic acid + 5 mg/ml nitrocellulose in 50% acetone, 50% 2-propanol) on the target plate. Ions were formed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with a nitrogen laser, 337 nm. Spectra were acquired with a Perspective Biosystems Voyager Elite time-of-flight mass spectrometer, operated in reflector delayed extraction mode. Peptides detected by MALDI-TOF MS were subjected to collision-induced dissociation in an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ, Finnigan MAT). A 1-μl aliquot (5%) of the P150 tryptic digest was loaded onto a 100-μm inner diameter, 360-μm outer diameter, 30-cm length of fused silica capillary packed with 15 cm of POROS 10R2 reverse phase beads (Perspective Biosystems). Peptides were eluted with an acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 500 nl/min for 15 min. A data-dependent experiment was performed to obtain structural information for selected peptides. Ions with m/zvalues corresponding to peptides observed by MALDI-TOF MS were monitored in full mass range scans and automatically subjected to collision-induced dissociation as each eluted from the capillary column. Peptide masses and selected b and y series fragments were used to search an in-house protein and DNA sequence data base with an enhanced version of the FRAGFIT (31Henzel W.J. Billeci T.M. Stults J.T. Wong S.C. Grimley C. Watanabe C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5011-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) and the SEQUEST program. The mouse caspase 3 was identified by a data base search of data obtained from a liquid chromatography/MS/MS analysis of a tryptic digest of the 18-kDa band. MS/MS analysis of MH+ 1118.9 was found to correspond to residues 65–75 (SGTDVDAANLR) of mouse caspase 3. MALDI MS analysis identified an additional eight masses that matched with the caspase 3 protein. Our recent studies have revealed a critical role for the RelA subunit of NF-κB in the regulation of TNFα and LPS-induced Fas expression (26Ouaaz F. Li M. Beg A.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 999-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Previous studies have also suggested that dsRNA-induced apoptosis could be mediated by induction of Fas expression (6Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 27Donze O. Dostie J. Sonenberg N. Virology. 1999; 256: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the possible involvement of NF-κB in dsRNA-dependent induction of Fas expression and apoptosis. To this end, we first determined whether RelA was a component of NF-κB complexes activated by dsRNA. RelA+/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (19Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar) were treated with dsRNA for 2 h, after which nuclear extracts were tested for κB-site binding activity by EMSA. As expected, dsRNA strongly activated NF-κB (Fig.1 A). Activated NF-κB was supershifted by antisera generated against RelA (Fig. 1 A), demonstrating the presence of RelA in dsRNA-activated NF-κB complexes. Furthermore, as previously observed following TNFα treatment (19Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar), dsRNA-treated RelA−/− MEFs showed a significantly lower level of NF-κB activation (Fig. 1 A, compare lane 2 and lane 5). To determine whether RelA was important for dsRNA-induced Fas expression, we treated RelA+/− or RelA−/− MEFs with dsRNA for 6 h, after which Fas mRNA expression was determined. Similar to TNFα and LPS, dsRNA-induced Fas expression was dramatically reduced in RelA−/− cells (Fig.1 B). In addition, dsRNA-mediated induction of the neutrophil-specific chemokine, MIP-2, was also found to be dependent on RelA (Fig. 1 B). These results thus demonstrate an important role for the RelA subunit of NF-κB in mediating dsRNA-induced gene expression. We wanted to determine whether Fas expression was responsible for controlling susceptibility of MEFs to dsRNA-induced cell death. Surprisingly, a 12-h dsRNA treatment significantly reduced viability of RelA−/− but not RelA+/+ MEFs (Fig.2 A). These results demonstrate the existence of a previously unrecognized function of RelA in inhibiting dsRNA-induced cytotoxicity. Recent studies have demonstrated a critical role for RelA in protecting cells from TNFα-induced killing (21Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar), through induction of survival gene expression (32Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Verma I.M. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 33Rath P.C. Aggarwal B.B. J. Clin.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for survival gene expression in preventing TNFα-induced killing, inhibition of RNA or protein synthesis sensitizes normally resistant cells to TNFα-induced killing (37Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). Similar to TNFα, treatment of RelA+/+ MEFs with an RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D (thus resulting in inhibition of RelA-mediated transcription) also rendered them susceptible to dsRNA-induced killing (Fig. 2 A). TNFα is cytotoxic to both RelA−/− fibroblasts and macrophages (21Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). To determine whether dsRNA could also induce cytotoxicity to RelA−/− macrophages, we generated fetal liver macrophages from embryonic day 14 (E14) RelA+/+ and RelA−/− mice. As seen with MEFs, RelA−/− macrophages readily lost viability in the presence of dsRNA, whereas RelA+/+ cells were not affected (Fig.2 B). Taken together, these results demonstrate a new role for RelA in preventing dsRNA-induced cytotoxicity, which similar to TNFα may also be mediated by regulation of survival gene expression. They also suggest that induction of pro-apoptotic genes, such as Fas, may not play an important role in mediating dsRNA-induced killing. These results have revealed strikingly similar mechanisms for inhibiting cell death induced by TNFα and dsRNA. However, it is also possible that dsRNA-induced killing of RelA−/− cells is somehow mediated by the TNFα signaling pathway. This could be accomplished by dsRNA-induced release of pre-synthesized TNFα or by dsRNA-dependent mechanisms, for example, which could lead to activation of TNF receptors. Two TNFα receptors have been identified and named TNFR1 and TNFR2 (38Goodwin R.G. Anderson D. Jerzy R. Davis T. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Smith C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3020-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 39Lewis M. Tartaglia L.A. Lee A. Bennett G.L. Rice G.C. Wong G.H. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Unlike TNFR2, TNFR1 contains a death domain that can induce cytotoxicity in many cell types (40Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar). To determine a possible involvement of TNFR1-mediated signaling in dsRNA-induced cytotoxicity, we tested the sensitivity of both TNFR1+/+RelA−/− and TNFR1−/−RelA−/− MEFs to dsRNA or TNFα-induced cell death (41Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kundig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K. Shahinian A. Wiegmann K. Ohashi P.S. Kronke M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 457-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). As expected, TNFα induced significant cytotoxicity in TNFR1+/+RelA−/− but not in TNFR1−/−RelA−/− MEFs 2E. Alcamo, J. P. Mizgerd, B. H. Horwitz, R. Bronson, A. A. Beg, M. Scott, C. M. Doerschur, R. Hynes, and D. Baltimore, submitted for publication. (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, dsRNA treatment efficiently killed both cell types. These results thus suggest that dsRNA induces a cell death pathway that does not depend on TNFR1-induced signaling. To determine whether dsRNA-induced killing of RelA−/− cells was in fact due to the absence of RelA, we tested whether ectopic expression of RelA was sufficient to protect RelA−/− MEFs from dsRNA-induced cytotoxicity. A GFP-expressing vector (to identify transfected cells) was cotransfected with either a control pLPC vector or a vector expressing RelA (pRelA). 24 h later, cells were left untreated or treated with dsRNA for another 12 h after which the viability of GFP-positive cells was determined. As expected, RelA−/− MEFs transfected with the control pLPC vector readily lost viability after dsRNA treatment (Fig.3). In contrast, cotransfection of pRelA significantly protected RelA−/− MEFs from dsRNA-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 3). These results suggest that RelA plays a direct role in inhibiting dsRNA-induced cell death. PKR activity is thought to be important for induction of cell death by dsRNA (6Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). We were also interested in determining whether PKR was important for dsRNA-induced killing of RelA−/− MEFs. To this end, we cotransfected RelA−/− MEFs with a construct encoding a PKR dominant-negative mutant, pPKR-DN."

An abnormal increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in dystrophic muscle could activate Ca2+-dependent proteases and disturb the metabolic regulation of cells leading to muscle degeneration (2Alderton J.M.

Dystrophinopathies. McGraw-Hill, New York1994: 1133-1187Google Scholar). There is some controversy about this Ca2+ elevation (1Ruegg U.T. Gillis J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 351-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4Gillis J.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 605-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Some groups (5Hopf F.W. Turner P.R. Denetclaw Jr., W.F. Reddy P. Steinhardt R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1325-C1339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Imbert N. Cognard C. Duport G. Guillou C. Raymond G. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that basal cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c)1was higher in dystrophic skeletal muscle cells relative to controls, whereas other laboratories (7Leijendekker W.J. Passaquin A.C. Metzinger L. Ruegg U.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8Gailly P. Boland B. Himpens B. Casteels R. Gillis J.M. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) found that [Ca2+]c was only increased under stress. To elucidate this contention, the redistribution of Ca2+ into intracellular organelles should be examined. In this context, the mitochondrion is a good candidate, since it is 1) able to buffer part of [Ca2+]c (9Babcock D.F. Herrington J. Goodwin P.C. Park Y.B. Hille B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 10Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar); 2) able to answer to the energy demand of cells by tuning the creatine/phosphocreatine ratio (11Wallimann T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D.

A. 1999; 96: 13807-13812Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) and the activation of key enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation (14McCormack J.G. Denton R.M. News Physiol. Sci. 1994; 9: 71-76Google Scholar). The control of [Ca2+]m homeostasis is not only important for the regulation of metabolism but also for the propagation of the Ca2+ signal throughout cells and for Ca2+-regulated cell functions (15Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Brini M. Chiesa A. Filippin L. Pozzan T. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 16Jouaville L.S. Ichas F. Mazat J.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 371-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is illustrated by the correlation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake with insulin secretion on the one hand (17Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and catecholamine secretion on the other hand (18Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In recent years, chimeras of the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin with unique cellular targets contributed to the understanding of the cross-talk between intracellular compartments (19Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). In particular, contacts between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria were demonstrated in the HeLa cell line (20Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it appears that release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum located near mitochondria leads to the formation of microdomains of high [Ca2+], thus permitting mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake via a low affinity uniporter (10Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 21Brini M. Carafoli E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 354-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To investigate compartmental Ca2+ distribution in skeletal muscle, we used aequorin targeted to mitochondria (mtAeq). The C2C12 murine skeletal muscle cell line was studied as a model to analyze cellular responses to various Ca2+ raising agents (Fig.1). These include depolarizing agents such as KCl at high concentration, which causes direct depolarization of the plasma membrane activating the voltage-operated Ca2+channel and releasing Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the ryanodine receptor (RyR) (22Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar); carbachol (CCh), which induces indirect depolarization by the activation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and a subsequent Na+ entry; extracellular ATP, which activates P2U-purinergic receptors leading to the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and Ca2+ release from the SR through the IP3 receptor (23Henning R.H. Duin M. van Popta J.P. Nelemans A. Den Hertog A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), which blocks the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA); and caffeine (Caf) as a RyR activator (22Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]cincreases are transmitted to mitochondria via an electrogenically driven uniporter leading to transient increases in [Ca2+]m. The present study shows that KCl-induced depolarization and caffeine caused a transient peak in [Ca2+]m followed by an oscillatory second phase in C2C12 myotubes. These [Ca2+]m oscillations were not observed with ATP, CPA, or the other depolarizing agent CCh. These results suggest privileged appositions of SR and mitochondria as described for other cell types (20Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T.

Carbachol and carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Atropine, α-bungarotoxin, cyclopiazonic acid, and caffeine were from Sigma. Digitonin was from Merck. G418 was from Calbiochem. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA-probe (F-7) IgG2 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG from Pierce. CGP 37157 was from Tocris (Bristol, UK). C2C12 murine skeletal muscle cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with essential amino acids, vitamins, 10 μg/ml ciproxine, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies, Switzerland), and 500 μg/ml G418 for continuous selection of C2C12 myoblasts expressing the transgenes. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and were passaged twice a week. For experiments, cells were seeded in 4- or 6-well plates at 104 cells per cm2 in DMEM, 10% FCS. After 3–4 days in culture, confluence was reached, and differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into post-mitotic myotubes was induced by reducing the FCS concentration in the culture medium from 10 to 2%. C2C12 cells were stably transfected with a pcDNAI expression vector containing a cDNA encoding aequorin targeted to the mitochondria (26Rizzuto R. Simpson A.W. Brini M. Pozzan T. Nature. 1992; 358: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). After 1 day in culture, two 80-cm2 flasks of C2C12 myoblasts (∼125′000 cells/flask) were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as follows. Culture medium was replaced by fresh DMEM, 10% FCS 1 h before transfection. mtAeq/pcDNAI (20 μg) and plasmid RSVNeo(6 μg) were added to 750 μl of 250 mmCaCl2. This solution was slowly added to 750 μl of phosphate containing solution (in mm: NaCl 280, NaH2PO4 750, Na2HPO4750, Hepes 50, pH 7) and incubated for 40 min at room temperature. The calcium phosphate/DNA precipitate (750 μl) was added to each flask, and cells were incubated overnight. Medium was removed, and cells were exposed to 15% glycerol in DMEM, 10% FCS for 2 min. They were incubated overnight in DMEM, 10% FCS and were split at a 1:6 ratio as described (27Namiki M. Akiyama S. Katagiri T. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Yamaji N. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22046-22052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Selection for transfected cells was done with 1.5 mg/ml G418 for 18 days. Colonies were isolated with glass rings, and two stable cell lines, C2C12 mtAeq 8 and C2C12 mtAeq 11, were established. The mitochondrial localization of the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin was verified by specific immunostaining (17Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Photon quantification after digitonin (100 μm) permeabilization showed that both clones exhibited sufficient mtAeq expression for quantitative [Ca2+]m analysis. The capacity of myoblasts to differentiate into myotubes was compared and prompted the choice of clone 8 which was used up to passage 16. C2C12 myoblasts were seeded on gelatin-coated Thermanox™ coverslips of 13-mm diameter (Nunc, Life Technologies, Inc.). After 8–11 days in culture, [Ca2+]m was measured in a population of myotubes (about 60,000 cells/coverslip) as follows. The mtAeq was reconstituted with coelenterazine (5 μm) in DMEM for 2–4 h before the experiment. The coverslip in a 0.5-ml chamber thermostated at 37 °C was placed 5 mm from the photon detector. Cells were superfused at a rate of 1 ml/min with physiological salt solution (PSS, in mm: NaCl 145, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, Hepes 5, glucose 10, and CaCl2 1.2, pH 7.4). Stimuli were usually applied for 5 min (unless otherwise stated) in PSS except for high KCl solution which contained (in mm) NaCl 95, KCl 55, MgCl2 1, Hepes 5, glucose 10, and CaCl2 0.12, pH 7.4. Emitted luminescence was detected by a photomultiplier apparatus (EMI 9789, Thorn-EMI, UK) and recorded every second using a computer photon-counting board (EMI C660) as described previously (17Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As published (28Allen D.G. Blinks J.R.

Total light output was obtained by exposing cells to 10 mm CaCl2, after permeabilization with 100 μm digitonin, to consume all aequorin. C2C12 cells were seeded on gelatin-coated glass coverslips of 22 mm diameter. After 45 min loading in 5 μm Fura-2/AM in the dark at room temperature, cells were washed twice with PSS. The coverslip was placed in a thermostated chamber at 37 °C on the stage of a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Diaphot, Küsnacht, Switzerland). After 3 min of stabilization in PSS, myotubes were excited at alternative wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, and emission was recorded at 510 nm. The PhoCal software (Life Science Resources Ltd., Cambridge, UK) was used to analyze the collected data. The ratio R between the emitted light at 340 and 380 nm permitted calculation of [Ca2+]c according to the equation formulated by Grynkiewicz et al. (32Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]cdeterminations were done independently of the [Ca2+]m measurements on separate coverslips. Where applicable, values are expressed as means ± S.E., and significance of difference was calculated by one-way analysis of variance and two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data. Traces are representative of at least 3 experiments performed at least in duplicate. Exposure of C2C12 myotubes to a depolarizing solution of KCl (55 mm) for 5 min led to an increase in [Ca2+]m, from a base line of 0.20 ± 0.01 to 3.03 ± 0.14 μm(n = 38, Fig.2 A). A delay of 14.8 ± 1.0 s was observed between the addition of the stimulus and the onset of the [Ca2+]m elevation, and the time from the onset to the maximum was 23.4 ± 1.3 s. The peak was immediately followed by [Ca2+]m oscillations, with a frequency of 5.1 ± 0.1 per min. The duration of KCl exposure affected these [Ca2+]m oscillations. A brief (20 s) KCl pulse elicited a [Ca2+]m peak without oscillations (2.22 ± 0.02 μm, n = 4; Fig. 2 A, inset), whereas oscillations were observed with longer (≥1 min) KCl pulses. KCl induced an elevation in [Ca2+]m 6 to 7 times higher than the one of [Ca2+]c (Fig. 2 A). No oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ were detected under KCl stimulation even if the Fura-2/AM concentration was reduced from 5 to 2 μm to attenuate its Ca2+ buffering capacity (data not shown). In further experiments, the mitochondrial membrane potential was blunted with the uncoupler FCCP (1 μm) which dissipates the proton gradient. After this pretreatment, the KCl-induced [Ca2+]m increase was completely blocked (Fig.2 B). This result confirms the correct localization of aequorin in mitochondria. As KCl induced a transient [Ca2+]m increase, the extrusion pathways from mitochondria were studied. The inhibitor of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger CGP 37157 (10 μm) did not affect the KCl-induced [Ca2+]m response (Fig. 2 C). Preincubation of the myotubes with cyclosporin A (1 μm), a blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (33Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), also failed to modify KCl-induced [Ca2+]m transient or oscillations (data not shown). Extracellular Ca2+depletion by 3 mm EGTA reduced the 55 mmKCl-induced [Ca2+]m transient by 56 ± 17% to 1.32 ± 0.34 μm at peak (n = 5), maintaining the oscillations (Fig.3 A). When nifedipine (1 μm), a blocker of the voltage-operated L-type Ca2+ channel, was added 20 min before and during KCl stimulation, a similar [Ca2+]m attenuation as Ca2+ depletion with EGTA was observed (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, when SR Ca2+ refilling was blocked by CPA (100 μm) 5 min before and during KCl stimulation, the amplitude of the KCl-induced [Ca2+]m peak was reduced and the oscillations were totally prevented (Fig.3 C). The occurrence of [Ca2+]m oscillations following stimuli other than KCl was analyzed in C2C12 myotubes. The cholinergic agonist CCh, known to induce similar levels of depolarization as KCl (23Henning R.H. Duin M. van Popta J.P. Nelemans A. Den Hertog A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), elicited a [Ca2+]m transient similar to KCl (3.24 ± 0.23 μm, n = 21, Fig.4 D). However, as compared with KCl, no oscillations followed (Fig. 4 A). The nicotinic blocker α-bungarotoxin (100 nm) almost completely attenuated the CCh-induced response, whereas the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 μm) had no effect (Fig.5, A and B), highlighting that C2C12 myotubes are exclusively sensitive to nicotinic stimulation and confirming the observations by other groups (23Henning R.H. Duin M. van Popta J.P. Nelemans A. Den Hertog A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Brini M. De Giorgi F. Murgia M. Marsault R. Massimino M.L. Cantini M. Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Activation of nicotinic receptors causes cell depolarization by Na+ entry and, to a much lesser extent, Ca2+entry via the associated channel. A dependence on extracellular Ca2+ was shown by the fact that EGTA reduced the CCh-induced [Ca2+]m peak (Fig.5 C).Figure 5Characterization of the carbachol-induced [Ca2+]m peak. The cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh, 100 μm) induced a [Ca2+]m peak in C2C12 myotubes stably expressing mtAeq (gray lines in A–C). This response was attenuated by a 5-min pretreatment with the nicotinic antagonist α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgt, 100 nm;black line, A) or with EGTA (3 mm; black line, C) but not with the muscarinic antagonist atropine (Atrop, 10 μm; black line, B). Mean values of the [Ca2+]m peak evoked by CCh with or without one of the above agents are represented in theinsets. Values significantly different from the CCh response are indicated with * (0.05 < p < 0.01) or *** (p < 0.001; Student's t test;n ≥ 3, performed at least in duplicate).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The purinergic agonist ATP (1 mm) induced a biphasic [Ca2+]m response initiated by a peak of 1.37 ± 0.12 μm (n = 14, Fig. 4, B and D), followed by an oscillatory phase. However, these oscillations were not as regular and frequent as the KCl-induced oscillations. Moreover, ATP concentrations of less than 1 mm were unable to elicit an oscillatory phase (data not shown). In Ca2+-free medium (3 mm EGTA), 1 mm ATP elicited two different [Ca2+]mpatterns; in 8 of 15 preparations, it caused a small [Ca2+]m peak without subsequent oscillations (Fig. 6 A), and in 7 of 15 preparations, it induced a smaller biphasic [Ca2+]m transient (Fig. 6 B). Pretreatment of cells with the SERCA inhibitor CPA slightly delayed the ATP response without affecting the second phase (Fig. 6 C). Thus, it appears that the [Ca2+]m oscillations caused by ATP are not of the same origin as those induced by KCl. CPA alone (100 μm) raised [Ca2+]mto 1.51 ± 0.31 μm (n = 9) before a slow return to basal level occurred (Fig. 4, C andD). As with CCh, this second phase did not exhibit [Ca2+]m oscillations. The RyR activator caffeine elicited a [Ca2+]mpeak followed by oscillations with a pattern similar to the one observed with KCl stimulation (Fig. 4, E and F). At 5 mm Caf, [Ca2+]m was increased to 1.35 ± 0.05 μm (n = 3), and [Ca2+]m oscillations appeared during the decay phase. This was also observed at 3.5 and 7 mm, whereas 20 mm Caf caused a [Ca2+]m peak (4.51 ± 0.19 μm, n = 3) without associated oscillations. C2C12 myotubes were stimulated twice with the same [Ca2+]m raising agent, and both pulses were separated by a 5-min wash. KCl (55 mm) caused a [Ca2+]m desensitization, i.e. the second peak was significantly smaller than the first peak induced by KCl (Fig. 7, A andF). On the other hand, 45Ca2+ influx into cells caused by the second KCl pulse was essentially the same as the one caused by the first pulse, i.e. 206 ± 19 and 206 ± 22% of basal influx, respectively (n = 5, performed at least in triplicate). 2The 45Ca2+ influx assay was as previously described (42Pulido S.M. Passaquin A.C. Leijendekker W.J. Challet C. Wallimann T. Ruegg U.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). C. Challet, P. Maechler, C. B. Wollheim, and U. T. Rüegg, unpublished data. This suggests that the voltage-operated Ca2+ channel is not desensitized by repeated KCl stimulations. ATP (1 mm) or CPA (100 μm) also induced [Ca2+]mdesensitization (Fig. 7, B, C, and F). In contrast to KCl desensitization, a second pulse of CCh (100 μm) elicited a higher [Ca2+]m peak than the first one, indicating a potentiation (Fig. 7, D andF). However, if the wash time was reduced from 5 to 2 min, a double stimulation with CCh tended to a [Ca2+]mdesensitization (Fig. 7 E). C2C12 myotubes were challenged with KCl and another [Ca2+]m raising agent, and both pulses were separated by a 5-min wash. When KCl stimulation was followed by CCh, [Ca2+]mdesensitization occurred. The CCh-induced [Ca2+]mpeak was reduced by ∼50% compared with a single CCh response (Fig.8 A). In contrast, a second pulse of KCl after CCh stimulation increased [Ca2+]m up to 3 μm as observed with a single KCl stimulation. However, the subsequent oscillatory [Ca2+]m phase was potentiated by the previous CCh pulse (Fig. 8 B). The frequency of the oscillations remained unchanged, but the area under the curve of the KCl-induced [Ca2+]m transient was ∼3 times higher than the area under the curve of a standard KCl response (364 ± 18versus 125 ± 6 μm·s, n≥ 4, p < 0.0001), whereas the time from the onset of the KCl-induced [Ca2+]m increase to the return to basal [Ca2+]m level was similar (386 ± 15versus 357 ± 10 s, n ≥ 4,p = 3.5). There was no cross-reactivity between KCl and the purinergic agonist ATP (1 mm, Fig. 8, C andD), whereas a first pulse with CPA (100 μm) attenuated the KCl-induced [Ca2+]m transient (Fig. 8, E and F). The present study reports for the first time that C2C12 myotubes stably expressing aequorin targeted to mitochondria display [Ca2+]m oscillations. This oscillatory behavior was elicited by KCl depolarization, whereas nicotinic stimulation did not cause oscillations. The oscillations were prevented by SERCA inhibition but not by blockade of Ca2+ entry. They were also produced by caffeine. Thus, RyR are strong candidates as triggers for [Ca2+]m oscillations. The other important results concern the desensitization of the [Ca2+]m response by KCl and the potentiation of [Ca2+]m by CCh when these stimuli were applied twice. The fact that the [Ca2+]m oscillations were detected in a cell population indicates that C2C12 myotubes are synchronized to some degree and respond as a single unit. Cell-to-cell communication can be expected to occur because myotubes result from the fusion of several myoblasts. An electrical coupling between cells is unlikely, as KCl clamped all cells to the same depolarized potential until KCl removal. Ca2+ itself or other second messengers such as IP3 could be involved in the oscillatory mechanism as has been shown in other cell types (34Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P. Paranjape S. Adams S.R. Potter B.V. Tsien R.Y. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As no spontaneous contractions occurred in the C2C12 myotubes used in this study, motion did not interfere with the analysis. [Ca2+]moscillations were always observed following KCl-triggered depolarizations lasting longer than 1 min (Fig. 2 A). When Ca2+ influx was prevented either by EGTA or by blockade of the voltage-operated Ca2+ channel with nifedipine, the whole [Ca2+]m response to KCl was diminished, but the oscillations were preserved (Fig. 3). Thus, Ca2+ entry into cells contributes to [Ca2+]m elevation but is not responsible for the oscillations. It thus appears that the “pacemaking” mechanisms for the oscillations are located intracellularly. When the SERCA was inhibited by CPA, KCl depolarization produced a [Ca2+]m peak, but no oscillations were observed (Fig. 3 C). It is therefore likely that the SR communicates with mitochondria to generate [Ca2+]m oscillations. As opposed to KCl-stimulated [Ca2+]m oscillations, those produced by ATP were insensitive to CPA but depended on extracellular Ca2+. The latter is in line with findings on purinergic stimulation in C2C12 myotubes (23Henning R.H. Duin M. van Popta J.P. Nelemans A. Den Hertog A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast to a previous report (35Nakazaki M. Ishihara H. Kakei M. Inukai K. Asano T. Miyazaki J.I. Tanaka H. Kikuchi M. Yada T. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the [Ca2+]m oscillations observed in the present study were not synchronized with cytosolic Ca2+oscillations. In MIN6 cells, Nakazaki et al. (35Nakazaki M. Ishihara H. Kakei M. Inukai K. Asano T. Miyazaki J.I. Tanaka H. Kikuchi M. Yada T. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) proposed that repetitive Ca2+ microdomains are responsible for cytosolic and mitochondrial oscillations. In C2C12 myotubes, spatially restricted pulsatile Ca2+ hotspots could occur in the proximity of the SR. Colocalization of mitochondria and SR could permit Ca2+ exchanges between these organelles and subsequent oscillations. Contacts between mitochondria and SR have been demonstrated morphologically by scanning electron microscopy (36Ogata T. Yamasaki Y. Anat. Rec. 1997; 248: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In fact, highly organized networks of SR interconnected with mitochondria were revealed in adult skeletal muscle fibers (36Ogata T. Yamasaki Y. Anat. Rec. 1997; 248: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, ryanodine receptors (RyR), as sensors of depolarization, could play a central role in generating local domains of high [Ca2+]cthat would be sensed by the neighboring mitochondria, in a manner similar to IP3 receptors in HeLa cells (Fig. 1 (20Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar)). This is supported by the effects of caffeine, known to release Ca2+ from the SR by RyR activation bypassing depolarization. As Caf at low concentrations induced a [Ca2+]m peak followed by oscillations, in a way comparable to KCl response, RyRs seem to be oscillation triggers (Fig.4, E and F). This has been already proposed for dyspedic myotubes (37Ward C.W. Schneider M.F. Castillo D. Protasi F. Wang Y. Chen S.R. Allen P.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 91-103Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or cardiac cells (25Szalai G. Csordas G. Hantash B.M. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15305-15313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). At the single cell level, Caf induced rapid perimembrane and mitochondrial [Ca2+] spikes, with a frequency increasing with the Caf concentration to give a sustained [Ca2+]melevation at 20 mm (25Szalai G. Csordas G. Hantash B.M. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15305-15313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In our study, RyR localization could explain the restriction of the [Ca2+]moscillations to KCl stimulation as opposed to the CCh effect. At low concentrations, Caf would act on RyR localized on KCl-sensitive Ca2+ stores and would initiate a global oscillatory behavior in the neighboring mitochondria, whereas at high concentrations, Caf would open all RyR and thus give rise to a single [Ca2+]m peak. The presence of discrete Ca2+ stores in C2C12 myotubes has previously been suggested by Henning et al. (23Henning R.H. Duin M. van Popta J.P. Nelemans A. Den Hertog A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These authors proposed separate noninteracting stores for KCl and CCh and for KCl and ATP. Because of the potential existence of discrete SR Ca2+stores, alterations in their filling state might influence mitochondrial Ca2+ responses. To address this issue, desensitization and cross-desensitization studies were performed. Repeated applications of KCl led to a down-regulation of the second [Ca2+]m transient, whereas dual nicotinic stimulation up-regulated the intensity of the second transient (Fig. 7) indicating different pathways of cellular activation with respect to mitochondria. The state of cell polarization was not responsible for this desensitization. A 5-min wash between two KCl pulses appeared to be sufficient for cell repolarization, in contrast to a 2-min wash, as shown by the CCh-induced [Ca2+]m desensitization (Fig. 7, see also Ref. 23Henning R.H. Duin M. van Popta J.P. Nelemans A. Den Hertog A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the voltage-operated Ca2+ channel was probably not desensitized because45Ca2+ influx caused by a second KCl pulse was the same as the first one. The KCl-induced [Ca2+]m desensitization may rather be due to an incomplete Ca2+ store refilling or to desensitization of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, as suggested in insulinoma cells (38Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20770-20778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, partial aequorin consumption cannot be ruled out. mtAeq could be consumed in specific regions of mitochondria, and a redistribution of mtAeq by movements of mitochondria would require some time. But another phenomenon participates in [Ca2+]m desensitization, as a partial recovery was observed when the washing time between two pulses of KCl was increased to at least 10 min (data not shown). The same might apply to ATP- and CPA-induced [Ca2+]m desensitization. In contrast to the other stimuli, repeated stimulations with CCh yielded a [Ca2+]m potentiation (Fig. 7). Discrepancy between Ca2+ homeostasis after CCh and KCl depolarization has been observed in rat skeletal muscle cells (39Robert V. De Giorgi F. Massimino M.L. Cantini M. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30372-30378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These authors showed that CCh induced a drop followed by a large overshoot of sarcoplasmic reticulum [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]SR), while KCl only elicited a [Ca2+]SR drop followed by a return to almost basal level. This over-accumulation of Ca2+ in the SR during cholinergic stimulation could be related to Ca2+uptake by SR portions strategically located near the nicotinic channels (24Brini M. De Giorgi F. Murgia M. Marsault R. Massimino M.L. Cantini M. Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A similar situation could occur in C2C12 cells and could be the reason for the CCh-induced [Ca2+]m potentiation observed in our work. The CCh-sensitive stores could contain more Ca2+ after the first pulse, thus producing a higher second [Ca2+]m peak. Alternatively, ATP may be locally depleted by SERCA-mediated Ca2+ uptake into the SR after a first CCh pulse leading to decreased SERCA activity during the second CCh pulse. As SR Ca2+ uptake should then be reduced, Ca2+ may accumulate in mitochondria resulting in a higher [Ca2+]m. This mechanism could also be the reason for the cross-potentiation between CCh and KCl, where the oscillatory second phase induced by KCl was increased after a previous stimulation with CCh (Fig. 8 B). In a manner similar to double KCl stimulation, the CCh-induced response was desensitized after a previous KCl pulse, again suggesting incomplete SR refilling. In summary, it seems that discrete Ca2+ stores exist but some interactions between KCl- and CCh-sensitive stores occur. In addition, those mobilized by ATP appear to be separate, as no cross-reactivity between KCl and ATP was observed. In conclusion, the present data point to a complex spatiotemporal Ca2+ pattern implicating cellular organelles. On the one hand, portions of the SR sensitive to KCl would contact mitochondria, establishing a cross-talk between these two organelles, therefore permitting repetitive Ca2+ exchanges and subsequent [Ca2+]m oscillations. On the other hand, distinct Ca2+ stores probably exist in C2C12 myotubes, explaining the discrepancy between the effects of KCl and CCh on mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling. The aequorin technology is helpful to estimate Ca2+ redistribution into intracellular compartments, and it has already proven its usefulness in detecting defective Ca2+ signaling. For example, in cells of patients with myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers, histamine stimulation caused a higher [Ca2+]m peak, as compared with controls (40Brini M. Pinton P. King M.P. Davidson M. Schon E.A. Rizzuto R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As mitochondria are likely to be involved in dystrophic muscle (41Lucas-Heron B. Schmitt N. Ollivier B. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 169: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), a similar approach with aequorin might therefore shed light on a better understanding of the Ca2+ dysregulation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Upon reduction of thecd 1 enzyme in the crystal, Tyr25, which ligates the d 1 heme in the active site of the oxidized protein is released to allow substrate binding. Concomitantly, the c domain refolds, resulting in a change in c heme coordination from His17-His69 to His69-Met106 (see Fig. 1, see also Ref. 2Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). During the conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide, both the cheme, which is the site of electron entry and thed 1 heme, the site where catalysis takes place, of cd 1 nitrite reductase are sequentially oxidized and the enzyme returns to its His17-His69 ligated oxidized state in the crystal when all reducing equivalents are exhausted. Similar heme-ligand switching has been observed since in other systems. The transcriptional activator CooA from Rhodospirillum rubrum contains a b-type heme that acts as a CO sensor in vivo. Under physiological conditions, CO can easily replace one of the ligands to the ferrous heme, thereby causing conformational changes around the heme and triggering activation of the transcriptional regulator (3Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The heme in CooA is in the six-coordinate form in both oxidation states, with Cys75being a heme ligand in the oxidized form (E 0 = −320 mV), whereas His77 appears to be an axial ligand in the reduced protein (E 0 = −260 mV) and is essential for activation of the protein by CO (3Aono S.

Another example of a redox-driven heme-ligand switching event has been reported for the yeast F82H/C102S iso-1-cytochrome c variant (7Schejter A. Taler G. Navon G. Liu X.J. Margoliash E. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13091-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the reduced state of the protein, the heme iron is coordinated by His18 and Met80, similar to the wild-type protein, whereas the heme iron is ligated by His18 and His82 in the oxidized protein. The redox potential of the His-Met form is E 0 = 247 mV and that of the His-His form is E 0 = 47 mV. Electrochemical examination has revealed that the oxidized His18-His82 form is highly disordered, and it is proposed that this high level of disorder facilitates rapid rearrangement to His18-Met80 upon reduction (8Feinberg B.A. Liu X.

In unfolded cytochrome c, the proximal histidine (His18) remains an axial ligand by virtue of its proximity to Cys15 and Cys17, which form the thioether linkages to the porphyrin ring (14Moore G.R.

Structural changes induced by changes in the redox state of a heme group in a protein play a central role in channeling redox energy into conformational energy in biology. For cytochromecd 1 nitrite reductase, the factors that drive the switch between His-His and His-Met coordination of thec-type heme center in the enzyme (Fig.1) have not been elucidated. An open question is whether ligand switching at the c heme is a property of the c heme domain or of the wholecd 1 molecule. To understand the molecular details of this process, we present here the characterization of the heme ligation in the isolated c domain of the P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd 1 nitrite reductase enzyme in both oxidation states in solution. The isolated c domain consisting of the first 133 amino acid residues of the mature P. pantotrophus cytochromecd 1 nitrite reductase was expressed inEscherichia coli, as described elsewhere. 1E. Gordon, E. Steensma, and S. J. Ferguson, manuscript in preparation. Six or eight-liter cultures of E. coli in LB medium were grown overnight at 37 °C and centrifuged at 7000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein was removed from the periplasm using an osmotic shock procedure. The cell pellet was resuspended in a 0.4-culture volume of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, incubated 5–10 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in a 0.4-culture volume of ice-cold 5 mm MgSO4, stirred on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C. The red-colored supernatant was loaded onto a fast-flow Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 50 mm NaCl. The c domain was isolated in the reduced form. To ensure full reduction or oxidation, a small excess of ascorbic acid or ferricyanide in the solid form was added to the purified protein immediately before it was put on a Novarose PrePac S.E.-100/17 gel-filtration column (Inovata, Bromma, Sweden), which was equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer and 100 mmNaCl, pH 7. The protein was either directly frozen in liquid nitrogen or concentrated to 1–2 mm using 3K Centriprep (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and 3K Microsep concentrators (Filtron Technology Corp., Northborough, MA), subsequently lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C before use. The purity of c domain samples was checked by native and SDS-PAGE2 on a PhastSystem (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and silver-stained. Care was taken to minimize proteolytic cleavage of thec domain samples by purifying and concentrating the protein at 4 °C as quickly as possible and by freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen between handling steps. The mass of the isolated c domain was determined by MALDI-TOF spectrometry. N-terminal analysis was performed to check whether the periplasmic leader sequence was cleaved off at the correct amino acid position. Equilibrium sedimentation studies were performed on 10 mmoxidized c domain samples in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 300 K, using a Centriscan 75 ultracentrifuge. The absorbance at 280 nm was recorded. UV-visible absorbance spectra between 250 and 750 nm were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Kinetic experiments to follow the ascorbate reduction of the isolatedc domain were performed using an RX2000 stopped-flow cell (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) coupled to the HP 8453 spectrophotometer. The reaction and storage chambers of the stopped-flow cell were kept at 4.5 °C. In the experiments, 2.5 μm oxidized c domain in 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7, was used. Pseudo first order rate constants were determined from exponential curves of the absorbance at 417 nmversus time at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mmascorbate in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. From these, the second order rate constant for ascorbate reduction of the isolatedc domain was determined. Unfolding of the oxidized (16–22 μm) and reduced (8–10 μm) isolated c domain was monitored by absorbance spectroscopy as a function of the sample temperature in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7. Thermal denaturation curves were measured between 277 and 340 K for oxidized and between 316 and 368 K for reduced protein samples, respectively. The isolated c domain was reduced with solid dithionite (end concentration 10 mm) inside an anaerobic glove box and kept overnight in the glove box before it was pipetted in an airtight cuvette and sealed. The sample temperature was measured with a thin NiCr-NiAl thermocouple (Testo 925, Göteborgs Termometerfabrik, Göteborg, Sweden), which was in direct contact with the protein solution inside the sealed cuvette. The precision of the temperature reading was within ±0.1 °C. The heating rate was manually controlled and varied between 0.25 and 1 °C per minute to ensure that thermal unfolding of the protein was at equilibrium,i.e. a change in heating rate within this regime did not result in a change of the T m. Thermal unfolding curves were measured at different wavelengths and corrected with the absorbance measured at 900 nm, a wavelength at which no protein absorbance is expected. The corrected unfolding curves were normalized and subsequently analyzed according to a two-state mechanism of unfolding (21Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E.

The data were fitted as described in Ref. 23van Mierlo C.P.M. van Dongen W.M.A.M. Vergeldt F. van Berkel W.J.H. Steensma E.

Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. 2nd. Ed. IRL press, Oxford1997: 299-321Google Scholar) in fits to the data of the isolated reduced c domain. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving lyophilized protein in either 99.9% 2H2O or 90% H2O/10% 2H2O to yield 1–2 mm protein solutions in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer and 100 mm sodium chloride, pH* 6.7. Solutions were prepared in an anaerobic glove box, and the NMR tubes were sealed with gas-tight caps. All samples contained 0.1–0.2 mm DSS as an internal standard. The c domain has a tendency to auto-oxidize and to auto-reduce, and 100% oxidized or 100% reduced samples, as detected by NMR spectroscopy, could not be made without the addition of oxidizing and reducing agents, respectively. The phenomenon of auto-reduction has been observed for other cytochromes cat high pH (24Ubbink M. Canters G.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13893-13901Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 3M. Ubbink, personal communication. Samples were oxidized or reduced in the NMR tubes by addition of small amounts of ferricyanide or sodium ascorbate, respectively, in 50 mmsodium phosphate, 100 mm sodium chloride, pH 7, using a Hamilton syringe until subsequent additions did not result in changes in the NMR spectrum. Before and after each two-dimensional1H NMR experiment, one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of the NMR sample were recorded and compared to ensure that the sample had not deteriorated during the NMR experiment. Furthermore, an aliquot of each c domain sample was taken before and after each series of NMR experiments (lasting for several days) and checked with SDS-PAGE to see whether degradation had occurred during acquisition of the NMR experiments. All 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer either at 500.13 or at 500.03 MHz. One- and two-dimensional experiments on isolated oxidized and reducedc domain were performed over the range of 278–308 K. One-dimensional 1H NMR experiments were recorded with a spectral width of 95 ppm. In two-dimensional 1H NMR experiments, the spectral width in both dimensions was 17 or 18 ppm when information on the diamagnetic region of spectra of the isolatedc domain was to be obtained. To obtain information on hyperfine shifted resonances of the isolated oxidized cdomain, a spectral width of 95 ppm was used in two-dimensional1H NMR experiments. Routinely, 2048 complex points were acquired in the direct dimension, whereas 256 complex points were recorded in the indirect dimension of two-dimensional 1H NMR experiments. Quadrature detection in the indirect dimension was accomplished using the time proportional phase incrementation method. Presaturation of the water signal was always employed during the relaxation period. Ordinary 30- and 150-ms NOESY, 31-ms clean-TOCSY (25Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem.

Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) sequence, and DQF-COSY experiments were recorded on the diamagnetic regions of spectra of the isolated c domain in both oxidation states. The relaxation delay was between 1 and 2 s. T1 inversion recovery experiments were performed on the oxidized protein in 100% 2H2O at 278, 295, and 298 K and in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O at 278 K using a relaxation delay of 5 s between individual free induction decays. Peak volumes of resolved peaks were plotted with respect to recovery delay time, and T1 values were extracted from exponential fits to the data using the XWINNMR package unless stated otherwise. In DEFT-NOESY and DEFT-TOCSY experiments (27Bertini I. Banci L. Luchinat C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 246-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Kolczak U. Han C. Sylvia L.A. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12643-12654Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the first 90° pulse in the ordinary NOESY and TOCSY pulse sequences was replaced with the modified DEFT sequence (90°-τ-180°-τ-90°) (29Becker E.D. Ferretti J.A. Farrar T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 91: 7784-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) with τ = 100 ms. In two-dimensional DEFT 1H NMR experiments, the relaxation delay was set to 200 ms. A 5-ms DEFT-TOCSY1H NMR experiment was recorded on the isolated oxidizedc domain. NOE mixing times of 5 and 15 ms were used in DEFT-NOESY 1H NMR experiments. Two-dimensional exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) 1H NMR experiments (30Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4805) Google Scholar, 31Boyd J. Moore G.R. Williams G. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 58: 511-516Google Scholar) were performed on samples containing mixtures of the oxidized and reduced c domain in2H2O (278 and 298 K) and in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O (278 K). Under the experimental conditions used, all 1H resonances are broadened to some extent due to intermediate exchange between oxidized and reduced molecules. NOE mixing times of 5 and 15 ms were used in the DEFT-NOESY pulse sequences to ensure that even cross peaks arising from resonances with the shortest T1 values could be observed. Two-dimensional 1H NMR data were processed using the XWINNMR package. One-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR data sets were apodized using an exponential decay in the direct dimension and using a 30–40° shifted sine-bell-squared window function in the indirect dimension. After phase correction, the spectra were baseline corrected in both dimensions. Two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were analyzed using the program XEASY (ETH Zurich, Switzerland (32Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar)). One-dimensional1H NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using the program Gifa (33Pons J.L. Malliavin T.E. Delsuc M.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). 1H chemical shifts were referenced using internal DSS as a standard. The isolated c domain is expressed in the reduced form in the periplasm of E. coli 1 and can be purified in the reduced state. At pH 8, the isolatedc domain remains reduced for weeks under aerobic conditions at 4 °C, as determined by absorbance spectroscopy. The absorbance spectrum of the reduced c domain (gray curve in Fig. 2 A) shows characteristic maxima at 418 nm (Soret band), 522 nm (β band), and 548 nm and 554 nm (split α bands), which are indicative of a low-spin six-coordinated heme iron. The oxidized c domain has absorption maxima at 410 and 527 nm (black curve in Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, at high protein concentrations (millimolar) a small band is observed at 696 nm (see inset in Fig. 2 A) indicative of methionine ligation to the heme (14Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochromes c: Evolutionary, Structural and Physicochemical Aspects..in: Rich A. Springer Series in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Google Scholar). For comparison, the absorbance spectra of reduced and oxidized cytochromecd 1 nitrite reductase are shown in Fig.2 C. The c domain appeared as a monomer on native gels, and mass/charge MALDI-TOF spectra did not show any indication of dimers. Sedimentation equilibrium studies with 10 μm protein solution confirmed that the isolated c domain is monomeric in solution. Although absorbance spectra of reduced c domain samples did not change over a period of weeks when stored at 4 °C, SDS-PAGE shows that the protein underwent a degradation over such periods of time (data not shown). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of an agedc domain sample, which was stored in the reduced state for a month at 4 °C, gave the sequence APEGVSALSD, showing that the first 41 residues of the c domain had been cleaved off. Mass spectrometric analysis gave a mass of 10,422 Da, confirming that most of the aged protein consisted of residues 42–133 of the cdomain sequence and that no full-length c domain was present anymore. The isolated c domain can reversibly be oxidized by ferricyanide and re-reduced by dithionite or ascorbate. The oxidizedc domain is readily reduced by ascorbate, with a second order rate constant of 20.9 ± 1.4m−1.s−1 in 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 4.5 °C. This is in contrast to the oxidized cd 1 nitrite reductase enzyme, which can only be reduced slowly by ascorbate (34Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 4T. Sjögren, personal communication. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of the reduced c domain in2H2O (green curve, Fig.3 A) and H2O (black curve, Fig. 3 A) shows several outstanding features typical for c-type cytochromes. The resonances of the reduced protein exhibit a broad chemical shift dispersion brought about by the presence of the aromatic heme group (Fig. 3 A). The four downfield resonances between 9 and 10.5 ppm in the2H2O spectrum arise from the four meso protons (numbered 5, 10, 15, and 20in Fig. 4), which reside within the heme plane. Many resonances between ∼1 and −3 ppm arise from protons of the axial ligands and from other protons located close to the center of and perpendicular to the heme plane. Using two-dimensional NOESY, TOCSY, and COSY 1H NMR spectra, most of the heme proton were assigned (TableI). 5The NMR data on the isolated c domain in the reduced and oxidized state are deposited in the BioMagResBank web site and have accession numbers 4800 and 4801, respectively. Figure 4NOEs observed in two-dimensional1H NMR spectra of the isolated reduced cdomain are indicated as red lines in the crystal structure of the reduced P. pantotrophus cytochromecd 1 nitrite reductase (Protein Data Bank file 1AOF; hydrogens were generated using the program InsightII (Biosym/MSI, San Diego, CA).

https://openalex.org/W1963927157,"Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase is a class II tRNA synthetase and occurs in a multisynthetase complex in mammalian cells. Human Asp-tRNA synthetase contains a short 32-residue amino-terminal extension that can control the release of charged tRNA and its direct transfer to elongation factor 1α; however, whether the extension binds to tRNA directly or interacts with the synthetase active site is not known. Full-length human AspRS, but not amino-terminal 32 residue-deleted, fully active AspRS, was found to bind to noncognate tRNAfMet in the presence of Mg2+. Synthetic amino-terminal peptides bound similarly to tRNAfMet, whereas little or no binding of polynucleotides, poly(dA-dT), or polyphosphate to the peptides was found. The apparent binding constants to tRNA by the peptide increased with increasing concentrations of Mg2+, suggesting Mg2+mediates the binding as a new mode of RNA·peptide interactions. The binding of tRNAfMet to amino-terminal peptides was also observed using fluorescence-labeled tRNAs and circular dichroism. These results suggest that a small peptide can bind to tRNA selectively and that evolution of class II tRNA synthetases may involve structural changes of amino-terminal extensions for enhanced selective binding of tRNA.

Extensive studies of the structure and function of this family of enzymes have provided excellent understanding of fundamental principles of RNA-protein interactions and structures of synthetases. Almost all synthetases contain a core catalytic domain carrying out adenylation of an amino acid and an anti-codon binding domain essential for aminoacylation of cognate tRNA. The core catalytic domains in class I synthetases resemble dinucleotide binding folds and reside in the amino termini, whereas a seven-stranded anti-parallel sheet with three α-helices characterizes active sites in class II synthetases and locates in the carboxyl termini of synthetases. Beyond the basic amino- and carboxyl-terminal catalytic domains, eukaryotic and mammalian synthetases (1Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 2Yang D.C.H. Curr. Topics Cell. Regul. 1996; 34: 101-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 3Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 83-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have evolved idiosyncratic extensions dispensable for aminoacylation of tRNA. Additionally, extensive association of synthetases occurs in high eukaryotic organisms; thus, 9 of the 20 synthetases associate as a multienzyme complex, ProRS and GluRS form a fused GluProRS (4Fett R. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1448-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cerini C. Kerjan P. Astier M. Gratecos D. Mirande M. Semeriva M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4267-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and ValRS associates with the EF1H as a separate complex (6Motorin Y.A. Wolfson A.D. Orlovsky A.F. Gladilin K.L. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Bec G. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21138-21145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the extensions in synthetases has attracted more attention recently. Controlled proteolysis or hydrophobic interaction chromatography dissociates several synthetases from the synthetase complex without significantly affecting enzymatic activities (8Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Johnson D.L. Dang C.V. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4362-4366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, the extensions in mammalian synthetases likely play pivotal roles in the structural organization of the synthetase complex. Extensions in synthetases can be involved in RNA binding (10Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giege R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Reed V.S. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol.

Multienzyme complexes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases also provide a model for studying organization of cellular protein biosynthetic machinery (15Rho S.B. Kim M.J. Lee J.S. Seol W. Motegi H. Kim S.

Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The primary and quaternary structures of the protein components and the gross structure of the synthetase complex are well established, but the structural and functional organization of the synthetase complex is not well understood. AspRS1 is a class II synthetase, its primary structures from more than 50 sources have been determined, and the three-dimensional structures from bacteria and yeast have been resolved (17Sauter C. Lorber B. Cavarelli J. Moras D. Giege R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Ruff M. Krishnaswamy S. Boeglin M. Poterszman A. Mitschler A. Podjarny A. Rees B. Thierry J.C. Moras D. Science. 1991; 252: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Mammalian AspRS occurs as the smallest synthetase in the multisynthetase complex and has been used as a model for better understanding of the multisynthetase complex and the extensions in synthetases. Human AspRS (hDRS) has a very short, 32-residue, near neutral extension (19Jacobo-Molina A. Peterson R. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16608-16612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mirande M. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 842-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as opposed to the 71-residue, highly basic extension in the corresponding yeast AspRS (21Sellami M. Prevost G. Bonnet J. Dirheimer G. Gangloff J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 40: 349-352Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All other mammalian synthetases have longer extensions than AspRS (1Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); in particular, IRS has an extension of 180 residues. Deletion of the amino-terminal extension in mammalian AspRS affects the stability, the Michaelis-Menten parameters (22Escalante C. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6014-6023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the dimerization (12Agou F. Waller J.-P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29295-29303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and cellular localization (23Mirande M. Lazard M. Martinez R. Latreille M.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Escalante C. Qasba P.K. Yang D.C.H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), but deletion mutants remain fully active. Interestingly, the amino-terminal extension reduces the rate of release of charged tRNA from hDRS (11Reed V.S. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32937-32941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and elongation factor 1α with GTP stimulates the charged tRNA release; thus, the extension in hDRS directly or indirectly mediates the direct transfer of charged tRNA from RS to elongation factor 1α (25Reed V.S. Wastney M. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32932-32936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length hDRS has appreciably lower Km to tRNA than that of the truncated hDRS (22Escalante C. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6014-6023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, the results of the steady-state and single-turnover kinetic analyses suggest that the hDRS extension likely interacts with tRNA or the active site in a manner that may provide additional understanding of the process of synthetase·RNA interactions. Furthermore, in contrast to the lysine-rich extensions described in several recent reports (10Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giege R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Wang C.C. Morales A.J. Schimmel P. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5449-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the 32-residue extension in hDRS is short and is not highly basic. In this paper, we focus on the tRNA binding by the amino-terminal extension in hDRS using fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD). We report that the hDRS extension indeed binds to tRNA and magnesium ion plays an essential role in this case of a neutral nonlysine-rich extension. Preliminary reports of this study have appeared previously (28Hammamieh R. Yang D.C.H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: A1024Google Scholar). Unfractionated Escherichia coli tRNA, yeast tRNA, and E. coli tRNAfMet were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rabbit reticulocytes were purchased from Green Hectare. The synthetase complex was purified from rabbit reticulocytes as described previously (29Godar D.E. Garcia V. Jacobo A. Aebi U. Yang D.C.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Ethidium bromide, trifluoroethanol, octadecaphosphate, soluble calf thymus DNA, and ribonuclease were obtained from Sigma. Poly(A), poly(U), poly(dA), and poly(dA-dT) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The full-length (hDRS) and the amino-terminal 32-residue-deleted (hDRSΔ32) forms of human AspRS were expressed in bacteria as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, subsequently thrombin-digested, and purified as free synthetase as described previously (22Escalante C. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6014-6023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the 21-mer synthetic peptide, hDRS (Thr5-Lys25), was AcTQRKSQEKPREIMDAAEDYAK-amide, and the sequence of the hexadecamer peptide, hDRS (Asp12-Arg27), was AcDPREIMDAAEDYAKER-amide. Both peptides were synthesized and purified using RPC-C18 high pressure liquid chromatography to be more than 95% pure by Peptide Technology (Bethesda, MD). The molecular weights of hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) and hDRS (Asp12-Arg27) were 2535 (expected 2535) and 1950 (expected 1950), respectively, as determined by mass spectrometry. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were carried out using a Hitachi PerkinElmer Life Sciences MPF2A spectrofluorimeter and 0.4- × 0.4-cm2 Hellma quartz microcuvettes at room temperature as described previously (30Ferguson B.Q. Yang D.C.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2743-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fluorescence titrations were performed by adding 1- to 5-μl aliquots to an initial volume of 250 μl in a standard buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 4 mm MgCl2 unless specified otherwise. Samples for fluorescence measurements had absorbance < 0.05 absorbance unit at the excitation wavelength. The extents of decrease of fluorescence intensity due to inner filter effect were determined by carrying out parallel titrations with tyrosine or tryptophan at the same molar concentration as that of the peptide or protein. The net extents of quenching were used for calculating binding constants. CD measurements were carried out using a Jasco700 CD spectrophotometer under nitrogen at 10 p.s.i. as described previously (11Reed V.S. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32937-32941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wavelengths were calibrated using camphor sulfate. The spectra were recorded using 1-cm cells and scanned at least three times from 190 to 300 nm. CD titrations were carried out by adding 1-μl aliquots to an initial volume of 300 μl in a standard buffer of 10 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 4 mm MgCl2unless specified otherwise. CD spectra were deconvoluted using the convex constraint analysis (31Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) to resolve the five fundamental component CD spectra for various secondary structures of a given sample and 25 proteins with known secondary structures using software supplied by Jasco. Binding of tRNA to peptides was analyzed by fluorescence quenching at varying concentration of peptides (ΔF) and saturating concentration of peptides (ΔFmax). Combining these values with the equation of conservation of mass and the Scatchard equation, Eq. 1 can be derived:ΔF=ΔFmax(nR0+P0+Kd)−[(nR0+P0+Kd)2−4nR0P0]1/22R0Equation 1 where R0, P0,n, and Kd are the total concentration of tRNA, the total concentration of peptide, the binding stoichiometry, and the dissociation constant, respectively. Eq. 1 was used instead of the simple hyperbolic equation to include correction of the total concentration of peptide to the concentration of unbound peptide. Nonlinear least square fit was carried out using Sigma Plot. CD titration was similarly analyzed except the net increases in ellipticity above the sum of tRNA and peptide ellipticities were used by subtraction of ellipticities of peptide and tRNA alone from those of mixtures of peptide and tRNA. Binding of Mg2+ to tRNA was analyzed by fluorescence quenching of tRNA-bound ethidium by Mg2+ at varying concentrations of Mg2+ (ΔF) and at saturating concentration of Mg2+ (ΔFmax). The Hill equation (Eq. 2) was used to obtain Hill coefficients:ΔF=ΔFmaxn[Mg2+]hKd+[Mg2+]h,Equation 2 where [Mg2+], h, n, and Kd are the total concentration of MgCl2, the Hill coefficient, the stoichiometry, and the dissociation constant, respectively. The amino-terminal extension in hDRS dramatically reduces the rate of release of charged tRNA from hDRS (11Reed V.S. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32937-32941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that tRNA interacts directly or indirectly with the amino-terminal extension in hDRS. Noncognate tRNAfMet from E. coli was used to examine tRNA binding capability of the amino-terminal extension in hDRS. Noncognate tRNA was used, because the relatively small amino-terminal extension was not expected to exhibit tRNA identity and noncognate tRNA should not bind to the cognate tRNA binding site. As shown in Fig. 1, the full-length hDRS bound to tRNAfMet as judged by the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of hDRS, and an apparent dissociation constant of tRNAfMet to hDRS of 0.27 μm was obtained based on fluorescence titration. No fluorescence quenching of hDRS by tRNAfMet was observed in the absence of MgCl2suggesting Mg2+ is essential in the noncognate tRNA binding. The linear decrease of the fluorescence in hDRSΔ32 was due to the UV absorption by tRNA, and the negligible fluorescence quenching of hDRSΔ32 by tRNAfMet precluded determination of a binding constant. The large difference in the tRNAfMetaffinity between hDRS and hDRSΔ32 suggests that the amino-terminal extension is needed for hDRS to bind to noncognate tRNA. The binding of tRNAfMet to hDRS could result from interaction of the amino-terminal extension with the active site or attribute to a direct binding of tRNA by the extension. The interaction of tRNAfMet with the amino-terminal extension in hDRS was next investigated using synthetic peptides. A 21-residue peptide hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) that contains a putative amphiphilic helix in the amino-terminal extension in hDRS was synthesized. The fluorescence intensity of ethidium enhances over 20-fold upon binding to a single strong binding site in tRNA (32Bittman R. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 33Tao T. Nelson J.H. Cantor C.R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3514-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the fluorescence of tRNA-bound ethidium was monitored to assess binding of tRNA to amino-terminal peptides. As shown in Fig.2, the fluorescence of tRNA-bound ethidium was quenched 25% by hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) at 4 mm MgCl2. In the absence of MgCl2, on the contrary, the fluorescence of tRNA-bound ethidium was not at all affected by the peptide. Free ethidium fluorescence in the absence of tRNA was not affected by the peptide under the same conditions either. Fluorescence titration of tRNAfMet and hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) gave an apparent dissociation constant of 1.7 μm. The number of peptide binding sites in tRNA was determined by Job analysis (34Job P. Ann. Chim. (Paris). 1928; 9: 113-203Google Scholar,35Huang C.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), in which the fluorescence intensities were determined at varying molar ratios of the peptide to tRNA without changing their total molar concentration. As shown in Fig. 2, the maximal change was obtained when tRNA and the peptide were present at a 1:1 molar ratio; thus, there is one binding site per tRNA molecule. When the Tyr fluorescence of the peptide was monitored, a moderate quenching by tRNAfMet, 11%, was observed after correction for the inner filter effect. In the absence of MgCl2, the Tyr fluorescence of the peptide was not quenched by tRNAfMet. When the CD spectrum of the peptide was compared with that of the peptide in the presence of tRNA after subtraction of CD of tRNA alone, significant changes of the peptide CD between 200 nm and 250 nm were observed (Fig. 3). Comparison of the CD spectra of tRNA in the absence and in the presence of the peptide (after subtraction of CD of peptide) indicated that no detectable changes in the spectrum between 250 nm and 300 nm where tRNA absorbs. Again, no CD changes of the peptide or tRNA were found in the absence of MgCl2. An apparent dissociation constant of 0.9 μm was obtained by monitoring ellipticity at 208 nm in the binding of tRNAfMet to the peptide. The binding of the peptide to tRNAfMet appears to be selective to tRNA among polyanions and polynucleotides. As shown in Table I, the fluorescence of poly(dA-dT)-bound ethidium was not affected by the peptide hDRS (Thr5-Lys25). The Tyr fluorescence of hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) was also monitored for binding to nucleic acids other than tRNA. As shown in Table I, tyrosine fluorescence quenching was small for poly(A), poly(U), poly(dA-dT), or an oligodeoxynucleotide. The tyrosine fluorescence of the hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) was not at all affected by polyphosphate (Table I). Finally, the ellipticity of the peptide was monitored to detect the binding of the peptide to polyphosphate and oligodeoxynucleotides. No change in the CD spectrum of the peptide was observed upon addition of polyphosphate. When the CD spectra of the peptide were compared in the absence and presence of the oligodeoxynucleotide after correction of the oligodeoxynucleotide CD, no changes in the CD spectrum of the peptide were found.Table IBinding of hDRS(T5–K25) to tRNAfMet and polyanionsTyrosine fluorescenceEthidium fluorescence% changeNone00tRNAfMet−11−25Poly (dA-dT)−3.70Oligodeoxynucleotide1-aThe sequence was GCGTCTACTCACCCAGTACCG.−1.7Poly(A)+4.1Poly(U)+1.3Polyphosphate0All fluorescence measurements were carried out using 0.2 mg/ml peptide hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 4 mm MgCl2.

In the absence of MgCl2, the peptide had no effect on the fluorescence of tRNAfMet (8Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. Eur. J.

The binding of hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) to tRNAfMet was analyzed at varying concentrations of ethidium to determine whether hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) and ethidium bind competitively to tRNAfMet. The binding of the hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) to tRNAfMet was determined at varying concentrations of ethidium in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 4 mm MgCl2, and the fitted titration curves using Eq. 1 gave apparent dissociation constants, 1.7, 1.86, 3.5, and 23.4 μm, at 1.4, 2.8, 5.6 and 11.2 μm ethidium, respectively. The amino-terminal peptide evidently showed weaker binding to tRNA at higher concentrations of ethidium; however, the effect of ethidium on the peptide binding to tRNA could not be modeled by simple competitive binding. Mg2+was needed for the binding of the amino-terminal peptide to tRNAfMet as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching and CD changes. Divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Zn2+or the monovalent cation Na+ could not substitute for Mg2+ in the binding of the peptide to tRNAfMetas judged by the extent of quenching of the fluorescence of tRNA-bound ethidium by the peptide. The roles of Mg2+ ion in the interaction of tRNA and the peptide could be maintaining the proper conformation of tRNA or mediating the formation of the complex. To assess the role of Mg2+ in the binding of the peptide to tRNA, fluorescence titration of the tRNA-bound ethidium with the peptide was carried out at varying concentrations of MgCl2. The effect of Mg2+ may be represented by the mass action of the process:tRNA+peptide+ΔnMg2+⇄[tRNA·Mg·peptide]Equation 3 When Ka is defined in terms of the equilibrium concentrations of tRNA, peptide and the complex, then it is readily shown that δlogKaδlog[Mg2+]T,P=ΔnEquation 4 where Δn is the difference of the average numbers of Mg2+ bound in free tRNA and peptide-bound tRNA. The apparent binding constants of the peptide to tRNA,Ka , increased with increasing concentrations of MgCl2. The linear relationship of the plot of log Ka versus log [Mg2+] gave a slope of 1.33 (Fig. 5). A slope of greater than one suggests at least one additional Mg2+ ion bound in the tRNA·peptide complex upon the formation of the complex as compared with free tRNA. The association of Mg2+ with tRNA was next analyzed by monitoring the fluorescence changes of tRNAfMet-bound ethidium by Mg2+. As shown in Fig.6, the binding of Mg2+ is highly cooperative and the binding isotherm gave a Hill coefficient of 3.4. This is in good agreement with earlier studies (36Stein A. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). When the association of Mg2+ with tRNAfMet was similarly analyzed in the presence of a saturating amount of the 21-mer peptide, a Hill coefficient of 4.5 was obtained. When the effect of NaCl on the binding of the peptide to tRNA in the presence of MgCl2 was analyzed, in contrast to the stimulatory effect of Mg2+, the extent of fluorescence quenching decreased at increasing concentrations of NaCl. The apparent binding constants of the peptides to tRNAfMet also decreased at increasing concentrations of NaCl and gave a linear relationship of log Ka versuslog[NaCl] with a slope of −0.2. A shorter 16-mer peptide in the amino-terminal extension of hDRS was also examined. The peptide hDRS (Asp12-Arg27), which has an additional acetylated Asp as a helix cap and an additional basic Arg residue at the carboxyl terminus, has significantly higher propensity of forming helical secondary structure than hDRS (T5–25) (11Reed V.S. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32937-32941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of tRNAfMet by the peptide hDRS (Asp12-Arg27) was similarly analyzed. As shown in Fig. 7, the fluorescence of ethidium noncovalently bound to tRNAfMet was similarly quenched by hDRS (Asp12-Arg27), showing an apparent dissociation constant of 8.9 μm. Again, in the absence of Mg2+, no change of the ethidium fluorescence was observed. Although the three-dimensional structures of yeast and bacteria AspRS have been determined, the amino-terminal extension was mobile and its structure so far remains unresolved. The conformation of the peptide was first modeled based on its 48% sequence identity to Salmonella typhimurium glutamine synthetase () in the Rutgers Protein Data Base. Coordinates of the peptide backbone were assigned to the peptide according to the coordinates of the reference glutamine synthetase (PDB 2LGS). The energy of the structure was minimized using the DISCOVER Homology module from Biosym by running 1000 dynamics steps followed by 100 equilibration steps at 300 °K and 1-ps time step. The dynamics process was followed by 3000 energy minimization steps. The lowest energy was −118 kcal/mol, and the predicted secondary structure had 11 hydrogen bonds. The peptide was then docked, using the DISCOVER Affinity module, onto tRNAPhe in the Rutgers Protein Data Base with all possible orientations and 100 iterations while the intermolecular energy between the peptide and tRNA was monitored. The lowest energy among docked structures was −99 kcal/mol. Binding of the peptide to tRNA involved conformational changes in the peptide and resulted in a slightly higher disordered secondary structure than that in the free peptide. A stereo view of the backbone model of the complex of hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) with tRNAPhe is shown in Fig. 8. The present study shows that the amino-terminal peptide in hDRS binds to tRNA based on fluorescence and CD changes in tRNAfMet or the peptide. Ethidium was used as an extrinsic fluorescence probe in analyzing the binding of tRNA by the peptide, and increasing the concentration of ethidium was found to reduce the affinity of tRNA to the peptide. A tighter binding to tRNA by the peptide can be expected in the absence of ethidium under the same conditions. Indeed, a slightly higher apparent binding constant based on the ellipticity at 208 nm was observed as compared with those obtained using fluorescence-labeled tRNA or ethidium-bound tRNA. Both fluorescence and CD results demonstrated the binding of tRNA by the peptide. The binding appears to be selective to tRNA, because other polynucleotides and polyphosphate did not bind to the synthetic peptide. These results are in notable contrast to the amino-terminal peptide in yeast DRS. Polyphosphate and DNA bind indiscriminately to the highly basic extension in yeast DRS (37Agou F. Yang Y. Gesquiere J.-C. Waller J.-P. Guittet E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It appears that the amino-terminal extension in DRS evolved from a highly basic extension in yeast to a nearly neutral extension in mammals and resulted in its selective binding to tRNA. To our knowledge, this is the first time an amino-terminal peptide was found to bind tRNA selectively. Several nonspecific tRNA binding domains have been found recently in GlnRS (26Wang C.C. Morales A.J. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17180-17186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), AspRS (10Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giege R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and AlaRS (27Ribas de Pouplana L. Buechter D. Sardesai N.Y. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5449-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and are characterized by clusters of basic residues in the tRNA binding domains. The nonspecific RNA binding domains evidently facilitate the formation of a specific and essential tRNA-protein complex and optimize recognition of tRNA. In addition, a zinc binding domain distal to the tRNA-binding site in IRS is essential in tRNA binding (38Glasfeld E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6739-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of tRNA recognition through these RNA binding domains in synthetases are yet to be elucidated. Mg2+ mediates and enhances the binding of tRNA by the amino-terminal peptides in hDRS. On the basis of the slope of the log Ka versus log [MgCl2] plot, there is clearly at least one additional Mg2+ in the tRNA·peptide complex than that in free tRNA. Mg2+ binds cooperatively to tRNA and stabilizes the conformation of tRNA. The observation that the Hill coefficient increased to 4.5 from 3.4 in the presence of the peptide is consistent with the increase of Mg2+ sites, although it should be cautioned that the Hill coefficient could have changed without changing the number of binding sites. A cluster of four acidic amino acids (Glu15, Asp18, Glu21, Asp22) in hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) could be involved in the binding of Mg2+ and mediate the binding of the phosphate-ribose backbone in RNA. No Mg2+requirement or Mg2+-mediated binding of tRNA by the highly basic or lysine-rich peptides has been reported, suggesting a different mode of RNA binding is utilized by neutral or nonlysine-rich peptides. Whether such mode of interaction is general for other neutral extensions or RNA binding domains is yet to be explored. Na+ cannot replace Mg2+ in facilitating the binding of the peptide to tRNA, and Na+ actually reduces tRNA affinity to the peptide. The slope of log Ka versus log [Na+] was small and negative in comparison to those such as drug·DNA interactions dominated by electrostatic interaction. The apparent dissociation constants of hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) and the 16-mer to tRNAfMet were found to be 1.7 and 8.9 μm, respectively. Three basic residues in hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) were absent in the 16-mer; thus, additional basic residues in hDRS (Thr5-Lys25) moderately enhanced affinity to tRNA. It appears that electrostatic interactions between tRNA and the basic residues in the extension may complement the roles of Mg2+ in tRNA binding. The molecular model of the peptide, which showed a disordered amino half of the peptide before Pro and a partial helical carboxyl half after Pro, is in general consistent with previously reported CD analyses. CD of a 22-mer, hDRS (T5-E26), and a 16-mer, hDRS (Asp12-Arg27), under various conditions indicated hDRS (Asp12-Arg27) has a high propensity of forming helical secondary structure and hDRS (T5-E26) has a low propensity (11Reed V.S. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32937-32941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of trifluoroethanol, hDRS (Asp12-Arg27) exhibited up to 61% helical content. However, the model must be considered tentative. Molecular modeling of the tRNA·peptide complex suggests that the peptide is preferentially located at the inside surface of the L-shaped tRNA with proximity to the acceptor and anti-codon stems. Such a model is consistent with the experimental data but must be considered tentative. It is intriguing that the binding of the peptide to tRNA is inhibited by ethidium, considering that the ethidium binding site is near the base of the acceptor stem as localized by singlet-singlet energy transfer experiments (39Ferguson B.Q. Yang D.C.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5298-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Because binding of ethidium to tRNA could be nonintercalative and nonfluorogenic, the nature of the competition of the peptide with ethidium remains to be clarified; nonetheless, the quenching of fluorescence of ethidium in tRNAfMet is consistent with the suggestion that the peptide binds near the base of the acceptor stem. The quenching of the fluorescence of tRNA (8Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Johnson D.L. Dang C.V. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol.

The present results support the likelihood that the evolution of extensions in mammalian synthetases may facilitate transferring tRNA between the periphery of the enzyme and the active site of the enzyme. The ability of tRNA binding by the amino-terminal extension in hDRS is in accord with its control of the release of charged tRNA (25Reed V.S. Wastney M. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32932-32936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal extension in hDRS also reduces the tRNA Michaelis-Menten constant as compared with hDRSΔ32 (22Escalante C. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6014-6023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the nonspecific tRNA binding extension in yeast AspRS decreases the tRNA Michaelis-Menten constant (10Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giege R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Clearly, fusion of a nonspecific tRNA binding domain to either class I or class II synthetase significantly enhances synthetase·tRNA interactions in terms of affinity and specificity (10Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giege R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Wang C.C. Morales A.J. Schimmel P. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5449-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The RNA binding capability of extensions in synthetases can conceivably facilitate not only the intramolecular transfer of RNA but also intermolecular transfers of RNA from one protein to another. The amino-terminal extension in hDRS mediates the direct transfer of charged tRNA from hDRS to the elongation factor 1α (25Reed V.S. Wastney M. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32932-32936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such intermolecular transfer is likely to play roles in the observed effects of yeast Arc1p on MetRS (40Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 41Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or a human homologue, p43, on ArgRS (42Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanisms of action and the tRNA binding motifs in these cases are yet to be determined. Highly charged and potentially amphiphilic helices are prevalent in mammalian synthetases but were absent in bacterial synthetases (2Yang D.C.H. Curr. Topics Cell. Regul. 1996; 34: 101-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The highly basic extensions in yeast synthetases endowed the yeast synthetases with the ability to bind polyanions (37Agou F. Yang Y. Gesquiere J.-C. Waller J.-P. Guittet E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Some mammalian synthetases such as Val- and LysRSs also contain such highly basic extensions (43Hsieh S.L. Campbell R.D. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 44Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol.

The present results open the possibility that the potentially amphiphilic helices in other mammalian synthetases may be involved in the RNA·synthetase interactions as well. Better understanding of the RNA·peptide interactions provides models of RNA·protein interactions and should be useful in the elucidation of the mechanisms in the transport of RNA from one protein to another and in the intracellular transport of RNA (45Grosshans H. Simos G. Hurt E. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as well as in protein biosynthesis (46Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

https://openalex.org/W2163361806,"Nuclear proteins from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) were identified that bind specifically to a rice tungro bacilliform virus promoter region containing a vascular bundle expression element (VBE). One set of proteins of 29, 33, and 37 kDa, present in shoot and cell suspension extracts but hardly detectable in root extracts, bound to a site containing the sequence AGAAGGACCAGA within the VBE, which also contains two CpG and one CpNpG potential methylation motifs. Binding by these proteins was determined to be cytosine methylation-independent. However, a novel protein present in all analyzed extracts bound specifically to the methylated VBE. A region of at least 49 nucleotides overlapping the VBE and complete cytosine methylation of the three Cp(Np)G motifs was required for efficient binding of this methylatedVBE-binding protein (MVBP)."
