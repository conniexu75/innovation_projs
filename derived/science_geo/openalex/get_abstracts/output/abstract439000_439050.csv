https://openalex.org/W2013125633,"The image of a fluorescent object hidden behind an opaque layer can be retrieved non-invasively by exploiting the correlation properties of the speckle pattern produced by illuminating the object through the layer using laser light. Imaging through opaque, light-scattering layers is an important capability in many fields, including nanotechnology and the biosciences. Several promising methods are being developed, but typically involve invasive procedures such a placing a detector or nonlinear material behind the scattering layer. Jacopo Bertolotti et al. now demonstrate a non-invasive imaging procedure that makes use of the correlations in the speckled intensity pattern that is produced when laser light passes through a scattering medium. Fluorescent micrometre-sized objects obscured by scattering layers can be imaged by measuring total fluorescence at several different angles of laser incidence and by using an iterative algorithm that disentangles the spatial information of the object and the speckle pattern. The authors successfully construct detailed images of cell-sized fluorescent objects hidden six millimetres behind scattering layers, and a complex biological sample sandwiched between two opaque screens. Non-invasive optical imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography1,2,3, are essential diagnostic tools in many disciplines, from the life sciences to nanotechnology. However, present methods are not able to image through opaque layers that scatter all the incident light4,5. Even a very thin layer of a scattering material can appear opaque and hide any objects behind it6. Although great progress has been made recently with methods such as ghost imaging7,8 and wavefront shaping9,10,11, present procedures are still invasive because they require either a detector12 or a nonlinear material13 to be placed behind the scattering layer. Here we report an optical method that allows non-invasive imaging of a fluorescent object that is completely hidden behind an opaque scattering layer. We illuminate the object with laser light that has passed through the scattering layer. We scan the angle of incidence of the laser beam and detect the total fluorescence of the object from the front. From the detected signal, we obtain the image of the hidden object using an iterative algorithm14,15. As a proof of concept, we retrieve a detailed image of a fluorescent object, comparable in size (50 micrometres) to a typical human cell, hidden 6 millimetres behind an opaque optical diffuser, and an image of a complex biological sample enclosed between two opaque screens. This approach to non-invasive imaging through strongly scattering media can be generalized to other contrast mechanisms and geometries."

Han et al. (p. 1321 , published online 8 November) now demonstrate a system for photoreductive hydrogen generation in water that manifests undiminished activity for weeks at a time. Semiconductor nanoparticles for light absorption were combined with a soluble nickel complex for the catalytic chemistry. The system currently requires a sacrificial electron donor, but its robustness shows promise for future pairing with an integrated oxidation catalyst."
https://openalex.org/W1982583124,"Genomic sequences contain rich evolutionary information about functional constraints on macromolecules such as proteins. This information can be efficiently mined to detect evolutionary couplings between residues in proteins and address the long-standing challenge to compute protein three-dimensional structures from amino acid sequences. Substantial progress has recently been made on this problem owing to the explosive growth in available sequences and the application of global statistical methods. In addition to three-dimensional structure, the improved understanding of covariation may help identify functional residues involved in ligand binding, protein-complex formation and conformational changes. We expect computation of covariation patterns to complement experimental structural biology in elucidating the full spectrum of protein structures, their functional interactions and evolutionary dynamics."

(p. 1353 , published online 8 November; see the Perspective by Stella ) investigated the cellular events that support regeneration in the zebrafish brain. Although inflammation is part of the response in both settings, the zebrafish brain goes on to initiate proliferation of replacement neurons. By inciting inflammation without neuronal damage, radial glial cells could be pushed into neurogenesis."

For applications such as lithography, it is useful to generate small features and to orient them through simple processing steps. Top-layer coatings should be able to help drive alignment, but it is difficult to coat a layer that also has strong enough interactions to influence assembly. Bates et al. (p. 775 ) developed a water-soluble polymer that can top-coat lamellaforming block copolymers and that transforms during thermal annealing into a neutral wetting layer that helps drive the formation of vertically oriented lamellae."

https://openalex.org/W2025361601,"Fang et al. generate the first genome-wide, strand-specific, single base–pair resolution map of m6A modifications in Escherichia coli. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing allows the systematic detection of chemical modifications such as methylation but has not previously been applied on a genome-wide scale. We used this approach to detect 49,311 putative 6-methyladenine (m6A) residues and 1,407 putative 5-methylcytosine (m5C) residues in the genome of a pathogenic Escherichia coli strain. We obtained strand-specific information for methylation sites and a quantitative assessment of the frequency of methylation at each modified position. We deduced the sequence motifs recognized by the methyltransferase enzymes present in this strain without prior knowledge of their specificity. Furthermore, we found that deletion of a phage-encoded methyltransferase-endonuclease (restriction-modification; RM) system induced global transcriptional changes and led to gene amplification, suggesting that the role of RM systems extends beyond protecting host genomes from foreign DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2037184839,"An Organic Knot When people tie knots, they grasp both ends of a strand and loop them around each other. The task is rather more difficult at the molecular level, when there is no top-down organizing framework, and the strand needs to be coaxed into looping around itself. Recently, chemists have taken advantage of the tight geometrical restrictions of metal-ligand coordination to produce knot morphologies. Ponnuswamy et al. (p. 783 ; see the Perspective by Siegel ) now demonstrate the spontaneous assembly of a trefoil knot from organic fragments without assistance from metal centers. The topology appears to be driven by hydrophobic interactions among aromatic segments that minimize exposure to surrounding water through their overlap."
https://openalex.org/W2123103161,"Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are widely used as optical sensors, whereas other light-absorbing domains have been used for optical control of protein localization or activity. Here, we describe light-dependent dissociation and association in a mutant of the photochromic FP Dronpa, and we used it to control protein activities with light. We created a fluorescent light-inducible protein design in which Dronpa domains are fused to both termini of an enzyme domain. In the dark, the Dronpa domains associate and cage the protein, but light induces Dronpa dissociation and activates the protein. This method enabled optical control over guanine nucleotide exchange factor and protease domains without extensive screening. Our findings extend the applications of FPs from exclusively sensing functions to also encompass optogenetic control."
https://openalex.org/W2083797876,"Large-scale sequencing has recently revealed the presence of highly complex, localized chromosomal rearrangements in cancer genomes. The authors discuss the evidence that such rearrangements can occur through at least two mechanisms: chromosomal shattering (chromothripsis) and template switching initiated by local defective DNA replication (chromoanasynthesis). They propose use of the term chromoanagenesis to describe this class of rearrangements, regardless of the initiating mechanism. Next-generation sequencing of DNA from human tumors or individuals with developmental abnormalities has led to the discovery of a process we term chromoanagenesis, in which large numbers of complex rearrangements occur at one or a few chromosomal loci in a single catastrophic event. Two mechanisms underlie these rearrangements, both of which can be facilitated by a mitotic chromosome segregation error to produce a micronucleus containing the chromosome to undergo rearrangement. In the first, chromosome shattering (chromothripsis) is produced by mitotic entry before completion of DNA replication within the micronucleus, with a failure to disassemble the micronuclear envelope encapsulating the chromosomal fragments for random reassembly in the subsequent interphase. Alternatively, locally defective DNA replication initiates serial, microhomology-mediated template switching (chromoanasynthesis) that produces local rearrangements with altered gene copy numbers. Complex rearrangements are present in a broad spectrum of tumors and in individuals with congenital or developmental defects, highlighting the impact of chromoanagenesis on human disease."
https://openalex.org/W1969081205,"Endocochlear potential (EP) is a battery-like electrochemical gradient found in and actively maintained by the inner ear. Here we demonstrate that the mammalian EP can be used as a power source for electronic devices. We achieved this by designing an anatomically sized, ultra-low quiescent-power energy harvester chip integrated with a wireless sensor capable of monitoring the EP itself. Although other forms of in vivo energy harvesting have been described in lower organisms, and thermoelectric, piezoelectric and biofuel devices are promising for mammalian applications, there have been few, if any, in vivo demonstrations in the vicinity of the ear, eye and brain. In this work, the chip extracted a minimum of 1.12 nW from the EP of a guinea pig for up to 5 h, enabling a 2.4 GHz radio to transmit measurement of the EP every 40-360 s. With future optimization of electrode design, we envision using the biologic battery in the inner ear to power chemical and molecular sensors, or drug-delivery actuators for diagnosis and therapy of hearing loss and other disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2129123584,"Powering LPS Export The surface of Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli is covered in lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which must be synthesized within the cytoplasm and then exported across the periplasm to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. Okuda et al. (p. 1214 , published online 8 November) describe the detection of LPS molecules bound to specific components of the E. coli lipopolysaccharide exporter during transport in vivo. In vitro reconstitution of LPS transport revealed the energetic requirements for the first two steps of transport, release from the membrane and transit along the periplasmic bridge of the exporter that connects the inner and outer membrane components. The findings suggest that adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis by a cytoplasmic component of the machine provides energy to push a continuous stream of LPS against its concentration gradient to the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W2048439293,"Mitochondria must grow with the growing cell to ensure proper cellular physiology and inheritance upon division. We measured the physical size of mitochondrial networks in budding yeast and found that mitochondrial network size increased with increasing cell size and that this scaling relation occurred primarily in the bud. The mitochondria-to-cell size ratio continually decreased in aging mothers over successive generations. However, regardless of the mother's age or mitochondrial content, all buds attained the same average ratio. Thus, yeast populations achieve a stable scaling relation between mitochondrial content and cell size despite asymmetry in inheritance."
https://openalex.org/W1973843772,"Sensitivity Training Equilibrium climate sensitivity—the increase in global mean surface air temperature caused by the doubling of the concentration of atmospheric CO 2 —is needed to predict anthropogenic climate change. For decades, models have estimated its value to be between 1.5° and 4.5°C, but with too high an uncertainty to have strong predictive value. Fasullo and Trenberth (p. 792 ; see the Perspective by Shell ) show that the seasonal variation of tropospheric relative humidity is related to climate sensitivity and could be used to constrain models and narrow the range of equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates, thereby allowing more accurate predictions of future warming."
https://openalex.org/W2008294932,"Dissecting Phosphine Resistance Worldwide populations of pest insects—such as the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica , and the rust-red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum —have become highly resistant to the fumigant phosphine, providing a potential threat to global food security. The nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans is vulnerable to phosphine, but phosphine-resistant strains are known. Schlipalius et al. (p. 807 ) show that mutations in the delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase ( dld-1 ) genes both give rise to phosphine resistance in C. elegans . Phosphine resistance mutants in R. dominica , and T. castaneum also map to the dld-1 gene, which codes for a core metabolic enzyme. These mutants are, however, hypersensitive to arsenic, mimics of which might thus synergize with phosphine."
https://openalex.org/W1989126510,"Despite more than 30 years of work on the Wnt signaling pathway, the basic mechanism of how the extracellular Wnt signal increases the intracellular concentration of β-catenin is still contentious. Circumventing much of the detailed biochemistry, we used basic principles of chemical kinetics coupled with quantitative measurements to define the reactions on β-catenin directly affected by the Wnt signal. We conclude that the core signal transduction mechanism is relatively simple, with only two regulated phosphorylation steps. Their partial inhibition gives rise to the full dynamics of the response and subsequently maintains a steady state in which the concentration of β-catenin is increased."
https://openalex.org/W1967182435,"The cAMP-binding protein Epac is a therapeutic target for the treatment of various diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy and tumor invasion. This points out the importance to develop Epac inhibitors to better understand the involvement of these cAMP sensors in physiology and pathophysiology. Here, we have developed a functional fluorescence-based high-throughput assay with a Z' value around 0.7 for screening Epac-specific antagonists. We identified an Epac1 inhibitor compound named CE3F4 that blocked Epac1 guanine nucleotide exchange activity toward its effector Rap1 both in cell-free systems and in intact cells. CE3F4 is a tetrahydroquinoline analog that fails to influence protein kinase A holoenzyme activity. CE3F4 inhibited neither the interaction of Rap1 with Epac1 nor directly the GDP exchange on Rap1. The kinetics of inhibition by CE3F4 indicated that this compound did not compete for binding of agonists to Epac1 and suggested an uncompetitive inhibition mechanism with respect to Epac1 agonists. A structure-activity study showed that the formyl group on position 1 and the bromine atom on position 5 of the tetrahydroquinoline skeleton were important for CE3F4 to exert its inhibitory activity. Finally, CE3F4 inhibited Rap1 activation in living cultured cells, following Epac activation by either 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2'-O-methyl-cAMP, an Epac-selective agonist, or isoprenaline, a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor agonist. Our study shows that CE3F4 and related compounds may serve as a basis for the development of new therapeutic drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2010489201,"Stars are generally spherical, yet their gaseous envelopes often appear nonspherical when ejected near the end of their lives. This quirk is most notable during the planetary nebula phase, when these envelopes become ionized. Interactions among stars in a binary system are suspected to cause the asymmetry. In particular, a precessing accretion disk around a companion is believed to launch point-symmetric jets, as seen in the prototype Fleming 1. Our finding of a post-common-envelope binary nucleus in Fleming 1 confirms that this scenario is highly favorable. Similar binary interactions are therefore likely to explain these kinds of outflows in a large variety of systems."

https://openalex.org/W1988586438,"Keeping Coral Clean Seaweed overgrowth is a major problem for coral reefs and also seems to be a consequence of excessive harvesting of herbivorous fish. Dixson and Hay (p. 804 ) examined this effect on Fijian reefs. Species of small herbivorous gobies and coral-associated damselfish were compared for their effect on the toxic Chlorodesmis seaweed in experiments that required caging colonies of the branching coral Acropora nasuta and the associated fish species. Only the gobies actively removed algal fronds attached to the cages and only one species (itself toxic to predators) ate them; the damselfish simply defected from the arena when toxic algae were present. The hydrophobic toxins exuded in the algal mucus lysed coral polyps releasing cell constituents that, together with the algal toxin, attract the gobies, which then eat the algal fronds. Interestingly, the toxic goby became more toxic to predators after consumption of the seaweed, which may help to drive symbiosis with a coral colony."
https://openalex.org/W1998225362,"P2X7 receptors are involved not only in physiological functions but also in pathological brain processes. Although an increasing number of findings indicate that altered receptor expression has a causative role in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, little is known about how expression of P2rx7 gene is controlled. Here we reported the first molecular and functional evidence that Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factor plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional regulation of P2X7 receptor. We delimited a minimal region in the murine P2rx7 promoter containing four SP1 sites, two of them being highly conserved in mammals. The functionality of these SP1 sites was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and Sp1 overexpression/down-regulation in neuroblastoma cells. Inhibition of Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation by mithramycin A reduced endogenous P2X7 receptor levels in primary cultures of cortical neurons and astrocytes. Using P2rx7-EGFP transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein under the control of P2rx7 promoter, we found a high correlation between reporter expression and Sp1 levels in the brain, demonstrating that Sp1 is a key element in the transcriptional regulation of P2X7 receptor in the nervous system. Finally, we found that Sp1 mediates P2X7 receptor up-regulation in neuroblastoma cells cultured in the absence of serum, a condition that enhances chromatin accessibility and facilitates the exposure of SP1 binding sites."

https://openalex.org/W2046208072,"Hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that catalyze 2H(+) + 2e(-) ↔ H(2). A multisubunit, bidirectional [NiFe]-hydrogenase has been identified and characterized in a number of bacteria, including cyanobacteria, where it is hypothesized to function as an electron valve, balancing reductant in the cell. In cyanobacteria, this Hox hydrogenase consists of five proteins in two functional moieties: a hydrogenase moiety (HoxYH) with homology to heterodimeric [NiFe]-hydrogenases and a diaphorase moiety (HoxEFU) with homology to NuoEFG of respiratory Complex I, linking NAD(P)H ↔ NAD(P)(+) as a source/sink for electrons. Here, we present an extensive study of Hox hydrogenase in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We identify the presence of HoxEFUYH, HoxFUYH, HoxEFU, HoxFU, and HoxYH subcomplexes as well as association of the immature, unprocessed large subunit (HoxH) with other Hox subunits and unidentified factors, providing a basis for understanding Hox maturation and assembly. The analysis of mutants containing individual and combined hox gene deletions in a common parental strain reveals apparent alterations in subunit abundance and highlights an essential role for HoxF and HoxU in complex/subcomplex association. In addition, analysis of individual and combined hox mutant phenotypes in a single strain background provides a clear view of the function of each subunit in hydrogenase activity and presents evidence that its physiological function is more complicated than previously reported, with no outward defects apparent in growth or photosynthesis under various growth conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2003773675,"The topology of the second extracellular loop (ECL2) and its interaction with ligands is unique in each G protein-coupled receptor. When the orthosteric ligand pocket located in the transmembrane (TM) domain is occupied, ligand-specific conformational changes occur in the ECL2. In more than 90% of G protein-coupled receptors, ECL2 is tethered to the third TM helix via a disulfide bond. Therefore, understanding the extent to which the TM domain and ECL2 conformations are coupled is useful. To investigate this, we examined conformational changes in ECL2 of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) by introducing mutations in distant sites that alter the activation state equilibrium of the AT1R. Differential accessibility of reporter cysteines introduced at four conformation-sensitive sites in ECL2 of these mutants was measured. Binding of the agonist angiotensin II (AngII) and inverse agonist losartan in wild-type AT1R changed the accessibility of reporter cysteines, and the pattern was consistent with ligand-specific ""lid"" conformations of ECL2. Without agonist stimulation, the ECL2 in the gain of function mutant N111G assumed a lid conformation similar to AngII-bound wild-type AT1R. In the presence of inverse agonists, the conformation of ECL2 in the N111G mutant was similar to the inactive state of wild-type AT1R. In contrast, AngII did not induce a lid conformation in ECL2 in the loss of function D281A mutant, which is consistent with the reduced AngII binding affinity in this mutant. However, a lid conformation was induced by [Sar(1),Gln(2),Ile(8)] AngII, a specific analog that binds to the D281A mutant with better affinity than AngII. These results provide evidence for the emerging paradigm of domain coupling facilitated by long range interactions at distant sites on the same receptor."

In humans, the YchF homologue hOla1 appears to influence cell proliferation and was found to be up-regulated in many tumors. A possible involvement in regulating the oxidative stress response was also suggested, but details on the underlying mechanism are lacking. For gaining insight into YchF function, we used Escherichia coli as a model organism and found that YchF overexpression resulted in H2O2 hypersensitivity. This was not caused by transcriptional or translational down-regulation of H2O2-scavenging enzymes. Instead, we observed YchF-dependent inhibition of catalase activity and a direct interaction with the major E. coli catalase KatG. KatG inhibition was dependent on the ATPase activity of YchF and was regulated by post-translational modifications, most likely including an H2O2-dependent dephosphorylation. We furthermore showed that YchF expression is repressed by the transcription factor OxyR and further post-translationally modified in response to H2O2. In summary, our data show that YchF functions as a novel negative regulator of the oxidative stress response in E. coli. Considering the available data on hOla1, YchF/Ola1 most likely execute similar functions in bacteria and humans, and their up-regulation inhibits the ability of the cells to scavenge damaging reactive oxygen species.

https://openalex.org/W1963633267,"Human C-reactive protein (CRP) protects mice from lethal Streptococcus pneumoniae infection when injected into mice within the range of 6 h before to 2 h after the administration of pneumococci. Because CRP binds to phosphocholine-containing substances and subsequently activates the complement system, it has been proposed that the antipneumococcal function of CRP requires the binding of CRP to phosphocholine moieties present in pneumococcal cell wall C-polysaccharide. To test this proposal experimentally, in this study, we utilized a new CRP mutant incapable of binding to phosphocholine. Based on the structure of CRP-phosphocholine complexes, which showed that Phe66, Thr76, and Glu81 formed the phosphocholine-binding pocket, we constructed a CRP mutant F66A/T76Y/E81A in which the pocket was blocked by substituting Tyr for Thr76. When compared with wild-type CRP, mutant CRP bound more avidly to phosphoethanolamine and could be purified by affinity chromatography using phosphoethanolamine-conjugated Sepharose. Mutant CRP did not bind to phosphocholine, C-polysaccharide, or pneumococci. Mutant CRP was free in the mouse serum, and its rate of clearance in vivo was not faster than that of wild-type CRP. When either 25 μg or 150 μg of CRP was administered into mice, unlike wild-type CRP, mutant CRP did not protect mice from lethal pneumococcal infection. Mice injected with mutant CRP had higher mortality rates than mice that received wild-type CRP. Decreased survival was due to the increased bacteremia in mice treated with mutant CRP.

https://openalex.org/W2062322913,"Sexual selection is driven by competition for mates, and the advantage of a competitor is determined by the number of offspring it produces. Early experiments by Angus Bateman characterized this interaction, and the quantitative relationship between a male's number of mates and number of offspring is known as the Bateman slope. Sexual dimorphism, one of the most obvious results of sexual selection, largely requires a positive Bateman relationship, and the slope provides an estimate of the potential for sexual selection. However, natural selection from the environment can also influence male success, as can random effects, and some have argued for inclusion of the latter in calculations of mate success. Data from pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) reveal the presence of a positive Bateman slope in each year of a 10-year study. We found no evidence that random effects skewed male mating success; however, substantial yearly variation in the Bateman slope due to predation on fawns was evident. These results support the validity of the Bateman relationship, yet they also demonstrate that environmental or extrinsic influences can limit the potential for sexual selection."

Here, we questioned whether and how physiologically and pathophysiologically relevant changes in surface N-glycosylation modified hERG channel function. Voltage-dependent hERG channel gating and activity were evaluated as expressed in a set of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines under conditions of full glycosylation, no sialylation, no complex N-glycans, and following enzymatic deglycosylation of surface N-glycans. For each condition of reduced glycosylation, hERG channel steady-state activation and inactivation relationships were shifted linearly by significant depolarizing ∼9 and ∼18 mV, respectively. The hERG window current increased significantly by 50-150%, and the peak shifted by a depolarizing ∼10 mV. There was no significant change in maximum hERG current density. Deglycosylated channels were significantly more active (20-80%) than glycosylated controls during phases 2 and 3 of action potential clamp protocols. Simulations of hERG current and ventricular action potentials corroborated experimental data and predicted reduced sialylation leads to a 50-70-ms decrease in action potential duration. The data describe a novel mechanism by which hERG channel gating is modulated through physiologically and pathophysiologically relevant changes in N-glycosylation; reduced channel sialylation increases hERG channel activity during the action potential, thereby increasing the rate of action potential repolarization."
