https://openalex.org/W2003838379,"After a decade of dramatic population fluctuations, protected populations of wolves and moose in Isle Royale National Park in Lake Superior returned in 1983 to the levels observed in the 1950's. Inherent lags in this predator-prey system and the strong recovery of the moose population following a wolf population crash suggest that these populations may continue to cycle with a period length of about 38 (95 percent confidence interval, +/-13) years. Such a long-term cycle is consistent with the proposal that period length of herbivore population cycles will characteristically scale according to the fourth root of body mass, a basic allometric relation linking physiological cycles to population processes."
https://openalex.org/W2153487134,"Laboratory experiments showed that predation by both trophically specialized and generalized nudibranch species triggers rapid induction of defensive spines in the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea. Spines effectively control the pattern and extent of intracolony mortality caused by nudibranch predation. Previously found only in plants, rotifers, and cladocerans, consumer-induced defenses may be widespread among clone-forming or colonial taxa exposed to nonfatal encounters with predators."
https://openalex.org/W2016476801,"Manipulations of early arriving, fast-growing algal stands, which appeared soon after a severe storm denuded a Southern California marine reef habiatat, indicated that the dense cover protected newly settled kelp plants from excessive damage by grazing fishes. This is an example of refuge facilitation in primary succession after a major natural disturbance, a mechanism that may contribute substantially to the regeneration of a kelp forest."

https://openalex.org/W2042811947,"Evidence of in situ metal (iron and manganese) deposition onto bacteria associated with rapidly sinking particles in the open ocean is reported. Below 100 meters, bacteria are found with extracellular capsules containing metal precipitates; the frequency of these capsules increases with depth. The capsular metal deposits appear to contribute a major portion of the weakly bound fraction of the particulate iron flux."

https://openalex.org/W2043877394,"The Bishop Tuff of eastern California is the type example of a high-silica rhyolite that, according to Hildreth, supposedly evolved by liquid-state differentiation. New analyses establish that the Bishop Tuff ""early/late"" rare earth element trend reported by Hildreth mimics the relations between groundmass glasses and whole rocks for allanite-bearing pumice. Differences in elemental concentrations between whole rock and groundmass are the result of phenocryst precipitation; thus the data of Hildreth are precisely those expected to result from crystal fractionation."
https://openalex.org/W2093449406,"Eight recognized or theorized paleoceanographic events during the past 70 million years were tested against changes in the global deep-sea benthic ostracode fauna. Two events, the sudden Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary event at 66 million years ago and the more gradual 40-million-year event (formation of the psychrosphere), show up most dramatically. Before the 40-million-year event, ostracodes freely radiated into the deeper water regions but were provincial. The development of thermal stratification isolated these deep-water taxa, mostly the survivors of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary event, which adapted to a new, free-flowing but more frigid ecosystem and spread rapidly throughout the world."
https://openalex.org/W2043754065,"Computer vision, the automatic construction of scene descriptions from image input data, has just entered its second decade. Approaches have varied widely, especially in the amounts of symbolic, domain-dependent knowledge and inference that are incorporated into the vision process. Much current research addresses the extraction of physical properties of the scene (depth, surface orientation, reflectance) from images by using only a few general assumptions about the scene domain. Extraction of physical parameters is part of a hierarchy of operations needed to transform image input data to symbolic descriptions. Two other processes that serve as examples are stereo fusion and the partitioning of image phenomena into related groups. Computer vision research is influencing theories of animal perception as well as the design of computing architectures for artificial intelligence."
https://openalex.org/W2147522102,Radiocarbon activity was negatively correlated (P</=.01) with a sunspot-auroral index during 25 designated solar activity periods from 129 B.C. to A.D. 1964. Change in carbon-14 activity during these periods was inverse to change in solar activity in 22 of 24 instances (P</=.001). Contamination from carbon-14 formed during previous solar cycles mnay lessen the value of carbon-14 as a climate or solar index.

https://openalex.org/W2040439803,A continuous seismic profile across the Blake Outer Ridge reveals clear evidence of a structural origin for the ridge. A ridge core separates distinctive regions of structure east and west of the crest and does not support a theory of depositional origin. The presence of horizon A continuously beneath the ridge rules out faulting or folding involving basement rocks. Gravity tectonics are suggested as the mechanism for formation of the ridge after the deposition of the sediments above horizon A.
https://openalex.org/W2089512459,"Command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) for nuclear forces are essential elements in the deterrence of nuclear war. The present C3I system has vulnerabilities associated with its reliability, survivability, and endurance under attack, thereby weakening deterrence by increasing the ambiguity in our capabilities. Development of a reliable and enduring C3I system would reduce this ambiguity. Its reliable, positive control of nuclear forces would give the national leadership more time to assess situations, ensure discriminate retaliation, and improve our ability to manage crises in general. These capabilities could help to stop a war rapidly should one start. A reliable and enduring C3I system will be needed for a long time to come, even if a freeze on strategic nuclear forces is accomplished or other arms control successes achieved. Indeed, C3I may be the best source today of confidence-building measures to reduce tensions and the threat of nuclear catastrophe."

https://openalex.org/W1992821827,"(1) Metals dissolve enough in milk to supply the requirements for rapid regeneration of hemoglobin in rat and man. (2) Copper alone is effective but less so than when accompanied by other metals, especially iron. (2) Much less mortality occurs among rats fed on metallized milk than when salts of the metals are used in anemia tests. (4) These metals produce no odor, color, taste or other observed change in milk with the quantities used unless they are exposed to air and milk."

https://openalex.org/W116833955,"A 5% cut in fusion research budgets will force some programs to be dropped in order to keep the large machinery running unless US and European scientists collaborate instead of competing. Legislators became uneasy about the escalating costs of the new devices. The 1984 budget of $470 million for magnetic fusion research is only half the projected cost of the Tokomak Fusion Core Experiment (TFCX) planned to ignite, for the first time, a self-sustaining burn. Planning for the TCFX continued despite the message from Congress. Work at the large institutions at Princeton, MIT, etc. may survive at the expense of other programs, some of which will lose academic programs as well. Scientists point to the loss of new ideas and approaches when projects are cancelled. Enthusiasm is growing for international collaboration."
