The activity of mPGES was increased markedly in macrophages and osteoblasts following proinflammatory stimuli. cDNA for mouse and rat mPGESs encoded functional proteins that showed high homology with the human ortholog (microsomal glutathioneS-transferase-like 1). mPGES expression was markedly induced by proinflammatory stimuli in various tissues and cells and was down-regulated by dexamethasone, accompanied by changes in COX-2 expression and delayed PGE2 generation. Arg110, a residue well conserved in the microsomal GSHS-transferase family, was essential for catalytic function. mPGES was functionally coupled with COX-2 in marked preference to COX-1, particularly when the supply of arachidonic acid was limited. Increased supply of arachidonic acid by explosive activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 allowed mPGES to be coupled with COX-1. mPGES colocalized with both COX isozymes in the perinuclear envelope. Moreover, cells stably cotransfected with COX-2 and mPGES grew faster, were highly aggregated, and exhibited aberrant morphology. Thus, COX-2 and mPGES are essential components for delayed PGE2 biosynthesis, which may be linked to inflammation, fever, osteogenesis, and even cancer.

The preference of COX-2 over COX-1 in the delayed response is explained, at least in part, by the ability of COX-2 to metabolize lower levels of AA to PGH2 than those required for COX-1-directed catalysis (2Murakami M.

When cells are first treated with proinflammatory stimuli and subsequently exposed to Ca2+ mobilizers, the inducible COX-2 can also promote the immediate response (priming or induced immediate response) (7Naraba H. Murakami M. Matsumoto H. Shimbara S. Ueno A. Kudo I. Oh-ishi S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2974-2982PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chen Q.-R. Miyaura C. Higashi S. Murakami M. Kudo I. Saito S. Hiraide T.

Understanding COX-2-dependent biological responses has received much attention in the past few years, because numerous pharmacological, biological and genetic studies have suggested that this inducible COX isozyme is involved in various human diseases, including inflammation and cancer (10Smith W.L.

Indeed, among the several PGs produced by macrophages, only the level of PGE2 was increased during the delayed response (7Naraba H. Murakami M. Matsumoto H. Shimbara S. Ueno A. Kudo I. Oh-ishi S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2974-2982PubMed Google Scholar, 25Fournier T. Fadok V. Henson P.M. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 230: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vivo studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors reduce PGE2 more profoundly than other PGs (17Harada Y. Hatanaka K.

Thus, the COX-2-dependent pathway may be more selectively linked to the terminal PGE2 synthase (PGES). More importantly, several recent studies have suggested that PGES activity is increased during the period when COX-2-dependent delayed PGE2 generation is ongoing (7Naraba H. Murakami M. Matsumoto H. Shimbara S. Ueno A. Kudo I. Oh-ishi S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2974-2982PubMed Google Scholar, 26Matsumoto H. Naraba H. Murakami M. Kudo I. Yamaki K. Ueno A. Oh-ishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). In most cases the enzyme requires glutathione (GSH) for catalytic activity (27Watanabe K. Kurihara K. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Ogorochi T. Ujihara M. Narumiya S. J.

A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify PGES isoforms, we have succeeded in identification of the GSH-dependent cytosolic PGES (cPGES/p23), as shown in an accompanying paper (31Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32775-32782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). However, this enzyme is constitutively expressed in a wide variety of cells and tissues and shows preferential functional coupling with COX-1. The linkage between the three constitutive enzymes of the biosynthetic cascade (i.e. cPLA2, COX-1, and cPGES/p23) implies that this pathway is crucial for the production of the PGE2 required for maintenance of tissue homeostasis. In view of the fact that PGE2 is often produced via the COX-2-dependent pathway (1Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we looked for another PGES that is induced by proinflammatory stimuli and shows selective coupling with COX-2. While this study was under way, Jakobsson et al. (30Jakobsson P.-J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) reported that human microsomal GST-like 1 (MGST-L1), a member of the MAPEG (membrane-associated proteins involved in eicosanoid and GSH metabolism) superfamily (32Jakobsson P.-J. Morgenstern R. Mancini J. Ford-Hunchinton A. Persson B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), exhibits significant PGES activity. Moreover, the expression of this enzyme has been shown to increase after stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1 in A549 cells (30Jakobsson P.-J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that MGST-L1 is identical to the membrane-associated PGES (mPGES), which we have originally detected in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages (7Naraba H. Murakami M. Matsumoto H. Shimbara S. Ueno A. Kudo I. Oh-ishi S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2974-2982PubMed Google Scholar). mPGES/MGST-L1 expression is strongly induced in several cells and tissues related to the inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo. Coexpression experiments clearly demonstrate that mPGES/MGST-L1 is preferentially linked with COX-2, promoting delayed and induced immediate PGE2 biosynthesis. Furthermore, sustained expression of both COX-2 and mPGES/MGST-L1 leads to aberrant cell growth. Our results indicate the presence of two segregated PGE2-biosynthetic routes, the cPLA2-COX-1-cPGES/p23 and cPLA2-COX-2-mPGES/MGST-L1 pathways, in the same cell.

To prepare macrophages, 5% (w/v) Bactopeptone in saline (5 ml/100 g of body weight) was injected intraperitoneally into Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and 4% thioglycollate (w/v) solution was injected intraperitoneally into C57BL/6 mice (1 ml/20 g body weight). The peritoneal exudate cells of rats and mice were collected on day 4 by washing the cavity with ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution. The cells were washed twice and plated onto six-well plastic plates (Corning) at a density of 4.5 × 106 cells/well in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) FCS.

Total RNA was extracted from mouse and rat peritoneal macrophages incubated with LPS for 12 h by using TRIzol reagent. The RT reaction was carried out by using the Superscript preamplification system (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (1 μg) was mixed with 1 μl of 50 μg/ml random hexamer oligonucleotides and 200 units of reverse transcriptase in a total volume of 20 μl, and incubated for 50 min at 42 °C. The PCR primers 5′-ATC AAG ATG TAC GTG GTG GC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAG CTG GGC CAG GGT GTA GG-3′ (antisense), designed on the basis of the reported cDNA sequence of human mPGES (MGST-L1) (30Jakobsson P.-J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), were used for PCR amplification. PCR was performed by adding both primers (0.2 μm for each) and an appropriate amount of template DNA to 25 μl of PCR buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.05% W-1) containing 0.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase and 0.2 mm dNTP. The reaction was carried out with 36 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 58 °C, and 45 s of extension at 72 °C using a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The amplified DNA fragments were directly subcloned into the TA cloning vector pGEM and sequenced by an autofluorometric DNA sequencer DSQ-1000L (Shimadzu) using the Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA fragments flanking the 3′-end regions of mouse and rat PGES cDNAs were obtained by the 3′-RACE method. The first strand cDNA from the total RNA isolated from LPS-treated macrophages was synthesized by the RT reaction as follows. After denaturation at 70 °C for 10 min, 1.2 μg of RNA was mixed with 500 nm(dT)17-adaptor primer (5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT AC(dT)17-3′) and 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for 50 min at 42 °C in 20 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 50 mmKCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTP, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). After heating at 70 °C for 15 min, the reaction mixture was further incubated with 2 units of RNase H at 37 °C for 20 min. The materials obtained were used for nested PCR amplification with the adapter primer (5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT AC-3′) and the gene-specific primers for mouse (5′-TGT CAT CAC AGG CCA GAT-3′) or rat (5′-TGT CAT CAC AGG CCA AGT-3′) mPGES. These gene-specific primers were designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence data of the partial cDNA fragments obtained above. 3′-RACE-PCR was performed by 36 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 54 °C, and 45 s of extension at 72 °C. The nested PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM vector and sequenced. 5′-RACE was conducted using the 5′-RACE system version 2.0 (Life Technologies, Inc) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 5′-gene-specific primers used for this RACE were based on the nucleotide sequence data obtained above (5′-TCG ATT AAG GCG TGG GCT-3′ for mouse and 5′-GGA GCG AAT GCG GGG-3′ for rat). Total RNAs (0.5 μg) from LPS-treated mouse and rat macrophages were reverse-transcribed using 5′-gene-specific primers as described above for the 3′-RACE. The first strand products were isolated using a GlassMax DNA isolation spin cartridge (Life Technologies, Inc.). A 10-μl portion of cDNA was heated at 94 °C for 2 min and incubated with 0.4 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase at 37 °C for 10 min in 25 μl of reaction mixture (10 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 25 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm dCTP). The first PCR was carried out using the 5′-gene-specific primers for mouse (5′-TTG TCT CCA TGT CGT TGC-3′) or rat (5′-TCG TCT CCA TGT CGT TGC-3′) mPGES and the anchor primer (5′-CUA CUA CUA CUA GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT ACG GGI IGG GII GGG IIG-3′) under the same amplification condition as for the 3′-RACE. Subsequently, a 1-μl aliquot of the first PCR product was subjected to the second PCR amplification using the upstream 5′-gene-specific primers (5′-ATC TGG CCT GTG ATG ACA-3′ for mouse and 5′-ACT TGG CCT GTG ATG ACA-3′ for rat) and the universal amplification primer (5′-CUA CUA CUA CUA GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT AC-3′). The PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM vector and sequenced. The cDNA encoding the open reading frame of human PGES was amplified by RT-PCR as described above using total RNA obtained from human umbilical vein endothelial cells as a template and the following oligonucleotide primers designed from the human mPGES (MGST-L1) cDNA sequence (30Jakobsson P.-J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar): sense, 5′-ATG CCT GCC CAC AGC CTG-3′; and antisense, 5′-TCA CAG GTG GCG GGC CGC-3′. To obtain the C-terminally FLAG-epitope-tagged human mPGES cDNA, PCR was conducted using the sense primer (see above) and the antisense primer 5′-TCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTC CAG GTG GCG GGC CGC TTC-3′ (the underlined sequence corresponds to the FLAG epitope). The amplified product was subcloned into pCR3.1 and sequenced. Site-specific mutations were introduced by mismatched primer PCR reactions with Advantage cDNA polymerase mix using human mPGES cDNA as a template, as described previously (34Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In order to obtain the R110S mutant, a product obtained from the PCR using the mutated sense primer 5′-CTC GTG GGCAGT GTG GCA CAC-3′, in which Arg110 was replaced by Ser at the underlined site, and the C terminus antisense primer that was tagged with the FLAG epitope (underlined) 5′-TCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTC CAG GTG GCG GGC CGC T-3′ (C-FLAG primer) was mixed with another product obtained from the PCR using the N terminus sense primer 5′-ATG CCT GCC CAC AGC CTG-3′ (N-primer) and the mutated antisense primer 5′-GTG TGC CAC ACT GCC CAC GAG-3′. After annealing, the second PCR was carried out using the N-primer and C-FLAG primer. The mutants R70S (Arg70 replaced by Ser) and Y117F (Tyr117replaced by Phe) were prepared by using the same strategy. The sequences of the m"

Our results demonstrate that random hexamer rather than 3′ ORF-specific priming of cDNA probe synthesis is required for accurate measurement of gene expression levels in bacteria. This is explained by the fact that the currently available set of 4,290 unique 3′ ORF-specific primers do not hybridize to each ORF with equal efficiency and by the fact that widely differing degradation rates (steady-state levels) are observed for the 25-base pair region of each message complementary to each ORF-specific primer. To evaluate the DNA microarray data reported here, we used a linear analysis of variance (ANOVA) model appropriate for our experimental design. These statistical methods allowed us to identify and appropriately correct for experimental variables that affect the reproducibility and accuracy of DNA microarray measurements and allowed us to determine the statistical significance of gene expression differences between our IHF+ and IHF− strains. Our results demonstrate that small differences in gene expression levels can be accurately measured and that the significance of differential gene expression measurements cannot be assessed simply by the magnitude of the fold difference.

Monod J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1961; 25: 193-209Crossref Google Scholar) on the regulation of the genes of thelac operon of Escherichia coli established the basic paradigm for protein-mediated regulation of gene expression. Since then, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of scores of operons in this organism have been elucidated. However, although a great deal has been learned about the regulation of individual operons, much less is known about the global regulatory mechanisms that coordinate the expression of these operons with one another and with the nutritional and environmental growth state of the cell. Much of what is known about global gene regulation has been inferred from the analysis of O'Farrell two-dimensional electrophoresis gels for the resolution of individual proteins expressed in cells grown under two experimental conditions. The heat shock- and starvation-induced proteins, for example, were originally identified by this method (2VanBogelen R.A. Abshire K.Z. Pertsemlidis A. Clark R.L. Neidhardt F.C. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R.I. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 2067-2117Google Scholar). However, the identification of each of the cellular proteins on these gels is a laborious task, and the estimation of the level of expression of each protein in the cell is not easily quantified. In fact, the expression of only about 250 proteins so far have been characterized by this method. Classical genetic and biochemical studies have also identified global regulatory proteins that respond to small molecule co-regulators to affect the expression of large sets of genes. These proteins, such as catabolic repressor protein and leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp), modulate the expression of stimulons that encompass several regulons, each of which may contain multiple operons of common function (3Neidhardt F.C. Savageau M.A. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R.I. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1310-1324Google Scholar). Stimulons are generally regulated by nutritional (e.g.glucose starvation) or environmental (e.g. heat shock) signals. For example, it is well known that catabolic repressor protein and its co-activator, cyclic-AMP, are required for the induction of carbon utilization operons under glucose starvation conditions (4Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another class of global regulatory proteins, which include members such as H-NS and integration host factor (IHF),1 are DNA architectural proteins involved in the condensation of the bacterial nucleoid. They are abundant proteins that bind to many sequence-specific but degenerate DNA sites and affect processes that require DNA duplex destabilization such as DNA replication, recombination, and transcription (5Ditto M.D. Roberts D. Weisberg R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Oberto J. Drlica K. Rouviere-Yaniv J.

McClure W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4993-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These proteins also affect the expression of many genes (operons), but unlike the global regulators of the previous class, they do not respond to small molecule metabolic co-regulators and there is no obvious metabolic coherence among the genes whose expression they affect. IHF was initially identified as the product of a gene required for the site-specific integrative recombination of phage λ into the E. coli chromosome (11Miller H.I. Friedman D.I. Cell. 1980; 20: 711-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it has been discovered that IHF affects many cell functions including a variety of site-specific recombination events and DNA replication (12Friedman D.I. Cell. 1988; 55: 545-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that IHF influences the expression levels of many genes. For example, Freundlich et al. (13Freundlich M. Ramani N. Mathew E. Sirko A. Tsui P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2557-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) used O'Farrell two-dimensional electrophoresis gels to demonstrate a difference in the levels of 15–20% of the proteins expressed in IHF mutant and isogenic parent cells grown under conditions comparable with those reported here. The mechanistic role for IHF in these processes has been largely ascribed to its ability to bend DNA to bring distant sites on the bacterial chromosome together for a biological function. In the case of phage λ, IHF facilitates the integration reaction by bringing distant integrase binding sites into the proximity of the bacterial and phage attachment sites (14Moitoso D.V. Kim S. Landy A. Science. 1989; 244: 1457-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). IHF has also been shown to function as a DNA looper protein to facilitate interactions between regulatory proteins bound at upstream sites and RNA polymerase at downstream promoter sites (15Claverie-Martin F. Magasanik B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 996-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Hoover T.R. Santero E. Porter S. Kustu S. Cell. 1990; 63: 11-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Because these functions involve IHF binding to site-specific high affinity sites and because of the high intracellular concentration of this abundant chromosomal organizer protein, these IHF sites are likely saturated under all physiological conditions (17Yang S.W. Nash H.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6292-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike other regulatory proteins that bind small molecule effectors that affect their DNA binding properties, IHF functions as an architectural component of DNA structures that affect the constitutive or basal level expression of many promoters. This may explain the lack of any obvious metabolic coherence among the genes whose expression are affected by IHF (12Friedman D.I. Cell. 1988; 55: 545-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that IHF can also inhibit the transition of supercoiling-induced DNA duplex destabilized (SIDD) sites from a B-form to a partially denatured duplex structure (18Parekh B.S. Sheridan S.D. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20258-20264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Sheridan S.D. Benham C.J. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8169-8174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This results in the translocation of the superhelical energy (negative twist) normally absorbed by the SIDD site to another site in a superhelically constrained DNA domain (19Sheridan S.D. Benham C.J. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21298-21308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Sheridan S.D. Benham C.J. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8169-8174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the case of theilvGMEDA operon, required for the biosynthesis of the branched chain amino acids in E. coli, IHF-mediated translocation of superhelical energy from an upstream SIDD site results in a destabilization of the DNA duplex in the −10 region of the downstream ilvPG promoter. This supercoiling-dependent, IHF-mediated duplex destabilization in the promoter region facilitates open complex formation and an increase in transcription into the structural genes of this operon (21Parekh B.S. Hatfield G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is known that the global superhelical density of the chromosome varies over a wide range during different phases of the bacterial growth cycle and in response to various types of environmental assaults such as osmotic, temperature, and anaerobic shocks and nutritional upshifts and downshifts. Our previously published results suggest that the effect of IHF on the expression of the genes of the ilvGMEDA operon is to amplify basal level expression of this operon (independently of operon-specific controls) in response to small changes in the global superhelical density of the bacterial chromosome in order to coordinate the capacity for branched chain amino acid biosynthesis with the environmental and nutritional growth conditions of the cell. To determine if this represents a general control mechanism for coordinating the expression of other genes (operons) will require knowledge of the location and thermodynamic stability of each of the SIDD sites on the E. coli chromosome at different physiological superhelical densities encountered under different growth conditions. This information together with the location of each of the high affinity IHF sites and the effects of IHF on global gene expression profiles under these same conditions should facilitate an assessment of the generality of this mechanism. Indeed, calculations to identify the location and thermodynamic stability of all of the SIDD sites on the E. coli chromosome at the global chromosomal superhelical densities observed in stationary phase and aerobically and anaerobically cultured cells growing in glucose minimal MOPS medium are currently in progress (22Benham C.J. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 375-381PubMed Google Scholar). 2C. J. Benham, personal communication. We are also currently developing genomic SELEX methods to isolate in vivocross-linked IHF-chromosomal DNA fragments for hybridization to DNA arrays containing probes for all of the E. coli inter-ORF (upstream regulatory) regions to identify each of the IHF-binding sites. 3J. M. Calvo and G. W. Hatfield, unpublished results. In this report we describe the use of nylon membranes spotted in duplicate with full-length polymerase chain reaction-generated products of each of the 4,290 predicted E. coli K12 ORFs to measure the gene expression profiles in otherwise isogenic IHF+ and IHF− strains growing in glucose minimal MOPS medium. To evaluate the data generated by these gene expression profiling experiments we used a linear analysis of variance model appropriate for the experimental design employed in this study. These statistical methods allowed us to identify and minimize experimental variables that affect the reproducibility and accuracy of DNA microarray measurements and to determine the statistical significance of observed differences between expression levels of each ORF in these two genotypes. Together with future knowledge of the location and in vivo occupancy of IHF at its high affinity chromosomal binding sites and the location and stability of the SIDD sites around the E. colichromosome in wild-type and IHF− strains grown under different environmental and nutritional conditions, these data will allow us to assess the generality of global gene regulation by IHF-mediated translocation of superhelical energy from one site on the chromosome to another. Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, RNase free DNase I, and Sephadex G-25 Quickspin columns were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Ribonuclease inhibitor III was purchased from Panvera/Takara, ultra pure deoxynucleoside triphosphates were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, random hexamer oligonucleotides were from New England Biolabs, and [α33P]dCTP (2–3000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. DNA filter arrays (Panorama E. coli gene arrays) and 3′ ORF-specific oligonucleotides were obtained from Sigma-Genosys Biotechnologies. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. All reagents and baked glassware used in RNA manipulations were treated with diethylpyrocarbonate. The construction of the isogenic E. coli strains IH100 [ilvPG::lacZYA] and IH105 [ilvPG::lacZYA,ΔhimA] used in these experiments have been described (21Parekh B.S. Hatfield G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In both strains the genes of the chromosomallac operon are transcribed from theilvPG promoter, which is activated by the upstream binding of IHF. Cells were grown in 25 ml of MOPS medium (23Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 0.4% glucose in 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks at 37 °C with constant aeration. Total RNA was isolated from cells at an A600 of 0.5–0.6. Five-ml samples of cultures of growing cells were pipetted directly into 5 ml of boiling lysis buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaCl, 8 mm EDTA) and mixed at 100 °C for 2 min. These samples were transferred to 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks, mixed with an equal volume of acid phenol (pH 4.3), and shaken vigorously for 6 min at 64 °C. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh Erlenmeyer flask, and the hot acid phenol extraction procedure was repeated. The second aqueous phase was extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, pH 8) at room temperature and, finally, with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Total RNA was precipitated with two volumes of ethanol in 0.3m sodium acetate (pH 5.3), washed with 70% ethanol, and redissolved in a 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA solution (pH 8.0). The redissolved RNA was treated with DNase I (20 units in a 200-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Mg Cl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 units RNAsin) for 15 min at 37 °C and re-extracted first with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, pH 8) at room temperature and then with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1). To ensure that the total RNA preparation was free of genomic DNA contamination, the DNase I treatment was repeated a second time. After ethanol precipitation, the purified RNA was again washed with 70% ethanol and redissolved in a 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA solution (pH 8.0). The RNA concentration was determined by absorption at 260 nm. Normally, three 5-ml samples from each culture were processed in parallel. For random hexamer-primed cDNA synthesis, 20 μg of total RNA and 37.5 ng of random hexamer primers were heated at 70 °C for 3 min and quick-cooled on ice. cDNA synthesis was performed at 42 °C for 3 h in a 60-μl reaction mixture containing the RNA and primer mixture, reverse transcriptase buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm each dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 50 μCi [α33P]dCTP, 20 units of ribonuclease inhibitor III, and 4 μl (88 units) of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Labeled cDNA was separated from unincorporated nucleotides on Sephadex G-25 spin columns. ORF-specific oligonucleotide primed cDNA synthesis was performed in the same way except that 2 μg of total RNA was mixed with 8 μl of ORF-specific primers and unlabeled nucleotides, heated at 90 °C for 2 min, and slow-cooled to 42 °C. After the addition of ribonuclease inhibitor III, avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and [α33P]dCTP, the reaction mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 3 h. Approximately 50% incorporation of labeled nucleotides usually was achieved with both protocols. The nylon filters were soaked in 2× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA for 10 min and prehybridized in 10 ml of hybridization solution (5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 2% SDS, 1× Denhardt's solution containing 0.1 mg/ml sheared herring sperm DNA) for 1 h at 65 °C. 2–3 × 107 cpm of cDNA probe in 500 μl of the same solution was heated at 90–95 °C for 10 min, rapidly cooled on ice, and added to 5.5 ml of hybridization solution. The prehybridization solution was removed and replaced with the hybridization solution. Hybridization was carried out for 15 to 18 h at 65 °C. Following hybridization, each filter was rinsed with 50 ml of 0.5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA containing 0.2% SDS at room temperature for 3 min, followed by three washes in the same solution at 65 °C for 20 min each. The filters were partially air-dried, wrapped in Saran Wrap, and exposed to a phosphor screen for 48–60 h. Filters were stripped by microwaving at half-maximal power in 500 ml of 10 mm Tris solution (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1% SDS for 20 min. Stripped filters were wrapped in Saran Wrap and stored in the presence of damp paper towels in sealed plastic bags at 4 °C. Cells were harvested at anA600 nm of 0.5 to 0.6 and disrupted by sonication in an appropriate buffer. Assays for cystathionase (metC), α,β-dihydroxyacid dehydrase (ilvD), β-galactosidase (lacZ), glutamine synthetase (glnA), and imidazolylacetolphosphate:l-glutamate aminotransferase (hisC) were performed as described (18Parekh B.S.

Chem. 1967; 242: 1168-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were performed under conditions where they were linear with respect to both extract concentration and time. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217317) Google Scholar). The experimental regimen for the four duplicate experiments reported here is diagrammed in Fig.1. In Experiment 1, Filters 1 and 2 were hybridized with 33P-labeled, random hexamer generated cDNA fragments complementary to each of three RNA preparations (IH100 RNA1–3) obtained from the cells of three individual cultures of strain IH100 (IHF+). These three 33P-labeled cDNA preparations were pooled before the hybridizations. Following PhosphorImager analysis, these filters were stripped and hybridized with pooled, 33P-labeled cDNA fragments complementary to each of three RNA preparations (IH105 RNA1–3) obtained from strain IH105 (IHF−). In Experiment 2, these same filters were again stripped, and this protocol was repeated with33P-labeled cDNA fragments complementary to another set of three pooled RNA preparations obtained from strains IH100 (IH100 RNA 4–6) and IH105 (IH105 RNA 4–6) as described above. Another set of filters (Filter 3 and Filter 4) was used for Experiments 3 and 4 as described for Experiments 1 and 2. This protocol results in duplicate filter data for four experiments performed with the cDNA probes complementary to four independently prepared sets of RNA. Thus, since each filter contains duplicate spots for each ORF and duplicate filters are hybridized for each experiment, four measurements for each ORF were obtained from each of four experiments. A commercial software package obtained from Research Imaging Inc. (DNA ArrayVision) was used to grid the phosphorimaging image, to record the pixel density of each of the 18,432 addresses on each filter, and to perform the background subtraction. 8,580 of the addresses on each filter are spotted with duplicate copies of each of the 4,290 E. coli ORFs. The remaining 9,852 empty addresses were used for background measurements. Since the backgrounds were quite constant, a global average background measurement was subtracted from each experimental measurement, although local background calculations were possible. Greater than four logs of linearity for the phosphorimaging-derived data was observed. The experimental design employed in this study consisted of four independent 33P-labeled cDNA preparations for each of two genotypes separately hybridized to two filter pairs, with each filter containing every E. coli ORF spotted in duplicate. This design is depicted in Fig. 1. For each spot, a background-subtracted estimate of expression level was obtained and scaled to total counts on the membrane. For any given spot, a number greater than zero (indicating an expression level) or a zero (indicating an expression level lower than background) was obtained. A full statistical model describing this design would be both complex and over-parameterized with respect to the number of expression measures for any given ORF. For these reasons and because we are only interested in testing for differences between genotypes, we opted for a reduced model. This model consists of t tests, which assume that filters are not involved in two-way statistical interactions. Thet test evaluates the difference between the means of two groups employing the variance within groups as an error term. The result is that large differences between groups for any given ORF would tend to be declared non-significant if the expression level of that ORF were unreplicable within experimental treatments. Conversely, small differences in expression could be determined to be statistically significant for a given ORF if expression levels for that ORF were replicable within treatments. In short, the test statistic employed here was constructed by scaling the difference in gene expression levels between genotypes relative to the observed variances within genotypes. p values based on this test statistic range from 1.0 for gene expression levels, with identical values to very smallp values for expression level differences that are highly significant. A comprehensive discussion of the use of the ttest and the modifications applicable to the analysis of DNA microarray data of the type presented here is available at the Genomics at the University of California, Irvine web site. To identify possible sources of experimental error we also used the t test to determine statistical differences among different filters hybridized with the same RNA preparation of the same genotype as well as differences among different RNA preparations of the same genotype hybridized to the same filters. Since these comparisons only involve factors that we expect to be highly replicable, an excess of hybridization signals showing significant differences in gene expression levels would indicate an experimental artifact. Depending on the magnitude of these artifacts, the detection of significant differences between genotypes requires replication over the variables (filters and RNA preparations) that lead to these false positives. The data presented here demonstrate that no experimental artifacts are contributed by filter differences and that experimental artifacts due to differences in RNA preparations of the same genotype can be eliminated by averaging over as few as four independent RNA preparations. All of the raw and processed data for the experimental results reported here may be downloaded in tabular format through the online version of this paper. 4The supplemental figure shows complete gene expression data for E. coli K12 strains IH100 (IHF+) and IH105 (IHF−). The values in each column are: column 1, gene name; columns 2–5, average of the duplicate gene measurements for each filter hybridized with cDNA pools from strain IH100 for experiments 1–4, respectively; columns 6–9, average of the duplicate gene measurements for each filter hybridized with cDNA pools from strain IH105 for experiments 1–4, respectively; column 10, number of non-zero IH100 measurements for Experiments 1–4; column 11, number of non-zero IH105 measurements for Experiments 1–4;column 12, average of the values in columns 2–5;column 13, average of the values in columns 6–9;column 14, the S.D. of the mean for the IH100 values for Experiments 1–4 (columns 2–5); column 15, the S.D. of the mean for the IH105 values for Experiments 1–4 (columns 6–9);column 16, the value of the t test statistic;column 17, the degrees of freedom associated with thet test; column 18, the ratio of the variances of the IH100 and IH105 measurements; column 19, thep values associated with the differences between the IH100 and IH105 measurements based on the t test distribution;column 20, the ratios of the means of the IH100 and IH105 data, a negative sign implies decreased expression in strain IH105. These data may be viewed and downloaded from the on-line journal (http://www.jbc.org). Since less than 10% of the total RNA in anE. coli cell is mRNA, it was feared that cDNA preparation by random hexamer priming of total RNA for hybridization to DNA microarrays might produce unacceptable backgrounds. We, therefore, used a set of 4,290 unique 25-base pair oligonucleotide primers specific for the 3′ end of each E. coli ORF (available from Sigma-Genosys) for primer-directed synthesis of α33P-labeled cDNA probes. However, filter hybridizations with these cDNA probes detected only 1,760 genes, with at least 2 out of 4 or greater non-zero, background-subtracted measurements on the control (IH100) filters. Equally disturbing, it was often observed that although some genes of a given operon were detected, others were not. For example, hybridization signals above background were detected for only three of the five genes of theilvGMEDA operon and two of the three genes for theilvPG::lacZYA operon. We, therefore, turned to the use of random hexamers for primer-directed synthesis of α-33P-labeled cDNA probes. Filter hybridization with these cDNA probes detected the expression of 2,592 genes with at least 2 out of 4 non-zero, background-subtracted measurements for each of the control (IH100) and experimental (IH105) data"
https://openalex.org/W1981198757,"The anti-tuberculosis drug ethionamide (ETH), which is a structural analog of isoniazid (INH), is known to strongly inhibit mycolic acid synthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although several targets have been identified for INH, only speculative information is available concerning ETH. Mutations within the promoter and the coding region of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) were found to confer resistance to both drugs, thus leading to the impression that INH and ETH may share a common mode of action. However, a notable distinction between the two drugs lies in the lack of cross-resistance in clinical isolates. This may be attributed in part to the fact that the pro-drug INH must be activated via KatG, and no activation step for ETH has yet been described. Here we report the identification of an activator for ETH. The ETH activator (Rv3854c), which we have termed EthA, was found to be homologous to various monooxygenases and induced ETH sensitivity when overexpressed in mycobacteria. Interestingly, the neighboring open reading frame (Rv3855), which was found homologous to transcriptional repressors of the tetRfamily, led to ETH resistance when overexpressed. In addition, chromosomal inactivation of this gene by transposition led to ETH hypersensitivity. These data strongly suggest that Rv3855, which we have termed EthR, regulates the production of EthA, which subsequently activates the pro-drug ETH. This study opens up new avenues of research relating to ETH activation in mycobacteria, possibly leading to an improved efficacy of ETH and to the generation of new anti-mycobacterial agents.

Chaisson R.E. Int. J. Tuberc. Lung Dis. 1999; 3: 457-465PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular composition and structural features of the mycobacterial cell envelope are thought to confer low permeability and thereby a basal resistance to most hydrophilic drugs (2Liu J. Barry C.E.I. Nikaido H. Ratledge C. Dale J. Mycobacteria: Molecular Biology and Virulence. Blackwell Science Inc, Malden, MA1999Google Scholar). As a consequence, the lack of potency and protracted duration of drug administration are a major cause of rampant mutational drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis(3Espinal, M. (1999) WHO/Tuberculosis/260Google Scholar). An essential step in developing novel therapies for the treatment of M. tuberculosis infections is to determine why multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis are resistant to many existing anti-mycobacterial agents. Possible mechanisms of resistance include: alteration of the target enzyme that has become resistant to antibiotics; increased expression of the gene encoding the target enzyme; mutations causing impermeability of the mycobacterial cell to the antibiotic; and/or alterations of an activation mechanism. Thus, the urgent need to develop new therapies for treating M. tuberculosis infections requires the definition of the failures of existing treatments and the discovery of new drug targets. The bacterial cell wall has been an effective target for many drugs (4Winder F. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria. Vol. 1, Physiology, Identification and Classification. Academic Press, London1982: 353-438Google Scholar). Many anti-tuberculosis agents, including ethambutol, cycloserine, isoniazid (INH),1 ethionamide (ETH), thiocarlide, and the thiosemicarbazones are known to inhibit cell wall biosynthesis. INH (see Fig. 1), which is one of the most efficient and the most widely used anti-tuberculosis drugs, has been the subject of intensive research during the past decade (5Heym B. Saint-Joanis B. Cole S.T. Tubercle Lung Dis. 1999; 79: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Barry III, C.E. Slayden R.A. Mdluli K.

BothM. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG are extremely susceptible to INH (minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 0.02–0.2 μg/ml), and earlier evidence suggested that INH specifically inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids in M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG (8Winder F.G. Collins P.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1970; 63: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 9Takayama K. Wang L. David H.L. Antimicrob.

ETH (see Fig.1), a structural analog of INH, is a useful second line anti-tuberculosis drug. The two drugs have almost identical effects in that both strongly inhibit the synthesis of mycolic acids (12Winder F.G. Collins P.B. Whelan D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1971; 66: 379-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Quemard A. Laneelle G. Lacave C. Antimicrob.

Delisle G. Jacobs W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a single mutation in theinhA gene (NADH-specific, 2-trans-enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase) confers resistance to INH and ETH, leading to the impression that the mode of action of both drugs is identical. In addition, mutations within katG, encoding a catalase-peroxidase led to the majority of INH-resistant isolates (6Barry III, C.E. Slayden R.A. Mdluli K. Drug Resistance Updates. 1998; 1: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), demonstrating that INH is a pro-drug and that an activated metabolite is responsible for its mode of action (15Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B. Young D. Cole S. Nature. 1992; 358: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 16Lei B. Wei C.J. Tu S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2520-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the notable distinction between the actions of ETH and INH resides in the lack of cross-resistance (4Winder F. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria. Vol. 1, Physiology, Identification and Classification. Academic Press, London1982: 353-438Google Scholar, 17Fattorini L. Iona E. Ricci M.L. Thoresen O.F. Orru G. Oggioni M.R. Tortoli E. Piersimoni C. Chiaradonna P. Tronci M. Pozzi G. Orefici G. Microb. Drug Resist. 1999; 5: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The majority of strains resistant to ETH are sensitive to INH, whereas some strains resistant to INH show slightly increased sensitivity to ETH (18Rist N. Adv. Tuberc. Res. 1960; 10: 69-126Google Scholar). Thus, there are subtle discrepancies between biochemical and genetic information on the modes of sensitivity and resistance in the cases of INH and ETH. Because INH requires activation via KatG, it is tempting to postulate an activation process for ETH. Inactivation of such an ETH-specific process could account for the lack of cross-resistance between the two drugs. Interestingly, ETH undergoes oxidation by rat liver microsomes to generate a highly reactive S-oxide, possibly a sulfinate (Fig.1) that exhibits greater activityin vitro against M. tuberculosis than ETH itself (19Johnsson K. King D.S. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5009-5010Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 20Ruse M.J. Waring R.H. Biochem. Soc.

These observations, in addition to the fact that genetic alterations in katG do not confer resistance to ETH, have led us to the hypothesis that ETH needs to be activated through a KatG-independent mechanism. In this report, we describe the cloning and characterization of the gene Rv3855, which we now term ethR, that confers resistance to ETH, but not to INH when it is overexpressed in eitherMycobacterium smegmatis, M. bovis BCG, orM. tuberculosis on a multycopy vector. Furthermore, a transposon mutant of ethR leads to ETH hypersensitivity inM. bovis BCG. In addition, genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that ethR encodes a transcriptional regulator that is not directly implicated in mycolic acid biosynthesis but plays an important role in the regulation of a second open reading frame (ORF), which is responsible for the activation of ETH. Analysis of the locus surrounding ethR revealed the presence of an adjacent gene now termed ethA, which encodes a putative monooxygenase, the predicted activator of ETH. Overexpression of ethA led to hypersensitivity to ETH in mycobacteria. Thus, the data presented are compatible with the notion that EthR represses ethA, which encodes the equivalent protein of KatG implicated in the activation of ETH. M. smegmatis mc2155, M. bovis BCG 1173P2 (WHO, Stockholm, Sweden), and M. tuberculosis H37Ra and their transformants were grown on 7H11 agar supplemented with oleic-albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Difco, Detroit, MI) or on Sauton medium (22Sauton M.B. C R Acad Sci Paris. 1912; 155: 860-861Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.001‰ ZnSO4 and 0.25‰ Triton WR1339 (Sigma). M. smegmatismc2155 is an electroporation-efficient mutant of mc26 (23Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). M. smegmatis, M. bovisBCG, and M. tuberculosis were transformed as described previously (24Wards B.J. Collins D.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 145: 101-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Large scale cultures of mycobacteria were grown to mid-log phase (M. bovis BCG, 10–14 days; M. smegmatis mc2155, 36 h; M. tuberculosis H37Ra, 12–16 days), harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stored at −20 °C until further use.Escherichia coli strains XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), NK5587, and their transformants were grown in Luria-Bertoni (LB) broth (Life Technologies, Inc.) and agar medium. E. coliSH305 was grown in 2YT (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% glucose. All strains were incubated at 37 °C. Antibiotics (Sigma) were added to media at the following concentrations: kanamycin at 20 μg/ml, tetracycline at 10 μg/ml, chloramphenicol at 100 μg/ml, and ampicillin at 100 μg/ml. The E. coli-mycobacterial shuttle vector pMV261 containing thehsp60 promoter was used as described previously (26Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bennet L.T. Bansal G.P. Young J.F. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F. Snapper S.B. Barletta R.G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Bloom B.R. Nature. 1991; 351: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany), and Vent DNA polymerase was purchased from New England BioLabs. All DNA manipulations were performed using standard protocols, as described by Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A genomic library of M. tuberculosisH37Rv, constructed by cloning 35- to 40-kb Sau3AI fragments of chromosomal DNA into the shuttle cosmid pYUB18 (27Jacobs Jr., W.R. Kalpana G.V. Cirillo J.D. Pascopella L. Snapper S. Udani R.A. Jones W. Barletta R.G. Bloom B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 537-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), was the source of cosmid pETH80 conferring ETH resistance to M. smegmatis. The minimal region of pETH80 involved in ETH resistance was identified by γδ transposition in E. coli as described by Guyer (28Guyer M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 126: 347-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, a suitable E. coli donor strain NK5587 (F′lacY::Tn9) was transformed with pETH80. One isolated transformant was subsequently conjugated with E. coli SH305 (recA1srl::Tn10) with selection for kanamycin-resistant/tetracycline-resistant exconjugants. Plasmid DNA was extracted from 50 double resistant exconjugants, retransformed intoM. smegmatis, and scored for their ETHRphenotype. Tn1000 (γδ) insertions were localized by restriction mapping and sequencing using primers near the end of γδ (primer γδ1: 5′-CAACGAATTATCTCCTT-3′; primer γδ2: 5′-TCAATAAGTTATACCAT-3′). Rv3855 was cloned into the mycobacterial overexpression vector pMV261 as follows. PCR amplification was performed using the upstream primer 142: 5′-CCACCTCCGCGGCCAGTCAGG-3′ and the downstream primer 141: 5′-TTTGGCACTGAGAATTCACCGAGCACCC-3′, which contains anEcoRI restriction site (underlined). The 690-bp PCR product was digested with EcoRI and cloned intoMluNI/EcoRI-restricted pMV261, giving rise to pMV261-ethR, where ethR is fused in-frame with the ATG initiation codon of hsp60. A similar strategy was used to construct the pMV261-based expression vector for Rv3854c. Rv3854c was amplified by PCR using the upstream primer 150: 5′-AGCACCTCGACGTTGTCATC-3′ and the downstream primer 149: 5′-ACGGATCCCCGCAAGAGCACCA-3′, which contains aBamHI restriction site (underlined). The 1624-bp fragment was digested by BamHI and cloned intoMluNI/BamHI-restricted pMV261, generating pMV261-ethA. The coding sequences of all amplified genes were verified by DNA sequencing after their cloning in pMV261. M. smegmatis mc2155, M. bovis BCG, andM. tuberculosis were grown to mid-log phase (A 600 ∼0.3). ETH or INH were added at various concentrations followed by further incubation for 4 h (forM. smegmatis) or 24 h (for M. bovis BCG andM. tuberculosis). At this point, 1,2-[14C]acetate (1 μCi/ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and the cultures were further incubated with gentle agitation at 37 °C for 4 h (for M. smegmatis) or 24 h (for M. bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis). The resulting 14C-labeled cells from ETH- or INH-treated cultures were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended into 3 ml of 15% tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH), and saponified at 100 °C for 15 h. After cooling, dichloromethane (4 ml), water (2 ml), and iodomethane (300 μl) were added, and the entire reaction mixture was agitated for 30 min. After centrifugation, the upper, aqueous phase was discarded and the lower, organic phase was washed twice with water, dried in a sand bath, and extracted twice with diethyl ether (3 ml) and the etheral extracts were dried and resuspended into 500 μl of dichloromethane for radioactivity counting. Equal volumes of this extract, which is composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and mycolic acid methyl esters (MAMEs), were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel (Merck 5735 Silica Gel 60 F254, Darmstadt, Germany) and developed once in petroleum ether:acetone (95:5, v/v). Subsequent autoradiography revealed 14C-labeled fatty acid and mycolic acid methyl esters after overnight exposure of the TLC plates to Kodak BioMax MR film. Genomic DNA (200–500 ng) of the mutagenized clones was digested with RsaI (New England BioLabs). After heat inactivation of the restriction enzyme at 65 °C for 20 min, the digested DNA (40–100 ng) was ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England BioLabs) at room temperature. PCR reactions were carried out in a total volume of 25 μl containing Amplitaq PCR buffer (Perkin-Elmer), 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.25 μm dNTPs, 0.4 μm 84L-F (5′-GTCATCCGGCTCATCACCAG-3′), and 0.4 μm 84L-R (5′-AACTGGCGCAGTTCCTCTGG-3′) primers, 4–10 ng of template DNA, and 0.5 unit of Amplitaq Gold (Perkin-Elmer). Thermal cycling was performed in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 machine with an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 90 s, and a final extension of 72 °C for 7 min. The chromosomal region involved in ETH resistance was sought using drug resistance imparted via gene overexpression by a plasmid vector, as a selection tool. A genomic library of DNA fromM. tuberculosis H37Rv was screened using the ETHS (MIC of 15 μg/ml) M. smegmatis host strain mc2155 for clones that exhibited an ETHRphenotype. Electrotransformants were plated in duplicate on medium containing kanamycin with ETH at 80 μg/ml. Colonies were scored as ETHR if growth appeared on plates after 4 days of incubation at 37 °C. Single ETHR colonies were re-streaked onto duplicate 7H10/oleic-albumin-dextrose-catalase plates containing kanamycin and INH (5 μg/ml). Specific ETHRclones were selected that grew in the presence of ETH but remained fully sensitive to INH. The cosmids, which confer ETHR, were recovered from the M. smegmatis transformants by electroduction into E. coli (29Baulard A. Jourdan C. Mercenier A. Locht C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Following analysis, all clones were found to contain the same cosmid (pETH80), which corresponded to a minimum of two chromosomal regions, probably associated during the packaging process (data not shown). The minimal region required for ETH resistance in M. smegmatiswas determined by transposon mutagenesis of pETH80. The method, adapted from Guyer et al. (28Guyer M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 126: 347-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) is based on the transposition inE. coli of γδ during F-mediated conjugal mobilization. Briefly, the mutagenesis technique is based upon the observation that conjugal transmission of pBR322 by the conjugative plasmid F is dependent on, or at least completely correlated with, the transposition of γδ from F to pBR322 (28Guyer M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 126: 347-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The transposition of γδ has also proved efficient on plasmids other than pBR322 (30de Lencastre H. Chak K.F. Piggot P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 3203-3210PubMed Google Scholar). The cosmid pETH80 identified in this study is an E. coli-mycobacterial shuttle vector based on ColE1 origin of replication. Thus, the mapping process of the minimal region of pETH80 responsible for ETHR in mycobacteria was achieved in two steps. First, mutagenesis of pETH80 inE. coli before the re-introduction of the derivatized DNA into mycobacteria allowed the analysis of insertion mutations. Of the 50 clones analyzed, 38 γδ insertions were located in the inserted portion of pETH80. Three γδ insertions were able to abolish ETHR in M. smegmatis. Restriction analysis of these clones revealed that these γδ insertions were located within 0.6 kb of DNA. Sequencing of the regions located left and right of γδ (with primers γδ1 and γδ2) revealed that all three insertions disrupted the same ORF annotated Rv3855 in theM. tuberculosis H37Rv genome data base, which was thus termed ethR. To avoid possible interference of other ORFs of pETH80 in association with ETHR, the coding region ofethR was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame withhsp60 into pMV261. The resultant plasmid pMV261-ethR was transformed into M. smegmatis,M. bovis BCG, and M. tuberculosis, and the MICs of the transformed bacteria were compared with those of untransformed strains and with those of strains containing the original pETH80. The MICs were determined by plating serial dilutions onto medium containing kanamycin plus 0–200 μg/ml ETH in increments of 10 μg/ml or 0–10 μg/ml INH in increments of 1 μg/ml. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of ETH that inhibited the growth of 99% of the bacteria. Table Isummarizes the results obtained, suggesting a direct correlation between the level of expression of ethR and ETH resistance. All three mycobacterial species transformed with pMV261-ethRremained sensitive to INH, thus demonstrating that overexpression ofethR specifically induces ETH resistance. In parallel, susceptibility assays with isoxyl, thiolactomycin, erythromycin, crystal violet, and streptomycin indicated that resistance was specific for ETH.Table IMICs (μg/ml) of ETH for mycobacteria harbouring ethR, ethA, or ethR KOpMV261pETH80pMV261-ethRpMV261-ethAethR::hygM. smegmatis 1-aStrain mc2155.1580250<1NT1-bNT, not tested.M. bovisBCG1-cStrain Paris 1173P2, except incolumn 5.22535NT<0.61-dStrain NCTC 5692.M. tuberculosis 1-eStrain H37Ra.12030NTNT1-a Strain mc2155.1-b NT, not tested.1-c Strain Paris 1173P2, except incolumn 5.1-d Strain NCTC 5692.1-e Strain H37Ra. Open table in a new tab Untransformed and pMV261-ethR-transformedM. bovis BCG were grown in the presence or absence of ETH at various concentrations, after which cultures were labeled with 1,2-[14C]acetate. Combined MAMEs and FAMEs were extracted, resolved, and fractionated on TLC plates. UntransformedM. bovis BCG exhibited a clear decrease in the incorporation of radioactivity into MAMEs in the presence of ETH (from 0 to 100 μg/ml) (Fig. 2). Examination of the individual classes of mycolates revealed that the production of all species was specifically inhibited. In addition, the production of a yet to be described and identified product, possibly a mycolate-specific fatty acid precursor, was progressively inhibited after treatment with ETH (and with INH) (Fig.3). The characterization of this product may be crucial for the identification of the specific target for ETH, but has been hampered by its relatively low abundance in the mycobacterial cell wall. In contrast, treatment of M. bovis BCG (pMV261-ethR) with ETH (0–100 μg/ml) had no dramatic effect on the synthesis of MAMEs and FAMEs (Fig. 2). Possible mechanisms related to ETH resistance may include detoxification of the drug or repression of an activation process of ETH leading to its active metabolite, conceivably an S-oxide type derivative (19Johnsson K. King D.S. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5009-5010Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The latter seemed an attractive scenario, because EthR is homologous to bacterial regulatory proteins of the TetR family (see Fig. 4 B). Many of the proteins of the TetR family are repressors. As for EthR (23.725 kDa), they all have similar molecular masses, from 21 to 25 kDa. The most conserved region between EthR and the TetR family members is characterized by a helix-turn-helix motif located in the N-terminal third of the protein. As illustrated in Fig. 4 A, the signature pattern (PS01081) starts four residues before the helix-turn-helix motif and ends six residues after the motif.Figure 3Effect of INH and ETH on fatty acid and mycolic acid synthesis. The samples are FAMEs and MAMEs fromM. bovis BCG + ETH 40 μg/ml (lane 1), M. bovis BCG + INH 10 μg/ml (lane 2), and M. bovis BCG (lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Locus Rv3854c andRv3855 of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. A, the tetR family members are characterized by a helix-turn-helix motif located in the initial third of the protein. The signature pattern is a conserved domain, which starts four residues before the helix-turn-helix motif and ends six residues after the motif. With the exception of Pro41, theRv3855 (ethR) region from Pro41 to Val71, fits the “Prosite” signature PDOC00830 (tetR), strongly suggesting that Rv3855(ethR) is a transcriptional regulator. B, thetetR consensus as determined at the Sanger center is named PF00440. A few members of the family have been chosen, and their PF00440 domain were aligned with Rv3855 (ethR). A more detailed and exhaustive alignment is available from Sanger on the Web. C, Rv3854c (ethA) belongs to a large and diverse family of monooxygenases. The region homologous to monooxygenases is located in the N-terminal part of the protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mutagenesis of M. bovis BCG NCTC 5692 was performed as described previously using the mycobacteriophage mini-transposon delivery system pJSC84 (31Bardarov S.

A clone with a transposon insertion between nucleotides 4,327,971 and 4,327,972 in the M. bovis BCG genome was identified (Fig. 5). The insertion disrupted ethR between nucleotide positions 426 and 427, leading to the production of a truncated polypeptide of 142 amino acids (instead of 648 for the normal protein). The M. bovis BCGethR::hyg strain was found to be extremely sensitive to ETH, with an MIC < 0.6 μg/ml (see TableI). The MIC for INH remained identical for M. bovis BCG andM. bovis BCG ethR::hyg, confirming that ethR was specific for ETH resistance. The isolated M. bovis BCGethR::hyg clone was grown in the presence or absence of ETH and examined for the relative inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis. Concentrations as low as 2.5 μg/ml ETH completely abolished mycolic acid synthesis in comparison to 50 μg/ml for the wild-type M. bovis BCG strain (Fig.6). This supported our hypothesis thatethR is involved in the repression of the formation of the active metabolite of ETH. Interestingly, in the absence of ETH, the FAME and MAME profiles of the mutant were unaffected, confirming the notion that ethR is not directly implicated in mycolic acid synthesis, but may rather be related to ETH activation. It is not unusual to find a gene under the control of a transcriptional regulator encoded by the neighboring ORF. The intergenic region located between Rv3854c andRv3855 (ethR) is 76 bp long, and the two genes are transcribed in opposite directions. This situation is consistent with the presence of divergent promoters in this region (32Beck C.F. Warren R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 318-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For some regions of divergent transcription described so far, one transcript determines a regulatory molecule and the other determines a non-regulatory polypeptide. The regulatory molecule may act within the divergent transcript unit to control transcription of the non-regulatory polypeptides; often it also regulates its own synthesis (32Beck C.F. Warren R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 318-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rv3854c, the adjacent ORF toethR, is homologous to various monooxygenases (Fig.4 C). Thus, Rv3854c could be a candidate to play a role equivalent to eukaryotic monooxygenases in the generation of active metabolites of ETH, notably S-oxides (20Ruse M.J. Waring R.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 233SCrossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 21Chieli E. Malvaldi G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 395-396Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, Rv3854c was overexpressed in M. smegmatis (pMV261-ethA) and the recombinant strain was examined for ETH sensitivity. As anticipated, M. smegmatis(pMV261-ethA) was hypersensitive to ETH (Table I), and a dramatic inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis was observed at very low concentrations of ETH in comparison to wild-type M. smegmatis (Fig. 7). These results strongly suggest that Rv3854c, which we have now termedethA, plays a role equivalent to katG for INH, but in relation to ETH. INH and ETH are specific anti-tuberculosis drugs, which inhibit mycolic acid synthesis through InhA as suggested by resistance to both ETH and INH of an inhA mutant (14Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quemard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. Delisle G. Jacobs W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Moreover, by the use of microarray hybridization, Wilson and coworkers (33Wilson M. DeRisi J. Kristensen H.H. Imboden P. Rane S. Brown P.O. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12833-12838Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that ETH treatment of M. tuberculosis induced the same genes that were induced by INH. However, Fattorini and coworkers (17Fattorini L. Iona E. Ricci M.L. Thoresen O.F. Orru G. Oggioni M.R. Tortoli E. Piersimoni C. Chiaradonna P. Tronci M. Pozzi G. Orefici G. Microb. Drug Resist. 1999; 5: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) recently reported that of 46 INH-resistant strains ofM. tuberculosis isolated from Italian patients only two were also ETH-resistant. Before INH exerts its lethal effect it must be converted to an active form, possibly an isonicotinic acyl anion (34Shoeb H.A. Bowman Jr., B.U. Ottolenghi A.C. Merola A.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or an isonicotinic acyl radical (35Johnson K. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7425-7426Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar) produced by the catalase-peroxidase KatG. ETH and other thioamides are sulfur-containing compounds, which are known to be substrates for oxidative catalysts, such as flavin-containing monooxygenases and cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases. An NADPH-dependent oxidation of ETH has previously been demonstrated in rat microsomes (20Ruse M.J. Waring R.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 233SCrossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). More recently, Johnsson et al. (34Shoeb H.A. Bowman Jr., B.U. Ottolenghi A.C. Merola A.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) suggested thatin vitro oxidation of ETH produces electrophilic intermediates (S-oxides) capable of undergoing addition reactions to nucleophilic protein side chains (35Johnson K. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7425-7426Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). During the 1950s ETH and, subsequently, prothionamide were introduced in the treatment of tuberculosis and were deemed clinically as effective as dapsone in the treatment of leprosy (36Rollier R. Rollier M.-T. Maroc Med. 1972; 52: 148-166PubMed Google Scholar). However, 25% of the patients suffered from various gastrointestinal symptoms and sometimes jaundice, especially when ETH was combined with rifampicin (37Waters M.F.R. Ratledge C. Stanford J. Grange J.M. The Biology of the Mycobacteria. Clinical Aspects of Mycobacterial Disease. 3. Academic Press, New York1989: 405-474Google Scholar). The hepatotoxicity induced by administration of ETH and thionicotinamide was decreased by preadministration of methimazole. Preadministration of methimazole was also shown to decrease the levels of excretion of thionicotinamide S-oxide, indicating that thioamideS-oxidation, mediated by the flavin-containing monooxygenases, may be linked to the initiation of hepatotoxicity induced by these thioamides (38Ruse M.J. Waring R.H. Toxicol. Lett. 1991; 58: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we describe evidence that ETH is activated by the monooxygenase homolog Rv3854c (EthA). EthA would then be the equivalent of KatG for INH. Thus, in a similar fashion by which mutations inkatG abolish INH sensitivity without leading to ETH resistance, we would expect that mutations in ethA lead to ETH resistance without affecting INH sensitivity. Studies are currently in progress examining clinical isolates for point mutations withinethA. Overexpression of ethA led to a dramatic increase in ETH sensitivity of M. smegmatis and clearly indicated that only a small proportion of ETH is activated when mycobacterial cells are grown under laboratory conditions. Alternatively, when administered to humans, ETH may be activated by either eukaryotic oxidative processes as mentioned earlier or by EthA (or perhaps a combination of both). Thus, determining the respective contribution of the bacterial and the eukaryotic activation of thioamides to their ultimate necrogenic forms would be crucial to understand the impact of EthA on the efficacy of ETH in vivoand to help designing new improved versions of ETH. ETH resistance may also be mediated by the overproduction of the putative repressor EthR. As a regulator, it is logical to assume that the production of EthR is also regulated, perhaps by signals external to the bacteria. Thus, any agent able to block EthR, or any physiological condition down-regulating ethR may favor the production of EthA and lead to the activation of substantial amounts of ETH, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the bacilli to ETH. Overexpression of ethA dramatically decreased the MIC ofM. smegmatis for ETH to a level comparable to the MIC ofM. tuberculosis (see Table I). This suggests that in part the innate relative resistance to ETH of M. smegmatis is associated with a low production of EthA and thus, indirectly, with EthR. Perhaps this mechanism may also account for the various susceptibility profiles to ETH displayed by other mycobacterial species. Interestingly, although synthesis of α and α′ mycolates is insensitive to ETH in M. smegmatis overexpressingethR, synthesis of epoxymycolates remained highly sensitive to the drug in this strain (data not shown). Thus, possible additional targets to InhA exist in relation to ETH and epoxymycolate synthesis, which has been previously shown to be highly sensitive to ETH (13Quemard A. Laneelle G. Lacave C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 1316-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that EthA and EthR orthologs are also present in M. avium and M. leprae. The EthARloci of M. avium and M. tuberculosis share a very similar architecture. In both cases, the two genes are oriented “head to head” and are separated by a putative 76-bp divergent promoter. In contrast, the two M. leprae orthologs are not located in the same locus. The initiation codons of the M. leprae EthA andEthR are found in the genome in positions 86,698 and 1,235,214, respectively. The genome of M. leprae seems to be reduced to a minimal pool of genes essential to the survival of this strictly intracellular pathogen. In contrast to many genes ofM. leprae, EthA and EthR are apparently not truncated and are highly similar to their orthologs inM. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis. Altogether, these observations suggest that these genes have an important rolein vivo. In addition, the M. tuberculosis genome possibly encodes more than 30 monooxygenases, and the relative role of each enzyme in the oxidation of ETH remains to be assessed in vivo. The understanding of the mode of action of ETH is valuable for the design of improved versions of the drug, for the elaboration of potentiating agents, and for the understanding of drug resistance. Finally, an intriguing question, which awaits further experimentation, concerns the possibility of an equivalent mechanism of regulation ofkatG and INH resistance.

Here we determined the relative avidities of unlabeled hyaluronan preparations for cell surface CD44 by their ability to block the binding of fluorescein-conjugated hyaluronan to a variety of cells. We show that hyaluronan binding at the cell surface is a complex interplay of multivalent binding events affected by the size of the multivalent hyaluronan ligand, the quantity and density of cell surface CD44, and the activation state of CD44 as determined by cell-specific factors and/or treatment with CD44-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb). Using low M(r) hyaluronan oligomers of defined sizes, we observed monovalent binding between 6 and 18 sugars. At approximately 20 to approximately 38 sugars, there was an increase in avidity (approximately 3x), suggesting that divalent binding was occurring. In the presence of the inducing mAb IRAWB14, monovalent binding avidity was similar to that of noninduced CD44, but beginning at approximately 20 residues, there was a dramatic and progressive increase in avidity with increasing oligomer size ( approximately 22 < 26 < 30 < 34 < 38 sugars). Kinetic studies of binding and dissociation of fluorescein-conjugated hyaluronan indicated that inducing mAb treatment had little effect on the binding kinetics, but dissociation from the cell surface was greatly delayed by inducing mAb."

We show that, in F9 cells and in transfected COS-1 cells, the nuclear retinoid receptors, retinoic acid receptor γ2 (RARγ2), RARα1, and retinoid X receptor α1 (RXRα1) are degraded in a retinoic acid-dependent manner through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The degradation of RARγ2 is entirely dependent on its phosphorylation and on its heterodimerization with liganded RXRα1. In contrast, RARα1 degradation can occur in the absence of heterodimerization, whereas it is inhibited by phosphorylation, and heterodimerization reverses that inhibition. RXRα1 degradation is also modulated by heterodimerization. Thus, each partner of RARγ/RXRα and RARα/RXRα heterodimers modulates the degradation of the other. We conclude that the ligand-dependent degradation of RARs and RXRs by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is regulated by heterodimerization and by phosphorylation, could be important for the regulation of the magnitude and duration of the effects of retinoid signals.

There are three RAR isotypes (α, β, and γ) and three RXR isotypes (α, β, and γ) encoded by distinct genes, and for each isotype there are at least two main isoforms, which differ in their amino-terminal region (1Chambon P.

The F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells provide an interesting cell-autonomous model system for the analysis of retinoid signalingin vivo, since upon RA treatment and depending on culture conditions, they differentiate into three distinct cell types resembling the primitive, parietal, and visceral extraembryonic cells (17Strickland S.

This F9 EC cell RA-induced differentiation is also accompanied by the induction of expression of a number of genes (8Taneja R. Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.L. Penna L. Gaub M.P. Chambon P.

Thus, one of the key issues for understanding the regulation of cell differentiation and gene expression by retinoid receptors is how the duration and magnitude of their activity in response to RA can be controlled. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the major system in eukaryotic cells for selective degradation of short lived regulatory proteins and transcription factors (25Pickart C.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 26Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A common feature of proteasome-mediated protein degradation is the covalent attachment of ubiquitin, a highly conserved 8.6-kDa protein, to lysine residues of proteins targeted for degradation, followed by the formation of polyubiquitin chains attached covalently to the targeted protein. Ubiquitinated proteins are recognized and degraded by the multisubunit protease complex, the 26 S proteasome (Refs. 27Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar and 28Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M.

Several members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily have been reported to interact with some of the enzymes involved in ubiquitination (29McKenna N.J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J.

Since certain nuclear hormone receptors have been shown recently to be degraded in a ligand-dependent manner through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (30Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L.

A. 2000; 97: 1032-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), we addressed the question of whether liganded RARs are degraded through this same pathway. We report here that, in F9 cells and in transfected COS-1 cells, RARγ2 is degraded in a RA-dependent manner and that this degradation involves the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This degradation requires phosphorylation of the receptor in its N-terminal region and is completely dependent on its heterodimerization with liganded RXR. RARα1 and RXRα1 are also degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway upon ligand binding, but the requirements for their degradation are different from those for RARγ2 degradation. Finally, each partner of RXR/RAR heterodimers was shown to modulate the degradation of the other. These results suggest that the retinoid-induced degradation of RARs and RXRs could play an important role in the control of the activity of RAR/RXR heterodimers.

In addition to the expression vectors (5 μg), all transfections contained Bluescript as a carrier and 1 μg of the β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 to correct for variations in transfection efficiency (37Nagpal S.

After a 16-h incubation with calcium phosphate-precipitated DNA, the cells were washed, maintained for 8 h in the appropriate medium, and incubated for an additional 15 h with ligand. Cells were harvested 40 h after transfection. Whole cell extracts were prepared from F9 cells or transfected COS-1 cells by four cycles of freeze-thaw in 50–200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 0.6 m KCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture and resolved by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, RARs and RXRs were detected by immunoblotting and chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitations, whole cell extracts were incubated with Protein A-Sepharose beads cross-linked with the appropriate antibodies (5Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by immunoblotting and chemiluminescence. RNA was isolated using the guanidinium thiocyanate method, and conditions for semiquantitative RT-PCR were as described (48Bouillet P. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Vicaire S. Garnier J.M. Schuhbaur B.

The RT-PCR oligonucleotides used were as follows: mRARα1, 5′-ATCGAGACCCAGAGCAGCAG-3′ and 5′-AGGCGTCAGCGTGTAGCTCT-3′; mRARγ2, 5′-CAATCGCTGGAGACACAGAG-3′ and 5′-GCTGACCTTGGTGATGAGTT-3′; 36B4, 5′-GAGGTCACTGTGCCAGCTCA-3′ and 5′-GAAGGTGTACTCAGTCTCCA-3′. The RT-PCR blots were probed with cognate 32P-labeled cDNA fragments and analyzed by autoradiography. To investigate whether retinoids decrease mRARγ2 protein levels, transiently transfected COS-1 cells were treated for 15 h with tRA (10−7m) or vehicle. Under these conditions, mRARγ2 is transcriptionally active upon tRA treatment (6Bastien J. Adam-Stitah S. Riedl T. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol.

Aliquots of whole cell extracts normalized for β-galactosidase were analyzed by immunoblotting with a RARγ antibody and revealed substantial mRARγ2 protein, while this receptor was undetectable in control untransfected cells. However, RARγ2 levels were not affected up to 24 h of tRA treatment (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 2). The same observation was made with a RARγ-specific agonist (BMS961), added either alone or in association with a pan-RXR agonist (BMS649) (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4–6) (see Ref. 50Benoit G. Altucci L. Flexor M. Ruchaud S. Lillehaug J. Raffelsberger W. Gronemeyer H. Lanotte M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7011-7018Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar for BMS retinoids). Since RAR/RXR heterodimers are the functional units mediating the retinoid signal in vivo (see Introduction), RARγ2 degradation was studied in transfected COS-1 cells overexpressing both RARγ2 and RXRα (the RXRα1 isoform). Under these conditions, RARγ2 was decreased by 90–95% upon the addition of either tRA or 9cRA (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–3). Surprisingly, on its own, the RARγ-specific agonist (BMS961, at 10−7 or 10−6m) was ineffective (Fig. 1 B, lane 5, and data not shown). Similarly, the RARα,γ antagonist (BMS453) had no effect on RARγ2 levels (Fig. 1 B,lane 6). However, the pan-RXR-specific agonist (BMS649) at 10−8, 10−7, and 10−6m promoted RARγ2 degradation by 40, 80, and 95%, respectively (Fig. 1 B, lane 4, and data not shown). The combination of BMS649 with BMS961, at any concentrations ranging from 10−8 to 10−6m, did not increase further RARγ2 degradation (Fig. 1 B, lane 7, and data not shown). Thus, it appears that RARγ2 degradation is triggered by the ligand of its heterodimeric partner, RXRα. This was confirmed by the observation that a pan-RAR antagonist (BMS493) did not prevent the degradation of RARγ2 induced by BMS649 (Fig.1 B, compare lanes 10 and14). To analyze more critically whether the decrease in RARγ2 protein requires efficient heterodimerization with concomitantly overexpressed RXRα, the mRARγ2 expression vector was cotransfected in COS cells with a vector expressing mRXRα mutated at its heterodimerization surface defined by crystallography (mRXRαD364A/E384A/E399A/Y402A/E406A/R426A/E439A). This mutant (RXRα7m in Fig. 2) still binds its ligand (51Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 52Bourguet W.

In the presence of this RXRα mutant, the levels of RARγ2 did not change upon tRA treatment (Fig.2 A, lanes 3 and 4), confirming that heterodimerization is required for RARγ2 degradation.Figure 3Role of the AF-2 AD core, the A/B region and its phosphorylation on the ligand-induced degradation of RAR γ2 and RAR α1.

Either ALLN, lactacystin (data not shown), or MG132 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7–9) blocked the decrease in RARγ2 protein induced by the BMS961/BMS649 combination, indicating that the disappearance of RARγ2 involves the proteasome pathway. As most protein substrates for the 26 S proteasome are ubiquitinated, we then investigated whether RARγ2 was polyubiquitinated in transfected COS cells. RARγ2 was immunoprecipitated from untreated cells and immunoblotted with ubiquitin antibodies. A ladder of polyubiquitinated forms of RARγ2 could be detected in control cells (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–3). Ubiquitination of RARγ2 was increased in intensity upon tRA, 9cRA, and pan-RXR agonist (BMS649) treatment only when RXRα was coexpressed (Fig.1 C, compare lanes 1–4, and data not shown). Thus, the retinoid-induced degradation of RARγ2 can be correlated to an increase in the ubiquitination of the receptor that is dependent on heterodimerization with RXRα. In most cases, phosphorylation is a positive signal for ubiquitination and targeting of several known substrates to the 26 S proteasome (28Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).

T84 cells treated with IL-4 or IL-13 displayed virtually identical dose- and time-dependent STAT 6 activation as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and decreases in transepithelial resistance (TER). STAT 6 DNA binding activity was maximal in nuclear extracts 30 min after exposure to IL-4 or IL-13, and TER was maximally reduced by 24 h post-treatment. Pretreatment of epithelia with transcription factor decoys (phosphorothioated DNA oligonucleotides containing the STAT 6 binding site) dramatically reduced STAT 6 activation as detected by EMSA, but did not attenuate the TER reduction by IL-4 or IL-13. In contrast, although the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 did not affect IL-4 or IL-13 STAT 6 activation, they significantly inhibited the ability of either cytokine to lower TER. Thus, we provide evidence for PI3K as the major proximal signaling event in IL-4 and IL-13 regulation of TER and speculate that pharmacological targeting of enterocytic PI3K activity may represent a means to manipulate epithelial permeability.

Whether this loss of barrier function is associated with the etiology of disease or acts as a potentiating factor is a point of debate. It has been shown that Crohn's disease is often accompanied by increased local, or circulating, levels of interferon-γ (IFNγ)1 and tumor necrosis factor-α and that IL-4 can be increased in cohorts of patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease (3Inoue S.

Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Although IL-4 and IL-13 signal transduction events are being precisely characterized in immune cells considerably less information is available with specific reference to epithelial cells. Given the ability of IL-4 and IL-13 to directly affect epithelial permeability, the present study was designed to: (a) define STAT 6 kinetics in model intestinal epithelia, primarily the human transformed T84 cell line, and (b) to use a pharmacological approach to explore the intracellular signal transduction pathway events that govern the IL-4- and IL-13-induced increase in epithelial permeability. The data presented here support the conclusions that IL-4 and IL-13 mobilize STAT 6 in similar dose- and time-dependent manners and activate the PI3K signal transduction pathway in T84 cells. Also, our in vitroobservations suggest that the IL-4- and IL-13-induced increase in T84 epithelial permeability occur, at least in part, via a PI3K-dependent mechanism. The transformed human colonic epithelial cell line T84 was cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified eagle medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin, and 1.5% (v/v) HEPES (all obtained from Life Technologies) (8O'Shea J.J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 10Donnelly G.A.E. Lu J. Takeda T. McKay D.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 180: 1590-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). T84 cells were seeded onto 6-cm diameter Petri dishes (3 × 106 cells) or onto 1-cm2 semipermeable culture media-treated filters (106 cells) (Costar, Corning Inc., Cornell, NY) for subsequent nuclear protein extraction or assessment of paracellular permeability, respectively. Additional experiments used the transformed human colonic epithelial cell line HT-29 or the transformed human lung epithelial cell line A549, for analysis of STAT 6 activation only. T84 monolayers were treated with IL-4 or IL-13 (Sigma) at doses of 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml for 30 min, or 100 ng/ml for 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 4 h, 14 h, and 24 h to determine the dose- and time-dependent kinetics of STAT 6 activation. Time-matched controls were cultured in media only. Transcription factor decoys (TFDs) were used to block IL-4 or IL-13 activation of STAT 6 (i.e. binding to nuclear DNA) (11Wang L.H. Yang X.Y. Kirken R.A. Resau J.H. Farrar W.L. Blood. 2000; 95: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Park Y.G. Nesterova M. Agrawal S. Cho-Chung Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1573-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). TFDs are double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides consisting of the same sequence as the STAT 6 probe (or the mutant probe) used for EMSA (see below) that have been phosphorothioated to increase their entrance into cells and render them less susceptible to degradation (12Park Y.G. Nesterova M. Agrawal S. Cho-Chung Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1573-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, TFDs (0.2 μm) were added to semiconfluent T84 cells in OPTI-MEM I-reduced serum medium (Life Technologies) as described (13Bielinska A. Shivdasani R.A. Zhang L. Nabel G.J. Science. 1990; 250: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). 24 h later the cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (3×) to remove non-incorporated TFDs and received standard medium (10% fetal calf serum) for 1 h prior to cytokine stimulation. Subsequently, either a nuclear protein extraction was performed or physiology assessed. (Comparative pilot studies used Lipofectin (Life Technologies) to deliver the TFDs. This approach was no more effective than adding the TFDs alone.) Also, the effects of the specific PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (1 μm) and LY294002 (20 μm) (both Sigma) on IL-4- or IL-13-induced mobilization of STAT 6 were assessed (14Ikizawa K. Kajiwara K. Basaki Y. Koshio T. Yanagihara Y. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 170: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitors were added to Petri dish-grown T84 cells for 10 min prior to cytokine stimulation, then concurrent with either 100 ng/ml IL-4 or IL-13. Nuclear protein extracts were collected 30 min later and snap frozen for subsequent EMSA analysis. Nuclear protein extracts were obtained following the protocol of Andrews and Faller (17Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar), with the addition of the enzyme inhibitors aprotinin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin A (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (20 mg/ml) (18Botelho F.M. Edwards D.R. Richards C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5211-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (all Sigma). Protein concentrations in the nuclear extracts were determined using the Bio-Rad/Bradford assay. EMSAs were conducted using a published protocol (18Botelho F.M. Edwards D.R. Richards C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5211-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of nuclear protein extract in a binding buffer consisting of 250 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8), 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm spermidine, 5% autoclaved dH20, and 25% glycerol was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with ∼105 cpm of [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides bearing the STAT 6 binding sequence as follows: 5′-GATCGCTCTTCTTCCCAGGAACTCAATG-3′, 5′-TCGACATTGAGTTCCTGGGAAGAAGAGC-3′ (synthesized by The Central Facility of the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (MOBIX), McMaster University) (19Ohmori Y. Smith Jr., M.F. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2058-2065PubMed Google Scholar). Two μl of indicator dye (0.25%, w/v, bromphenol blue; 5%, v/v, glycerol) was added to each sample, bringing the sample volumes to 25–30 μl, which were then electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel consisting of 40 acrylamide:1 bisacrylamide, containing 1.25% glycerol, 0.7% ((w/v) ammonium persulfate, 0.05% (v/v) TEMED, and 1.25% Tris borate-EDTA (10 × TBE: 89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8) for 3.5 h at 95 V, then dried and visualized by autoradiography. Specificity controls consisted of non-32P-labeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide as a cold competitor and use of a polyclonal anti-STAT 6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) in EMSA supershifts. In addition to the normal probe, a double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide with a mutation in the STAT 6 binding sequence was also used as a cold competitor prior to exposure of sample to radioactive probe and had the sequences 5′-TTGTGCTCTTCTGCCCAGGCACTCAATGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTTCATTGAGTGCCTGGGCAGAAGAGCACAA-3′ (MOBIX) (19Ohmori Y. Smith Jr., M.F. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2058-2065PubMed Google Scholar). Irrelevant isotype-matched antibodies against STAT 1 or ERK-1/ERK-2 (Santa Cruz) were used as negative controls for the supershifts. Most experiments and EMSA analyses were performed at least three times. Confluent T84 filter-grown monolayers with a transepithelial resistance (TER) > 1000 Ω/cm2 were exposed to 10 ng/ml of either IL-4 or IL-13 for 24-h ± TFDs (0.2 μm), wortmannin (0.1, 1 μm), or LY294002 (10, 20 μm) (15Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 16Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TFDs and inhibitors were added to the cells following the same procedure as that described for the EMSA analysis, with the addition that wortmannin was added every 8 h to the cells due to its reported instability in culture medium at 37 °C (14Ikizawa K. Kajiwara K. Basaki Y. Koshio T. Yanagihara Y. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 170: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cytokine and all reagents were added to the basolateral compartment of the culture well. TER was measured prior to and 24 h after cytokine administration using a voltmeter with chop-stick electrodes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Time-matched controls consisted of naı̈ve T84 monolayers and those treated with drug or vehicle only. TER data are presented as the percentage of pretreatment values ± S.E., wheren = number of individual epithelial preparations. Data were compared by ANOVA followed by post-hoc Newman-Keuls statistical comparisons, where p < 0.05 was set as the level of statistically significant difference. When T84 cells were exposed to 1 ng/ml IL-4 or IL-13, a faint STAT 6 band was discernible on EMSA, whereas STAT 6 DNA binding activity was clearly evident in nuclear extracts from cells treated with 10 or 100 ng/ml of either cytokine (n = 3) (Fig. 1). Time-dependent experiments with 100 ng/ml IL-4 or IL-13 showed STAT 6 was detectable in nuclear extracts 15 min, 30 min (= maximum response), and 1 h post-treatment, was apparent but reduced by 4 and 14 h, and was undetectable at 24 h (n = 2–3) (Fig.2, A and B). STAT 6 identity was confirmed by the ability of a STAT 6-specific, but not an irrelevant isotype-matched antibody, to supershift the suspected band. Specificity of the DNA oligonucleotide probe for STAT 6 was confirmed by the ability of increasing concentrations (50–200×) of non-[α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe, but not the mutated probe sequence, to progressively compete out the suspect band (n = 3) (Fig. 3). (Similarly, nuclear extracts from IL-4- or IL-13-treated cells were not reactive with a STAT 1-specific probe 2P. J. M. Ceponis, F. Botelho, C. D. Richards, and D. M. McKay, personal observation.). In some, but not all, T84 nuclear protein extracts, a faint band on EMSA was detected that migrated slightly faster than the inducible STAT 6 signal (see Fig. 1). This band, when present, occurred in nuclear extractions from non-treated cells and those treated with IL-4 or IL-13. The exact nature of this constitutive STAT 6-like band is unclear (reactive with the anti-STAT 6 antibody and reduced in intensity by competitive binding (Fig. 1)). We speculate that it is a truncated form of STAT 6 analogous to isoforms of STAT 6 that have been identified in mast cells, fibroblasts, and T cells (20Sherman M.A. Secor V.H. Brown M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2703-2708PubMed Google Scholar, 21Patel B.K.R. Pierce J.H. LaRochelle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Yu C.-R. Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Young H.A. Ortaldo J.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 218-227PubMed Google Scholar). IL-4 and IL-13 (10–100 ng/ml, 30-min exposure) were also found to activate STAT 6 in the HT-29 and A549 epithelial cell lines (data not shown).Figure 2EMSA analysis showing that treatment of T84 cells with 100 ng/ml IL-4 (A) or IL-13 (B) results in a time-dependent mobilization of STAT 6, which is maximal at 0.5 h, considerably decreased by 4 and 14 h, and no longer apparent at 24 h after cytokine exposure. Arrowhead, STAT 6. EMSA are representative two or three experiments. Note in B that the faster constitutive STAT 6-like isoform, unlike the IL-4-inducible STAT 6 band, remains largely unchanged over the time course.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Representative EMSA of T84 nuclear protein extracts showing that the inducible band detected following exposure to IL-4 (100 ng/ml, 30 min) is in fact STAT 6. The indicated STAT 6 band (arrowhead) is supershifted by inclusion of an anti-STAT 6 antibody (α-STAT 6) but not an isotype-matched irrelevant antibody. Increasing concentrations of non-32P-labeled probe as a cold competitor prevents detection of STAT 6, whereas a mutant cold competitor (100-fold excess) does not. EMSA also shows that the transcription factor decoys act as a cold competitor, whereas the mutant TFDs do not significantly reduce the IL-4-induced STAT 6 band (n = 3). In this experiment the faster migrating constitutive STAT 6-like band was detected and was reactive with the STAT 6 antibody and the cold competitor. (Identical results were obtained with IL-13 stimulation of T84 cells (data not shown).)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 4 (A andB) illustrates that nuclear extracts from T84 cells pretreated with TFDs (0.2 μm) and then exposed to IL-4 or IL-13 had a significantly reduced STAT 6 signal on EMSA (n = 5 and 3). In contrast, epithelial monolayers treated with TFDs containing a mutation in the STAT 6 recognition sequence and then exposed to IL-4 displayed STAT 6 DNA binding activity on EMSA that was not different from nuclear proteins extracted from T84 cells treated only with cytokine (n = 2; Fig.4 C). Nuclear extracts from T84 cells pretreated for 10 min with wortmannin or LY294002 and then exposed for 30 min to fresh inhibitor with or without IL-4 or IL-13 (100 ng/ml) were examined on EMSA. Consistently, neither wortmannin (n = 3–4; Figs.5 A and 6 A) nor LY294002 (n = 3; Figs. 5 B and 6 B) altered the IL-4- or IL-13-induced mobilization of STAT 6. These experiments were conducted with the highest doses of wortmannin (1 μm) and LY294002 (20 μm) used in the physiological experiments.Figure 6Neither the PI3K inhibitor (A) wortmannin nor (B) LY294002 alter the STAT 6 activity (arrowhead) of nuclear protein extracts from T84 cells treated with IL-13 (30 min) as judged by EMSA (n = 3–4). C, using the same treatment regime, wortmannin (W) and LY294002 (LY) reduce the magnitude of the drop in transepithelial resistance caused by IL-13 over a 24-h period.n = 9–18 T84 monolayers from 3 experiments; mean ± S.E.; *, p < 0.05 compared with control; #,p < 0.05 compared with control and monolayers treated only with IL-4; no inhib., no inhibitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Both IL-4 and IL-13 (10 ng/ml) caused a significant decrease in the TER of filter-grown T84 monolayers, which was consistently reduced to 30–60% of pretreatment values by 24 h post-treatment (n > 24; Figs. 4 D,5 C, 6 C), which is consistent with other investigations with these cytokines (5Madara J.L. Stafford J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with the STAT 6-specific TFDs (or the mutant TFDs as a negative control) did not preserve the TER of cytokine-treated T84 monolayers (n= 8; Fig. 4 D). However, treatment with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 significantly preserved the TER of T84 monolayers treated with IL-4 or IL-13 24 h previously. Fig.5 C shows that both inhibitors of PI-3K activity dose dependently prevented the drop in T84 TER caused by 24-h exposure to IL-4 (n = 6–12). In general, the drug treatments did not completely prevent the drop in TER, which may be a reflection of the pharmacokinetics of the drugs in T84 cells or indicate a role for another intracellular signaling pathway (and we have not unequivocally ruled out STAT 6) in the regulation of epithelial paracellular permeability. Similarly, the IL-13-induced drop in TER was significantly reduced by wortmannin (0.1 μm) and LY294002, which at the higher concentration completely preserved monolayer TER (n = 9–18; Fig.6 C). Exposure to TFDs, wortmannin or LY294002 only, or the vehicle for the inhibitors had no significant affect on T84 TER, and thus only media controls are shown on Figs. 4 D, 5 C, and 6 C. Cytokines directly affect a variety of epithelial functions, including electrolyte transport, barrier function, and mediator synthesis (23McKay D.M. Baird A.W. Gut. 1999; 44: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent studies have begun to explore epithelial intracellular signaling cascades in response to cytokine exposure (24Guo F.H. Uetani K. Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. Dweik R.A. Thunnissen F.B.J.M. Calhoun W. Erzurum S.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,25Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar). Here we used a pharmacological approach to provide evidence for a PI3K-dependent, STAT 6-independent proximal signal transduction pathway in the IL-4 and IL-13 regulation of paracellular permeability in T84 cells, a model gut epithelium. Cell-mediated immunity is typified by IFNγ production (i.e. T helper 1 cell events), and humoral immunity is characterized by IL-4 and IL-10 synthesis (i.e. Th2 events). Investigations with patients with airways inflammation have shown elevated serum levels of Th2-type cytokines and, somewhat unexpectedly, concomitant increases in gut permeability (26Bernard A. Desreumeaux P. Huglo D. Hoorelbeke A. Tonnel A. Wallaert B. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 97: 1173-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Increases in IL-4 mRNA in ileal resections from some patients with Crohn's disease and colonic tissue from cohorts of patients with ulcerative colitis have been shown (3Inoue S. Matsumoto T. Iida M. Mizuno M. Kuroki F. Hosika K. Shimizu M. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1999; 94: 2441-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Desreumaux P. Brandt E. Gambiez L. Emilie D. Geboes K. Klein O. Ectors N. Cortot A. Capron M. Colombel J.-F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 118-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Also, the colitis that develops in mice lacking the α-chain of the T cell receptor is less severe in animals that also lack IL-4, although gut permeability has not been examined in this model (27Mizoguchi A. Mizoguchi E. Bhan A.K. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 320-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro studies have unequivocally shown that cytokines can directly alter epithelial permeability (23McKay D.M. Baird A.W. Gut. 1999; 44: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,28Colgan S.P. Resnick M.B. Parkos C.A. Delp-Archer C. McGuirk D. Bacarra A.E. Weller P.F. Madara J.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2122-2129PubMed Google Scholar): IL-4 and IL-13 often exert similar biological activities and both decrease the barrier function of T84 monolayers (6Zund G. Madara J.L. Dzus A. Awtrey C. Colgan S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7460-7464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Takeda K. Tanaka T. Shi W. Matsumoto M. Minami M. Kashiwamura S.-I. Nakanishi K. Yoshida N. Kisimoto T. Akira S. Nature. 1996; 380: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Consequently, excess IL-4 (or IL-13) in vivo may be important in the regulation of gut permeability and the development and/or progression of inflammatory disease. The IL-4 and IL-13 receptors share a common chain, designated the IL-4Rα chain, and studies with immune cells have revealed that following receptor ligation both cytokines activate the STAT 6 and PI3K pathways (9Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Although cell-specific events have been described, the bulk of the available data indicate that IL-4/STAT 6 events control transcriptional regulation of genes for CD23, major histocompatibility complex II, and IgE as well as facilitating the generation of Th2 cells (29Takeda K. Tanaka T. Shi W. Matsumoto M. Minami M. Kashiwamura S.-I. Nakanishi K. Yoshida N. Kisimoto T. Akira S.

Grosveld G. Paul W.E. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 630-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). The PI3K pathway has been shown to regulate vesicle trafficking and, by inference, cytoskeletal rearrangements (31Corvera S. Czech M.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 442-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), proliferation, and rescue from apoptosis (32Chen R.-H. Chang M.-C. Su Y.-H. Fsai Y.-T. Kuo M.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23013-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The aims of our investigation were to assess if IL-4 and IL-13 activate STAT 6 to the same degree and to determine if IL-4 and IL-13 regulate epithelial permeability via a STAT 6 or a PI3K pathway. Initial studies revealed that IL-4 and IL-13 activation of STAT 6 (as defined by DNA binding activity on EMSA) was time- and dose-dependent and virtually identical for both cytokines. The identity of STAT 6 on EMSA was confirmed by anti-STAT 6 antibody supershifts and competitive binding by a non-radiolabeled STAT 6 DNA oligonucleotide. Although these data fit with the predicted effect of IL-4 and IL-13, they are nevertheless the first demonstration of STAT 6 activation in enteric epithelium. Indeed, it is only recently that STAT signaling has piqued the interest of the epithelial biologist (33Pfeffer L.M. Yang C.H. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. McCormack S.A. Johnston L.R. Am. J. Physiol.

Additionally, a faster migrating constitutive STAT 6-like band was identified on EMSA. This may be a truncated STAT 6 isoform analogous to one of the STAT 6 isoforms (designated STAT 6, 6b, and 6c) that have been identified in a murine mast cell line (20Sherman M.A. Secor V.H. Brown M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2703-2708PubMed Google Scholar), a human lung fibroblast cell line (21Patel B.K.R. Pierce J.H. LaRochelle W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and primary isolates of human blood-derived natural killer and T cells (23McKay D.M. Baird A.W. Gut. 1999; 44: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Currently there are no specific pharmacological inhibitors of STAT 6, with the possible exception of the immunosuppressive drug leflunomide, which was found to block STAT 6 activation in IL-4-treated B cells (37Siemasko K. Chong A.S.-F. Jack H.-M. Gong H. Williams J.W. Finnegan A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1581-1588PubMed Google Scholar). Following the published leflunomide treatment protocol, we were unable to block either IL-4- or IL-13-induced STAT 6 activation in T84 cells or the drop in TER. 3P. J. M. Ceponis, F. Botelho, C. D. Richards, and D. M. McKay, personal observation.These preliminary data may reflect cell-specific effects of leflunomide. Rather, we employed transcription factor decoys (TFDs) to block STAT 6 activation. With this strategy, activated STAT dimers will bind to the TFDs in the cytoplasm, effectively blocking their binding to host cell nuclear DNA (13Bielinska A. Shivdasani R.A. Zhang L. Nabel G.J. Science. 1990; 250: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 38Boccaccio C. Ando M. Tamagnone L. Bardelli A. Michielli P. Battistini C. Comoglio P.M.

Immunopathol. 1998; 86: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A recent report (12Park Y.G. Nesterova M. Agrawal S. Cho-Chung Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1573-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) suggests that TFDs may remain stable in the cytoplasm for up to 48 h. Importantly, TFDs bearing the particular binding element specific for STAT 6 used in our study (i.e. TTC-N4-GAA) have been used to functionally disrupt the IL-4-induced, STAT 6-driven proliferation of CD4+ T cells (11Wang L.H. Yang X.Y. Kirken R.A. Resau J.H. Farrar W.L. Blood. 2000; 95: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of T84 cells with the appropriate TFD, but not a scrambled form of the DNA sequence, significantly blocked the activation of STAT 6 by 100 ng/ml IL-4 or IL-13 as determined by subsequent EMSA. Similarly, the constitutive STAT 6-like band was also reduced by TFD exposure. However, TFD pretreatment did not interfere to any significant extent with the ability of a 10-fold less dose of IL-4 or IL-13 to reduce the TER across T84 monolayers. Thus, we present no data in favor of the involvement of the inducible, or constitutive, form of STAT 6 in the regulation of epithelial paracellular permeability. The possibility remains that the EMSA was unable to detect low levels of STAT 6 that were capable of transducing a biological signal; that is, small amounts of STAT 6 below the EMSA detection limit, but enough to affect transcription may have escaped the TFDs. Unequivocal statements on the role of STAT 6 in regulating epithelial paracellular permeability await the advent of a stable and, preferably, inducible STAT 6 dominant-negative transfected enterocytic cell line suitable for electrophysiological studies. Ligation of the IL-4 and IL-13 receptors results in sequential binding of the docking protein insulin receptor substrate-1/2 and then PI3K, followed by the production of lipid inositols that can activate a variety of signaling molecules, including PKC (40Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Use of T84 cells and other epithelia have implicated PKC activity in the regulation of the epithelial tight junction function, the rate-limiting step governing paracellular permeability (41Turner J.R.

Recently, biphasic PI3K activity with characteristic early and late functions has been described, suggesting that PI3K is capable of supporting immediate and sustained cellular responses (44Hershberg R.M. Mayer L.F. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We found that inclusion of the inhibitors of PI3K activity, wortmannin, or the more specific compound LY294002, resulted in a significant ablation of the ability of IL-4 or IL-13 to decrease T84 monolayer TER. Indeed, these observations are in accordance with the recognized ability of PI3K to affect the cytoskeleton, which is a pivotal determinant in the control of epithelial tight junction activity (31Corvera S. Czech M.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 442-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Additionally, rescue of the HT-29 epithelial cell line from apoptosis by exposure to IL-13 was shown to occur via a PI3K pathway (45Wright K. Kolios G. Westwick J. Ward S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17193-17201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A recent report (46Pan Z.K. Chen L.-Y. Cochrane C.G. Zuraw B.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) indicates that wortmannin and LY294002 can inhibit NFκB activation in stimulated immune cells, raising the possibility that these drugs affect STAT 6 activation in response to IL-4 or IL-13. However, neither wortmannin nor LY294002, when used at the highest doses employed in the physiological studies, affected the STAT 6 activation by IL-4 or IL-13. Similarly, others have shown that wortmannin did not affect IL-4-evoked STAT 6 activation as assessed by Western blotting (47Ahmad F. Gao G. Wang L.M. Landstrom T.R. Degerman E. Pierce J.H. Manganiello V.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4864-4875PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the proximal signal transduction events elicited by IL-4 and IL-13, namely STAT 6 and PI3K activation, are separate and distinct. The virtually indistinguishable kinetics of IL-4- and IL-13-induced STAT 6 mobilization, along with the pivotal role of PI3K in their modulation of epithelial paracellular permeability, adds support to the hypothesis that the common IL-4Rα chain in the IL-4 and IL-13 receptors is crucial for signal transduction in enteric epithelia. In conclusion, we have identified PI3K activity as a major proximal signaling event involved in the IL-4- and IL-13-induced increase in epithelial paracellular permeability. The data raise questions pertinent to downstream events from PI3K in the regulation of paracellular permeability such as the involvement of PKC isoforms in the modulation of epithelial tight junctions by cytokines. These issues are the focus of ongoing studies. Finally, our data lead to the tantalizing speculation that future therapies for enteropathies characterized by an epithelial permeability defect could specifically target PI3K while leaving STAT 6-driven events (e.g. major histocompatibility complex II expression) intact.

Because there is a discrepancy between reported affinities of Tau to microtubules, we determined the interaction over a wide concentration range using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that the interaction is biphasic and not monophasic as assumed earlier. The first binding phase is typical for identical and noninteracting binding sites, with dissociation constants around 0.1 μmand stoichiometries around 0.2 Tau/tubulin dimer. Surprisingly, the second phase is nonsaturable and shows a nearly linear increase in bound Tau <i>versus</i> free Tau for free Tau concentrations higher than 2 μm. The slope is proportional to the microtubule concentration. From this we define an overloading parameter with values around 50 μm. The influence of Tau isoform, phosphorylation, and dimerization on both phases was investigated. Remarkably the overloading of Tau on microtubules leads to a thioflavin S fluorescence increase reminiscent of that seen with Tau aggregated into Alzheimer paired helical filaments. Because polyanions stimulate Tau aggregation and because the C-terminal domain of tubulin is polyanionic, we suggest that an early conformational change in Tau leading to paired helical filament aggregation occurs right on the microtubule surface."

To understand the structural elements responsible for this activity, various lengths of MMP-1 segments have been introduced into MMP-3 (stromelysin 1) starting from the C-terminal end. MMP-3/MMP-1 chimeras and variants were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, folded from inclusion bodies, and isolated as zymogens. After activation, recombinant chimeras were tested for their ability to digest triple helical type I collagen at 25 °C. The results indicate that the nine residues 183RWTNNFREY191 located between the fifth β-strand and the second α-helix in the catalytic domain of MMP-1 are critical for the expression of collagenolytic activity. Mutation of Tyr191 of MMP-1 to Thr, the corresponding residue in MMP-3, reduced collagenolytic activity about 5-fold. Replacement of the nine residues with those of the MMP-3 sequence further decreased the activity 2-fold. Those variants exhibited significant changes in substrate specificity and activity against gelatin and synthetic substrates, further supporting the notion that this region plays a critical role in the expression of collagenolytic activity. However, introduction of this sequence into MMP-3 or a chimera consisting of the catalytic domain of MMP-3 with the hinge region and the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-1 did not express any collagenolytic activity.

They consist of three α chains with repeating Gly-X-Y triplets where X andY are frequently Pro and Hyp, respectively. Each chain of the repeating tripeptide adopts a left-handed poly-Pro II helix conformation, and three left-handed chains then intertwine to form a right-handed superhelix (1Rich A. Crick F.H.C. J.

The action of cathepsin K is probably important in collagen breakdown in specialized environments such as during bone resorption in an acidic pH environment. Neutrophil elastase may degrade telopeptides of interstitial collagen (6Starkey P.M. Barrett A.J. Burleigh M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 483: 386-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the triple-helical region of type I collagen under inflammatory conditions, but the latter activity is much weaker than that of collagenase (5Kafienah W. Buttle D.J. Burnett D. Hollander A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Vertebrate collagenases, on the other hand, are synthesized by many cell types such as stromal fibroblasts, chondrocytes, keratinocytes, osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages in response to inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, cellular transformation, and other chemical and physical stimuli (7Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar). These collagenases are members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1family; they include the collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-13, MMP-18) (8Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar), gelatinase A (MMP-2) (9Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. J. Biol.

These enzymes cleave interstitial collagens at a specific site approximately three-fourths of the way from the N terminus of the collagen molecule at neutral pH. Once collagen is cleaved, the resulting triple helical fragments denature at body temperature and become susceptible to nonspecific proteolysis. Thus, the cleavage of interstitial collagens by metallocollagenases is critical for the initiation of collagenolysis under both physiological and pathological conditions. Typical collagenases are secreted from the cell as proenzymes of 55–60 kDa. They consist of an N-terminal propeptide domain of about 80 amino acids, a catalytic domain of about 165 amino acids, and a C-terminal hemopexin-like domain of about 190 amino acids. The catalytic domain and the hemopexin-like domain are linked by an exposed proline-rich linker peptide of 16 amino acids (11Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M.

MMP-3 (stromelysin 1) shares 54% overall identity in amino acid sequence with MMP-1 (58% within the catalytic domain), but it cleaves neither type I nor type II collagen. MMPs have homologous, superimposable substrate binding grooves in the catalytic domains (19Dhanaraj V. Ye Q.Z. Johnson L.L. Hupe D.J. Ortwine D.F. Dunbar Jr., J.B. Rubin J.R. Pavlovsky A. Humblet C.

Investigation of the substrate specificity using synthetic substrates shows that all MMPs prefer bulky hydrophobic residues at the P1′ position (20Nagase H. Fields G.B. Biopolymers. 1996; 40: 399-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both MMP-1 and MMP-3 can cleave all synthetic peptides based on the collagenase cleavage sites of types I, II, and III collagen at the same site, although their rates are different. It was therefore postulated that the C-terminal hemopexin domain plays an important role in the expression of collagenolytic activity. However, when the catalytic domain of MMP-3 was linked with the hemopexin domain of MMP-1, this chimera failed to express collagenolytic activity (21Murphy G. Allan J.A. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I.

Several other chimeras of collagenases and stromelysins have been constructed and studied (21Murphy G. Allan J.A. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Connell J.P. Docherty A.J.P. J. Biol.

We have approached this problem by attempting to transform non-collagenolytic MMP-3 to a collagenolytic enzyme by introducing increasing lengths of MMP-1 into it, starting from the C-terminal end. The present study has determined that the sequence183RWTNNFREY191 located between the fifth β-strand and the second α-helix in the catalytic domain is one of the key elements in MMP-1 for the expression of triple helicase activity. 4-Aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) was purchased from ICN Biochemicals.

Type I gelatin was formed by heating type I collagen at 65 °C for 20 min. The MMP chimeras shown in Fig.1 were constructed using wild-type MMP-1 and wild-type MMP-3 cDNAs in the pET3a vector as templates for overlapping polymerase chain reaction. The primers used are listed in TableI. Using the sense T7 promoter primer and an antisense chimeric junction primer containing the MMP-3 sequence at the 5′-end and the MMP-1 sequence at the 3′-end (see Table I), the N-terminal part of the chimera containing primarily the MMP-3 sequence was made. Using an antisense primer annealing to the vector (pET3a primer) and a sense chimeric junction primer containing the MMP-1 sequence at the 5′-end and the MMP-3 sequence at the 3′-end (overlapping with the previous primer), the C-terminal part of the chimera containing primarily the MMP-1 sequence was made. A final polymerase chain reaction was performed using these two first round products as the template and the two flanking primers (T7 promoter and pET3a primers). The final reaction resulted in a full-length chimera of MMP-3 and MMP-1 (see Fig. 1). The full-length product was then cut withNdeI and BamHI and ligated into the pET3a vector.

Polymerase chain reaction was used to replace a 9-amino acid sequence or a single amino acid of either MMP-1 or MMP-3, using overlapping primers. A sense primer and an antisense primer were constructed in which the 5′-ends of the primers contained overlapping portions of the sequence to be inserted and the 3′-ends of the primers contained the sequence of the wild-type cDNA (Table I). Using the T7 promoter primer and the antisense mutation primer, the N-terminal portion of the construct was made. Using the sense mutation primer and the pET3a reverse primer, the C-terminal portion of the construct was made. A second reaction was performed using the first round products as a template and the two flanking primers (T7 promoter and pET3a primers) to make the final full-length product. MMP-1(Gln185–Thr193)mmp-3is MMP-1 replaced with 185QWTKDTTGT193 of MMP-3, and MMP-3(Arg183–Tyr191)mmp-1 is MMP-3 replaced with 183RWTNNFREY191 of MMP-1 in their corresponding sequences (Table I). The pET3a vector harboring chimeric or mutant MMP cDNA was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells. Protein was expressed upon the addition of 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at 37 °C. Inclusion bodies were resuspended in urea buffer (8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.6), 20 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ZnCl2) and passed over a High Q Support anion exchange column (Bio-Rad). Recombinant proteins were diluted toA280 nm 1%, cm < 0.3, and 20 mmcystamine was added. For folding, proteins were dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.6), 0.15 mNaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 100 μmZnCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide, and 0.02% NaN3and then against TNC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3) containing 50 μm ZnCl2 at 4 °C. Folded proteins were further purified by chromatography on a Green A Dyematrex gel column (Amicon). ProMMP-1 and its chimeras/variants were activated by treating with l mm APMA at 37 °C for 1–2 h. ProMMP-3, proMMP-3–1-1, proMMP-3(Arg183–Tyr191)mmp-1, and proLC1 were activated by 10 μg/ml chymotrypsin at 37 °C for 1 h to generate primarily the 43–45-kDa form. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The amount of active enzyme was titrated with recombinant TIMP-1, the integrity of the 41-kDa active form was analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and the amount of active form was quantitated by densitometric analysis using IPLab gel (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). All chimeras were tested for their ability to digest pepsin-treated type I collagen at 25 °C, and products were analyzed on SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. Various concentrations of activated enzymes were incubated with 30 μg of type I collagen for up to 8 h. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer with 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and the products were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions. Collagen was then examined for digestion into TCA (¾) and TCB (¼) fragments. Activity of each chimera and mutant at 25 °C was determined by scanning TCA and TCB fragments on the gel, taking at least 4 earlier time points (less than 10% collagen digestion), and calculating the rate of hydrolysis. Specific activity against a 14C-labeled type I collagen at 37 °C was determined using a diffuse fibril assay according to Cawston and Barrett (29Cawston T.E. Barrett A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were performed in TNC buffer containing 0.05% Brij 35 as described previously (24Nagase H. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20952-20957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All enzymes were tested for their ability to digest synthetic fluorogenic substrates: Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly∼Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (a general MMP substrate) and Mca-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Val-Glu∼Nva-Trp-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-NH2(specific for MMP-3). Each enzyme was incubated with 1 μmsubstrate at 37 °C for 10–40 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μm EDTA, pH 8.0. Fluorescence was measured using wavelengths of 325 (excitation) and 393 nm (emission) with a microtiter plate fluorescence reader, Biotek FL600 (Biotek Instruments). The kcat/Km was calculated for each peptide substrate using Equation 1 to measure the initial velocity (vi) values under first order conditions ([S0] ≪ Km), kcatKm=vi[S0][E0](Eq. 1) where [S0] and [E0] are the initial concentrations of substrate and enzyme, respectively. MMP chimeras designed according to Fig. 1were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells as proenzymes. The proteins were extracted from inclusion bodies with 8 m urea and partially purified under denaturing conditions by ion exchange chromatography. Partially purified proteins were folded to the native state as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Folded proteins (∼85% pure on SDS-PAGE) were further purified by Green A Dyematrex gel chromatography. All chimeras, except LC2, were isolated as the precursor form, and they were activated to the 42-kDa form upon treatment with APMA or chymotrypsin (Fig.2). The treatment of the activated enzymes with trypsin (10 μg/ml) did not degrade these proteins, but they were digested into smaller fragments in the presence of 10 mm EDTA. These results, together with the enzymatic activity detected with the chimeric enzymes (see Table II), support the notion that these proteins were correctly folded in native structure. LC2 was spontaneously activated during purification, and treatment of this species with APMA did not alter the molecular mass, indicating that it was a stable, active enzyme.Table IISubstrate specificities of MMP chimeras and mutantsEnzymePeptide 1aPeptide 1, Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly∼Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2. kcat/KmPeptide 2bPeptide 2, Mca-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Val-Glu∼Nva-Trp-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-NH2. kcat/KmCollagenase activitys−1 · m−1s−1 · m−1%Wild-type MMP-110,400 ± 950n.d.cn.d., not detectable.100.0LC4121,000 ± 7,50017,200 ± 60027.6LC398,800 ± 4,60026,200 ± 5,20013.2LC210,700 ± 1,800106,000 ± 2,4003.0LC118,300 ± 2,000112,000 ± 6,200n.d.Wild-type MMP-31,800 ± 780183,000 ± 10,000n.d.MMP-3(T193Y)9,300 ± 2507,100 ± 420n.d.MMP-1(Y191T)338 ± 40n.d.23.4MMP-1(Gln185–Thr193)mmp-3271 ± 72n.d.11.6MMP-3(Arg183–Tyr191)mmp-122,800 ± 1,80014,300 ± 400n.d.MMP-3–1-1(Arg183–Tyr191)mmp-120,400 ± 1,80018,600 ± 2,300n.d.The collagenase assay was carried out at 25 °C, and the activity was determined by densitometric analysis of the fragments as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity of wild-type MMP-1 was taken as 100%.a Peptide 1, Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly∼Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2.b Peptide 2, Mca-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Val-Glu∼Nva-Trp-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-NH2.c n.d., not detectable. Open table in a new tab The collagenase assay was carried out at 25 °C, and the activity was determined by densitometric analysis of the fragments as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity of wild-type MMP-1 was taken as 100%. To examine collagenolytic activity, wild-type MMP-1 and MMP-3 and their chimeras were activated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Upon activation, some of the 42–45 kDa forms converted to lower molecular mass (22–28 kDa) species. Because only the full-length MMP-1 expresses collagenolytic activity, the amount of each chimeric enzyme corresponding to the 42–45-kDa form generated upon activation was quantified by densitometric analysis after SDS-PAGE and staining of proteins with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. As reported previously for natural MMP-3 (30Okada Y. Nagase H. Harris Jr., E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14245-14255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no collagenolytic activity was detected with recombinant MMP-3 (data not shown). Replacement of the C-terminal segment of MMP-3 with the corresponding sequence of MMP-1 up to Thr222 (LC1 chimera) (see Fig. 1) did not result in any collagenolytic activity (Fig.3). The LC2 chimera consisting of MMP-3(Phe83–Thr193) and MMP-1(Asn192–Asn450) showed a very low collagenolytic activity (< 3% of the wild-type MMP-1). A prominent increase of activity was observed with LC3, which contains an additional 9 amino acids of MMP-1 extended toward the N-terminal side (Fig. 3). A further extension of 9 amino acids of the MMP-1 sequence as in LC4 increased the activity only 1.8-fold. A similar pattern of increase in collagenolytic activity with these chimeras was observed at 37 °C using pepsin-untreated 14C-labeled type I collagen (data not shown). The difference between LC2 and LC3 is only a sequence of nine amino acids, 183RWTNNFREY191, indicating that this stretch of residues in MMP-1 is one of the key elements for the expression of collagenolytic activity (Fig.4).Figure 4Chimera sequences and their collagenolytic activities. Amino acid sequence of the overlapping region between MMP-3 and MMP-1 in the chimeras; MMP-3 is shown ingray, and MMP-1 is shown in black. The Zn2+ binding site is underlined. Collagenolytic activity of each chimera was measured at 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The alignment of the 183RWTNNFREY191 region with other collagenolytic MMPs (e.g. MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-13, and MMP-18) indicates that Tyr191 is conserved among them, but in MMP-3 the corresponding residue is Thr193. We therefore substituted Thr for Tyr191 in MMP-1, and the proMMP-1(Y191T) mutant was expressed in E. coli, folded from inclusion bodies, and purified. After activation with APMA, collagenolytic activity was measured. This mutation reduced the collagenolytic activity by 4–5-fold. Replacement of the 9 amino acids of MMP-1 with the corresponding sequence QWTKDTTGT of MMP-3 further reduced the collagenolytic activity by 2-fold (Fig.5). This suggests that the Tyr191 in this sequence is particularly important in maintaining full collagenolytic activity. To examine whether the 183RWTNNFREY191 sequence is the only part of the catalytic domain that is critical for the unique expression of collagenolytic activity, this sequence was introduced into MMP-3 and MMP-3–1-1 by replacing the185QWTKDTTGT193 section of MMP-3. Collagen assays were carried out at 25 °C, but neither of the variants, MMP-3(Arg183–Tyr191)mmp-1 and MMP-3–1-1(Arg183–Tyr191)mmp-1, expressed triple helicase activity (Fig. 5). These results suggest that whereas the RWTNNFREY stretch plays an important role in cleaving triple helices, this segment alone, or even with the linker and the hemopexin domain of MMP-1, is not sufficient to express collagenolytic activity. There must be other additional elements within the catalytic domain that contribute to the collagenolytic activity of MMP-1. We used type I gelatin and two synthetic substrates to investigate the substrate specificity of the above chimeras and mutants. In these experiments the active site of each enzyme was titrated with TIMP-1, and the same amount of active enzyme (mixture of 42-kDa and 22–25-kDa forms) was assayed. Using a mixture of catalytic domain and full-length forms is valid, because the enzyme activity on these substrates is not altered by the deletion of the hemopexin domain (data not shown). Digestion of gelatin by MMP-1 and MMP-3 and the subsequent analyses of the products by SDS-PAGE indicated that MMP-1 and MMP-3 have distinct substrate specificities (Fig.6 A). The chimera LC1 showed substrate specificity similar to the wild-type MMP-3, but it had about 5-fold higher activity on gelatin than did MMP-3. LC2, whose S1′ pocket includes MMP-1-specific Arg195, digested gelatin in a pattern similar to that of MMP-1. The activities of LC2 and MMP-1 on gelatin were comparable. LC3 and LC4 also had a similar digestion pattern as LC2, but they were about 5-fold more active on gelatin than was LC2. These studies have demonstrated that the RWTNNFREY sequence greatly influences the specific activity of MMP-1 on gelatin. When this sequence was introduced into MMP-3 and MMP-3–1-1 by replacement, the chimeric constructs MMP-3(Arg183–Tyr191)mmp-1 and MMP-3–1-1(Arg183–Tyr191)mmp-1showed about a 15-fold increase in gelatinolytic activity without significant changes in the cleavage pattern (Fig. 6 B). On the other hand, a single mutation of Tyr191 of MMP-1 to Thr reduced not only collagenolytic activity but also gelatinolytic activity 4–5-fold (Fig. 6 C). Replacement of the QWTKDTTGT sequence with the corresponding sequence of MMP-1 reduced gelatinolytic activity to a level similar to that of MMP-1(Y191T). Gelatin digestion"

Here, we describe a novel bioaction of lipoxin A4(LXA4), namely inhibition of leukotriene D4 (LTD4)-induced human renal mesangial cell proliferation, and investigate the signal transduction mechanisms involved. LXA4 blocked LTD4-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity in parallel to inhibition of LTD4-induced mesangial cell proliferation. Screening of a human mesangial cell cDNA library revealed expression of the recently described cys-leukotriene1/LTD4 receptor. LTD4-induced mesangial cell proliferation required both extracellular-related signal regulated kinase (erk) and PI 3-kinase activation and may involve platelet-derived growth factor receptor transactivation. LTD4-stimulated the MAP kinases erk and p38 via a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive pathway dependent on PI 3-kinase and protein kinase C activation. On screening a cDNA library, mesangial cells were found to express the previously described LXA4 receptor. In contrast to LTD4, LXA4 showed differential activation of erk and p38. LXA4 activation of erk was insensitive to PTX and PI 3-kinase inhibition, whereas LXA4 activation of p38 was sensitive to PTX and could be blocked by the LTD4 receptor antagonist SKF 104353. These data suggest that LXA4stimulation of the MAP kinase superfamily involves two distinct receptors: one shared with LTD4 and coupled to a PTX-sensitive G protein (Gi) and a second coupled via an alternative G protein, such as Gq or G12, to erk activation.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4878-4882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known of the cellular signaling pathways elicited by either LTD4 or LXA4 in mesangial cells. MAP kinases are a family of serine-threonine kinases activated by a cascade of protein-protein interactions. Activation of MAP kinases is critical to several aspects of mesangial cell function, such as proliferation, cell adhesion, and gene expression (31Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Dunn M.J. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1187-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). MAP kinase activation subsequent to receptor stimulation has been extensively demonstrated. Tyrosine phosphorylation of growth factor receptors leads to a series of kinase reactions culminating in phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase (reviewed in Ref. 32Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). More recently, it has become appreciated that receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins can stimulate MAPK activation (reviewed in Ref. 33Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence specificity of the MAPK tripeptide phosphorylation motif, three families have been identified: extracellular-related signal regulated kinases (erks); p38, a homologue of yeast HOG-1; and c-Jun N-terminal kinases. MAPKs are activated by a family of dual specificity kinases (MAPK kinase or MAPK/erk kinase) subsequent to MAPK/erk kinase kinase activation. Several molecules linking ligand binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to MAP kinase activation have been identified; among these is phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (34Ferby I.M. Waga I. Sakanaka C. Kume K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30485-30488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12133-12136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Activation of the PI 3-kinase family of lipid kinases regulates multiple cell functions, including proliferation. Here, we present data on proliferative responses to both LTD4 and LXA4 in mesangial cells and on activation of members of the MAP kinase superfamily (erk and p38 kinases). These data indicate that LTD4-induced proliferation can be blocked by LXA4 and requires both erk and PI 3-kinase activation. LXA4 blocked LTD4-induced PI 3-kinase activity in parallel to inhibitory effects on mesangial cell proliferation. LXA4 may cause differential activation of MAP kinases by binding to both a common LTD4 receptor and a specific LXA4 receptor through which inhibition of proliferation is effected. Furthermore, we demonstrate LTD4 activation of MAP kinases in mesangial cells by a PTX-sensitive pathway involving activation of PI 3-kinase and PKC. A mesangial cell cDNA library has been screened, and we have established expression of the myeloid LXA4 receptor (19Fiore S. Maddox J.F. Perez H.D. Serhan C.N. J. Exp.

SV40-transformed human mesangial cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). These cells retain the phenotypic characteristics of mesangial cells, including stellate morphology, typical α-actinin expression, and production of extracellular matrix proteins and are negative for cytokeratin and endothelial markers (36Sraer D.

Before being treated with the indicated agents, cells were cultured in serum-free medium or media containing 0.5% FCS (24–48 h) as indicated. Mesangial cells were plated on 96-well plates (500 cells/well) and cultured in 5.0% FCS for 24 h. Prior to the experiments, cells were incubated for 48 h in serum-free culture medium. Incubation was continued for another 48 h with the indicated agents as detailed in the figure legends. Proliferation of mesangial cells was measured by determination of the number of viable cells using an assay in which a tetrazolium salt is reduced by viable cells to aqueous soluble formazan (Promega) andA 450 nm is determined (38Mondorf U.F.

The quantity of formazan product as measured by A 450 nm was directly proportional to the number of living cells. A mesangial cell cDNA library was constructed using 2 μg of total RNA from mesangial cells as a template for SMART PCR cDNA library construction (CLONTECH). The library was used as template in an amplification reaction with oligonucleotides based on the myeloid LXA4 receptor. The resulting PCR product was further analyzed by Southern blotting and showed hybridization with a [32P]dCTP-labeled internal probe based on the myeloid receptor (data not shown). The library was also used as template in PCRs with oligonucleotides based on the cysLT1/LTD4 receptor (29Lynch K.R. O'Neill G.P. Liu Q. Im D.S. Sawyer N. Metters K.M. Coulombe N. Abramowitz M.

A hot start cycle of 72 °C (5 min), 4 °C (5 min), and 94 °C (5 min) preceding addition of Taq polymerase was included in which the library was template. Amplification protocols for LXA4 receptor consisted of 35 repetitive cycles of denaturing at 94 °C (1 min), annealing at 61 °C (1 min), and extension at 72 °C (1 min 20 s). LTD4receptor was amplified by 35 repetitive cycles of denaturing at 94 °C (1 min), annealing at 60 °C (1 min), and extension at 72 °C (1 min 20 s). Primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as internal controls, as described. Amplification protocols for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase consisted of 35 repetitive cycles of denaturing at 94 °C (30 s), 64 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (1 min). Amplified cDNA was separated by agarose gel (1.1%) electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide. Subconfluent cell cultures were rendered quiescent by serum restriction in 0.5% FCS RPMI 1640 medium for 24–48 h. After this period, cells were stimulated with various agents for indicated times as detailed in the legends to Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8. After washing cells once with ice cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysates were harvested in ice cold hypotonic lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm-NaCl, 5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μm sodium orthophosphate). The lysates were centrifuged and supernatants processed for immunoblotting as described previously (39Godson C. Reppert S.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Protein was assayed in appropriately diluted samples by the method of Bradford. The cell lysates (40 μg of protein/well) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel before blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Equal loading and transfer of proteins was verified by staining a portion of the membranes with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Nonspecific sites on the membranes were blocked by incubation in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk TBS. The blots were incubated with primary antibody. Antisera specific for phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Tyr-182) or phosphorylated erk (Thr-202/Tyr-204) were diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, blots were washed with TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated with an appropriate alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Specific antibody binding was measured with a colorimetric substrate (4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phospate).

https://openalex.org/W2013022584,"Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) regulated growth and function of the ovarian follicle was previously thought to be mediated solely through activation of Gs-coupled receptors. In this study, we show for the first time that this function is predominantly mediated through the alternatively spliced and novel growth factor type 1 receptor (oFSH-R3) that is also present in the ovary. Immortalized granulosa cells lacking endogenous FSH receptors, when transfected with either oFSH-R3 cDNA (JC-R3) or the Gs-coupled oFSH-R1 (JC-R1), expressed the corresponding glycosylated receptor. In JC-R3 or JC-R1 cells labeled with bromodeoxyuridine or [3H]thymidine, FSH stimulated the cells to progress through S-phase and divide. The growth promoting effect of recombinant FSH in JC-R3 cells was preceded by the rapid activation of ERK1 and ERK2. This effect was hormone-specific and transient. In JC-R3 cells inhibitors like calphostin C, PD98059, Ag 18, or calcium chelators EGTA or 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid/AM inhibited both mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. FSH induced phosphorylation of the FSH-R3 receptor was blocked by pretreating cells with calphostin C. There was no cAMP induction by FSH in JC-R3 cells. The cAMP independent growth promoting effect of FSH is mediated by activation of Ca2+ and mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathways. Thus, alternative splicing of a G-protein coupled receptor creates the expression of a novel receptor motif that can mediate a widely recognized function of the glycoprotein hormone.

Two dimeric pituitary gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone or follitropin (FSH)1 and luteinizing hormone or lutropin (LH) that belong to the complex glycoprotein hormone family are critically involved in the mechanisms regulating follicle status and development. The actions of gonadotropic hormones are mediated by binding to high affinity receptors present on plasma membranes of target gonadal cells. FSH regulates a large number of genes encoding nuclear, cytoplasmic, membrane associated (1Loganzo Jr., F. Fletcher P.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1259-1267PubMed Google Scholar), and secreted proteins (2Griswold M.D. Russell L.D. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli Cell. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1993: 493-508Google Scholar). The full-length FSH receptor (hereafter called FSH-R1) belongs to a superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors, which interact with intracellular effector system through 7-transmembrane domains (3Simoni M. Gromoll J. Nieschlag E. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 739-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 4Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R.

Commun. 1996; 226: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This FSH-R1 receptor like LH and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyrotropin) receptors has a large extracellular (EC) amino-terminal domain comprised of more than 300 amino acid residues. The EC domains of these receptors are encoded by multiple exons and contain leucine-rich repeat sequences that are thought to be important for ligand binding. According to present evidence, the FSH receptor is coded by a single large gene (80–100 kilobases), in various species (3Simoni M. Gromoll J. Nieschlag E. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 739-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 6Sairam M.R. Subbarayan V.S.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a widespread theme for gene regulation and for generating isoform variants as this mechanism will ensure molecular diversity for cellular regulation in instances where only one gene exists (7Sharp P.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). There are many reports on the identification of various alternatively spliced transcripts for most glycoprotein hormone receptors including that of FSH in the ovary and testis, the two exclusive targets of the hormone action (4Braun T.

Touyz R.M. Sairam M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Follicles in the ovary are either quiescent or committed to one of the two developmental pathways: growth or atresia/apoptosis. Although most of the growth in the follicles is attributed to the proliferation of granulosa cells under the tropic influence of FSH, the molecular mechanisms and the exact receptor motifs that participate in the process are poorly understood. Recent evidence derived from the generation of knockout mutants for the FSH-β subunit (lacking the hormone dimer) (15Kumar T.R. Wang Y. Lu N. Matzuk M.M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) and all forms of the FSH receptor (16Dierich A. Sairam M.R. Monaco L. Fimia G.M. Gansmuller A. LeMeur M. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) in the mouse substantiate the importance of the hormone-receptor interaction in follicular development. The presence of underdeveloped ovarian follicles in our FSH-R knockout mouse suggests that FSH signaling is critical in the final phases of follicular growth and maturation (16Dierich A. Sairam M.R. Monaco L. Fimia G.M. Gansmuller A. LeMeur M. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Recent studies of numerous cells undergoing proliferation in response to various extracellular signals have demonstrated the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) or extracellular-regulated kinases (ERK). The ERK cascade consists of 3-kinase modules that include a MAPK which is activated by a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which is in turn activated by another MEK kinase (MEKK) (17Elion E.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1625-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Multiple mammalian MAPK pathways have been identified, of which the ERK cascade is the best characterized. It consists of Raf isoforms, MEK1/2 and ERK1/ERK2 and is regulated by Ras. In addition, it is also known that proto-oncogenes, the normal cell progenitors of oncogenes may regulate the growth and differentiation of normal cells. Accordingly, a number of observations like the transient increase in c-fos, c-myc expression, and MAP kinase activation were reported in primary granulosa cell cultures in response to FSH (18Das S.

Endocrinol. 1991; 80: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and some of the actions are apparently mediated by cAMP independent pathways (19Cameron M.R. Foster J.S. Bukovsky A. Wimalasena J. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Pennybacker M. Herman B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 80: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This raises the critical question whether all FSH actions on target cells are mediated by one type of receptor (R1), the heptahelical transmembrane form that is coupled to the activation of adenylyl cyclase producing cyclic AMP as the second messenger? As the FSH receptor gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing (3Simoni M. Gromoll J. Nieschlag E. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 739-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 6Sairam M.R. Subbarayan V.S.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and most of the earlier observations in literature are made with primary cultures of target cells that may express heterogeneous populations of FSH receptors, it is conceivable that other FSH receptor motifs may be implicated in signaling events that contribute to cell proliferation. In view of its novel structural features, the alternatively spliced receptor 39-kDa FSH-R3 identified in the developing ovary (12Babu P.S. Jiang J. Sairam A.M. Touyz R.M. Sairam M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that is distinctly different from R1 becomes a good candidate. Like other growth factor type I receptors, the FSH-R3 has a single transmembrane domain and undergoes dimerization in response to the action of FSH (10Sairam M.R. Jiang L.G. Yarney T.A. Khan H. Mol.

We have also shown that this R3 type receptor but not the Gs-coupled R1 receptor mobilizes Ca2+ influx into the cell through L-voltage Ca2+ channels (21Touyz R.M. Jiang L. Sairam M.R. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The experiments presented herein were designed to test for the potential role of this growth factor type I receptor in FSH-mediated MAP kinase signaling in target granulosa cell proliferation. The availability of a granulosa cell line (JC-410) (22Chedrese P.J. Rodway M.R. Swan C.L. Gillio-Meina C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,23Rodway M.R.

Encocrinol. 1999; 148: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) that lost innate expression of gonadotropin receptors during spontaneous immortalization but retained its steroidogeneic capability has provided us an ideal system to understand the role of the alternatively spliced FSH receptor in hormone signaling. The results of the current study provide the first direct evidence strongly implicating a role for the novel growth factor type I receptor in activating extracellular-regulated kinase pathways by mechanisms that are independent of the cAMP pathway. Highly purified recombinant hormones rhFSH (AFP 8468A), rhCG (AFP8456A), and rhLH (1295 RL) were obtained from the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. For iodination, highly purified hFSH prepared in our laboratory was used. Anti-rFSHR (W970) a polyclonal antibody against rFSHR (sequence 150–183) was kindly provided by J. Dias (State of New York, Department of Health, New York). Anti-oFSHR antibody (J25) is a rabbit polyclonal antibody obtained by immunizing Escherichia coli expressed R4-type oFSHR (24Khan H. Jiang L.G. Jayashree G.N. Yarney T.A. Sairam M.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 19: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used in this study are P44/42 MAP kinase, phosphospecific P44/42 MAP kinase, Akt, and phosphospecific Akt (New England Biolabs), anti-BrdUrd antibody (DaKo Diagnostic, Ontario), anti-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Sigma). Ag 18 was kindly furnished by Dr. A. Levitzki of Jerusalem, Israel. All other inhibitors used in this study were purchased from Calbiochem. The immortalized pig granulosa cells (JC-410) were handled as described earlier (22Chedrese P.J. Rodway M.R. Swan C.L. Gillio-Meina C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), except that DMEM/F-12 medium was used for cell culture instead of M-199. pcDNA1 Neo vector (Invitrogen) containing the complete coding sequence for oFSH-R1 of 678 residues (11Yarney T.A. Jiang L.G. Khan H. MacDonald E.A. Laird D.W. Sairam M.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 458-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and oFSH-R3 of 242 residues (10Sairam M.R. Jiang L.G. Yarney T.A. Khan H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) of the respective mature proteins was transfected into JC-410 cells. For making stable cell lines the calcium precipitate protocol was used. Densely growing foci of transformed cells were visualized, selected for 8 weeks using G418 (Life Technologies, Inc., Mississauga, ON; 400 μg/ml) and expanded into cell lines. Initial screening for cells expressing the oFSH-R3 protein was performed by125I-hFSH binding and responsive cells were further used for signaling studies in serum-deprived medium in the presence of stimulators or inhibitors as described in the individual experiments outlined below. This was performed according to published protocols (10Sairam M.R. Jiang L.G. Yarney T.A. Khan H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Yarney T.A. Jiang L.G. Khan H. MacDonald E.A. Laird D.W. Sairam M.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 458-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Highly purified hFSH was labeled with125I by the lactoperoxidase method (specific activity 100,000 cpm/ng) and incubated with granulosa cells expressing FSH-R3 or R1 or the vector control. The membranes were incubated for 12 h at 25 °C with 100,000 cpm/ml 125I-FSH in presence or absence of excess unlabeled oFSH. Specific binding was determined in presence of 1 μg of unlabeled oFSH. The number of receptor molecules present in either JC-R3 or JC-R1 cells was determined as described earlier (10Sairam M.R. Jiang L.G. Yarney T.A. Khan H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (0.2 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K) and digested for 3 h at 50 °C with gentle shaking. Salt concentration was adjusted to 0.2 mNaCl and DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform. PCR using genomic DNA was performed with neomycin-specific primers: forward, AAGGGACTGGCTGCTATTG (RS 003) and reverse, AGAAAAGCGGCCATTTTC (RS 004) to amplify a 348-bp fragment. RNA from cells expressing FSH-R3 or FSH-R1 and cells transfected with pcDNA1 vector alone were extracted using midi-RNA isolation kit (Ambion) and reverse transcribed using first strand synthesis kit (Ambion). The cDNAs were used to amplify both oFSH-R3 and oFSH-R1 using specific primers SFR1 (ATGTGTTCTCCAACCTGCCCA) and TB21 (CTGACTCGAGCTAATTTGGATGCTGCTTGA) for an expected size of 517 bp for R3 and SFR1 and SFR11 (CATCATCTTCTGCCAAAGAGA) for R1 with an expected size of 690 bp. The products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The cells (1 × 106/ml) transfected with/without FSH-R3 or FSH-R1 were harvested and fixed in 1% buffered paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed thrice with 3 ml of staining buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin) and resuspended in 100 μl of staining buffer containing the FSH-R antisera (1:100) raised in rabbits and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. They were again washed and incubated with 100 μl of staining buffer containing fluorosceinated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50 dilution) in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. After one more final wash they were resuspended in 1 ml of staining buffer. The green fluorescence intensity of cells was measured in a Coulter flow cytometer at 530 nm. Control cells were processed in the same manner excluding the primary antibody. The antibodies used were characterized previously and shown to react with FSH receptor in cells or gonadal tissues (12Babu P.S. Jiang J. Sairam A.M. Touyz R.M. Sairam M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Khan H. Jiang L.G. Jayashree G.N. Yarney T.A. Sairam M.R. J. Mol.

The cells were scraped in cold PBS and collected after centrifugation at 800 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. They were suspended in lysis buffer and left on ice for 30 min to solubilize membrane proteins. The solubilized receptor was deglycosylated using N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which cleaves all N-linked glycomoieties of the FSH receptor (26Davis D. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 159-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 200 μg of membrane protein was suspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated with 50 units/ml N-glycosidase F. After incubation for 4 h at 30 °C, 100 μg of equivalent protein was reduced in 1 × SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using the FSH-R3-specific peptide antibody (12Babu P.S. Jiang J. Sairam A.M. Touyz R.M. Sairam M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Granulosa cells expressing the cloned oFSH-R3 or oFSH-R1 were stimulated in serum-free medium as described in the figure legends. In preliminary studies, we used natural and highly purified hFSH and hLH or hCG prepared in our laboratory. In subsequent experiments all data reported herein were derived from the use of recombinant human glycoprotein hormones (see “Methods”). Cells collected by scraping in cold PBS were washed and homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein content in the samples was estimated by the Bio-Rad protein assay. For verifying the expression of FSH-R3 ∼100 μg of protein was used whereas for MAP kinases 5 μg of total solubilized protein was adequate. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE minigel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (DuPont) membranes. After blocking nonspecific sites, membranes were incubated with anti-MAP kinase (1:1000), phospho-MAP kinase (1:1000), oFSH-R3 IgG (1:2000), or FSHR Ab (1:2000) in TBS containing 1% (w/v) skim milk powder and 0.05% Tween 20 for 12 h at 4 °C. The washed blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) at 1:3000 dilution. Bound antibody was visualized using the Luminol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) chemiluminescent detection system. The quantification of BrdUrd-positive cells by flow cytometry can be considered as a measure of actively dividing S-phase cells (27Gasinska A. Wilson G.D. Br. J. Radiol. 1988; 61: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Quantification of BrdUrd-labeled cells was done according to the procedure described earlier (28Terry N.H. White R.A. Meistrich M.L. Calkins D.P. Cytometry. 1991; 12: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Granulosa cells transfected with/without FSH-R3 or FSH-R1 receptor were growth arrested by serum starvation for 16–24 h and treated with various concentrations of human recombinant FSH and 50 μm BrdUrd. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+ and Mg2+-free) and fixed in 70% chilled ethanol at a concentration of 1 × 106 per ml. An aliquot of ethanol-fixed cells (2 × 106) was washed, pepsinized, acid denatured, and incubated with 200 μl of a monoclonal antibody against BrdUrd at 1:40 dilution for 1 h in dark. The cells were washed and incubated with 200 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at 1:10 dilution for 30 min in dark and cells were counterstained with propidium iodide staining solution containing 100 μg/ml DNase-free RNase. Control cells were processed similarly without incubating with BrdUrd. The intensity of green fluorescence of fluorescein isothiocyanate staining and red fluorescence of propidium iodide-stained cells were measured at 530 and 620 nm, respectively, in a Coulter Flow Cytometer. Granulosa cells (JC-R3, JC-R1, or JC-Vector) were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 cm2 in 24-well tissue culture plates and grown for 2 days without a medium change. They were rinsed once with serum-free DMEM and serum starved for 16 h by incubating with DMEM. The medium was changed to DMEM containing varying concentrations of rFSH plus 1 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine (specific activity 79 Ci/mmol). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated into DNA was determined as described previously (10Sairam M.R. Jiang L.G. Yarney T.A. Khan H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). JC-R3 cells plated in 100-mm dishes were biosynthetically labeled in phosphate-free DMEM medium with 100 μci/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 as described by others (29Nakamura K. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24346-24354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and stimulated for another 30 min with 10 ng/ml rFSH. The plates were placed on ice and cells were scraped into cold buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Cells were solubilized on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble receptor in the supernatant was immunoprecipitated using anti-FSH R3 IgG antibody and resolved on SDS-PAGE in the presence of thiol reducing agents. Autoradiographs of dried gels were obtained using intensifying screen. Stable granulosa cells expressing oFSH-R3 (JC-R3) or oFSH-R1 (JC-R1) were evaluated for their capacity to stimulate estradiol production. Estradiol-17β was estimated by radioimmunoassay in 200 μl of culture medium, as described previously in the presence or absence of 0.1 μl of androstenedione (22Chedrese P.J. Rodway M.R. Swan C.L. Gillio-Meina C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For cAMP estimation, 2′-O-monosuccinyl adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate methyl ester was labeled with Na125I using chloramine T. Cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 0.1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma). The cAMP produced was measured using the double antibody precipitation method (5Sairam M.R. Jiang L.G. Khan H. Yarney T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and expressed as picomole/μg of protein. Cells were washed twice with PBS and solubilized in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and cellular protein content was determined with Bio-Rad protein assay kit. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. and analyzed by one-way ANOVA. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The role of alternatively spliced FSH-R3 signaling was evaluated in granulosa cell line (JC-410) which had lost the responsiveness to gonadotropins during spontaneous immortalization (22Chedrese P.J. Rodway M.R. Swan C.L. Gillio-Meina C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but retained expression of several genes required for steroidogenesis. The retention of these phenotypic features is critical in examining all phases of hormone action. Accordingly this ovarian cell line provides a convenient in vitro model for creating responsive target cells with discrete receptor motifs. Following transfection of granulosa cells with the oFSH-R3 or oFSH-R1 construct in the pcDNA1 Neo vector, successful transfectants were identified and selected by their resistance to G418 (400 μg/ml) for 8 weeks. The stable cell lines are, hereafter named JC-R3 and JC-R1, respectively. Further screening of these stable cell lines was done by PCR to confirm the expression of neomycin. Neomycin (348 bp) was amplified only in the cell lines transfected with FSH-R3 or FSH-R1 (Fig. 1 A). The expression of oFSH-R3 and oFSH-R1 was also confirmed in these cells by RT-PCR using primers specific for FSH-R3 and FSH-R1. A 517-bp product specific to FSH-R3 was amplified only in FSH-R3 transfected cell lines (Fig. 1 A) but not with vector alone. Similarly a 690-bp product, which spans between exon 3 and 10 for FSH-R1, was expressed only in JC-R1 cells. These results not only showed the faithful expression of R3 type receptor in the JC-R3 cell lines and R1 in JC-R1 cells but also confirmed the absence of any endogenous FSH receptors in the vector-transfected cells. The cell surface expression and 125I-hFSH binding to JC-R3 or JC-R1 membranes are shown in Fig. 1 B. The binding of125I-hFSH was effectively competed by unlabeled FSH but not the structural homologous hormone LH. In the same experiment granulosa cells transfected with vector alone showed no specific binding of labeled FSH. Previously, we have reported that HEK 293 cells expressing the same FSH-R3 or FSH-R1 cDNA show high affinity binding (K d = 0.17- 0.27 nm) to labeled FSH (10Sairam M.R. Jiang L.G. Yarney T.A. Khan H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) similar to receptors in the target tissue (K d = 0.66 nm). From the binding data in this study the number of receptor molecules present in the JC-R3 and JC-R1 were estimated to be approximately equal (∼2000 R/cell). Taken together these data confirm that the first 8 exons, which account for about 61% of the extracellular domain of the R1 receptor, is sufficient for efficient hormone binding when it is combined with a single transmembrane protein segment that allows cell surface expression (10Sairam M.R. Jiang L.G. Yarney T.A. Khan H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (see below). Analysis of intact JC-R3 or JC-R1 cells with selected and previously characterized antibodies using flow cytometry also showed that both these receptors were present on the cell surface."

However, all nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms are 20–40 residues longer in the C terminus, forming a “tail” that is absent in CPR. To investigate its function, we removed the 33 and 42 residue C termini from neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS), respectively. Both truncated enzymes exhibited cytochrome c reductase activities without calmodulin that were 7–21-fold higher than the nontruncated forms. With calmodulin, the truncated and wild-type enzymes reduced cytochrome c at approximately equal rates. Therefore, calmodulin functioned as a nonessential activator of the wild-type enzymes and a partial noncompetitive inhibitor of the truncated mutants. Truncated nNOS and eNOS plus calmodulin catalyzed NO formation at rates that were 45 and 33%, respectively, those of their intact forms. Without calmodulin, truncated nNOS and eNOS synthesized NO at rates 14 and 20%, respectively, those with calmodulin. By using stopped-flow spectrophotometry, we demonstrated that electron transfer into and between the two flavins is faster in the absence of the C terminus. Although both CPR and intact NOS can exist in a stable, one-electron-reduced semiquinone form, neither of the truncated enzymes do so. We propose negative modulation of FAD-FMN interaction by the C termini of both constitutive NOSs.

Ignarro L. Nitric Oxide. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000Google Scholar). The three isoforms, neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS), produce NO by the same mechanism but play very different physiological roles due to the type of cell where they are located. nNOS, located in neurons in the brain and at neuromuscular junctions, is involved in neurotransmission (2Garthwaite J. Charles S.L. Chess-Williams R. Nature. 1988; 336: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar, 3Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Vasodilation: Vascular Smooth Muscle, Peptides, Autonomic Nerves, and Endothelium. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 427-435Google Scholar). The NO produced by nNOS and eNOS exerts its effects through the stimulation of guanylate cyclase, whereas the NO produced by iNOS exerts its effects directly or by combining with superoxide anion radical to form peroxynitrite anion, both potent oxidants deleterious to proteins and DNA. The NOSs consist of two domains, a heme and H4B-containing oxygenase (or heme) domain, which binds the substratel-arginine, and a flavin-containing reductase (or flavoprotein) domain, which binds the prosthetic group flavins FAD and FMN and the cofactor NADPH. Electrons are transferred into NOS at the FAD moiety and are subsequently passed through the FMN to the heme domain. A calmodulin-binding region bisects the two domains. Calmodulin (CaM) is required for NO production and mediates the transfer of electrons from the FMN of NOS to the heme domain (8Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaM binds NOS in a 1:1 stoichiometry with very high affinity. CaM binds to sequences within the nNOS, eNOS, and iNOS CaM-binding sites withKD values of 1–2, 4, and 0.1 nm, respectively (9Sheta E. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol.

Two of the isoforms (nNOS and eNOS) are constitutive; induction of NO synthesis activity requires an influx of calcium to promote calmodulin binding (3Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar, 15Förstermann U. Pollock J.S. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Heller M. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1788-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The iNOS enzyme is induced at the transcriptional level, and calmodulin is bound even at basal calcium concentrations (16Cho H.J.

The basis for this dramatic difference of the calcium requirements between the inducible and constitutive NOSs has not been totally clarified, but differences in the CaM-binding sequences themselves do not explain it because swapping the binding sites between the inducible and constitutive NOSs does not completely confer the CaM binding properties of one to the other (12Venema R.C.

The reductase domains of the NOSs have not yet been crystallized, but they appear to be structurally very similar to the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), with the nNOS flavoprotein domain sharing 36% identity and 58% close homology at the amino acid level (22Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). Like those of CPR, the flavins of NOSs transfer electrons to artificial electron acceptors, such as cytochrome c, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP), and ferricyanide (9Sheta E. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Miller R.T. Martásek P. Omura T. Masters B.S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); these rates of reduction also differ very greatly from CPR and between the NOS isoforms. In addition to mediating electron transfer between the flavin and heme domains, CaM also has an effect on the flavin domain itself, as its binding increases the rates of reduction of cytc, DCIP, and ferricyanide by eNOS and nNOS and by flavoprotein constructs containing the CaM-binding sequences (24McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To account for such differences in calcium dependence, NO production, and cyt c reduction in what are otherwise very homologous structures, attention has now focused on the search for control mechanisms in several regions that exist in the flavin domains of NOSs that have no counterpart in CPR. A putative autoinhibitory domain described by Salerno et al. (25Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M.E. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), consisting of about 45 amino acids located in the middle of the FMN-binding region, is present in the constitutive NOSs (nNOS and eNOS) but is absent in iNOS and CPR. This autoinhibitory domain was proposed to control the calmodulin binding/activation of the constitutive isoforms. Deletion of this region in nNOS resulted in an enzyme that attained maximal NO synthesis at lower levels of free calcium and even retained 30% of its activity in the absence of calcium/CaM (26Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30589-30595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that the insert inhibits electron transfer from FMN to the heme in the absence of CaM and also destabilizes CaM binding at low calcium concentrations. The autoinhibitory peptide, however, does not limit the rates of NO synthesis and cyt c reduction; its effect is only on the calcium/CaM dependence. Another notable difference between the NOS isoforms and CPR is that each of the NOS isoforms contains about 21–42 additional amino acids at the C terminus (42, 33, and 21 amino acids in bovine eNOS, rat nNOS, and murine iNOS, respectively), forming a tail that is not present in CPR. Xie et al. (27Xie Q.W. Cho H. Kashiwabara Y. Baum M. Weidner J.R. Elliston K. Mumford R. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28500-28505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that deletion of 22 or 23 residues from the C terminus of iNOS, which removed the tail plus 1 or 2 additional residues, reduced the rate of NO synthesis 26 or 66%, respectively. We have shown that removing the C-terminal 21 amino acids from murine iNOS results in an enzyme with significantly higher cytochrome c reduction and NO synthesis activities (10- and 1.2-fold, respectively; see Ref. 28Roman L.J. Miller R.T. de la Garza M.A. Kim J.-J.P. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21914-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The kinetic consequences of this truncation were an increased rate of electron transfer to and between the flavin moieties and from the flavins to the heme. In addition, the air-stable semiquinone form of the flavin domain, observed with the wild-type enzyme, was greatly destabilized, and the heme-nitrosyl complex, formed by the wild-type enzyme during NO synthesis, was decreased in the truncated form. However, iNOS lacks the autoinhibitory domain, and experiments cannot be done in the absence of CaM due to the expression system used, which coexpresses iNOS and CaM. Thus, any effect of the C-terminal tail on the CaM dependence of the enzyme could not be examined. To investigate the functional role of the additional 33 and 42 residues at the C terminus of nNOS and eNOS, respectively, we have removed them from nNOS and eNOS and compared the resulting enzymes to the intact proteins. The mechanistic implications of this deletion are discussed. (6R)-5,6,7,8-Tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) was from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA), and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma and were of the highest grade available. Pfu turbo polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); ligase and restriction enzymes were purchased from either Promega (Cambridge, MA) or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Shrimp alkaline phosphatase was from United States Biochemical Corp. The rat nNOS cDNA was provided by Drs. Solomon Snyder and David Bredt at The Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore. The bovine eNOS cDNA was provided by Dr. William Sessa at Yale University, New Haven. PCWori+ was given by Dr. Michael Waterman at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. nNOSpCW-tr1 and eNOSpCW-tr1, the plasmids for the expression of the truncated nNOS (residues 1–1397) and eNOS (residues 1–1163) in Escherichia coli,were constructed as follows. For nNOS-tr1, the initial 1397 codons of nNOSpCW (29Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) (from the ATG start codon to the final residue minus 33) were amplified by PCR. Primer tr1-1 (upstream primer, withNdeI site) was 5′-TGCTTAGGAGGTCATATG-3′, and primer tr1-2 (return primer, with XbaI site) was 5′- CTAGTCTAGATTATCCAAAGATGTCCTCGTG-3′. Primers were synthesized by the Center for Advanced DNA Technologies at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio. Reaction mixtures included 50 pmol of each primer, 20 ng of nNOSpCW template, 200 μm dNTPs, 1× Pfu turbo polymerase buffer, and 2.5 units ofPfu turbo polymerase in 50 μl total volume. The mixture was preincubated for 1 min at 94 °C prior to the addition ofPfu turbo polymerase, followed by amplification for 18 cycles: 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was gel-purified using the GeneClean II kit (Bio 101, Vista, CA) and digested with NdeI andXbaI. PCWori+ DNA was digested withNdeI and XbaI, and the ends were dephosphorylated. The resulting nNOS cDNA and pCW plasmid were ligated, and the ensuing products were used to transform E. coli XL10-gold competent cells (Stratagene) using the manufacturer's instructions. Positive colonies were identified by restriction digest analysis of plasmid DNA isolated from small (2 ml) cultures of select colonies. For eNOS-tr1, glycine in position 1163 of bovine eNOS represents the residue aligned with the terminal serine of CPR. Preparation of parental plasmid bov-eNOSpCWori+ was described previously (30Martásek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The sense primer 5′-GACATCCTGAGAAACCGAGCTG-3′ was located between nucleotides 3276 and 3297 and the antisense primer 5-TATATGAATTCTCATCAGCCGAAAATGTCCTCGTGATAGC-3′ encompassed the codon for Gly-1163 followed by two stop codons and contains anEcoRI restriction site. A DNA product amplified by PCR using the parental plasmid as the template and above-mentioned oligonucleotides was digested by XhoI and EcoRI. The longer XhoI-EcoRI fragment was gel-purified. The parental plasmid was digested by XhoI-EcoRI; the longer fragment was gel-purified and ligated with theXhoI-EcoRI fragment from PCR. DNA from the new construct was sequenced in the PCR-amplified region using automated sequencing at the Center for Advanced DNA Technologies at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio. groELS was co-transformed with nNOSpCW-tr1 or eNOSpCW-tr1 into E. coli BL21 cells via electroporation using an Invitrogen Electroporator II (San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and plated on LB agar containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Protein expression and purification are as described in Roman et al. (29Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(30Martásek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The peak fraction of dimeric protein from the gel filtration column was used for all analyses described. Both nNOS-tr1 and eNOS-tr1 were purified in tandem with their wild-type forms to reduce differences resulting from preparation to preparation. Absolute spectra and CO difference spectra were performed as described (29Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The molar protein concentrations for nNOS and nNOS-tr1 were determined based on heme content via reduced CO difference spectra, where ε = 100 mm−1 cm−1for ΔA445–470. The molar protein concentrations for eNOS and eNOS-tr1 were determined based on spectral determination at Soret maximum after subtraction of extrapolated base line, using ε = 100 mm−1. This protein concentration determination was in good agreement with that of CO difference spectum. All spectral analyses were performed using a Shimadzu model 2101 UV-visible dual-beam spectrophotometer. Stopped-flow reactions were performed aerobically under turnover conditions at 23 °C, as described in Miller et al. (23Miller R.T. Martásek P. Omura T. Masters B.S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and Roman et al.(28Roman L.J. Miller R.T. de la Garza M.A. Kim J.-J.P. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol.

Reactions contained 2 μm enzyme, 100 μm NADPH, 10 μm H4B, and 100 μml-arginine in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl. Where indicated, 3 μm CaM was also added. Heme reduction was monitored at 397 nm, and flavin reduction was monitored at the 485 nm shoulder, rather than the absorption peak value at 455 nm, to avoid spectral interference from the heme. Nitric oxide formation (hemoglobin capture assay and/or [3H]arginine to citrulline assay) and cytochrome c reduction were measured at 23 °C as described by Sheta et al. (9Sheta E. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Martásek et al. (31Martásek P. Miller R.T. Roman L.J. Shea T. Masters B.S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), with the exception that the cytochrome creduction assays were performed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1 for reduced minus oxidized cyt c at 550 nm. NaCl was 0, 100, or 250 mm, as indicated in the figure or table legends. Ferricyanide reduction was performed the same as cyt c reduction except that 100 mm ferricyanide was used, and the extinction coefficient was 1.02 mm−1. Oxidation of NADPH was monitored at 340 nm in the presence of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 μm NADPH, and 26 nm truncated or 134 nm wild-type enzyme at 23 °C. In the case of NADPH oxidation under cyt creduction conditions, 250 mm NaCl was included. The rate was determined using an extinction coefficient of 6.2 mm−1 at 340 nm for NADPH. The reoxidation of reduced flavins was monitored at 485 nm for all enzymes in the presence of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 20 or 100 μm NADPH, and 2 μm enzyme at 23 °C. Fig. 1 shows the C-terminal final 8 amino acids of CPR and the co-alignment of several NOS sequences. Depicted are the murine iNOS, rat nNOS, and the bovine eNOS along with two non-mammalian sequences for comparison. All known NOSs appear to have additional C-terminal residues as compared with CPR. Also shown in the boxed region is a highly conserved 8-amino acid sequence just prior to the NOS tail. The penultimate amino acid in CPR, tryptophan, has been shown to be important for reductase activity. Specifically, it has been proposed to be involved in modulating the hydride transfer from NADPH to FAD and, in the crystal structure of CPR (32Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), it appears to be a shielding or stacking residue for the FAD. The aromatic property of this residue is completely conserved in all known NOSs, and deletion of the C terminus of iNOS including this residue to the C-terminal end yields a protein with only 30% of wild-type NO synthesis activity (27Xie Q.W. Cho H. Kashiwabara Y. Baum M. Weidner J.R. Elliston K. Mumford R. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28500-28505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 3L. J. Roman and B. S. S. Masters, unpublished observations.whereas deletion of only the additional tail residues, i.e.the final 21 amino acids, yields a protein with 15% higher activity (28Roman L.J.

The path of electron transfer through the NOSs is from NADPH to the FAD moiety, to FMN, and finally to the NOS heme (Scheme FS1). Like CPR, the NOSs also have the ability to reduce artificial electron acceptors, such as cyt c, DCIP, and ferricyanide. Cyt c and DCIP both accept electrons from the FMN, whereas ferricyanide can accept electrons directly from the FAD, as shown by its reduction by a CPR in which FMN has been removed (33Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8812-8819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Alexander L.M. Hersh L.B. Masters B.S.S. Coon M.J. Conney A.H. Estabrook R.W. Gelboin H.V. Gillette J.R. O'Brien P.J. Microsomes, Drug Oxidations, and Chemical Carcinogenesis. Academic Press, Inc., New York1980: 285-288Google Scholar). When the iNOS isoform was expressed without the C-terminal tail (minus the 21 residues of the C terminus), the rate of cyt c reduction was increased 10-fold (28Roman L.J.

It was not possible to examine the effect of CaM with iNOS-tr1 since the enzyme was expressed in the presence of CaM, which remains tightly bound. The constitutive enzymes, nNOS and eNOS, are easily expressed in the absence of CaM, whose binding is modulated by the calcium concentration. The rate of cyt c reduction by wild-type nNOS is stimulated about 10-fold by CaM (345versus 3860 min−1, in the absence and presence of CaM, respectively; Fig.2 A) and that of eNOS is stimulated about 3-fold (173 versus 478 min−1, in the absence and presence of CaM, respectively; Fig. 2 A). Surprisingly, both nNOS-tr1- and eNOS-tr1-catalyzed cyt c reduction are inhibited by CaM. Although the rates in the presence of CaM are similar for both the wild-type and truncated enzymes (3860 versus 4604, respectively, for nNOS and nNOS-tr1, and 478 versus 665, respectively, for eNOS and eNOS-tr1; Fig. 2 A), nNOS-tr1 reduces cyt c at a 56% higher rate than nNOS-tr1 in the presence of CaM and 21-fold faster than wild-type in its absence. Likewise, eNOS-tr1 reduces cyt c at a 85% higher rate than eNOS-tr1 in the presence of CaM and 7-fold faster than wild-type in its absence.Figure 2Reduction of artificial electron acceptors by intact and truncated NOSs. A, cytochrome creduction; B, ferricyanide reduction. The open bars are in the absence of CaM, and the solid bars are in the presence of CaM. The data for nNOS-wt and nNOS-tr1 are plotted against the left axis, and the data for eNOS-wt and eNOS-tr1 are plotted against the right axis. These data represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three separate assays. Assay conditions were as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and concentration of NaCl was 250 mm. The concentration of enzyme used for the nNOS experiments was 1 nm, and where present, the concentration of CaM was 50 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the most significant differences in rate between the wild-type and tr1 forms are seen in the absence of CaM, it was possible that the loss of the tail affected the binding of cyt c under these conditions. The Km and kcatvalues for cyt c in cyt c reduction by either wild-type or truncated enzyme were determined in the absence of CaM. There is no difference in the Km value in the absence of CaM between the wild-type and truncated forms for either nNOS or eNOS (approximately 2–3 μm; TableI), and thus the C-terminal tail probably does not directly affect binding of cyt c.Table IKinetic constants for Cyt c reductionEnzyme−CaM+CaMkcatKmEfficiencyaEfficiency iskcat/Km.kcatKmEfficiencymin−1μmmin−1μm−1min−1μmmin−1μm−1nNOS-wt2133.364.527245.4504nNOS-tr135482.1169022771.12070eNOS-wt282.411.71181.865.5eNOS-tr12872.2130.41520.9168.9These experiments were performed in the absence of NaCl. The addition of 250 mm NaCl increases the rate of NOS-mediated cytc reduction by about 3-fold (see rates in Fig. 2). The concentrations of enzymes used were as follows: nNOS-wt, 10 nm; nNOS-tr1, 1 nm; eNOS-wt, 30 nm; eNOS-tr1, 30 nm. These concentrations were chosen so that the absolute rate of cyt c reduction was in a reasonable range. The concentration of CaM was 60 nm for nNOS-wt, 30 nm for nNOS-tr1, and 100 nm for both eNOS enzymes. Assay conditions were as described under “Experimental Procedures.”a Efficiency iskcat/Km. Open table in a new tab These experiments were performed in the absence of NaCl. The addition of 250 mm NaCl increases the rate of NOS-mediated cytc reduction by about 3-fold (see rates in Fig. 2). The concentrations of enzymes used were as follows: nNOS-wt, 10 nm; nNOS-tr1, 1 nm; eNOS-wt, 30 nm; eNOS-tr1, 30 nm. These concentrations were chosen so that the absolute rate of cyt c reduction was in a reasonable range. The concentration of CaM was 60 nm for nNOS-wt, 30 nm for nNOS-tr1, and 100 nm for both eNOS enzymes. Assay conditions were as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To investigate further the effect of CaM on cyt c reduction, assays with both the wild-type and truncated enzymes were titrated with CaM, as shown in Fig. 3. With the wild-type enzyme, CaM is a nonessential activator of cyt creduction; it is not required for activity, but it potentiates the formation of reduced product. The kinetic constants for the wild-type enzymes were determined by varying the cyt c concentration in the absence of CaM and at saturating CaM concentrations, and the resulting data are shown in Table I. In the case of the wild-type nNOS, CaM at a saturating concentration increases the Km for cyt cby 1.6-fold and kcat by 13-fold. In the case of eNOS-wt, saturating CaM decreases the Km for cytc by 25% and increases kcat about 4-fold. As shown in Fig. 3, CaM clearly has an inhibitory effect on cytc reduction by nNOS-tr1, even at low concentrations of CaM. CaM and cytochrome c bind independently and reversibly to different sites on NOS to produce NOS·CaM, NOS·cytc, and NOS·CaM·cyt c complexes. Since both the NOS·cyt c and NOS·cyt c·CaM complexes can form product (reduced cyt c), with the NOS·cytc·CaM complex being less effective than NOS·cytc, and the activity reaches a minimum that is not zero, CaM must be a partial noncompetitive inhibitor of cyt credu"

The specific reaction catalyzed for the hydrolysis of the insecticide paraoxon is illustrated in Scheme FS1. Measurements of the kinetic constants for this enzyme have demonstrated that the turnover numbers are remarkably high. For example, the kcat and kcat/Km values for the hydrolysis of paraoxon approach 104s−1 and 108m−1 s−1, respectively (2Omburo G.A. Kuo J.M. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13278-13283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a naturally occurring substrate has not, as yet, been identified. We have speculated that this catalytic activity recently evolved from a preexisting enzyme, due in part to the widespread use of high levels of organophosphate insecticides throughout the world (3Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Adv. Enzymol. 2000; 74: 51-93PubMed Google Scholar).The three-dimensional structure of PTE was solved several years ago by x-ray crystallographic analyses and an α-carbon trace of one subunit of the homodimer is displayed in Fig. 1(4Benning M.M.

The native enzyme contains Zn2+, but the two divalent cations can be substituted with Cd2+, Co2+, Ni2+, or Mn2+ without loss of catalytic activity (2Omburo G.A. Kuo J.M. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13278-13283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two metal ions are coordinated to the protein via complexation with four histidine residues (His-55, His-57, His-201, and His-230) and a single carboxylate from Asp-301 (5Benning M.M. Kuo J.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7973-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition to these ligands, the two metal ions are bridged via a carboxylated lysine residue and a hydroxide from the solvent (5Benning M.M. Kuo J.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M.

The bridging hydroxide is thought to be the nucleophile for the hydrolytic attack on the phosphorus center of the substrate.Figure 1α-Carbon trace of one subunit of phosphotriesterase. The overall fold of phosphotriesterase is dominated by eight strands of parallel β-sheet that wrap around to form a barrel that is flanked on the outer surface by α-helices. There are two additional β-strands located at the N terminus that form an antiparallel β-sheet. The active site is located at the C-terminal portion of the β-barrel; the positions of the zinc ions are indicated by the yellow spheres, and the side chain ligands are displayed in ball-and-stickrepresentations. The metal bound hydroxide is indicated by the large red sphere. Those residues defining the small pocket (Ile-106, Leu-303, and Ser-308) and the large pocket (Met-317, Leu-271, and His-257) are labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The molecular structure of PTE has also been determined with the protein crystallized in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable inhibitor, diethyl 4-methylbenzyl phosphonate (Fig.2, compound I) (8Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The orientation of this inhibitor within the active site of PTE has defined the outlines of the binding pockets that accommodate the four substituents attached to the phosphorus core. In this structure, the pro-SP ethoxy group of the inhibitor is pointed away from the binuclear metal center and toward the solvent. It is positioned within the active site in a manner expected of the leaving group prior to nucleophilic attack by the bridging hydroxide. The pro-RP ethoxy group lies closest to the side chains of Ile-106, Leu-303, and Ser-308 (Fig. 1). The methylbenzyl substituent is pointed toward a pocket lined primarily with the side chains of His-257, Leu-271, and Met-317 (Fig. 1). Additionally, the phosphoryl oxygen of the inhibitor is located at 3.3 Å from the indole ring of Trp-131, 3.2 Å from the imidazole of His-201, and 3.5 Å from the more solvent-exposed divalent metal cation.Figure 2Substrates for phosphotriesterase. Compounds II and III are substrates for phosphotriesterase, whereas compounds I, IV, and V are the inhibitors employed in the structural analysis reported here. Compound VI is the chemical warfare agent sarin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A recent investigation of the substrate and stereochemical specificity of PTE has demonstrated that the active site of this protein will accommodate a variety of substituents attached to the phosphorus center (9Hong S.-B. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Any combination of methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, and phenyl groups is tolerated in a substrate library bearing p-nitrophenylate as the leaving group. However, PTE shows a marked preference for one stereoisomer over the other. For example, the value of kcat/Km for the SP-isomer of ethyl phenyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Fig. 2, compound II) is 100 times larger than the value for the RP-isomer (Fig. 2, compound III) when the Zn2+/Zn2+-substituted enzyme is utilized. Within this modest substrate library, the SP-isomer is always a better substrate than is the RP-isomer. The structural determinants to the substrate specificity and stereoselectivity have been assessed by molecular modeling of the more rapidly hydrolyzed SP-stereoisomer of ethyl phenyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate, for example, onto the three-dimensional structure of PTE with bound diethyl 4-methylbenzylphosphonate. If the p-nitrophenyl substituent is positioned in the leaving group pocket and the phosphoryl oxygen is placed where it is positioned in the bound inhibitor, then the two remaining substituents are fixed in space within respect to the other two binding regions. With the preferred SP-isomer, the larger and bulkier substituent is oriented in the same binding pocket as the methylbenzyl group of inhibitor I (Fig. 2), whereas the smaller substituent occupies the same binding pocket as the pro-RP ethoxy group. These binding regions have thus been assigned the names “large pocket,” formed by His-257, Leu-271, and Met-317, and “small pocket,” formed by Ile-106, Leu-303, and Ser-308. The relative stereochemical relationships between the substrates and inhibitors can be visualized from the structures presented in Fig. 2.The bacterial phosphotriesterase is a leading candidate for a bioremediation agent that could ultimately be employed for the widespread detoxification of agricultural insecticides and chemical warfare agents. However, the observed stereoselectivity and substrate specificity of the native enzyme dictate that mutant forms of this enzyme with enhanced catalytic properties must be obtained in order to accommodate the structural variations in the toxic compounds already in use. Therefore, structures of PTE complexed with other substrate analogs are essential to more fully quantify those molecular factors that dictate the binding orientations of ligands within the active site. This information is vital for the design of site-directed and combinatorial mutants of PTE. Here, we report the high resolution x-ray crystallographic structures of PTE complexed with diisopropyl methyl phosphonate (Fig. 2, compound IV) or triethyl phosphate (Fig. 2, compound V). The bacterial enzyme phosphotriesterase (PTE)1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of a wide range of organophosphate nerve agents, including the chemical warfare agents sarin, soman, and VX (1Caldwell S.R. Raushel F.M. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1991; 31: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The specific reaction catalyzed for the hydrolysis of the insecticide paraoxon is illustrated in Scheme FS1. Measurements of the kinetic constants for this enzyme have demonstrated that the turnover numbers are remarkably high. For example, the kcat and kcat/Km values for the hydrolysis of paraoxon approach 104s−1 and 108m−1 s−1, respectively (2Omburo G.A. Kuo J.M. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13278-13283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a naturally occurring substrate has not, as yet, been identified. We have speculated that this catalytic activity recently evolved from a preexisting enzyme, due in part to the widespread use of high levels of organophosphate insecticides throughout the world (3Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Adv. Enzymol. 2000; 74: 51-93PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of PTE was solved several years ago by x-ray crystallographic analyses and an α-carbon trace of one subunit of the homodimer is displayed in Fig. 1(4Benning M.M. Kuo J.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15001-15007Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 5Benning M.M. Kuo J.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7973-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The protein folds into an (αβ)8 motif that is very similar in size and shape to urease (6Jabri E. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A. Science. 1995; 268: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) and adenosine deaminase (7Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The active site is located adjacent to a binuclear metal center located within the αβ-barrel. The native enzyme contains Zn2+, but the two divalent cations can be substituted with Cd2+, Co2+, Ni2+, or Mn2+ without loss of catalytic activity (2Omburo G.A. Kuo J.M. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13278-13283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two metal ions are coordinated to the protein via complexation with four histidine residues (His-55, His-57, His-201, and His-230) and a single carboxylate from Asp-301 (5Benning M.M. Kuo J.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7973-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition to these ligands, the two metal ions are bridged via a carboxylated lysine residue and a hydroxide from the solvent (5Benning M.M. Kuo J.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7973-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The carboxylation of the ε-amino group of Lys-169 to form a carbamate functional group has also been observed in the structure of the related enzyme, urease (6Jabri E. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A. Science. 1995; 268: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The bridging hydroxide is thought to be the nucleophile for the hydrolytic attack on the phosphorus center of the substrate. The molecular structure of PTE has also been determined with the protein crystallized in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable inhibitor, diethyl 4-methylbenzyl phosphonate (Fig.2, compound I) (8Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).

Here, we report the purification of one of the representatives of the RAD51 family in human cells. We demonstrate that the purified RAD51L3 protein possesses single-stranded DNA binding activity and DNA-stimulated ATPase activity, consistent with the presence of “Walker box” motifs in the deduced RAD51L3 sequence. We have identified a protein complex in human cells containing RAD51L3 and a second RAD51 family member, XRCC2. By using purified proteins, we demonstrate that the interaction between RAD51L3 and XRCC2 is direct.

During meiosis, genetic recombination is required both for the generation of genetic diversity and for ensuring that segregation of homologous chromosomes occurs faithfully at meiosis I. In the mitotic cell cycle, the major role for recombination is probably in the elimination of DNA damage, including repair of DNA double strand breaks and cross-links (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In bacteria, the process of genetic recombination depends upon the RecA protein, which forms nucleoprotein filaments on DNA and promotes DNA strand exchange between homologous sequences (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2West S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 603-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Structural and functional homologs of RecA have been isolated from several other organisms, including yeasts and mammalian cells, where the genes have been designated RAD51 (3Aboussekhra A. Chanet R.

Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying a deletion of the RAD51 gene are viable but are highly sensitive to ionizing radiation and are defective in meiosis (7Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae Rad51 protein has been purified and shown to form nucleoprotein filaments and promote DNA strand exchange, albeit far less efficiently than does RecA (6Ogawa T., Yu, X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 9Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 10Sung P. Robberson D.L.

In contrast to yeast, the equivalent gene in mammalian cells (RAD51) has been shown to be essential for embryonic development, as determined by analysis of mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of the RAD51 gene (11Tsuzuki T. Fujii Y. Sakumi K. Tominaga Y. Nakao K. Sekiguchi M. Matsushiro A. Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6236-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 12Lim D.S. Hasty P. Mol. Cell.

These genes belong to the same epistasis group (theRAD52 group) and are therefore considered to operate in the same biochemical pathway (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This supposition has been validated through biochemical analyses, which have shown, for example, that Rad51p makes specific interactions with Rad52p, Rad54p, and Rad55p (13Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4843-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,14Hays S.L. Firmenich A.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Functional homologs of Rad52p and Rad54p have been identified in mammalian cells, and their biochemical properties have been partially characterized (15Essers J. Hendriks R.W. Swagemakers S.M.

Rad55p and Rad57p show some primary sequence similarity to RecA but do not appear to perform the same biochemical function(s) as Rad51p (13Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4843-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19Lovett S.T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 142: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Instead, Rad55p and Rad57p form a heterodimer that is thought to act as a Rad51 accessory factor greatly stimulating the efficiency with which Rad51 catalyzes DNA strand exchange (20Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Consistent with this important role in genetic recombination, rad55 and rad57 mutants have a phenotype similar to that of rad51 mutants, including extreme sensitivity to ionizing radiation (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To date, no obvious RAD55 and RAD57 orthologs have been identified in human cells. Nevertheless, several genes have been isolated from rodent and human cells that show a limited degree of sequence similarity to RAD51. These genes were identified either through data base searching (RAD51L1,RAD51L2, and RAD51L3, also known as RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D, respectively) or through functional complementation of x-ray-sensitive rodent cell mutants (XRCC2 and XRCC3) (21Albala J.S.

Although the functional roles of the RAD51L1/L2/L3 proteins can only be surmised at this stage, there is good evidence that the XRCC2 and XRCC3 proteins participate in genetic recombination processes. The mutants of Chinese hamster ovary (XRCC3) or V79 cells (XRCC2) defective in these proteins show mild sensitivity to ionizing radiation but extreme sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents (29Jones N.J. Cox R. Thacker J. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 30Fuller L.F. Painter R.B. Mutat. Res. 1988; 193: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Both mutants also show an elevated incidence of spontaneous and radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations (30Fuller L.F. Painter R.B. Mutat. Res. 1988; 193: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 31Tucker J.D. Jones N.J. Allen N.A. Minkler J.L. Thompson L.H. Carrano A.V. Mutat.

Moreover, theXRCC2 mutant cell line (irs1) displays a 100-fold decrease in the frequency of homologous recombinational repair of DNA double strand breaks (33Johnson R.D. Liu N. Jasin M. Nature. 1999; 401: 397-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence that XRCC3 also operates in the RAD51 pathway comes from the finding that the characteristic nuclear focal pattern of localization for RAD51 is disrupted in XRCC3mutants (34Bishop D.K. Ear U. Bhattacharyya A. Calderone C. Beckett M. Weichselbaum R.R. Shinohara A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21482-21488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).Although the sequence similarities of the human RAD51-like proteins to their yeast counterparts are limited, multiple protein sequence alignments of eukaryotic RAD51 family members suggest that RAD51L3 may be closer in structure to the yeast Rad57p than to the other family members (35Thacker J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Similarly, the closest human RAD51-like protein to Rad55p is XRCC2. The biochemical functions of these human RAD51-like proteins have not been explored, and therefore as a first step in understanding these functions, we have purified both RAD51L3 and XRCC2 following expression in Escherichia coli. We show that RAD51L3 is a DNA-stimulated ATPase that binds specifically to single-stranded DNA. We present evidence that RAD51L3 forms a complex with XRCC2 in human cells and that this interaction is direct.DISCUSSIONWe have expressed recombinant RAD51L3 cDNA in bacteria and obtained protein at an estimated purity of >90% using nickel chelate and heparin chromatography. By using antibodies raised to this protein, a single band of 35 kDa was detected in extracts from human cells, consistent with the molecular mass of RAD51L3 predicted from the nucleotide sequence (23Cartwright R. Dunn A.M. Simpson P.J. Tambini C.E. Thacker J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Pittman D.L. Weinberg L.R. Schimenti J.C. Genomics. 1998; 49: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). RAD51L3 is a member of the RecA/RAD51 family, but the similarity of the protein to human RAD51 protein is low and is confined primarily to the nucleotide-binding domains as well as a few residues dispersed over the remainder of the protein (35Thacker J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, the RAD51L3 protein is highly conserved from man to mouse (23Cartwright R. Dunn A.M. Simpson P.J. Tambini C.E. Thacker J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,24Pittman D.L. Weinberg L.R. Schimenti J.C. Genomics. 1998; 49: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting that it plays an important role in mammals. It is unlikely that this role is to act as a back-up to RAD51 in strand transfer reactions, because disruption of the RAD51 gene in mice leads to embryonic lethality (11Tsuzuki T. Fujii Y. Sakumi K. Tominaga Y. Nakao K. Sekiguchi M. Matsushiro A. Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6236-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 12Lim D.S. Hasty P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7133-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Hence, it is clear that none of the other RAD51-like proteins can replace the function of RAD51 itself.An important feature of all RecA/RAD51-like proteins is the presence of the Walker A and B boxes, which commonly indicate an ATPase function. Accordingly, site-directed mutagenesis of the S. cerevisiaeand human RAD51 proteins at highly conserved residues in the Walker A box leads to severe defects in function (7Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 38Donovan J.W. Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2552-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Similar experiments with S. cerevisiae Rad55p and Rad57p, which form a heterodimer and stimulate the action of Rad51p (20Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), have shown that mutation of the Walker A box of Rad55p, but not of Rad57p, disables function (13Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4843-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that ATP hydrolysis may be dispensable for some of the RecA/RAD51 family members. Here, we have shown that purified RAD51L3 has significant ATPase activity in the absence of DNA but that both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA stimulate this activity. The rate of hydrolysis of ATP by RAD51L3 is relatively slow but nevertheless similar to that of human RAD51. ATP hydrolysis by human RAD51 is 2 orders of magnitude slower than the rate shown by E. coli RecA, as noted previously (9Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 39Benson F.E. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 40Baumann P.

A. 1997; 94: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It may be that some modification of, or interaction between, the human RAD51-like proteins is required before a high rate of ATP hydrolysis is revealed. It remains to be tested whether interactions among the human RAD51-like proteins will influence this activity of RAD51L3 protein.An understanding of the DNA binding properties of members of the RAD51 family may help elucidate the roles that they play in the complex process of homologous recombination. The E. coli RecA protein binds preferentially to single-stranded DNA, but the RAD51 proteins from yeast and man bind single- and double-stranded DNA with a similar affinity (9Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 40Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2907-2915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA strand exchange proteins may reflect different requirements for co-factors or accessory proteins to promote DNA pairing and exchange. Indeed, in yeast, the Rad55/Rad57 heterodimer has an enhanced affinity for single-stranded DNA, and there is experimental support for a model in which these proteins facilitate the nucleation of Rad51 onto DNA by displacing the single-stranded DNA-binding protein, RPA (20Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Our finding that single-stranded DNA is the preferred substrate for binding by RAD51L3 is consistent with a similar facilitating role for this protein in human cells.As noted above, it is known that Rad55p and Rad57p interact to form a heterodimer and that these proteins have some sequence similarities to XRCC2 and RAD51L3, respectively. By using several different experimental approaches, we have shown that the RAD51L3 protein and the XRCC2 protein interact and that this interaction does not require additional accessory factors. First, to assess in vivo the interaction, we showed using the yeast two-hybrid system that XRCC2 interacts strongly with RAD51L3. Second, we showed that the RAD51L3 and XRCC2 proteins physically interact in pull-down experiments, both using purified recombinant proteins and human cell extracts. Finally, far Western analysis with the purified recombinant proteins showed that immobilized XRCC2 interacts with RAD51L3. These data argue strongly for the existence of a direct interaction between the RAD51L3 and XRCC2 proteins in vivo. Our gel filtration analysis is consistent with but does not prove that RAD51L3 and XRCC2 form a heterodimeric complex in human cells. It is significant that no protein was detected in the eluted fractions of a size expected for monomeric XRCC2 and RAD51L3.Additional studies are required to assess the functional significance of the XRCC2 and RAD51L3 interaction. Based on previous studies of the Rad55 and Rad57 proteins, we anticipate that the proposed heterodimer of XRCC2 and RAD51L3 will be required to promote the formation of RAD51 molecules on single-stranded DNA. The RAD51L3-XRCC2 complex could influence the loading of Rad51 onto DNA in the presence of single-stranded DNA-binding protein (20Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 43Gasior S.L. Wong A.K. Kora Y. Shinohara A. Bishop D.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2208-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) or help in the remodeling of chromatin at damaged sites subject to homologous recombination repair (44Sugawara N. Ivanov E.L. Fishman-Lobell J. Ray B.L. Wu X. Haber J.E. Nature. 1995; 373: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).In addition to RAD51L3 and XRCC2, there are currently three other members of the RAD51-like family in human cells as follows: XRCC3, RAD51L1, and RAD51L2. In a recent review article, Thompson and Schild (45Thompson L.H. Schild D. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) summarized their results of 2-hybrid analyses, which suggested that multiple interactions may occur between RAD51-like proteins, including an interaction between RAD51L3 and XRCC2. This raises the possibility that, rather than acting as a heterodimer in a manner analogous to yeast Rad55p and Rad57p, RAD51L3 and XRCC2 form part of a complex containing multiple RAD51-like proteins and possibly RAD51 itself. However, given the yeast paradigm of a Rad55/Rad57 heterodimer influencing Rad51-catalyzed reactions (20Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), together with our gel filtration data, it perhaps seems more likely that the RAD51L3/XRCC2 partnership is just one of several possible heterodimeric complexes that participate in genetic recombination reactions in mammalian cells.The irs1 mutant hamster cell line defective in XRCC2 shows a phenotype similar to that of yeast rad55/rad57 mutants in being x-ray-sensitive and deficient in genetic recombination. However, a striking feature of XRCC2-deficient cells is their extreme sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C (29Jones N.J. Cox R. Thacker J. Mutat. Res. 1987; 183: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the RAD51L3-XRCC2 complex is particularly important in those recombination functions that are required for the removal of DNA cross-links. This also suggests a possible scenario in which different combinations of the multiple RAD51-like proteins in human cells impart functionally different roles on RAD51.In summary, we have purified the human RAD51L3 protein and partially characterized its biochemical properties. We have also shown that RAD51L3 forms a complex with XRCC2 protein in vitro andin vivo. It is clear based on what we currently know about the roles of the RAD51-like proteins, such as from analysis of mutant cell lines lacking XRCC2 or XRCC3, that the correct functioning of the RAD51-like proteins is vital for the maintenance of genome stability in mammalian cells. The goal for the future is to determine how XRCC2 and RAD51L3 participate in recombination reactions in human cells. Genetic recombination is an essential process in eukaryotic cells with roles in both meiotic and mitotic cells. During meiosis, genetic recombination is required both for the generation of genetic diversity and for ensuring that segregation of homologous chromosomes occurs faithfully at meiosis I. In the mitotic cell cycle, the major role for recombination is probably in the elimination of DNA damage, including repair of DNA double strand breaks and cross-links (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In bacteria, the process of genetic recombination depends upon the RecA protein, which forms nucleoprotein filaments on DNA and promotes DNA strand exchange between homologous sequences (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2West S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 603-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Structural and functional homologs of RecA have been isolated from several other organisms, including yeasts and mammalian cells, where the genes have been designated RAD51 (3Aboussekhra A. Chanet R.

Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying a deletion of the RAD51 gene are viable but are highly sensitive to ionizing radiation and are defective in meiosis (7Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae Rad51 protein has been purified and shown to form nucleoprotein filaments and promote DNA strand exchange, albeit far less efficiently than does RecA (6Ogawa T., Yu, X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 9Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 10Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In contrast to yeast, the equivalent gene in mammalian cells (RAD51) has been shown to be essential for embryonic development, as determined by analysis of mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of the RAD51 gene (11Tsuzuki T. Fujii Y. Sakumi K. Tominaga Y. Nakao K. Sekiguchi M. Matsushiro A. Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6236-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 12Lim D.S. Hasty P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7133-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Efficient genetic recombination in S. cerevisiae requires several genes other than RAD51, including RAD52,RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, andRAD59. These genes belong to the same epistasis group (theRAD52 group) and are therefore considered to operate in the same biochemical pathway (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This supposition has been validated through biochemical analyses, which have shown, for example, that Rad51p makes specific interactions with Rad52p, Rad54p, and Rad55p (13Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4843-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,14Hays S.L. Firmenich A.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Functional homologs of Rad52p and Rad54p have been identified in mammalian cells, and their biochemical properties have been partially characterized (15Essers J. Hendriks R.W. Swagemakers S.M.

Rad55p and Rad57p show some primary sequence similarity to RecA but do not appear to perform the same biochemical function(s) as Rad51p (13Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4843-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19Lovett S.T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 142: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Instead, Rad55p and Rad57p form a heterodimer that is thought to act as a Rad51 accessory factor greatly stimulating the efficiency with which Rad51 catalyzes DNA strand exchange (20Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Consistent with this important role in genetic recombination, rad55 and rad57 mutants have a phenotype similar to that of rad51 mutants, including extreme sensitivity to ionizing radiation (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, no obvious RAD55 and RAD57 orthologs have been identified in human cells. Nevertheless, several genes have been isolated from rodent and human cells that show a limited degree of sequence similarity to RAD51. These genes were identified either through data base searching (RAD51L1,RAD51L2, and RAD51L3, also known as RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D, respectively) or through functional complementation of x-ray-sensitive rodent cell mutants (XRCC2 and XRCC3) (21Albala J.S.

https://openalex.org/W1994726128,"B-Raf contains multiple Akt consensus sites located within its amino-terminal regulatory domain. One site, Ser364, is conserved with c-Raf but two additional sites, Ser428 and Thr439, are unique to B-Raf. We have investigated the role of both the conserved and unique phosphorylation sites in the regulation of B-Raf activityin vitro and in vivo. We show that phosphorylation of B-Raf by Akt occurs at multiple residues within its amino-terminal regulatory domain, at both the conserved and unique phosphorylation sites. The alteration of the serine residues within the Akt consensus sites to alanines results in a progressive increase in enzymatic activity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, expression of Akt inhibits epidermal growth factor-induced B-Raf activity and inhibition of Akt with LY294002 up-regulates B-Raf activity, suggesting that Akt negatively regulates B-Raf in vivo. Our results demonstrate that B-Raf activity can be negatively regulated by Akt through phosphorylation in the amino-terminal regulatory domain of B-Raf. This cross-talk between the B-Raf and Akt serine/threonine kinases is likely to play an important role in modulating the signaling specificity of the Ras/Raf pathway and in promoting biological outcome."

Nevertheless, there are major differences between these two cytokines in terms of their cellular origins and the mechanisms controlling their synthesis and secretion.

In contrast to the predominantly T cell-restricted expression of IL-2 transcripts, there is widespread constitutive expression of IL-15 mRNA in a variety of tissues, including placenta, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, and heart, and fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and activated monocytes. Despite this widespread expression of IL-15 mRNA, detection of significant quantities of IL-15 protein in cell culture supernatants has proven to be extremely difficult. For example, IL-15 mRNA is induced in lipopolysaccharide/interferon-γ-activated monocytes, yet the supernatants as well as the lysates of such cells contain only trace amounts of IL-15, suggesting that IL-15 synthesis and secretion are negatively regulated at multiple levels (7Bamford R.N.

Furthermore, we and others have demonstrated that the negative regulation of IL-15 protein expression is associated with the use of an unusually long (48 aa) signal peptide (LSP). In particular, the LSP with its associated start codon with a poor Kozak configuration impedes IL-15 translation (5Bamford R.N. DeFilippis A.P. Azimi N. Kurys G. Waldmann T.A. J.

Recently, a second IL-15 isoform with a typically short (21 aa) signal peptide (SSP) was detected in small cell lung carcinoma cell lines, T cell lines, and a human testicular cDNA library (8Onu A.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to most signal peptides that are encoded by a single exon, IL-15 leader sequence isoforms are encoded by at least two exons. The LSP is encoded by exons 3–5 of the human IL-15 gene, whereas the SSP is encoded by exon 5 as well as by an additional 119-nucleotide sequence termed exon 4a located in intron 4 (9Meazza R.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the two signal peptides share 11 amino acids encoded by exon 5. The presence of exon 4a disrupts the LSP sequence by inserting a premature termination codon and then provides an alternate initiation codon with a poor Kozak context. Previous studies reported that protein associated with the SSP was not secreted, but rather was stored intracellularly and appeared in nuclear and cytoplasmic components as detected by confocal microscopy (8Onu A.

Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In the present study, expression constructs encoding combinations of the long signal peptide and mature proteins including those of IL-2, IL-15, and GFP were used to address the intracellular trafficking pathways and subcellular organelle fate of IL-15. LSP-IL-15 was relatively inefficiently translocated into the ER compared with IL-2; and therefore, some of LSP-IL-15 remained unprocessed in the cytoplasm, where the protein was degraded in proteasomes. Some of LSP-IL-15 entered the ER and was partially processed to yield a proposed 19-aa 3′-element of the LSP linked to the mature glycosylated protein. This alternatively cleaved IL-15 was not found to be secreted into the medium in this form. An additional trafficking pattern involved translocation of LSP-IL-15 into the ER, where the LSP was fully processed, and the protein was N-glycosylated and ultimately secreted as a 17-kDa cytokine by the classical Golgi route. The observed complex patterns of IL-15 trafficking suggest that control of intracellular trafficking must be added to the control of translation as a level of negative control of the expression of this inflammatory cytokine, whose indiscriminate expression might result in a serious inflammatory disorder. Furthermore, the demonstration that there are both secreted and intracellular fates for IL-15 is consistent with the view that this lymphokine may act both as an intercellular signaling agent and in intracellular signaling. The cell lines used in this study were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-human IL-15 and monoclonal mouse anti-GFP antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were purchased from Serotec (Raleigh, NC) andCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), respectively. For indirect immunofluorescence, the polyclonal rabbit anti-human IL-15 antibody used was a gift from Harmesh Sharma (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA); the polyclonal rabbit anti-IL-2 antibody was from Genzyme; fluorescein-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Texas Red-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-mouse IgG, and normal donkey serum were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA); and recombinant human IL-15 was from Peprotech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). The murine cytokine-dependent CTLL-2 cell line was used to quantitate IL-15 activity as described previously (11Tagaya Y. Kurys G. Thies T.A. Losi J.M. Azimi N. Hanover J.A. Bamford R.N. Waldmann T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14444-14449Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). COS cell transfection was performed as described (1Bamford R.N. Grant A.J. Burton J.D. Peters C. Kurys G. Goldman C.K. Brennan J. Roessler E. Waldmann T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4940-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). A total of 8 × 106COS cells were electroporated (240 V, 950 microfarads) with the indicated construct with 10 μg of plasmid DNA and distributed evenly into two tissue culture dishes with 5 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium in each. 72 h post-transfection, the supernatant was removed, and 1 ml of fresh complete medium was added to each dish with or without the addition of brefeldin A (Epicentre Technologies Corp., Madison, WI) at 0.5 μg/ml for 8 h. After 8 h, supernatants were harvested and checked for IL-15 concentrations by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Genzyme). The pEF-Neo/ΔAUG-IL-15 expression construct used to express IL-15LSP-IL-15mp (where mp is mature protein) and pEF-Neo/IL-2SP-IL-15mp were described previously (5Bamford R.N. DeFilippis A.P. Azimi N. Kurys G. Waldmann T.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4418-4426PubMed Google Scholar). The pEF-Neo/GFP construct was also described previously (11Tagaya Y. Kurys G. Thies T.A. Losi J.M. Azimi N. Hanover J.A. Bamford R.N. Waldmann T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14444-14449Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For generation of the pEF-Neo constructs for IL-15LSP-GFP, IL-2SP-GFP, IL-15LSP-IL-15mp-GFP, and IL-2SP-IL-2mp-GFP, coding sequences for the signal peptides or coding sequences for both the signal peptide and mature protein were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from existing constructs. Primer designs were as follows: IL-15LSP, primer 1 (sense), 5′-GCCATCGATACCATGAGAATTTCGAAACCACAT-3′ (ClaI site underlined), and primer 2 (antisense), 5′-GCCACGCGTGTTGGCTTCTGTTTTAGGAAGCCC-3′ (MluI); IL-2SP, primer 3 (sense), 5′-GCCATCGATACCATGTACAGGATGCAACTC-3′ (ClaI), and primer 4 (sense), 5′-GCCACGCGTTGCACTGTTTGTGACAAGTGCAAG-3′ (MluI); IL-15LSP-IL-15mp, primer 1 above (sense) and primer 5 (antisense), 5′-GCC ACGCGT AGAAGTGTTGATGAACATTTG-3′ (MluI); IL-2SP-IL-2mp primer 3 above (sense) and primer 6 (antisense), 5′-GCCACGCGTAGTCAGTGTTGAGATGATGCTTTG-3′ (MluI). The polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments above were TA-cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA.) and subsequently subcloned into pEF-Neo/GFP. Unless otherwise indicated, 1 × 107 COS cells in 0.4 ml of RPMI 1640 medium were electroporated with 15 μg of the indicated construct (250 V, 950 microfarads). Electroporated cells were equally aliquoted into five 60-mm dishes in 3 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium; one dish was used for each time point during the chase. At 48 h, cells were Cys/Met-starved for 30 min in Cys/Met-free RPMI 1640 medium with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum in the presence or absence of tunicamycin at a 5 μg/ml final concentration. For experiments involving lactacystin, starvation was for 1 h in presence or absence of lactacystin (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) at a 20 μm final concentration. Each dish was then pulsed with 150 μCi of [35S]Cys/Met (Express labeling mixture, NEN Life Science Products). After 10–15 min of labeling at 37 °C, cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then 3 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium was added as a cold chase, with tunicamycin or lactacystin maintained in the corresponding dishes. Lysates were made at the indicated time points in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-H Cl (pH 7.4), 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies using Ultralink-immobilized protein A/G beads (Pierce). Procedures, including incubation times, antibody concentrations, and washings, closely followed the manufacturers' recommendations. For all studies except those requiring EndoH digestion, proteins were eluted from the protein A/G beads in SDS sample buffer. For EndoH experiments, proteins were eluted from the beads in EndoH buffer (0.1 msodium phosphate (pH 6.1) containing 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton-X, and 0.2% SDS) by heating to 95 °C for 10 min. Digestion with EndoH (Oxford Glycosystems, Abingdon, United Kingdom) at a 0.1 milliunit/μl final concentration at 37 °C was carried out overnight, followed by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Unless otherwise stated, IL-2SP-IL-15mp and IL-15LSP-IL-15mp proteins were electrophoresed on 16% Tris/glycine-SDS gels, and all GFP chimeric proteins were run on 12% Tris/glycine-SDS gels. Gels were fixed, incubated in Enlightening autoradiography enhancer (DuPont), dried, and exposed to film. There are multifaceted controls of IL-15 expression at the levels of transcription, translation, and intracellular trafficking. The patterns of trafficking and secretory control alone are exceedingly complex. To obtain insights into these diverse patterns, experiments were performed employing different combinations of the LSPs and mature proteins, including IL-2, IL-15, and GFP. In preliminary experiments using SDS-PAGE, we characterized the intracellular forms of LSP-IL-15 biosynthesized by COS cells transfected with a pEF-Neo/LSP-IL-15mp construct containing the native IL-15 coding sequence, including the LSP. Following a 15-min labeling with [35S]Cys/Met, IL-15 was immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal anti-IL-15 antibody and resolved by SDS-PAGE. At least six species of IL-15 were observed that, as shown below, reflect N-linked glycosylation and alternative processing of the LSP of IL-15. Experiments were designed to facilitate the identification of the particular contributions of these two processes to the complex protein patterns observed with IL-15. First, to examine the contribution of N-glycosylation, COS cells were transiently transfected with a pEF-Neo/IL-2SP-IL-15mp construct consisting of the human IL-15 mature protein coding sequence linked to the sequence encoding the IL-2 signal peptide that does not manifest alternative processing. Parallel studies focusing on the processing of the IL-15 LSP were performed in the presence of tunicamycin to prevent N-linked glycosylation. IL-15 has three potential glycosylation sites (Asn-X-(Ser/Thr)) in the mature protein coding sequence based on its sequence analysis (Fig.1 a). The number of functional sites was determined by transient transfection into COS cells with the fusion construct pEF-Neo/IL-2SP-IL-15mp. In this experiment, substitution of the 48-aa LSP of IL-15 with that of IL-2 enabled us to separate glycosylation events from signal peptide processing events and simplified our analysis of the number of bands on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were expressed in COS cells in the absence (Fig. 1 b) or presence (Fig. 1 c) of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, and were recovered by immunoprecipitation using the polyclonal anti-human IL-15 antibody. Based on the difference in the number of bands on SDS-PAGE between untreated cells (three bands; Fig. 1 b) and tunicamycin-treated cells (one band; Fig. 1 c), the number of functional N-linked glycosylation sites on IL-15 is two or more. The unglycosylated fully processed protein ran at 12.7 kDa in Fig. 1 (b and c). We next examined the species obtained when COS cells were treated with tunicamycin following transfection with pEF-Neo/LSP-IL-15mp, which consists of the native IL-15 coding sequence with the LSP. Instead of a single species on SDS-PAGE, as had been obtained with IL-2SP-IL-15mp when tunicamycin was present, we now obtained three unglycosylated species with IL-15LSP-IL-15mp in the presence of tunicamycin at 18.8, 14.5, and 13.0 kDa (Fig.2). The constructs differed only in the coding sequence for the SP. We therefore considered the possibility that these forms arose from differences in SP cleavage. To investigate whether these forms arose from differences in SP cleavage, a pEF-Neo fusion construct was synthesized in which the coding sequence for the LSP of IL-15 was fused with the GFP coding sequence (expected molecular mass for the fusion protein of 33 kDa). The GFP translation start site was removed, enabling translation to occur at the start site of the IL-15 LSP. Furthermore, since GFP has no potential glycosylation site, it provided us a simpler means to interpret bands observed by gel electrophoresis. In addition, the use of the IL-15LSP-GFP fusion protein allowed us to use the monoclonal anti-GFP antibody for immunoprecipitation, thus eliminating the possibility that the three bands seen in Fig. 2 were nonspecific products immunoprecipitated by the polyclonal anti-human IL-15 antibody. We compared IL-15LSP-GFP with a GFP control (expected molecular mass of 27 kDa) in the same vector (Fig.3). As predicted, three bands were obtained for IL-15LSP-GFP from cell lysates (32.4 = uncleaved LSP, 29.2 = alternatively cleaved, and 27.9 = fully cleaved), whereas only one band was obtained for GFP without the LSP (27.9 kDa). (Fig. 3). In the IL-15LSP-GFP lanes, it would appear that the 29.2-kDa band results from an endoprotease cleavage point located upstream of the cleavage site that yields the mature protein. This alternative cleavage may occur between Ala29 and Gly30 of the signal sequence based on the Kyle-Doolittle hydrophilicity profile (Fig. 4) and on the size of the band that is comparable to that of IL-15SSP-GFP, which has a 21-aa SP. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence in this area (Thr27-Glu28-Aal29) has the same tripeptide as the downstream mature protein cleavage site (i.e.Thr46-Glu47-Ala48).Figure 4Hydrophilicity profile of LSP-IL-15. The proposed alternative cleavage site of the LSP is shown C-terminal to Ala29 in the 48-aa SP and is indicated with an arrow in the hydrophilicity profile. The mature protein cleavage site (between Ala 48 and Asn49) is also shown with an arrow in the same profile.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) More support for alternative cleavage within the LSP of IL-15 comes from experiments with IL-15LSP(ΔEx5)-GFP, an artificial engineered deletion construct in which the amino acids encoded by exon 5 have been eliminated, thus removing the mature protein cleavage site. We compared this construct with a GFP control in the same vector (Fig.5). Two bands could be seen for IL-15LSP(ΔEx5)-GFP (at 30.2 and 27.9 kDa). The lower of these bands (27.9 kDa) migrated just slightly higher than the single band in the GFP control lane (at 27.3 kDa). The presence of the 27.9-kDa band in the IL-15LSP(ΔEx5)-GFP lane therefore shows that although LSP(ΔEx5) lacks the mature protein cleavage site, an alternative cleavage can still occur within the signal peptide. The slightly higher migration of this band relative to the GFP control band would be in accordance with the few amino acids C-terminal to the proposed alternative cleavage site encoded by exon 4, namely GIHVFILG, which would remain attached to GFP following cleavage. Previous in vitro translation experiments in cell-free rabbit reticulocyte and wheat germ systems (in the absence of microsomes) performed with an IL-15LSP-IL-15mp construct yielded a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a molecular mass that indicated that translation initiates at the first AUG start site (5Bamford R.N. DeFilippis A.P. Azimi N. Kurys G. Waldmann T.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4418-4426PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the bands suspected to result from alternative cleavage of the LSP (at 14.5 kDa in Fig. 2, 29.2 kDa in Fig. 3, and 27.9 kDa in Fig. 5) do not appear to be the result of alternative initiation. We wished to determine whether the species with the fully cleaved (48-aa) LSP (13.0 kDa in Fig. 2) arose from a stepwise processing of the alternatively cleaved form (at 14.5 kDa in Fig. 2). To address this question, COS cells were transfected with pEF-Neo/IL-15LSP-IL-15mp and subjected to a short pulse of [35S]Cys/Met in the presence of tunicamycin (5 min as opposed to 15 min in the above-mentioned experiments), followed by rapid harvest of the lysate (at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 min). The results show that at the 0 chase time point, the alternatively cleaved form (at 15.3 kDa) was barely detectable, whereas the fully cleaved form (migrating at 13.6 kDa) was readily visible (data not shown). The ratio of the 15.3- and 13.6-kDa bands was relatively constant throughout the experiment. This result suggests that the alternative cleavage occurs as a separate event and that the majority of the fully cleaved form is not the result of further processing of the alternatively cleaved form. In the absence of tunicamycin, six distinct IL-15 forms were generated from pEF-Neo/LSP-IL-15mp in the COS cell translation system precipitated with the polyclonal anti-human IL-15 antibody (at 24.9, 21.9, 20.1, 19.1, 17.6, and 16.1 kDa in Fig.6). In an effort to determine which of the forms represent ER species, an aliquot of immunoprecipitated IL-15LSP-IL-15mp obtained from tunicamycin-untreated cell lysates was digested with EndoH. EndoH cleaves the high mannose N-linked glycans found on ER resident proteins, the loss of which results in a protein with a faster mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The modifications of glycans that occur in the medial Golgi result in EndoH resistance. All but one of the six forms of IL-15LSP-IL-15mp displayed full EndoH sensitivity. Only the 19.1-kDa band appeared EndoH-resistant. Although only the 0 time point is shown in Fig. 6, the Endo H sensitivity pattern was maintained throughout a 4-h chase. Based on the molecular masses of the three highest bands at the 0 time point in the absence of EndoH in Fig. 6 (at 24.9, 21.9, and 20.1 kDa), it would appear that at least some of IL-15 is capable of t"

In addition to the Na+-K+-Cl−cotransporter, this family now includes the furosemide-sensitive Na+-independent K+-Cl−cotransporter (KCC) and the thiazide-sensitive K+-independent Na+-Cl−cotransporter (NCC 2NCC is also called thiazide-sensitive cotransporter.; see Ref.8Gamba G.

Within the families, the CCCs share 25–75% amino acid identity (see Fig. 2). Two types of NKCCs have been identified to date, the widely distributed NKCC1 (3Xu J. Lytle C. Zhu T.T. Payne J.A. Benz E.

Not surprisingly, several splice variants of the CCCs have been identified in recent years.Figure 2Cladogram of the CCC family.

The central hydrophobic domain exhibits the highest levels of sequence conservation among the CCC family members; this is consistent with the presumed importance of the tms in ion movement (1Isenring P.

Considerable indirect evidence indicates that the CCCs interact with other proteins. For example, changes in cell volume and in intracellular Cl− (Cl-i) affect cation-Cl− cotransport (1Isenring P.

U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8575-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), thus implying that associations form between the carriers and kinases and/or phosphatases. Substantial data also support the notion of CCC regulation by phosphorylation-independent mechanisms, occurring in part through structural interactions with the cytoskeleton (21Kelley S.J. Dunham P.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1122-C1130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Matthews J.B. Smith J.A. Tally K.J. Awtrey C.S. Nguyen H. Rich J. Madara J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15703-15709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, Matthews et al. (22Matthews J.B. Smith J.A. Tally K.J. Awtrey C.S. Nguyen H. Rich J. Madara J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15703-15709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have found that NKCC1 was functionally linked to F-actin during cAMP-elicited electrogenic Cl− secretion. Finally, recent studies (23Ichinose M. Hall A.E. Cheng S. Xu J.Z. Hebert S.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10 (Abstr. A0176): 34Google Scholar, 24Plata C. Mount D.B. Rubio V. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F359-F366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that NKCCs form homo-oligomers at the cell surface of Xenopus laevis oocytes provide further evidence that the CCCs can assemble with other macromolecules. Through BLAST searches of human and mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases, we have identified novel overlapping sequences homologous to a region in the carboxyl terminus of the CCCs. Corresponding cDNAs were isolated from a human heart cDNA library. The full-length clone, termed WO3.3, was found to encode a 914-residue polypeptide that is ∼25% identical to each of the known CCCs. In heterologous expressions systems, this novel CCC inhibits human (h) NKCC1-mediated transport, possibly through heterodimer formation at the cell surface. Hence, WO3.3 is denoted CCC-interacting protein type 1 (CIP1). In June 1998, a BLAST search of the GenBankTM data base enabled the identification of ESTs that were 25% identical to known CCCs. These sequences appeared to cover the carboxyl terminus and the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of a putative transporter corresponding to a member of a new CCC family branch. The cDNA of one of these ESTs (clone number aa104358) was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium EST project (25Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). A 500-bp BamHI fragment excised from aa104358 was gel-purified, random-labeled with 32P, and used to screen a λZAP II human heart cDNA library purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Hybridization was performed in 2× PIPES buffer, 50% formamide, 0.5% SDS, and 10 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm at 42 °C. The most stringent wash was in 0.5× SCC and 0.5% SDS at 55 °C. Height-positive plaques (out of 5 × 106plated plaques) were carried through 2 or 3 rounds of screening and excised from λZAP as pBluescript phagemids using the Stratagene ExAssist phage. Restriction analysis revealed that 6 of the 8 clones were identical. The three different cDNAs (named WO3.3, WO2.6, and WO2.2) were sequenced using fluorescent dye terminators. The longest cDNA, WO3.3, was found to contain a 2472-open reading frame starting at base pair (bp) 128, with the first methionine downstream of a stop codon, and finishing at bp 2869; WO2.6 and WO2.2 were smaller overlapping clones. Sequence analyses and tree constructions were carried out with DNAStar (Lasergene) and GCG programs. BLAST searches were performed with the NCBI BLAST program and structure predictions with the BCM Search Launcher TMpred program. WO3.3 was eventually assigned to CIP1, based on additional characterizations. The WO3.3/hCIP1 cDNA (3276 bp), originally in the vector pBluescript II SK (pBS), was subcloned in theKpnI-AvrII sites of the mammalian expression vector pJB20M as a KpnI-SpeI fragment, and in the oocyte expression vector Pol1 as anEcoRI fragment.

Pol1 is a modified pGEM vector containing (5′ to 3′) the T7 promoter sequence, the X. laevis β-globin 5′-UTR, a multiple cloning site, the X. laevis β-globin 3′-UTR, a poly(A) tract, and linearizing sites. hCIP1/pBS was c-Myc-tagged by inserting pairs of oligonucleotides 3The upper c-Myc oligonucleotide was gtcacctaac ccatttgtgg cttcctctac ctgtgctcag ccatggaaca aaaactaatc tccgaggagg acct, and the lower c-Myc oligonucleotide was catgaggtcc tcctcggaga ttagtttttg ttccatggct gagcacaggtagaggaagcc acaaatgggt tag. at the 5′ end of the cDNA between the sites BstEII (bp 85) andNcoI (bp 126). This assembly adds a leader sequence, MEQKLISEEDL, in front of the first original methionine. The c-Myc-tagged inserts were then transferred from pBS to the expression vectors as described above. To examine the function of other CCCs in the X. laevisexpression system, we transferred full-length insert cDNAs from pBS to Pol1. The rabbit (rb) KCC1 insert (7Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A.

To permit ligation between inserts and vectors, the XhoI andHindIII sites were pretreated with mung bean nuclease. Chromosomal assignment of hCIP1 was obtained with the Genebridge IV human/rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panel (Research Genetics). Genomic DNA was amplified through PCRs with primers 4To amplify the 3′-UTR of hCIP1, the 5′ oligonucleotide was gctaggtaga gagggcccag and the 3′ oligonucleotide was cggtgagtct ggccaaaatg. derived from the 3′-UTR of hCIP1. The PCR products were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis and scored according to size correctness (310 bp) and amplification yield. Results were analyzed using the radiation hybrid server and the summary human gene maps of chromosome 7. A CLONTECH human Multiple Tissue Northern (MTNTM) Blot kit containing ∼2 μg/lane poly(A) was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes synthesized by random primer extension from a gel-purified hCIP1BamHI fragment or from a commercial human β-actin fragment. Conditions for hybridization were as recommended byCLONTECH's user manuals. At near-confluence, HEK-293 cells were transfected with 40 μg of the hCIP1, the c-Myc-tagged hCIP1, or the hNKCC1 cDNA by calcium phosphate precipitation (0.75 mmNa2HPO4, 125 mm CaCl2, pH 7.1). Starting 48 h after transfection, cells were selected for G418 resistance (950 μg/ml) in growth medium (see Refs. 14Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol.

Protein expression was estimated by either 86Rb+ flux measurements for hNKCC1-transfected cells or by Western blotting for c-Myc-tagged hCIP1-transfected cells; in both cases, approximately half of the cell lines exhibited significant expression. For expression in the X. laevis oocyte, cDNA inserts in the Pol1 vector were linearized and transcribed in vitrowith T7 RNA polymerase using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 kit (Ambion). Defolliculated stage V–VI oocytes were injected with 50 nl of H2O or with ∼5–25 ng of cRNA diluted in 50 nl of H2O. Functional expression was assessed 3–4 days after injection. Transfected HEK-293 cells were grown to near-confluence and lysed in buffer X (10% glycerol, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors. The cell lysates were precleared by a 15-min microcentrifugation (15,000 × gat 4 °C) yielding protein concentrations of ∼1 μg/μl. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated 1 h at 4 °C with different antibodies as follows: a rabbit anti-CIP1 antiserum (anti-C1), a mouse anti-NKCC monoclonal antibody (T4; see Ref. 29Lytle C.Y. Xu J.C. Biemesderfer D. Forbush III, B. Am. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25428-25437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The T4 antibody is highly specific to the NKCCs as previously shown (29Lytle C.Y. Xu J.C. Biemesderfer D. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1496-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sensitivity of T4 is usually increased with prior SDS denaturation. However, it remains possible to T4-immunoprecipitate NKCC1 directly from Triton extracts; for example, T4-immunoprecipitated proteins from shark NKCC1-transfected HEK-293 cell extracts can be detected by J3 (results not shown). Western analyses of c-Myc-tagged hCIP1-transfected HEK-293 cells and of mock-transfected HEK-293 cells show an ∼150–200-kDa NKCC-specific signal with the T4 antibody (results not shown) but no signals at the expected ∼90–100-kDa size for hCIP1 (as shown in Fig.5 with anti-c-Myc). This result indicates that T4 does not react with hCIP1 directly. For the anti-c-Myc antibody used in this study, we used the 9E10 antibody (from Sigma).The lysates were then reincubated 30 min at 4 °C with Sepharose A. Bound antigens were microcentrifuged (15,000 × g at 4 °C) and washed 4 times in buffer X. The antigen was released by incubating Sepharose pellets 2 min at 100 °C in protein sample buffer. For Western blots, proteins from cell lysates or immunoprecipitations were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels using the Tricine system (1Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and transferred to nylon membranes. Blots were incubated with anti-C1, T4, anti-c-Myc, or J3 and reincubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG. Bound antibody was visualized with the ECL assay. Immunofluorescence studies of HEK-293 cells expressing c-Myc-tagged-hCIP1 were conducted as described previously (1Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and incubated sequentially with anti-c-Myc or anti-C1, and a rhodamine-conjugated secondary anti-IgG. Immunolocalization studies of hNKCC1 and hCIP1 in oocytes were also performed as described previously (30Tanphaichitr V.S. Sumboonnanonda A. Ideguchi H. Shayakul C. Brugnara C. Takao M. Veerakul G. Alper S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 2173-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Here, egg cryosections (5 μm) were postfixed 3 min in acetone, incubated with T4 or anti-C1, and detected with rhodamine- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-IgG. HEK-293 cells were grown to confluence in 96-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine, and oocytes were maintained 3–4 days in Barth medium at 18 °C. Ion transport rates were determined by 86Rb+,22Na+, or 36Cl− flux measurements, and all experiments were performed at ∼22 °C. Different media were used for the functional studies (see Table I, figure legends, and “Results” for details). In these studies, regular medium designates a physiological iso-osmolar solution with a pH of 7.4. When necessary, osmolality was adjusted with sucrose; cations were replaced by N-methylglucamine and anions by SO42− or gluconate, and solutions were supplemented with inhibitors, such as furosemide (125–250 μm), bumetanide (250 μm),N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; 1 mm), or ouabain (10 μm).Table IComposition of flux solutionsNa+Rb+Cl−Ca2+Mg2+PO42−SO42−HEPGLU−SUCosmmmOocytes Hypo-osmolar low Cl−43.52.5411115390100 Hypo-osmolar43.52.5431111500100 Regular medium8758622221000200 Modified regular medium (low K+)870.1 to 18622221000200 Hyperosmolar87586222210085285 Barth medium90.4089.60.740.8200.821000200HEK-293 Hypo-osmolar low Cl−772.520.50.5117.5700163 Hypo-osmolar772.5720.50.5117.500163 Regular medium154514411221500326 Hyperosmolar15451441122150100426Barth medium also contains 1 mm K+, 0.66 mm NO32−, and 2.4 mmHCO3−.

Then, HEK-293 cells were incubated for 2–5 min and oocytes for 1–6 h in various media containing ouabain and 1–2 μ Ci/ml 86Rb+, 22Na+, or36Cl−. Fluxes were terminated by washing cells several times in regular medium + ouabain. For efflux experiments, cells were loaded with the tracer (1–2 μCi/ml) for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + fetal bovine serum (HEK-293 cells) or for 20 h in Barth medium + 125 μm furosemide (oocytes). After the loading period, cells were reincubated for timed intervals in a tracer-free medium containing ouabain ± NEM. Effluxes were terminated as for the influx assays. After the final washes for both the influx and efflux studies, cells were solubilized in 2% SDS, and the activity of86Rb+, 22Na+, or36Cl− was detected by liquid β-scintillation counting using the TopCountNXT microplate counter (Packard). Flux rates from individual oocytes are presented as the means ± S.E. of 1–4 experiments. Sequence alignments shown in Fig. 1 indicate that the deduced amino acid sequence of WO3.3 (hCIP1) shares 27% identity with that of both hKCC1 and hNKCC1 and 22% identity with that of hNCC. Human CIP1 is also homologous to a 952-amino acid Caenorhabditis elegans protein (41% identity) and to the 1120-amino acid YBR235wSaccharomyces cerevisiae protein (31% identity). The phylogenetic relationships between these various CCCs and two other members of the family (hNKCC2A and hKCC3) are illustrated in Fig.2. It can be seen that the recently discovered hCIP1 corresponds to a member of a new CCC family branch, which would also include a putative C. eleganshomologue. As for previously characterized CCCs, topology analyses of hCIP1 (Fig.3) predict a 12-tm region flanked by cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini. The greatest sequence conservation is present in the membrane-associated domain (particularly in the intracellular loop following tm2) and in a short carboxyl-terminal domain ∼140 residues downstream of tm12. Two N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn228 and Asn243) are found in an ∼55-residue loop between tm5 and tm6 (Figs. 1and 3), and 5 candidate sites for protein kinase C phosphorylation are present in the carboxyl terminus. To localize CIP1 on the human chromosome, we screened the Genebridge IV somatic cell hybrid panel by PCR using cDNA-specific primers4 derived from the 3′-UTR. The gene of interest was assigned to locus 7q22 between markers D7S651 and D7S518 at approximately 112 centimorgans from top of the linkage group of chromosome 7. According to GeneMap ‘99, there are at least 8 known genes in the interval (CUTL1, MPPB, PMS2L12, TAC2, TRRAP, MCM7, CYP3A7, and NPTX2) as well as 28 ESTs not associated to these genes. Based on the OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) morbid map, genetic disorders or susceptibilities mapping to 7q22 have all been linked to candidate genes. The level of expression and the tissue distribution of CIP1 were analyzed by Northern blot. A probe was derived from the 500-bp WO3.3 BamHI fragment, which includes ∼225 bp of the carboxyl terminus coding sequences and ∼275 bp of 3′-UTR. As shown in Fig. 4, ∼3.8-kb transcripts are detected at high levels in several tissues, including placenta, brain, and kidney. A less prominent message is found in lung and liver and a slightly smaller message (∼3.6-kb) in heart, liver, and muscle. A shorter exposure time of the blot also revealed a muscle-specific ∼5.1-kb transcript (results not shown). Anti-C1 was derived from the synthetic peptide GPRDIRLTPRPGPNG, which corresponds to a segment of hCIP1 between residues 215 and 229; this segment is in the putative 3rd extracellular loop of hCIP1 where consensus sites forN-glycosylation are found. The anti-C1-specific signal is relatively weak, suggesting that the antibody has low affinity for hCIP1. Regarding anti-C1 specificity, it was assessed as follows: 1) positive anti-c-Myc detection of anti-C1-immunoprecipitated proteins from c-Myc-tagged hCIP1-transfected HEK-293 cells but not from hCIP1- or mock-transfected cells (see Fig. 10, right panel); 2) positive anti-C1 detection of anti-c-Myc-precipitated proteins from c-Myc-tagged hCIP1-transfected HEK-293 cells but not of anti-c-Myc-precipitated proteins from hCIP1-transfected HEK-293 cells (results not shown); 3) absent anti-C1 detection of J3-precipitated proteins from c-Myc-tagged hCIP1-transfected HEK-293 cells (results not shown); here, J3 was"
https://openalex.org/W2005647067,"High resolution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra at 303.6 MHz (corresponding to a1H resonance frequency of 750 MHz) have been obtained of perchloric acid extracts of Trypanosoma brucei,Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania major, the causative agents of African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease, and leishmaniasis. Essentially complete assignments have been made based on chemical shifts and by direct addition of authentic reference compounds. The results indicate the presence of high levels of short chain condensed polyphosphates: di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentapolyphosphate. 31P NMR spectra of purified T. brucei, T. cruzi, and L. majoracidocalcisomes, calcium and phosphorus storage organelles, indicate that polyphosphates are abundant in these organelles and have an average chain length of 3.11–3.39 phosphates. In the context of the recent discovery of several pyrophosphate-utilizing enzymes in trypanosomatids, the presence of these inorganic polyphosphates implies a critical role for these molecules in these parasites and a potential new route to chemotherapy.

New chemotherapeutic leads based on unique aspects of parasite biology are therefore of great interest, particularly in the case of emerging resistance to traditional treatments.One approach to the discovery of new drug targets is to identify metabolic pathways in parasites that are essential for parasite survival but do not have an equivalent in the host. Then, one can pursue specific inhibitors of such metabolic activities as possible means of controlling the parasites without damaging the host. NMR spectroscopy has already been used by several groups to investigate the carbohydrate and/or phosphate metabolism of protozoa, includingCrithidia fasciculata (1de los Santos C. Buldain G.

In Tetrahymena, large levels of pyrophosphate were found, and more recently we have found similarly large levels of pyrophosphate in T. cruzi (10Urbina J.A. Moreno B. Vierkotter S. Oldfield E.

These observations are of interest since a number of protozoa are already known to utilize pyrophosphate in addition to ATP in their high energy phosphate metabolic processes. For example, E. histolytica possesses a pyrophosphatedependent phosphofructokinase (11Reeves R.E. South D.J. Blytt H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7737-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a pyruvate-phosphate dikinase (12Reeves R.E. J. Biol.

Several of these pyrophosphate-utilizing enzymes have also been discovered in other parasitic protists (see, e.g., the discussion in Ref. 15Mertens E. Parasitol.

Vierkotter S. Oldfield E. Payares G. Sanoja C. Bailey B.N. Yan W. Scott D.A. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol.

The resonance assignments and relative intensities are given in TableI. The two most prominent resonances in the bloodstream form spectrum (A and E) occur at 4.36 and 0.03 ppm and are assigned tosn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P)1 and glycerol-3-phosphoryl choline (GPC) based on their chemical shifts (29Van Wazer J.R. Ditchfield R. Burt C.T. Phosphorus NMR in Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 1-23Google Scholar) and the results of co-addition of authentic G3P and GPC (data not shown). The presence of large amounts of G3P can be attributed to the well known specialized metabolism of the long slender form under anaerobic conditions (31Hammond D.J. Bowman I.B.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1980; 2: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). During centrifugation of the parasites, a decrease in the oxygen tension could lead to inactivation of the terminal mitochondrial oxidase (32Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and the accumulation of G3P. This high concentration of G3P allows the parasite to maintain net production of ATP in the absence of oxygen via a reversible glycosomal glycerol kinase (32Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The large amount of GPC observed could be the result of the process by which the long slender form acquires fatty acids from the host for the synthesis of membrane phospholipids (33Bowes A.E. Samad A.H. Jiang P. Weaver B. Mellors A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 263: 13885-13892Google Scholar). GPC has been observed to be the product of phospholipase A1, an enzyme found in high concentrations in the plasma membranes of the parasite (33Bowes A.E. Samad A.H. Jiang P. Weaver B. Mellors A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 263: 13885-13892Google Scholar). Phospholipase A1 cleaves the fatty acid chain of lysophosphatidylcholine, leaving free fatty acid and GPC as products (33Bowes A.E. Samad A.H. Jiang P. Weaver B. Mellors A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 263: 13885-13892Google Scholar). This process has been observed using14C labeling of lysophosphatidylcholine (34Samad A. Licht B. Stalmach M.E. Mellors A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 29: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this previous study, GPC was detected in the extracellular medium, with no significant accumulation in the parasites (34Samad A. Licht B. Stalmach M.E. Mellors A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 29: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas in the bloodstream form extract shown here, it is clear that large amounts of GPC can accumulate within the cells. High levels of phosphorylethanolamine (B, 3.85 ppm) and phosphorylcholine (C, 3.42 ppm) are also present, consistent with the high levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in the glycosomal and plasma membranes (35Hart D.T.

Sharp resonances corresponding to α-ADP (K), α-ATP (L), and NADH (M) are clearly visible in the −11 ppm region, and β-ADP (H) appears at −6.13 ppm. The β and γ phosphates of ATP resonate at −21.26 and −5.81 ppm (from direct spiking results), but overlap with additional peaks. The remaining resonances in the −5 to −7, and −20 to −22 ppm regions exhibit chemical shifts and spin-spin coupling patterns consistent with short chain condensed polyphosphates (36Waki H. Hatano M. Polyhedron. 1982; 1: 69-75Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 37Glonek T. Van Wazer J. Mudgett M. Myers T.C. Inorg. Chem. 1972; 11: 567-570Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 38Crutchfield M.M.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 85-94Google Scholar). Proceeding upfield, resonancesF (−5.52 ppm, multiplet), G (−5.79 ppm, multiplet), I (−6.25, doublet), and J (−6.97, singlet) are assigned to the a (terminal) phosphates of (linear) penta-, tetra-, tri-, and pyrophosphate, respectively. The cluster of resonances at −20.82 ppm (N) can then be assigned to the β (bridging) phosphorus atoms of the tri- and tetrapolyphosphate, as well as phosphates 2 and 4 of pentapolyphosphate. The resonance appearing at −21.27 ppm is assigned to the centermost bridging phosphorus atom of pentapolyphosphate, based on previous observations of pentapolyphosphate (36Waki H. Hatano M. Polyhedron. 1982; 1: 69-75Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 39Roberts M.F. Burt C.T. Phosphorus NMR in Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 85-94Google Scholar), and supported by the relative intensity of this resonance compared with the −5.52 ppm resonance cluster. To confirm these assignments, authentic pyro-, tri-, and tetrapolyphosphate were added to samples and found to co-resonate with the peaks in question, with the β phosphorus of tripolyphosphate and the β phosphorus of tetrapolyphosphate comprising the downfield and upfield components of the −20.82 ppm resonance, respectively. Finally, the peak at −21.62 ppm, lacking any significant multiplicity, is tentatively assigned to cyclic tetrametaphosphate and/or pentametaphosphate (the latter resonating upfield by 0.1 ppm), based on previous reports of these species in the literature (37Glonek T. Van Wazer J. Mudgett M. Myers T.C. Inorg. Chem. 1972; 11: 567-570Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these extracts show no significant (cyclic) trimetaphosphate (−21.40 ppm), the primary breakdown product of longer chain polyphosphates by chemical degradation, indicating that all these inorganic phosphates are unlikely to be the result of very long chain polyphosphate hydrolysis during extract preparation (40Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kulaev I.S. Vagabov V.M. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1983; 24: 83-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found no evidence for these short chain polyphosphates when a sample of long chain polyphosphate was subjected to our perchloric acid extraction protocol (data not shown). There are, therefore, high levels of condensed short chain polyphosphates in acid extracts of T. brucei, and by inference, in the natural state of T. brucei parasites themselves.Fig. 2 shows the 303.6-MHz1H-decoupled 31P NMR spectra of perchloric acid extracts of the insect forms of two other trypanosomatid parasites:T. cruzi and L. major, and resonance assignments and relative intensities are given in Table Table I, Table II. The phosphomonoester (5 to 0 ppm) regions of the 31P NMR spectra of the perchloric acid extracts of these parasites are qualitatively similar to these seen with the T. brucei procyclic forms, with the detection of the metabolic intermediates G6P and 3-PGA, together with phosphorylcholine (particularly elevated in the case of L. major) and phosphorylethanolamine. The phosphagen phosphoarginine, responsible for ATP homeostasis during muscle contraction in some invertebrates (42Fan T.W.M. Higashi R.M. Macdonald J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Parasitol. 1999; 85: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), was detected at −3.52 ppm in L. major at approximately half the level of ATP, and at trace levels in T. cruzi. A phosphoarginine kinase with a putative actinin-like actin binding site has recently been cloned and characterized in T. cruzi, and is hypothesized to be involved in cytoskeletal movements requiring high energy consumption (45Pereira C.A.

In the upfield region (from ∼−5 ppm), there are once again strong resonances corresponding to short chain polyphosphates, with additional peaks arising from ADP, ATP, NAD(H), and UDPG. In both T. cruzi and L. major, however, the vast majority of the observed spectral intensity arises from condensed phosphates, primarily pyrophosphate and tripolyphosphate, just as found with the T. brucei bloodstream and procyclic spectra shown in Fig. 1.Figure 2303.6-MHz (1H decoupled)31P NMR spectra of perchloric acid extracts of T. cruzi epimastigotes (A) and L. major promastigotes (B).

InT. cruzi epimastigotes, the level measured here by NMR is ∼ 260 nmol/mg of protein, some 20% higher than the enzymatically determined pyro- and tripolyphosphate level of 195 nmol/mg of protein reported previously (10Urbina J.A. Moreno B. Vierkotter S. Oldfield E. Payares G. Sanoja C. Bailey B.N. Yan W. Scott D.A. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33609-33615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, this previous measurement did not include contributions from tetra- or pentapolyphosphate, and scaling the present value down to reflect only the pyro- and tripolyphosphate levels gives 188 nmol/mg of protein, very good agreement. L. major promastigotes contain the highest level of condensed inorganic phosphates, ∼ 350 nmol/mg of protein, while both forms of T. brucei contain ∼100–200 nmol/mg of protein, values that are related to ATP levels (31Hammond D.J. Bowman I.B.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1980; 2: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and therefore depend on the oxygen tension during sample preparation, which was not controlled in this study.The subcellular localization of these abundant polyphosphates is expected to be the acidocalcisome, a novel calcium, magnesium, sodium, zinc, and phosphorus storage organelle common to all trypanosomatids investigated to date (20Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 443-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To test this idea in more detail, acidocalcisomes were isolated from T. brucei, T. cruzi, and L. major using an iodixanol (OptiPrep) density gradient (28Scott D.A. Docampo R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The densest fraction, corresponding to the acidocalcisomes, was then extracted with perchloric acid, treated with 20 mm EDTA to chelate the divalent metal cations, and observed by high resolution 31P NMR (Fig.3, A–D). The spectra of the acidocalcisomal contents of all three species are very similar and resemble those of the whole cell extracts (Figs. 1 and 2), but contain only the short chain inorganic polyphosphate resonances, corresponding to pyro-, tri-, tetra-, and pentapolyphosphate, as well as tetra- and/or pentametaphosphate. In previous work with T. cruzi(24Scott D.A. Docampo R. Dvorak J.A. Shi S. Leapman R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28020-28029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), x-ray microprobe analysis revealed high levels of calcium (171 ± 6), magnesium (646 ± 19), sodium (161 ± 18), zinc (148 ± 6) and phosphorus (1390 ± 13 mmol/kg dry weight) in acidocalcisomes, and from these results and the requirement of overall charge neutrality, a charge-per-phosphorus ratio of ∼1.6 was estimated (24Scott D.A. Docampo R. Dvorak J.A. Shi S. Leapman R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28020-28029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This x-ray measurement translates to an average chain length of 3.33 phosphates/anion, which is very close to the values that we obtain here from the integrated intensities of the α and β phosphate groups. In acidocalcisomes from T. bruceibloodstream forms, T. brucei procyclics, T. cruziepimastigotes, and L. major promastigotes, the average chain lengths are 3.11, 3.39, 3.25, and 3.12, respectively. There is therefore good agreement between the average phosphate chain lengths, as determined by x-ray microprobe analysis and NMR spectroscopy, although the NMR experiments have the advantage of a more direct and accurate determination of the precise chain length distribution.Figure 3303.6-MHz (1H decoupled)31P NMR spectra of perchloric acid extracts of isolated acidocalcisomes.

Resonance assignments are given in Table II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe presence of polyphosphates in various microorganisms is well established and the hypothetical roles of these molecules have been reviewed (40Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1966; 30: 772-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kulaev I.S. Vagabov V.M. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1983; 24: 83-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 49Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The localization of these molecules within the cation-rich acidocalcisomes implies that their functional roles could be 1) energy stores and/or 2) chelators of metal ions. For example, in plants and in some parasitic protozoa, pyrophosphate is used in place of ATP as an energy donor in several reactions (reviewed in Ref. 15Mertens E. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 122-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), such as the pyruvate, phosphate dikinase of trypanosomatids (16Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The vacuolar-type proton-translocating pyrophosphatase, which has now been located in the acidocalcisomal membranes of T. cruzi (17Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J.

Moreover, this enzyme has also recently been identified in malaria parasites (51Luo S. Marchesini N. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 52Marchesini N. Luo S. Rodrigues C.O. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The parasite's V-H+-PPase has been shown to drive proton uptake into the acidocalcisomal compartment through cleavage of cytosolic pyrophosphate, and this activity is inhibited by small pyrophosphate analogs, such as imidodiphosphate, in a similar manner to that seen in plant systems (53Zhen R.-G. Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, the sequences of the V-H+-PPases in T. cruzi (AF159881), P. falciparum (AF115766), andArabidopsis thaliana (A6005697) bear an extremely high sequence homology to each other, and the V/H+-PPase appears to be an attractive target for drug development.Polyphosphates undoubtedly form metal complexes within the acidocalcisome and binding studies of pure short chain polyphosphates have been performed, which indicate that in most cases soluble 1:1 complexes are formed with both magnesium and calcium, with precipitation occurring at 2–3 mol of metal/mol of polyphosphate (54Crutchfield M.M. Irani R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 2815-2820Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because"
https://openalex.org/W2054396227,"One-carbon metabolism in yeast is an essential process that relies on at least one of three one-carbon donor molecules: serine, glycine, or formate. By a combination of genetics and biochemistry we have shown how cells regulate the balance of one-carbon flow between the donors by regulating cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase activity in a side reaction occurring in the presence of excess glycine. This control governs the level of 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-H4folate) in the cytoplasm, which has a direct role in signaling transcriptional control of the expression of key genes, particularly those encoding the unique components of the glycine decarboxylase complex (GCV1,GCV2, and GCV3). Based on these and other observations, we propose a model for how cells balance the need to supplement their one-carbon pools when charged folates are limiting or when glycine is in excess. We also propose that under normal conditions, cytoplasmic 5,10-CH2-H4folate is mainly directed to generating methyl groups via methionine, whereas one-carbon units generated from glycine in mitochondria are more directed to purine biosynthesis. When glycine is in excess, 5,10-CH2-H4folate is decreased, and the regulation loop shifts the balance of generation of one-carbon units into the mitochondrion.

One-carbon units are derived from catabolism of three donor molecules: serine, glycine, and formate. These are then activated and compartmentalized by attachment to H4folate for biosynthetic processes. In most organisms, serine is the principle one-carbon donor (1Schirch L. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 399-431Google Scholar) contributing to the pool of 5,10-CH2-H4folate by the action of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) enzymes (see Fig. 1 and Table I,reactions 1 and 2). Glycine catabolism via the mitochondrial glycine decarboxylase multienzyme complex (GDC) (see Fig.1 and Table I, reaction 3) also contributes to the one-carbon pool by generation of 5,10-CH2-H4folate (2Ogur M. Liu T.N. Cheung I. Paulavicius I. Wales W. Mehnert D. Blaise D. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 926-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas formate activation to 10-HCO-H4folate occurs via the synthetase activity of the C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase trifunctional enzymes (see Fig. 1 and Table I, reactions 4c and 6c) (3McKenzie K.Q. Jones E.W. Genetics. 1977; 86: 85-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the one-carbon H4folate pools are interconverted by the cyclohydrolase (see Fig. 1 and Table I, reactions 4b and6b) and dehydrogenase (see Fig.1 and TableI, reactions 4a and6a) activities of the C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase enzymes, whereas flow between the mitochondrion and the cytoplasm is mediated by the three one-carbon donor molecules. The result is a dynamic metabolic system in which one-carbon units are interconverted between the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic compartments as well as between oxidation states. This flow has been the subject of extensive biochemical analyses (4Barlowe C.K. Appling D.R. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pasternack L.B. Laude D.A. Appling D.R.

Open table in a new tab In contrast to the other enzyme activities for the generation and interconversion of one-carbon units, glycine catabolism via the GDC is strictly mitochondrial. This enzyme is composed of four subunits each encoded separately. These are the P-protein (encoded byGCV2), the H-protein (encoded by GCV3), the T-protein (encoded by GCV1), and the L-protein (encoded byLPD1). Each of the GCV genes is unique to the GDC and on addition of exogenous glycine has been shown to be induced transcriptionally (10Sinclair D.A. Hong S.P. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11McNeil J.B. Zhang F. Taylor B.V. Sinclair D.A. Pearlman R.E. Bognar A.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4444-4450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For GCV1 and GCV2expression this was due to a 17-base pair sequence with the hexanucleotide 5′-CTTCTT-3′ at its core in their promoters (13Hong S.P. Piper M.D. Sinclair D.A. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10523-10532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and similar sequences have been identified in the GCV3 promoter. This work also indicated that H4folate or one of its derivatives may play a role in signaling the need for increasedGCV transcription when glycine is added to the medium. This possibility led us to the hypothesis that the glycine effect is only one component of a broader one-carbon metabolism regulatory system. This has been confirmed from genome-wide transcript analysis in which the addition of glycine to yeast cells growing in minimal medium led to the induction of other genes central to one-carbon metabolism (14Hong S.P. Transcriptional Regulation of One-carbon Metabolism Genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ph.D. thesis. University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia1999Google Scholar).Here, we have used a combination of genetics and biochemistry to identify which derivative of H4folate acts to signal this response, and we propose a model for 5,10-CH2-H4folate-mediated regulation of metabolism through transcription. Because of the large body of work on the phenotypes of many one-carbon metabolic mutants (6Pasternack L.B. Laude D.A. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Barlowe C.K. Appling D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5679-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16McNeil J.B.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14956-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), strains were available that were specifically altered with respect to the different reduced H4folate pools. Gene expression studies in these strains were combined with 13C NMR experiments to monitor one-carbon flow. These data indicated that control over cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase activity is responsible for determining how GCV gene transcription is regulated. By monitoring the levels of the 5,10-CH2-H4folate pool (which is normally derived from serine), cells can up-regulate glycine catabolism for one-carbon generation when 5,10-CH2-H4folate is limiting or spare the breakdown of serine when glycine is in surplus.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAmino acids, 2-mercaptoethanol, [2-13C]glycine, poly(dI-dC), and sodium H4folate were obtained from Sigma. 3-trimethylsilyl propionate-2,2,3,3-d4, sodium salt and [14C]formaldehyde were from ICN Pharmaceuticals, and DEAE-Sephadex was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

A 1-liter culture of cells was grown to late log phase in yeast minimal medium with or without 100 mg liter−1[2-13C]-labeled glycine. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of 0.3 n HCl and warmed over a boiling water bath for 1 h. This solution was centrifuged, the supernatant was replaced with fresh HCl, and the process was repeated. The supernatants from the two extractions were pooled, reduced using a Rotavapor, and dried in a Speedivac. Samples were stored at this stage at −80 °C until analysis. Immediately prior to NMR, samples were resuspended in 1 ml of deuterated dimethyl-d6-sulfoxide.NMR AnalysisNMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX 600 spectrometer equipped with a TXI-XYZ probe at a temperature of 298 K. Chemical shifts are relative to internal 3-trimethylsilyl propionate-2,2,3,3-d4, sodium salt set to 0 ppm. (This results in our measured shifts being ∼1.4 ppm lower in frequency than those reported relative to tetramethylsilicone.) Metabolites were identified by comparison with previously published data on chemical shifts (Table III) (6Pasternack L.B. Laude D.A. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Relative intensities of lines within “triplets” produced by mixtures of single 13C and double13C-13C isotopomers were extracted with line shape deconvolution using the Bruker WINNMR program. 13C NMR spectra were acquired using power-gated decoupling. A total of 2400 scans with an acquisition time of 1.14 s and recycle delay of 5.0 s were acquired for each sample, resulting in an overall time of 4 h 7 min per sample. The spectral width was 190 ppm, and 64,000 points were collected. The pulse lengths were 9.0 μs, with a 78-degree flip angle.

Open table in a new tab Chemical Synthesis of 5,10-CH2-H4folateLabeled 5,10-CH2-H4folate was prepared from H4folate and [14C]formaldehyde, based on a previously published method (23Zarow C. Pellino A.M. Danenberg P.V. Prep. Biochem. 1983; 12: 381-393Google Scholar). Equimolar proportions of H4folate and formaldehyde (5% [14C]formaldehyde) were combined in a stoppered oxygen- and light-free container. The solution was brought to pH 5 by the dropwise addition of 1 n NaOH, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction mixture was left at 4 °C for 60 min after which the pH was adjusted to 9.5 using 1n NaOH. The 5,10-CH2-H4folate was purified at 4 °C on a 10-ml DEAE-Sephadex column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm (NH4)2CO3and washed immediately before loading with 100 ml of 50 mm2-mercaptoethanol. After loading, the column was washed with 20 ml of 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and then eluted with a 100-ml gradient of 10–500 mm(NH4)2CO3 containing 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (progress was monitored by absorbance at 295 nm). Fractions (2 ml) were collected, and those containing 5,10-CH2-H4folate were identified by absorbance and scintillation counting. Concentration and purity were estimated by correlating the pteridine ring concentration (ε295 = 30,000 m−1cm−1) with the amount of radioactivity (1 mmol = 1.3 × 1011 dpm) in a given fraction. Maximum purity was estimated at greater than 90%.Samples were freeze-dried and stored under argon at −80 °C away from light. Prior to use, the powder was resuspended in 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol.Gel Mobility Shift AssayAssays were performed as described previously (24Sinclair D.A. Kornfeld G.D. Dawes I.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 214-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using purified protein extracts obtained from heparin-Sepharose chromatography (25Ruet A. Camier S. Smagowicz W. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Proteins were extracted from yeast strain BWG1–7A, purified, and incubated with 40-base pair DNA fragments harboring the glycine regulatory region of GCV2. These were prepared, separated by electrophoresis, and analyzed as described previously (13Hong S.P. Piper M.D. Sinclair D.A. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10523-10532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The relative amount of DNA present in the DNA/protein complexes was estimated by PhosphorImager analysis. To reduce the effects of loading inconsistencies, these values were normalized to the total DNA present in each lane.RESULTSOne-carbon metabolism comprises a complex set of reactions that contribute to many central biosynthetic pathways. Several approaches can be taken to identify components of the signaling system regulating the glycine response, although direct biochemical analyses are difficult because of the ability of the reactants to interchangeably supplement the pools of one-carbon-derived compounds and the relative instability of the H4folate derivatives. By combining extensive genetic analysis with biochemical approaches, several groups have provided clear indications of the flow of metabolites and the consequences of specific metabolic blocks (6Pasternack L.B. Laude D.A. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Barlowe C.K. Appling D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5679-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16McNeil J.B. Bognar A.L. Pearlman R.E. Genetics. 1996; 142: 371-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kastanos E.K. Woldman Y.Y. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14956-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In particular, Appling and co-workers have effectively combined genetics with the use of 13C NMR to provide a wealth of information on the biochemistry of one-carbon metabolic flow. Here, we have combined genetic and biochemical approaches to extend our previous finding that a folate species plays a role in signaling the glycine response of theGCV genes (13Hong S.P. Piper M.D. Sinclair D.A. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10523-10532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because glycine catabolism via the glycine decarboxylase reaction directly contributes to the one-carbon pool, we first tested whether a mutant lacking GDC activity could still elicit a glycine response.The Glycine Response Is Independent of the Ability to Metabolize GlycineWe previously proposed that changes in an intermediate or product of one-carbon metabolism (e.g. a derivative of H4folate) provide the signal for the glycine response. To test whether these changes require glycine catabolism, we transformed a strain mutant for glycine cleavage activity with a normally regulatedGCV2::lacZ fusion (pRH2) and compared reporter gene expression in minimal medium with that in minimal medium containing 10 mm glycine (Fig.2). A 3- to 4-fold increase in gene expression on the addition of glycine was observed, which is typical of the wild-type glycine response previously reported (10Sinclair D.A. Hong S.P. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because this strain is mutant for the GCV1 gene product encoding the T-protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex and has no detectable GDC activity, it is unable to use glycine as a sole one-carbon and nitrogen source (26Sinclair D.A. Dawes I.W. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1213-1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus glycine catabolism has no direct effect on H4folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. To reconcile this result with the data indicating that GCV transcriptional signaling involves a H4folate intermediate, we sought a one-carbon metabolic mutant unable to elicit a normal glycine response. We reasoned that this strain would reveal how glycine acts to control one-carbon metabolism and the balance of cellular H4folate molecules.Figure 2Expression of the full-lengthGCV2::lacZ gene fusion (pRH2) transformed into a strain mutant for glycine decarboxylase activity. Straingsd1 is mutant in the gene encoding the GDC T-protein (gcv1) and therefore cannot catabolize glycine.

Fig.3 shows the effect of a mutation eliminating cytosolic SHMT activity (shm2) on glycine induction of expression of all three GCV genes. Expression of each of the GCV genes was constitutively high in minimal medium with and without glycine. Interestingly, the elevated level of expression in this strain in minimal medium was about the same as that of the wild type (ADE3 SHM2) grown in minimal medium containing glycine. The mutation in this strain therefore elicited the same increase in gene expression as seen for the addition of glycine to the wild type.Figure 3The glycine response of GCV1, GCV2, and GCV3 genes is disrupted in anshm2-knockout strain. TheGCV::lacZ gene fusions were transformed as single copies into a strain mutant for the cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (ADE3 shm2) and its isogenic wild type (ADE3 SHM2). Strains are described in Table II.Error bars represent the standard deviation of β-galactosidase assays performed in triplicate. Dmin, minimal medium (10Sinclair D.A. Hong S.P. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the effect of this mutation was due to a disturbance of one-carbon metabolism and not simply loss of the SHMT enzyme, we supplemented the cytosolic one-carbon pool with formate. From Fig. 1 and Table I it can be seen that catabolism of formate in the cytosol should compensate for any one-carbon imbalance of anADE3 shm2 strain via the activity of C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase (ADE3 gene product; Ref. 7Pasternack L.B. Laude D.A. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7166-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This enzyme first activates the one-carbon units derived from formate to 10-HCO-H4folate before conversion to 5,10-CH2-H4folate. In the wild-type strain (ADE3 SHM2) addition of excess formate caused a decrease inGCV2 gene expression (Fig.4 A). This reduction was even more evident in the ADE3 shm2 strain, occurring at a lower formate concentration. This effect was eliminated by the introduction of a mutation in the ade3 gene. The lack of response to formate by the ade3–130 shm2 strain shows that assimilation of cytoplasmic one-carbon units from formate is required for the down-regulation of gene expression. Interestingly, in these experiments the effect on control of adding glycine to the wild type was similar to that of the shm2 mutation. That is, there was anADE3-dependent reduction in GCV gene expression induced by glycine on the addition of formate (Fig.4 B). We propose, therefore, that the presence of excess glycine acts in a similar manner to the shm2 mutation by causing a reduction in the level of one of the cytoplasmic one-carbon charged H4folates and that this decrease then acts as the signal to increase GCV gene expression.Figure 4Exogenous formate alters GCVgene transcription by altering the one-carbon metabolic balance. One-carbon metabolic mutant strains transformed with the full-length GCV2::lacZ gene fusion were grown in minimal medium with the addition of formate (concentration as indicated) (left) or minimal medium containing 10 mm glycine with the addition of 25 mm formate (right). β-Galactosidase assays were performed on exponentially growing cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are relative to those without the addition of formate. Error bars represent the standard deviation of β-galactosidase assays performed in triplicate. Dmin, minimal medium (10Sinclair D.A. Hong S.P. Dawes I.W. Mol.

First, when grown in minimal medium, it has a slightly slower growth rate than the wild type that can be restored by the addition of adenine to the medium (Table IV). This is also consistent with the observation made by West et al. (9West M.G. Horne D.W. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3122-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that a strain that was unable to oxidize cytoplasmic 5,10-CH2-H4folate could not generate sufficient one-carbon units in the mitochondrion for purine synthesis to support wild-type growth. This strain recovered when adenine was added to the medium.Table IVEffect of mutation of cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shm2) on growth rateStrainMedium4-aRequires methionine for growth.MinimalMinimal + adenineADE3 SHM2 (wild type)2.4 h2.3 hADE3 shm23.5 h2.4 h4-a Requires methionine for growth. Open table in a new tab Secondly, we used 13C NMR to follow the incorporation of one-carbon units from the mitochondrion into molecules derived from the cytoplasmic one-carbon H4folate pools. When cells are grown in the presence of exogenous glycine it is incorporated into choline and adenine both directly as an intact molecule and also as a one-carbon unit from the cytoplasmic pool. Appling and co-workers (6Pasternack L.B. Laude D.A. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have shown that monitoring the incorporation of [2-13C]glycine into choline and adenine allows an insight into the flow of mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism to the cytoplasm.Fig. 5 shows a comparison of the relevant regions of the NMR spectra for extracts of three mutants used for the gene expression studies (ADE3 SHM2, ade3–130 SHM2, and ADE3 shm2). Fig. 5 A shows that there was an approximate 4-fold reduction in the incorporation of label into choline in the ADE3 shm2 strain when compared with either the wild-type or the ade3–130 SHM2 strain. This demonstrated that synthesis of choline was principally derived from one-carbon units formed as a result of the cytoplasmic SHMT reaction. Residual labeled choline (notably at the C-4 position) in this strain was generated by the export of labeled formate from the mitochondrion and its activation and interconversion by theADE3 gene product (Fig. 1 and Table I, reactions 4a-4c). In contrast, the mitochondrially derived one-carbon metabolites contributed much more extensively to adenine biosynthesis because the ade3–130 mutation virtually eliminates the incorporation into all labeled position"
https://openalex.org/W2036610017,"In the present work, by titrating cytochromec oxidase (COX) with the specific inhibitor KCN, the flux control coefficient and the metabolic reserve capacity of COX have been determined in human saponin-permeabilized muscle fibers. In the presence of the substrates glutamate and malate, a 2.3 ± 0.2-fold excess capacity of COX was observed in ADP-stimulated human skeletal muscle fibers. This value was found to be dependent on the mitochondrial substrate supply. In the combined presence of glutamate, malate, and succinate, which supported an approximately 1.4-fold higher rate of respiration, only a 1.4 ± 0.2-fold excess capacity of COX was determined. In agreement with these findings, the flux control of COX increased, in the presence of the three substrates, from 0.27 ± 0.03 to 0.36 ± 0.08. These results indicate a tight in vivo control of respiration by COX in human skeletal muscle. This tight control may have significant implications for mitochondrial myopathies. In support of this conclusion, the analysis of skeletal muscle fibers from two patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, which carried deletions in 11 and 49% of their mitochondrial DNA, revealed a substantially lowered reserve capacity and increased flux control coefficient of COX, indicating severe rate limitations of oxidative phosphorylation by this enzyme.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1175-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Typical histopathological hallmarks are the presence of “ragged red fibers,” indicating mitochondrial proliferation and of COX1-negative fibers pointing to a COX deficiency (2Morgan-Hughes J.A. Hanna M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although, in many forms of these metabolic myopathies, various mtDNA mutations have been shown to be the cause of the diseases (1Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1175-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar), the metabolic consequences of the mitochondrial defects for the skeletal muscle are still poorly understood. One problem is the frequent co-existence of mutant and wild-type mtDNAs in the same fiber (3Wallace D.C. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 128-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Additionally, studies with isolated mitochondria have suggested the presence of a large excess of various enzymes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. As a consequence, the individual enzymes of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway can be inhibited up to 80% without significant changes in the overall flux, thus creating threshold effects (4Davey G.P. Peuchen S. Clark J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12753-12757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 5Rossignol R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Letellier T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33426-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This situation is predicted from the application to oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria of the metabolic control analysis (6Letellier T. Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), a theory that allows a quantification of control of flux exerted by the individual enzymes of a metabolic pathway (7Kacser H. Burns J.A. Davies D.D. Rate Control of Biological Processes. Cambridge University Press, London1973: 65-104Google Scholar, 8Heinrich R. Rapoport T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, the examination of thresholds of cytochrome c oxidase in intact cells (9Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 10Villani G. Greco M. Papa S. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31829-31836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) has raised the critical issue of how accurately the data obtained with isolated mitochondria reflect the in vivo situation. Important complications of the analysis on isolated mitochondria are the possible loss of essential metabolites during the organelle isolation and the disruption of the normal interactions of mitochondria with the cytoskeleton and other organelles, as well as of the possible regulation of enzyme activities by cytoplasmic effectors (11Reipert S.

In this report we have therefore used saponin-permeabilized muscle fibers to determine the reserve capacity of COX in human skeletal muscle. Muscle fibers treated with low concentrations of saponin have been shown to be a suitable model for studying oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle under conditions reflecting more closely the in vivo situation than isolated mitochondria (12Saks V.A. Veksler V.I. Kuznetsov A.V. Kay L. Sikk P. Tiivel T. Tranqui L. Olivares J. Winkler K. Wiedemann F. Kunz W.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 81-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kuznetsov A.V.

Our data are consistent with previous findings on cultured human cells and support the conclusion that there is in human skeletal muscle only a low excess capacity of COX, with significant implications for mitochondrial myopathies. Skeletal biopsy specimens were obtained from two patients (ages 40 and 48) with the clinical picture of chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, who underwent a diagnostic biopsy. Skeletal muscle samples from diagnostic biopsies of 10 patients (ages 32–63) with questionable abnormalities in electromyography, but no biopsy evidence for a manifest myopathy, were used as controls. All patients gave written informed consent prior to biopsy. Total DNA was isolated from 10 to 40 mg of liquid nitrogen-frozen muscle samples by standard methods, and Southern blots were performed with 1 μg of DNA digested by PvuII as described previously (17Vielhaber S. Kunz D. Winkler K. Wiedemann F.R. Kirches E. Feistner H. Heinze H.-J. Elger E.C. Schubert W. Kunz W.S. Brain. 2000; 123: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The “relaxing solution” contained 10 mm calcium EGTA buffer, free concentration of calcium 0.1 μm, 20 mm imidazole, 20 mm taurine, 49 mm potassium MES, 3 mm KH2PO4, 9.5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 15 mmphosphocreatine, pH 7.1. The measurements were performed in a medium consisting of 110 mm mannitol, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm Na2EDTA, and 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. About 50 mg of biopsy tissue (Musculus vastus lateralis) were used for isolation of saponin-permeabilized fibers. Bundles of muscle fibers containing usually 2–4 single fibers were isolated by mechanical dissection. The saponin treatment was performed by incubation of the fiber bundles in “relaxing solution” containing 50 μg/ml saponin, as described in Ref. 16Kuznetsov A.V. Mayboroda O. Kunz D. Winkler K. Schubert W. Kunz W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar. The respiration of muscle fibers was measured at 25 °C using an Oroboros high resolution oxygraph (Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) in the measurement medium containing 2 mmADP and 10 mm glutamate + 5 mm malate as mitochondrial substrates, or, additionally 10 mm succinate, as described previously (18Kuznetsov A.V. Winkler K. Kirches E. Lins H. Kunz W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1360: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The KCN titration of COX activity of permeabilized fibers was performed in the same oxygraphic chamber in the presence of 500 μm TMPD, 1 mm ascorbate, 2 mm ADP, and 0.2 μm antimycin A. In control experiments, it was shown that the ADP-stimulated respiration of the saponin-permeabilized fibers with all three respiratory substrate combinations could not be further stimulated by the uncoupler 4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2-trifluoromethylbenzimidazole (10 μm) or cytochrome c (8 μm), indicating, respectively, a maximal respiratory rate and a preserved integrity of the mitochondrial outer membrane. The activity of COX was measured spectrophotometrically in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in the presence of 0.1% laurylmaltoside and 200 μmferrocytochrome c. With this high cytochrome cconcentration, we utilized for the analysis a dual wavelength photometer (Aminco DW 2000, SLM Instruments, Rochester, NY) and measured in the β-band of ferrocytochrome c at 515–535 nm (19Wiedemann F.R. Vielhaber S. Schröder S. Elger C.E. Kunz W.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Using specific noncompetitive inhibitors, the flux control coefficientC i of an enzyme i can be determined experimentally (18Kuznetsov A.V. Winkler K. Kirches E. Lins H. Kunz W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1360: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) according to the following equation. Ci=−(dJ/J)/(dpi/Imax)Equation 1 where J is the flux through the pathway,p i is the concentration of a specific inhibitor of enzyme i, and I max is the maximal amount of inhibitor binding sites. The flux control coefficients of cytochromec oxidase were determined from cyanide titration curves using nonlinear regression analysis accounting for the dissociation equilibrium of the inhibitor as described in Ref. 20Gellerich F.N. Kunz W.S. Bohnensack R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 274: 167-170Google Scholar. Inhibition plots were constructed of relative ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption with the different combinations of substrates versus the percentage of decrease of isolated COX activity at the same KCN concentrations. The resulting curves can be usually divided into two descending phases. The slope of the first part depends on the flux control coefficient of COX, whereas the second descending portion represents the inhibition of the flux rate-limited by COX. The reserve capacity of COX (COXRmax) was determined from the intersection of the best fitting regression line through the data points of the second descending part of the inhibition plot with the ordinate axis (9Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,21Taylor R.W. Birch-Machin M.A. Bartlett K. Lowerson S.A. Turnbull D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3523-3528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ultra-turrax homogenized muscle was centrifuged, and the pellet was washed in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, to remove the hemoglobin contamination. The dithionite reduced-oxidized spectra were determined using the Aminco DW 2000 dual wavelength photometer. The content of cytochromeaa 3 was determined at 605 nm, using ε = 12 mm−1 cm−1 (22Balaban R.S. Mootha V.K. Arai A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and applying a base-line correction. To determine the reserve capacity of COX in human skeletal muscle, titrations of the ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption of saponin-permeabilized muscle fibers with cyanide were performed. Fig.1 shows the averages of a series of titration curves with the substrate combination glutamate/malate (panel A) and with the additional presence of succinate (panel B). The titration curve with glutamate/malate has clearly a sigmoidal shape (Fig. 1 A), whereas in the presence of succinate (Fig. 1 B), which causes an approximately 1.4-fold increase of the rate of respiration of fibers (TableI), the sigmoidal shape is less pronounced. This is an indication of a substantial rate limitation of the respiratory flux by COX in the additional presence of this complex II substrate. The averages of all experimental points were fitted to a theoretical model (20Gellerich F.N. Kunz W.S. Bohnensack R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 274: 167-170Google Scholar) allowing calculation of the flux control coefficient of cytochrome c oxidase (equal to 0.27 in the presence of glutamate/malate), whereas this value approached almost 0.36 in the additional presence of succinate. Fig. 1 Cshows the KCN titration curve of TMPD/ascorbate-dependent respiration in antimycin A-treated permeabilized fibers. This oxygen consumption can be attributed to the isolated COX activity, as revealed by the hyperbolic shape of the curve. The comparison of the inhibition of the enzymatic reaction with the degree of inhibition of the respiration flux at identical cyanide concentrations allows the construction of an inhibition plot (6Letellier T. Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) for COX. The inhibition plots obtained for the substrate combinations glutamate/malate and glutamate/malate/succinate are presented in Fig.2 (A and B, respectively). The averaged experimental points were fitted to a theoretical curve describing the inhibition kinetics of an irreversible inhibitor (solid line; cf. Ref. 20Gellerich F.N. Kunz W.S. Bohnensack R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 274: 167-170Google Scholar). The intersection of the best fitting regression line of the second descending portion of the plot with the ordinate axis marked the COXRmax value. Using this procedure for human skeletal muscle fibers in the presence of glutamate/malate, an approximately 2.3-fold reserve capacity of COX was determined (Fig. 2 A). In the additional presence of succinate, the reserve capacity was only about 1.4-fold (Fig.2 B). Similar results were obtained if the TMPD + ascorbate oxygen consumption rates were compared with the respiratory rates obtained with the two substrate combinations (Table I). It is interesting noting that the maximal COX activities (expressed as turnover numbers) measured polarographically by using ascorbate (1 mm) and TMPD (0.5 mm) as artificial reductants for the endogenous cytochrome c pool in permeabilized fibers are also similar to those obtained by spectrophotometric measurements on fiber homogenates in presence of 0.1% laurylmaltoside and an excess (200 μm) of ferrocytochrome c. Using this procedure, with glutamate/malate a COX excess capacity of 2.0-fold, and, with glutamate/malate/succinate, an excess capacity of 1.5-fold was obtained. This is a clear indication that both the COX reserve capacity and flux control coefficient critically depend on the substrate supply and, consequently, on the overall flux rate (9Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To investigate which changes of the metabolic control by COX occur in these diseases, we investigated the respiration of saponin-permeabilized muscle samples from two patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia. As shown in the Southern blots of PvuII-cleaved DNA in Fig.3 A, both patients carried large scale mtDNA deletions in skeletal muscle. In Fig. 3 B, the cytochrome spectra of the skeletal muscle samples from both patients are shown. It can be seen that the cytochromeaa 3 content (605 nm peak) decreased with the increasing proportion of deleted mtDNA, whereas the content of cytochromes c + c 1 and bdetermined at 553 and 563 nm, respectively, remained almost unchanged. This is an indication of a change in the composition of the respiratory chain. The inhibition plots of COX obtained with saponin-permeabilized muscle fibers from patient W. respiring in the presence of glutamate/malate or glutamate/malate/succinate are shown in Fig.4 (A or B, respectively). In agreement with the lower activity of COX in the skeletal muscle of this patient, the COX reserve capacity decreased with both substrate combinations used. The results of the various analyses performed with the muscle samples from both patients are summarized in Table I. In the sample carrying a higher proportion of deleted mtDNA, we observed a lower COX activity (see also Ref. 23Schröder R. Vielhaber S. Wiedemann F.R. Kornblum C. Papassotiropoulos A. Broich P.

This accounts for the lower values of COX reserve capacity and for the increase in flux control coefficient of COX in the presence of both substrate combinations.Figure 4Inhibition plots of relative ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption of saponin-permeabilized muscle fibers of patient W. versus present decrease of isolated COX activity at the same KCN concentrations.

Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,10Villani G. Greco M. Papa S. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31829-31836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Previous studies with isolated mitochondria (6Letellier T. Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) had reported high threshold values for COX in skeletal muscle, which appeared to be in accordance with data showing that the molar ratio of COX and NADH:CoQ oxidoreductase is about 6–7 (24Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schwerzmann K. Hoppeler H. Kayar S. Weibel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In agreement with this apparent large “excess” capacity of COX for skeletal muscle mitochondria, COX inhibition threshold values of about 70% (or even over 80%) were observed (5Rossignol R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Letellier T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33426-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 6Letellier T. Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, it was concluded that COX defects in skeletal muscle should lead to a phenotypic expression only if more than about 70% of the enzyme activity is lost (5Rossignol R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Letellier T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33426-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 6Letellier T. Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, this prediction has not been supported by findings on copper-deficient mottled brindled mice, in which COX activity deficits of about 50% already seriously affected the muscle energy metabolism (26Kuznetsov A.V. Clark J.F. Winkler K. Kunz W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 283-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Tracey I. Dunn J.F. Radda G.K. Muscle Nerve. 1997; 20: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and by quantitative studies on patients with mitochondrial myopathies carrying mtDNA deletions or point mutations, which have indicated low threshold values for mtDNA mutations (23Schröder R. Vielhaber S. Wiedemann F.R. Kornblum C. Papassotiropoulos A. Broich P. Zierz S. Elger C.E. Reichmann H. Seibel P. Klockgether T. Kunz W.S. J. Neuropath. Exp.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 10Villani G. Greco M. Papa S. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31829-31836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) has raised the critical issue of how accurately the data obtained with isolated mitochondria reflect the in vivo situation. To investigate the metabolic control of respiration by COX in human skeletal muscle, we have therefore used saponin-permeabilized muscle fibers. In the contest of a tight control by COX, as revealed in the present work, it would not have anymore functional meaning to measure inhibition threshold values, because significant decreases for the respiratory fluxes are obtained even at low degrees of inhibition of the isolated COX. Our results for the flux control coefficient of COX obtained with saponin-permeabilized muscle fibers and the substrate combination glutamate/malate (0.27 ± 0.03) are higher than the values previously reported for isolated rat skeletal muscle mitochondria with the substrates pyruvate/malate (0.2 ± 0.04) (6Letellier T. Heinrich R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 29Rossignol R. Letellier T. Malgat M. Rocher C. Mazat J.-P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This discrepancy could be related either to problems resulting from nonrigorous mitochondria isolation conditions (efflux of NAD+, etc.), which might affect the maximal electron flow through complex I, or to species differences. On the other hand, our results show clearly that the flux control coefficient and the reserve capacity of COX in human skeletal muscle critically depend on the substrate supply and, consequently, on the overall respiratory rate. In the presence of both the complex I and II substrates (glutamate/malate and succinate, respectively), we observed an approximately 1.4-fold higher respiration rate than with glutamate/malate alone. Under these conditions of increased electron flow through the respiratory chain, the COX activity exceeds the capacity of the respiratory chain only by about 40%. This is in agreement with the high flux control coefficient of COX (0.36) observed with the substrates glutamate/malate/succinate. Because the process of substrate supply to skeletal muscle mitochondriain vivo is rather complex (oxidative degradation of pyruvate originating from glycogen breakdown and glycolysis of fatty acids and amino acids), at least under certain circumstances, high flux rates through the respiratory chain can be reached (30Mootha V.K. Arai A.E. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H769-H775PubMed Google Scholar). At these high flux rates there is obviously a tight control of respiration flux by COX. The present results are completely in agreement with the data obtained using intact cultured human cells respiring with endogenous substrates (9Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 10Villani G. Greco M. Papa S. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31829-31836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, there are in skeletal muscle low levels of oxygen, which are known to increase the flux control coefficient of COX (31Wiedemann F.R. Kunz W.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In additional studies, we have investigated the effect of mtDNA mutations on the flux control and reserve capacity of COX. To detect the influence of low amounts of mutant DNA, we have chosen patients carrying deletions in less than 50% of the skeletal muscle mtDNA population. In agreement with our results indicating a tight control of high respiration flux by COX in control human skeletal muscle, we have observed significant effects on the flux control coefficient and the COX reserve capacity in samples harboring only ∼10–50% deleted mtDNA, which caused effects on COX activity and hemeaa 3 content. This finding can explain why a pathological phenotype can occur in individuals carrying a low proportion of mutant mtDNA in their susceptible tissues. In conclusion, we report here a low reserve capacity and high flux control coefficient of COX in saponin-permeabilized human skeletal muscle fibers at high rates of mitochondrial respiration by COX. These findings can explain the defects in energy metabolism in patients with mitochondrial myopathies carrying mutations in a low proportion of the muscle mtDNA population."

InEscherichia coli, the initiating step in the decay process is usually mediated by RNase E (1Belasco J.G. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability.

In vitro, RNase E activity is conferred by a multi-enzyme complex, the degradosome (5Miczak A. Kaberdin V.R. Wei C.-L. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3865-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 6Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In small RNAs, such as the ColE1 replication regulator RNA 1, and therpsO or rpsT mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins S15 and S20, respectively, a single RNase E cleavage is capable of inactivating the mRNA and rendering it susceptible to complete destruction to mononucleotides (reviewed in Ref. 3Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 55-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In larger mRNAs this initiating endonucleolytic event can trigger a 5′ → 3′ “wave” of subsequent endonucleolytic cleavages, which rapidly inactivate the entire mRNA (7Goodrich A.F. Steege D.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 972-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The 3′ termini generated by RNase E cleavages are scavenged by 3′–5′-exoribonucleases (1Belasco J.G. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 3-12Crossref Google Scholar, 3Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 55-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Two features in the 5′-extremity of an mRNA, secondary structure and the triphosphate terminus, can control the susceptibility of the entire mRNA toward RNase E. The 5′-terminal stem-loop structure of the ompA mRNA is largely responsible for the atypical stability of this mRNA and can confer stability to heterologous mRNAs to which it is grafted (8Emory S.A. Bouvet P. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Hansen M.J. Chen L.-H. Fejzo M.L.S. Belasco J.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Stabilization is abolished by as few as three single-stranded residues at the extreme 5′-end of an RNA (10Bouvet P. Belasco J.G. Nature. 1992; 360: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These effects of 5′-terminal secondary structure on mRNA stability are mediated directly though Rne (4Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 11Mackie G.A. Genereaux J.L. Masterman S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 609-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Evidence for the critical role of the free 5′-end of RNA and its phosphorylation state in mRNA turnover arises from several experiments. Most notably, circular derivatives of the well characterized RNase E substrates,rpsT mRNA or 9 S RNA, are highly resistant to cleavagein vitro by Rne or degradosomes (4Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). An RNase E cleavage at a site 5 residues from the 5′-end of RNA 1 destabilizes the 103-residue 3′-cleavage product in vivo. However, an artificial RNA identical to the initial cleavage product but containing a triphosphorylated terminus is significantly more stable (12Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1991; 65: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Likewise, oligonucleotide-directed cleavage of the rpsT mRNA by RNase H shows that the 5′-segment containing a triphosphorylated terminus is quite stable, even in relatively crude extracts. In contrast, the 3′-segment that would be monophosphorylated undergoes RNase E cleavage at an accelerated rate compared with the unmodified substrate (11Mackie G.A. Genereaux J.L. Masterman S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 609-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13Mackie G.A. Genereaux J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 998-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Finally, either Rne protein alone or purified degradosomes preferentially cleave monophosphorylated substrates 20–30-fold more rapidly than their triphosphorylated counterparts (4Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Together, these results imply that the vectorial nature of mRNA decay is a reflection of the inherent preference of Rne for 5′-monophosphorylated substrates. To address whether Rne or degradosomes display 5′-end dependencein vivo where a circular RNA would be exposed to all the components of the degradative machinery, I have constructed chimeric RNAs in which a portion of the rpsT mRNA is embedded in a permuted group I intron, a construction that should permit its precise, autocatalytic circularization (14Puttaraju M. Been M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5357-5364Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15Ford E. Ares M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3117-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this work I show that circular rpsT mRNAs form efficiently and are 4–6-fold more stable than their linear counterparts. Circular RNAs are, however, cleaved slowly by RNase E in a 5′-end-independent fashion, which is highly sensitive to ongoing translation.

Based on the finding that the separate “halves” of a group I intron can self-assemble to form an active ribozyme (19Galloway-Salvo J. Coetzee T. Belfort M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 a), permuted group I introns have been designed to drive the circularization of “passenger” sequences inserted between the halves of the intron (14Puttaraju M. Been M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5357-5364Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15Ford E. Ares M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3117-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sequences from the E. coli rpsT gene (13Mackie G.A. Genereaux J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 998-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were inserted into the polylinker in pRR1 (17Perriman R. Ares M. RNA. 1998; 4: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), flanked by the appropriate group I intron sequences (Fig. 1 b) and verified by DNA sequence analysis. A set of constructions, whose prototype is pGM110, containsrpsT sequences from residue 93 to 413, including the entire 5′-untranslated region, the coding sequence, and part of the 3′-untranslated region but lacking the transcriptional terminator (Fig.1 b). The plasmids pGM113 and pGM116 (see below) differ from pGM110 only by point mutation. The insert in pGM111 extends from residue 132 adjacent to the initiation codon (altered from UUG to AUG) to residue 413 and lacks the 5′-untranslated region completely (Fig.1 b). All constructions contain a major internal RNase E cleavage site at rpsT residues 300–301 as well as other minor sites (20Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 171: 2488-2497Crossref Google Scholar). A Northern blot of total cellular RNA extracted from cultures of JM109/pGM110 or JM109/pGM111 with or without induction showed that expression of putative circular rpsT RNAs of 336 or 297 nucleotides, respectively, was induced by IPTG to appreciable levels. These RNAs migrated at roughly half the mobility of the linearrpsT mRNAs (Fig.2 a, compare lanes 2–3 and 4–5). The same blot was reprobed with a complementary oligonucleotide spanning the circular junction, which clearly identified the major species in lanes 3 and5 as circular (Fig. 2 a, lanes 6–10). A permutation analysis (4Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the putative circular RNAs could be converted to linearly permuted, full-length monomers after treatment with RNase H and an appropriate oligonucleotide (data not shown). Further substantiation that circular rpsT RNAs are formed in vivo was obtained by using “inverse” RT-PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). Primers were selected such that only a circular RNA template can give rise to an amplified cDNA product (Fig. 3 a). Synthesis of the expected 189-bp double-stranded DNA product from total RNA isolated from JM109/pGM110 (Fig. 3 b, lanes 2,3, and 6) was dependent on reverse transcription in the first step (compare lanes 6 and 7) and was not affected by prior treatment of the RNA template with DNase I (data not shown). Yields of the anticipated product of 149 bp from total RNA extracted from JM109/pGM111 were low (Fig. 3 b, lane 4) but improved when the RNA template was initially linearized by oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage at a location outside the sequences to be amplified (Fig. 3 b, compare lanes 4 and 5). The amplification products of “inverse” RT-PCR were purified, cloned into pUC19, and sequenced. Both sequences agreed completely with those predicted from the sequence of pRR1 and the group I intron-rpsT boundaries in pGM110 and pGM111 (data not shown). Finally, a point mutation, G → C at position J7/8-5 (21Tanner M.S. Anderson E.M. Gutell R.R. Cech T.R. RNA. 1997; 3: 1037-1051PubMed Google Scholar), known to reduce the rate of self-splicing by group I introns by >103, was introduced into the 3′-“half” of the group I sequence in pGM110 generating pGM116. This mutation abolishes formation of rpsT/circ-336 RNA (not shown). Taken together, the Northern blots, the permutation analyses, and the sequences of the RT-PCR products demonstrate unambiguously that expression of therpsT sequences embedded in pGM110 or pGM111 yields circularrpsT RNAs, which accumulate to readily detectable levels, roughly 4–5-fold higher than those of the endogenous rpsTmRNAs (Fig. 2 a, lanes 1–5).Figure 3Inverse PCR detection of circularrpsT RNA. a, principle of the method. Reverse transcription is primed by oligonucleotide 992, and the product is amplified by oligonucleotides 991 and 992 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The position and orientation of the primers are such that circular RNA (left) but not linear RNA (right) can serve as an amplifiable template. b,analysis of inverse RT-PCR products. Template RNA was extracted from JM109/pGM110 (lanes 2, 3, 6, and7; predicted product of 189 bp) or JM109/pGM111 (lanes 4 and 5; predicted product of 149 bp) and used for RT-PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). In lanes 3 and5, the template RNA was linearized outside the region of amplification with RNase H and oligonucleotide 481 (13Mackie G.A. Genereaux J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 998-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) prior to RT-PCR. In lane 7, reverse transcriptase was omitted in the first step.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Measurements of RNA half-life were performed using standard methods (1Belasco J.G. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 3-12Crossref Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The rate of decay of rpsTRNAs extracted from strain JM109/pGM110 was measured initially from blots probed with a complementary rpsT RNA (data not shown). The circular rpsT/circ-336 RNA disappeared with a half-life of 290 s. In contrast, two linear RNAs larger than 500 nucleotides containing rpsT sequences, presumably incompletely processed species, disappeared with half-lives of 50 and 33 s (data not shown). A typical Northern blot of RNA extracted from cultures of JM109/pGM111 probed with oligonucleotide 993, specific for circularrpsT RNAs, is shown in Fig. 2 b. Two species of RNA are detectable, the major upper band representing intact circular RNA (rpsT/circ-297) and the lower fainter band, marked with an X in the left margin, which indicates circles nicked during isolation. The half-life of the intact circular species (rpsT/297-circ) was 560 s in this experiment. A similar blot with the same samples was probed with oligonucleotide 995, complementary to sequences near the 3′-end of the T4 tdgroup I intron in the vector (Fig. 2 c). A smear of discrete bands is visible in the zero time sample, extending from about 400 to over 1000 nucleotides (Fig. 2 c, lane 0). Virtually all the detectable species disappear within 3–4 min. Half-lives were measured for three discrete non-circular species shown by triangles in the left margin in Fig. 2 c, yielding values of 49–57 s. Thus either circularrpsT mRNA species is considerably more stable than its linear precursors. Although significantly stabilized, the circular rpsT RNAs described above are, nonetheless, metabolically labile. To determine whether RNase E is responsible for initiating the degradation of circular rpsT RNAs in vivo, the stabilities of the rpsT/circ-336 RNAs in either MG1693/pGM110 (Fig.2 d) or SK5665 (rne1)/pGM110 (Fig. 2 e) were measured after cultures grown at the permissive temperature of 29 °C were induced with IPTG and shifted to 39.5 °C for 20 min to achieve partial inactivation of the rne1 gene product prior to RNA extraction. The half-life of the rpsT/circ-336 species in strain SK5665/pGM110 is 1800 ± 155 s (Fig.2 e). This represents a 6-fold increase relative to the same RNA in the wild type strain under identical conditions (296 ± 33 s) (Fig. 2 d). Circular RNAs, including the rpsT/circ RNAs, are translated in vivo (Ref. 17Perriman R. Ares M. RNA. 1998; 4: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and additional data not shown). To assess a role for translation in the stability of circular RNAs, half-lives were determined for several circular rpsT RNAs containing mutations affecting translational efficiency (TableI). For comparison, half-lives are also given for a set of linear, chimeric rpsT mRNAs (rpsT/614) containing similar or identical rpsTsequences embedded between 40 residues of lac operon sequence in their 5′-leader and a portion of the 3′-end of therrnB operon (16Parsons G.D. Donly B.C. Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Such transcripts also effectively mimic the linear precursors to the circular rpsT RNAs. The data in Table I show that a circular rpsT RNA is 4–6-fold more stable than a linear mRNA containing the same rpsTsequences regardless of translational efficiency. CircularrpsT/circ-336 (UUG) RNA, which spans residues 93–412 (Fig. 1 b), exhibits a half-life 5-fold greater thanrpsT/614 (UUG) mRNA spanning the same rpsTsequences (Table I, line 1). A UUG to AUG change at the initiation codon increases expression of the S20 protein up to 6-fold in vivo (16Parsons G.D. Donly B.C. Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The half-life of the rpsT/circ-297 (AUG) RNA is 4-fold greater than its linear counterpart, rpsT/614 (AUG) (Table I, line 3). A double mutation in the rpsTleader (16Parsons G.D. Donly B.C. Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (G129C, A130U; “−3, −4”), which reduces S20 expression substantially, was introduced into pGM110 to form pGM113. The half-life of the rpsT/circ-336 RNA encoded by pGM113 is almost 2-fold lower than the nearly identical circular RNA encoded by pGM110 (compare lines 1 and 2 in Table I) but is still much higher than the corresponding rpsT/614 mRNA containing the −3, −4 mutation (Table I, line 2). These results show that the stabilities of circular mRNAs are subject to almost the same degree of translational modulation as their linear counterparts and more interestingly that circularization protects the rpsTmRNA most effectively when translation is highly efficient (comparerpsT/297-circ (AUG) to rpsT/336-circ (−3, −4) in Table I).Table ITranslational control of stability of circular and linear rpsT mRNAs in vivoInitiation featureHalf-liferpsT/circ1-aThe rpsT/circ RNAs (Fig. 1 b) were detected with oligonucleotide 993.rpsT/6141-bThe rpsT/614 mRNAs were detected with an rpsT cRNA.

LinearrpsT/614 mRNAs encoded by pCD6, pGP11, and pGP12 initiate at a tac promoter and contain from 5′ to 3′: 40 residues of lac leader mRNA, rpsT sequences to residue 412, and 254 residues from the 3′-end of the rrnBoperon (16Parsons G.D. Donly B.C. Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The rpsT leader extends from residue 92 to 132 in pCD6 and pGP12 and from residue 93 to 132 in pGM110 or pGM113 (Fig.1 b), followed by the UUG initiation codon. The −3, −4 mutation in pGM113 and pGP12 reduces translational efficiency without affecting the Shine-Dalgarno sequence or the initiation codon (16Parsons G.D. Donly B.C. Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The initiation codon is altered to AUG and the entire 5′-untranslated leader is deleted in pGM111 (Fig. 1 b) and pGP11.

These constructs all contain the entire rpsT coding sequence (residues 133–393) and 3′ sequences extending to residue 412 or 413 (see also Fig. 1 b). The resistance of a circular RNA to exoribonucleases is obvious (14Puttaraju M. Been M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5357-5364Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); it is thus surprising, if not counterintuitive, that a circular RNA is significantly more resistant to RNase E, a single-stranded specific endoribonuclease of limited sequence preference (2Melefors Ö. Lundberg U. von Gabain A. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 53-70Crossref Google Scholar, 3Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. Prog.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10790-10796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when the same RNA in linear form is an excellent substrate (4Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 13Mackie G.A. Genereaux J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 998-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Mackie G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 171: 2488-2497Crossref Google Scholar). This finding is, however, fully consistent with in vitro data (4Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Moreover, the increased stability of the circularrpsT/circ-336 (UUG) mRNA when RNase E activity is reduced shows that other ribonuclease activities in E. coli(3Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 55-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), including RNase III, RNase G/CafA, and RNase I/I*/M, are unable to compensate efficiently. These findings clearly demonstrate that RNase E is a 5′-end-dependent endoribonuclease in vivoas well as in vitro (4Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 23Jiang X. Diwa A. Belasco J.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2468-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Tock M.R. Walsh A.P. Carroll G. McDowall K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8726-8732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and that the frequently observed 5′ → 3′ vectorial character of mRNA decay in vivo (1Belasco J.G. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 3-12Crossref Google Scholar, 3Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

RNA. 1999; 5: 972-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) is due to the end dependence of RNase E (4Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar,23Jiang X. Diwa A. Belasco J.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2468-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The initial attack of RNase E on circular RNAs in vivo is 5-fold less efficient than on linear RNAs of similar primary sequence. This can be rationalized by a two-site or looping model (3Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 55-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In this model, RNase E in the degradosome would first contact linear substrate mRNAs at their extreme 5′-ends. This 5′-contact would stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex and would facilitate, possibly in a first order rearrangement (“looping”), recognition of internal cleavage sites that may be partially hindered by adjacent secondary structures. In circular RNAs, there would be no 5′-contact, and cleavage site recognition itself would become second order and much less efficient unless the cleavage site were particularly accessible or exposed. Thus the rate of attack of RNase E on a circular RNA, rather than on a triphosphorylated RNA as suggested elsewhere (23Jiang X. Diwa A. Belasco J.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2468-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), defines its basal rate of activity. As shown here, linear RNA with an unobstructed 5′-triphosphate terminus is attacked 5-fold faster than a circular RNA, showing that a triphosphate terminus can assist substrate recognition. A 5′-monophosphate terminus provides a further 20–25-fold stimulation of the initial rate of RNA cleavage by RNase E in vitro (4Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar,23Jiang X. Diwa A. Belasco J.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2468-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and by a significant but undefined amount in vivo (12Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1991; 65: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). One clear implication of these data for the two-step model is that translation affects the second (rearrangement) step rather than the initial recognition of the 5′-end of the substrate. It is likely that the degradation of many mRNAs will follow the behavior of the rpsT mRNA and exhibit 5′-end dependence. Any exceptions that prove to be insensitive to the state of the 5′ terminus will likely be explained by the presence of readily accessible RNase E sites in the body of the mRNA (permitting an increase in the basal rate of RNase E cleavage) or by inefficient translation.

(1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 31421–31427). Synaptotagmin I (Syt I), a possible Ca2+sensor for neurotransmitter release, showed both Ca2+-dependent (via the C2 domain) and -independent (via the NH2-terminal domain) self-oligomerization, which are thought to be important for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. However, little is known about the relationship between these two interactions and the Ca2+-dependent oligomerization properties of other synaptotagmin isoforms. In this study, we first examined the Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization properties of synaptotagmin family by co-expression of T7- and FLAG-tagged Syts (full-length or cytoplasmic domain) in COS-7 cells. We found that Syt VII is a unique class of synaptotagmins that only showed robust Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization at the cytoplasmic domain with EC50 values of about 150 μm Ca2+. In addition, Syt VII preferentially interacted with the previously described subclass of Syts (V, VI, and X) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Co-expression of full-length and cytoplasmic portion of Syts VII (or II) indicate that Syt VII cytoplasmic domain oligomerizes in a Ca2+-dependent manner without being tethered at the NH2-terminal domain, whereas Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization at the cytoplasmic domain of other isoforms (e.g. Syt II) occurs only when the two molecules are tethered at the NH2-terminal domain.

Syt I (or II) has two self-oligomerization properties: a SDS-resistant Ca2+-independent multimerization probably mediated by a region just downstream of the transmembrane region (7Fukuda M. Kanno E.

For instance, it remains undetermined whether the C2B domains oligomerize independent of the Ca2+-independent oligomerization at the amino-terminal domain (Fig. 1 A). In addition, studies of the Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of the C2B domain have mainly used recombinant proteins from Escherichia coli (9Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Fukuda, unpublished observations. Studies of Ca2+-independent oligomerization using recombinant proteins from E. coli may also be unreliable because native synaptotagmins undergo post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation (16Veit M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, it would be better to examine the oligomerization properties of the synaptotagmin family in mammalian cultured cells by expressing two different epitope (FLAG and T7)-tagged synaptotagmins (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this method, we previously showed that Syts III, V, VI, and X form homo- and hetero-oligomer through the NH2-terminal cysteine motif by disulfide bonding (at amino acids 10, 21, and 33 of mouse synaptotagmin III) irrespective of the presence of Ca2+ (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and that Syt VIΔTM, a major alternatively spliced variant of Syt VI that lacks this cysteine motif, cannot associate with Syt VI in vitroor in vivo (18Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31428-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, other isoforms did not show such cysteine-based homo-oligomerization (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the Ca2+-dependent and -independent oligomerization properties of synaptotagmin isoforms (both full-length and cytoplasmic portion) using two different epitope-tagged synaptotagmins, and found that Syt VII is the only isoform that shows robust Ca2+-dependent oligomerization properties. On the basis of these results, we discuss the functional relationship between Ca2+-dependent and -independent oligomerization of synaptotagmins. AmpliTaq DNA polymerase and restriction enzymes were obtained from PE Biosystems, and Toyobo Biochemicals (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (M2) against FLAG peptide were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. and Sigma, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody was from Novagen. All other chemicals were commercial products of reagent grade. Solutions were prepared in deionized water. Construction of the full cytoplasmic domains of mouse synaptotagmins I-XI were carried out by polymerase chain reaction using the following oligonucleotides with internal restriction enzyme sites (underlined below; BamHI or BclI): Syt I, 5′-CGGATCCAAGAAATGTTTGTTCAAA-3′ (Syt I-cyto primer, sense; amino acid residues 80–85); Syt II, 5′-GCGGATCCAAGAAGTGCTGCTGCAAGAA-3′ (sense; amino acid residues 88–94); Syt III, 5′-CGGATCCTGGAAGTTGTGCTGGGT-3′ (sense; amino acid residues 77–82); Syt IV, 5′-CTGATCACAGAGAAGATCAGCCAAATC-3′ (sense; amino acid residues 39–45); Syt V, 5′-GCGGATCCTGGAAACTGTGCTGGGTTCC-3′ (sense; amino acid residues 75–81); Syt VI, 5′-CGGATCCATGCCCTGGAGGAAGAAAGA-3′ (sense; amino acid residues 86–92); Syt VII, 5′-GCGGATCCCGCAAACTGGGCAAACGCTA-3′ (sense; amino acid residues 43–49); Syt VIII, 5′-GCGGATCCCACCGCCATCGCCACAGGAA-3′ (sense; amino acid residues 69–75); Syt IX, 5′-GCGGATCCCGGAAGCGCTGTCGGAGA-3′ (sense; amino acid residues 52–57); Syt X, 5′-GCGGATCCTGGAAGTTGTGCTGGCCATG-3′ (sense; amino acid residues 77–83), and Syt XI, 5′-GCGGATCCCACCAGCAGGCAGAGAAGAA-3′ (sense; amino acid residues 41–47). In the case of FLAG-tagged Syt I-cyto, for example, a cDNA encoding the Syt I cytoplasmic domain was amplified by Syt I-cyto and SP6 primers using pGEM-T-FLAG-Syt I (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) as a template. Purified polymerase chain reaction products were digested with BamHI and SalI and then substituted for the BamHI-SalI insert of pGEM-T-FLAG-Syt I, and verified by DNA sequencing as described previously (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The resulting pGEM-T-FLAG-Syt I-cyto plasmid was digested withNotI, and then the NotI insert was subcloned into the NotI site of pEF-BOS (pEF-FLAG-Syt I-cyto) (19Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5332Crossref Scopus (1499) Google Scholar, 20Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pEF-FLAG-Syts II-XI-cyto clones were similarly constructed. pEF-T7(or FLAG)-Syts I-XI were prepared as described previously (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared using Wizard-mini preps (Promega) or QIAGEN Maxi-prep kits. Statistical analysis and curve fitting were done using the GraphPad PRISM computer program (Version 2.0). Co-transfection of pEF-T7-Syts and pEF-FLAG-Syts into COS-7 cells (5 × 105 cells, the day before transfection/10-cm dish) was carried out by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Proteins were solubilized with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin A at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitation of T7-Syts by anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and immunoblotting analyses were also performed as described previously (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands on x-ray film (X-Omat AR, Kodak) were captured by Gel Print 2000i/VGA (Bio Image) and analyzed by Basic Quantifier Software (version 1.0) (Bio Image). In a previous study (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we showed that Syts III, V, VI, and X formed hetero-oligomers through disulfide bonding irrespective of the presence of Ca2+. To examine the Ca2+-dependent self-oligomerization of other synaptotagmin isoforms (Syts I, II, IV, VII, VIII, IX, and XI), T7- and FLAG-tagged full-length Syts were co-expressed in COS-7 cells and the association of these two proteins was evaluated by immunoprecipitation in the presence or absence of 250 μm Ca2+, corresponding to the concentrations required for neurotransmitter release (1Llinás R. Sugimori M. Silver R.B. Science. 1992; 256: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 2Heidelberger R. Heinemann C. Neher E. Matthews G. Nature. 1994; 371: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, and T7-Syts were immunoprecipitated by anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose. Co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-Syts were first detected by anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.1 B, upper left panel), and then the same blots were stripped and reprobed with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody to ensure the equivalent loading of T7-Syts (Fig.1 B, lower left panel). Co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-Syts were then quantified and normalized by the amount of immunoisolated T7-Syts (Fig. 1 C). Based on the differences in homo-oligomerization activities, we classify these isoforms into three distinct groups. The first group included Syts I, II, VIII, and XI, which showed Ca2+-independent homo-oligomerization activity, but Syt XI oligomerization activity was apparently weaker than that of the others (Syts I, II, and VIII). Among this group, only Syt II oligomerization was slightly activated by Ca2+ (<1.5-fold increase; Fig.1 C). The second group contained Syts IV and IX. Syt IV did not form homo-oligomers in our binding conditions, and faint Syt IX homo-oligomerization was only observed after prolonged exposure to x-ray film. Consistent with this, we previously showed that these isoforms did not form significant SDS-resistant homo-oligomers on SDS-PAGE (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The third group contained only Syt VII, the homo-oligomerization of which was largely Ca2+-dependent, although small fractions of Syt VII oligomerize in the absence of Ca2+. The minor higher band of Syt VII is probably produced by partial post-translational modifications such as O-glycosylation or palmitoylation at the NH2-terminal domain due to transient overexpression in COS-7 cells. Because of such possible modifications at the NH2-terminal domain, the minor higher band of Syt VII seems to be more efficiently immunoprecipitated than the lower band, but both bands behaved the same in the presence of Ca2+. Since the homo-oligomerization of Syts, except for Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of Syt VII, were difficult to detect when T7- and FLAG-tagged Syts were separately expressed in COS-7 cells and mixed after solubilization (Fig. 1 B, upper right panel), the homo-oligomerization presented in Fig.1 B probably reflects in vivo interactions. It is noteworthy that Syt VII Ca2+-independent oligomerization could not be observed when T7- and FLAG-Syt VII were separately expressed in COS-7 cells, whereas in the presence of Ca2+Syt VII oligomerized as well as with co-expression. The oligomerization experiments were also performed in the presence of 1 mmMg2+, but Mg2+ could not activate synaptotagmin oligomerization (data not shown). In the next set of experiments, we examined the Ca2+-dependent oligomerization properties of synaptotagmin cytoplasmic domains as demonstrated by the interaction of recombinant Syt I or II expressed in bacteria with detergent-solubilized native proteins (Syt I) from brain (9Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Damer C.K. Creutz C.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1661-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Chapman E.R. Desai R.C. Davis A.F. Tornehl C.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 59-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1, only the cytoplasmic domain of Syt VII showed robust Ca2+-dependent oligomerization (Fig.2). Syts II and V cytoplasmic domains also showed apparent Ca2+-dependent oligomerization (2.4- and 1.9-fold increase in the presence of Ca2+, respectively), but most of the fractions of Syts II and V oligomerization were Ca2+-independent. Surprisingly, Ca2+-dependent Syts I, III, VI, IX, and X homo-oligomerizations were quite weak, and could only be detected when large amounts of anti-T7 tag antibody immunoprecipitant was loaded on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). In contrast, homo-oligomerization of Syts IV, VIII, and XI cytoplasmic domains was not observed in our binding conditions. This result is unlikely to be due to the lower expression levels of the cytoplasmic domains of Syts than those of full-length proteins, because comparable or greater amounts of T7-(or FLAG)-Syts I-XI cytoplasmic domains were expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). To further examine whether Syt VII also hetero-oligomerizes with other isoforms in a Ca2+-dependent manner, FLAG-Syt VII-cyto and various T7-Syt-cytos proteins were co-expressed in COS-7 cells and their association was tested by immunoprecipitation in the presence or absence of Ca2+ as described above. Interestingly, the Syt VII cytoplasmic domain preferentially interacted with Syts V, VI, and X, but not Syt III, all of which belong to the same subclass of synaptotagmins (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 21Ibata K. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12267-12273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Syts V, VI, and X were found to hetero-oligomerize as well with Syt VII as Ca2+-dependent Syt VII homo-oligomerization. Similar results were obtained even when the full-length Syts III, V, VI, VII, and X were used (data not shown). Since the homo-oligomerization of full-length and the cytoplasmic domain of Syt VII were strongly activated by Ca2+ (Figs. 1 Band 2), Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of the Syt VII cytoplasmic domain would occur between two molecules that do not pre-assemble at the NH2-terminal domain (see Fig.1 A, right panel). This was evident when three proteins (T7-Syt VII, FLAG-Syt VII, and FLAG-Syt VII-cyto; molar ratio, 1:1:1) were co-expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig.4 B, lane 2) and their associations were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. In the absence of Ca2+, only FLAG-Syt VII weakly interacted with T7-Syt VII (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), whereas in the presence of Ca2+, equivalent amounts of Syt VII cytoplasmic domain (FLAG-Syt VII-cyto) and Flag-Syt VII were co-immunoprecipitated with T7-Syt VII (Fig. 4 A, lane 4, arrowheads), indicating that the Syt VII cytoplasmic domain can oligomerize with full-length proteins completely in a Ca2+-dependent manner without being tethered at the NH2-terminal domain (see Fig.4 C, right panel). In contrast, when T7-Syt II, FLAG-Syt II, and FLAG-Syt II-cyto were co-expressed in COS-7 cells (molar ratio, 1:1:1), the Syt II cytoplasmic domain (FLAG-Syt II-cyto) could not interact with full-length proteins (T7-Syt II) even in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 2), even though the Syt II cytoplasmic domain itself showed Ca2+-dependent oligomerization (Fig. 2). However, FLAG-Syt II could oligomerize well with T7-Syt II irrespective of the presence of Ca2+, as demonstrated in Fig. 1,A and B. Therefore, the Ca2+-independent oligomerization mediated by the transmembrane region may restrict the Ca2+-dependent oligomerization mediated by the cytoplasmic domain; i.e. Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of synaptotagmins (Syts I, II, III, V, VI, and X) occurs only when the two molecules are tethered at the NH2-terminal domain (see Fig. 4 C, left panel). In the final set of experiments, we examined the Ca2+ dependence of homo-oligomerization of the Syt VII cytoplasmic domain. T7- and FLAG-Syt VII-cyto were co-expressed in COS-7 cells and recombinant proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-T7 tag antibody in the presence of various concentrations of Ca2+. As shown in Fig.5 A (upper panel), co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-Syt VII-cyto was increased as a function of Ca2+ concentration. The EC50 value (Ca2+ concentration at half-maximal binding) of Syt VII self-oligomerizations was calculated to be 155 μmCa2+ (Fig. 5 B), which closely corresponds to the Ca2+ concentrations required for neurotransmitter release (1Llinás R. Sugimori M. Silver R.B. Science. 1992; 256: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 2Heidelberger R. Heinemann C. Neher E. Matthews G. Nature. 1994; 371: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), and is consistent with the previously described EC50 values for Syts I and II (9Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, hetero-oligomerization of Syt VII with Syt V, VI, or X cytoplasmic domain also occurred in a Ca2+ concentration range similar to that required for Syt VII homo-oligomerization (EC50 of about 200–400 μm Ca2+; Fig. 5 Cand data not shown), suggesting that these associations are physiologically relevant. In this study, we have demonstrated that synaptotagmin isoforms show distinct homo-oligomerization activities by using a dual epitope-tag (T7 and FLAG) expression system. Based on the results shown in Fig. 1 B, together with the previously described cysteine-based oligomerization of Syts III, V, VI, and X (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we classified the synaptotagmin family into four distinct groups. The first group contained Syts III, V, VI, and X, which were strongly associated with each other via the conserved NH2-terminal cysteine motif by disulfide bonding (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and accordingly their associations were β-mercaptoethanol-sensitive and Ca2+-independent. At the cytoplasmic domain, however, only Syt V cytoplasmic domain showed apparent Ca2+-dependent homo-oligomerization (Fig. 2). This grouping is consistent with a previous phylogenetic analysis (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and their reported weak or no inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate binding ability (21Ibata K. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12267-12273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The second group (Syts I, II, VIII, and XI) also showed Ca2+-independent homo-oligomerization, but these interactions were insensitive to β-mercaptoethanol (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Syt XI homo-oligomerization activity was significantly lower than those of Syts I, II, and VIII. Despite the high sequence similarity between Syts I and II (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and the similar biochemical properties of their C2 domains tested so far (9Sugita S. Hata Y.

Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), the Syt I and II cytoplasmic domains showed distinct self-oligomerization activities (Fig. 2): the Syt II cytoplasmic domain oligomerized well in the absence of Ca2+, and this association was enhanced by Ca2+, whereas the Syt I cytoplasmic domain showed only very weak Ca2+-dependent oligomerization. Although the oligomerization activity is thought to be protein concentration-dependent, the expression levels of recombinant Syt I in COS-7 cells seems to be sufficient and at physiologically relevant levels, because the levels of expression of Syts I-XI in COS-7 cells are greater than the endogenous levels of expression in brain.2 Moreover, previous in vitro binding experiments only showed the existence of Ca2+-dependent oligomerization, but did not address the strength (e.g. K d value) of the Syt I oligomerization (9Sugita S.

Further work will be required to elucidate whether the Ca2+-dependent oligomerizing capacity of Syt I occurs at physiologically relevant levels. Syt I Ca2+-independent oligomerization is thought to be mediated by the predicted amphipathic α-helix region just downstream of the transmembrane region (14Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, since Syts II and VIII did not contain such amphipathic α-helix regions and only the Syt II cytoplasmic domain showed Ca2+-independent oligomerization (Fig. 2), different mechanisms are involved in homo-oligomerization of Syts II and VIII. Syts IV and IX belong to the third group, which was characterized by almost no homo-oligomerization activity in our binding conditions. Syt VII, the only member of fourth group, showed unique Ca2+-dependent oligomerization properties. The Syt VII cytoplasmic domain oligomerizes in a Ca2+-dependent manner without being tethered at the NH2-terminal domain (Fig. 1 A, right panel), whereas the Ca2+-dependent homo-oligomerization of the first and second group Syts at the cytoplasmic domain occurs only when the two molecules are tethered at the NH2-terminal domain (Fig. 1 A, left panel). In addition, we found that Syt VII can completely hetero-oligomerize with Syts V, VI, and X, but not Syt III, in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Since Syts III, V, VI, and X can be assembled by disulfide bonding at the NH2-terminal domain (7Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), Syt VII binds to the cytoplasmic domain of Syts V, VI, and X in response to Ca2+, which would modulate the function of the Syts III, V, VI, and X complexes. Since Syts III, VI, and VII are expressed in all brain regions and Syts V and X are brain-specific isoforms (25Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C.

Thus, it is possible to form such Ca2+-dependent hetero-oligomers. Currently, however, except for the function of Syt III in insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (29Mizuta M. Kurose T. Miki T. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seino S. Matsukura S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the exact role of Syts III, V, VI, and X in brain remains obscure.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although these two Lys residues in the C2B domain are well conserved in almost all the isoforms (7Fukuda M. Kanno E.

Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), Ca2+-dependent homo-oligomerization activities were apparently different between each isoform (Fig. 2), suggesting that the surrounding sequences would affect and determine homo-oligomerization capacity. In fact, the Syt VII C2B domain has several unique amino acid residues that are not conserved in other isofomrs (e.g. I284, N328, S373 etc.). Further detailed mutational analysis is needed to elucidate the structural basis of Ca2+-dependent oligomerization of the cytoplasmic domain of Syt VII in the future. In contrast, when the C2B domains of Syts III, V, VI, and X were compared, we could not identify specific amino acid residues unique to Syt III, which are implicated in loss of Ca2+-dependent oligomerization with Syt VII. In summary, we have investigated the Ca2+-dependent and -independent homo-oligomerization of synaptotagmin family proteins and show that the Ca2+-independent oligomerization at the NH2-terminal domain is a prerequisite for the Ca2+- dependent oligomerization at the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin family proteins (except for Syt VII). Therefore, studies on the Ca2+-dependent hetero-oligomerization at the cytoplasmic domain will have to be evaluated by using both full-length and cytoplasmic domains. Ca2+-dependent and -independent hetero-oligomerization of the synaptotagmin family will be clarified by the T7- and FLAG-tagged Syts co-expression system in the near future.

Electrophysiological recordings demonstrate that myometrial maxi-K current is suppressed in term-pregnant compared to non-pregnant mice. We sought to determine whether maxi-K current suppression is due to reduction of maxi-K channel protein or differential expression of maxi-K channel isoforms that vary in their Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage sensitivities. Immunoblot analyses show an increase of maxi-K channel protein throughout gestation. Polymerase chain reaction of mouse myometrial cDNA identified four alternatively spliced sites within the maxi-K transcript and three within the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive ""tail"" domain. Ribonuclease protection analyses demonstrate that total channel transcript levels mimic protein expression; however transcript levels of alternatively spliced regions of regulatory domains that alter sensitivity to voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> differ in their gestational expression. An insert that increases the maxi-K channel sensitivity to voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present at steady levels throughout gestation, differing from total channel transcript regulation. The insert-less form of this transcript, which reduces the channel voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity, is not detected until midterm pregnancy. These findings verify that multiple isoforms of the maxi-K channel are present in the mouse myometrium and are regulated differentially during gestation, which is a likely mechanism for modulation of myometrial excitability during pregnancy."

Barnard E.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Antibodies against peptides from the C-terminal portion of the P2X1 subtype have been used to determine the distribution of P2X1 receptors in the vas deferens and urinary bladder, where they are found on the smooth muscle cells (2Vulchanova L. Arvidsson U. Riedl M. Wang J. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Elde R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8063-8067Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that different P2X receptor subtypes form clusters of two different sizes on the smooth muscle cells of the rat urinary bladder, vas deferens, and blood vessels: large numbers of small clusters of about 0.4-μm diameter distributed over the smooth muscle and small numbers of large clusters greater than 1-μm diameter positioned under junctional varicosities (3Hansen M.A. Balcar V.J. Barden J.A. Bennett M.R. J. Neurocytol. 1998; 27: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Hansen M.A. Dutton J.L. Balcar V.J. Barden J.A. Bennett M.R. J. Autonom. Nerv.

The large junctional P2X clusters can be observed during normal development to be formed from small clusters of a number of different subtypes, which gather in large numbers in the vicinity of the nerve varicosities (6Dutton J.L. Hansen M.A. Balcar V.J. Barden J.A. Bennett M.R. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 3-15Crossref Google Scholar). Sympathetic ganglion cells were reported to possess P2X receptors, primarily of the P2X2, P2X4, and P2X6 subtypes (7Xiang Z. Bo X. Burnstock G. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 256: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and transcripts for P2X1, P2X2, P2X4, and P2X6 are present (8Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although it is not known whether these receptors are organized into large and small clusters and if so whether the large clusters are found beneath boutons as expected if they mediate some aspect of transmission. In the present work, both large and small clusters of different P2X subunit types are shown to exist on ganglion cells, and their spatial disposition with respect to preganglionic boutons has been ascertained. The existence of P2X receptor clusters of different sizes on ganglion cells raises the question whether they can form independently of the innervation of the cells. In addition, are such clustered P2X subunits stable once they form or are they subject to internalization and recycling, as is the case for instance with the β2-adrenergic receptor? Chimeras of green fluorescent protein (GFP)1 and receptors as diverse as the β2-adrenergic receptor (9Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol.

Malinow R. Science. 1999; 284: 413-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar) have been used to transfect cells to study receptor lability. In the present work a P2X1-GFP chimera (16Dutton, J. L., Poronnik, P., Li, G. H., Holding, C. A., Worthington, R. A., Vandenberg, R. J., Cook, D. I., Barden, J. A. & Bennett, M. R. (2000) Neuropharmacol. 39, in pressGoogle Scholar) has been used to determine the lability of P2X1 receptor clusters in the plasma membranes of sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglion. It is shown that junctional size clusters of P2X1-GFP chimeras form in the plasma membranes of these neurons and that these clusters become dispersed with the internalization of the chimeras on their exposure to agonists for periods of seconds. pCI-P2X1-GFP was constructed as follows. The plasmid pBKCMV containing a P2X1 cDNA insert from rat vas deferens was obtained (10Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). The P2X1 cDNA was amplified from the plasmid by polymerase chain reaction using a forward primer that annealed to the T3 promoter region and a reverse primer that annealed directly upstream of and over the stop codon in P2X1. The reverse primer (5′ CAT GCC ATG GAG GTC CTC ATG TTC TCC 3′) eliminated the stop codon and incorporated an in frame NcoI site at the 3′ end of P2X1. The polymerase chain reaction product was thymine adenine-cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). The sequence of the P2X1 polymerase chain reaction product was confirmed using automated fluorescence sequencing of both the coding and noncoding strands. pRSET GFP20 (S65A, V68L, F99S, M153T, and V163A), a plasmid containing an optimized GFP, was obtained from Shinichi Aota (Biomolecular Research Institute, Osaka, Japan). P2X1 was ligated upstream in frame into the 5′ NcoI site of GFP. The P2X1-GFP insert was removed and ligated into pCI (Promega), a CMV promoter-driven mammalian vector. Construction of control plasmid pCI-P2X1 involved excision of P2X1 from pBKCMV-P2X1 and ligation into pCI. The replication-deficient adenovirus Ad-CMV-P2X1-GFP was produced using the Adeasy system (17He T.C. Zhou S.B. da Costa L.T., Yu, Y. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar). Briefly P2X1-GFP was cloned into the pShuttle-CMV vector, which was then recombined in Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells with Adeasy1 plasmid. Recombinant clones were isolated and screened. Positive clones were grown, linearized with PacI, and transfected into HEK293 cells. After a cytopathic effect was observed, the crude viral lysate was harvested and the viruses characterized. CsCl-purified virus stocks were subsequently prepared and cells infected prior to experimentation as described previously (18Poronnik P. O'Mullane L.M. Harding E.A. Greger R. Cook D.I. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Coverslips were placed cell side down, with a drop of modified Eagle's medium onto glass microscope slides. Alternatively the coverslips were put cell side up, a drop of modified Eagle's medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium added, and another coverslip placed on top. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde prior to labeling with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the extracellular domain of P2X1 and then labeled with a Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for visualization with an upright Leica TCS NT UV laser confocal microscope system as described previously (3Hansen M.A. Balcar V.J.

Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 3-15Crossref Google Scholar). Cy5 fluorescence was detected at 665 nm, while GFP fluorescence was detected at 525 nm. Live cells growing on coverslips in which only GFP fluorescence was recorded at room temperature were mounted in a perspex holder that allowed rapid solution change and mounted on an inverted Leica system. Experiments were performed using an inverted microscope (IM 35, Zeiss) with phase-contrast optics. Neurons infected with P2X1-GFP were selected by their fluorescence. Patch pipettes between 2 and 4 MΩ were filled with: 130 mm CsCl, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mmEGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mmMgCl2, pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH. The bath solution contained: 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3 adjusted with NaOH. Whole-cell recordings were made with an Axopatch 1C amplifier (Axon Instruments). The holding potential was −60 mV. ATP was applied either with a fast-flow U tube delivery system (19Evans R.J. Lewis C. Buell G.N. Valera S. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar) or a puffer pipette. Delivery time to cells varied between 20 and 100 ms depending on separation distance. The pipette was identical to those used for whole cell recording, except it was not fire-polished. The puffer pipette was positioned 2–5 μm from the cell surface, and the pressure was 1–3 p.s.i. with a duration of 200 ms. All electrical recordings were carried out at room temperature (20–22 °C). Data were acquired and analyzed using MacLab (AD Instruments). Tissue samples were prepared from 20 rat whole superior cervical ganglion collected from animals 1 day, 6 weeks, and 9 months old. Samples were prepared as described previously (20Worthington R.A. Dutton J.L. Poronnik P. Bennett M.R. Barden J.A. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 2065-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis procedures according to the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) were undertaken using a NOVEX X-cell II mini system to run the 10–20% gradient gels. Tissue loadings were 9.2 μg. Detection of antibody bands was achieved using the ECL/Hyperfilm system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specificity of the antibodies against each of the subunit types has been given (20Worthington R.A. Dutton J.L. Poronnik P. Bennett M.R. Barden J.A. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 2065-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Endogenous P2X receptor subunits are found in and on the plasmalemma membrane of rat superior cervical ganglion cells in rats from 6 weeks to 2 years of age. However the frequency with which either a diffuse or clustered distribution of P2X receptors exists either in the ganglion cells or on their membranes depends on the subunit type being considered (summarized in TableI). Of all the seven subtypes examined, AbP2X2 was the most predominant (Table I). In contrast, few ganglion cells showed much staining for AbP2X3, AbP2X4, and AbP2X5 (see Table I). The staining mostly occurs in patches of about 1-μm diameter inside the cells, which on some occasions is associated with AbSV2 labeling. This indicates a close relationship between these receptors and synaptic vesicles in the neuron. The next highest level of staining for P2X subunits after AbP2X2 was found for AbP2X7 and then AbP2X6 (Table I). The highest level of staining for each of these was found, as for AbP2X2, on the membranes of the cells (Fig.1, e and f show P2X6), although there was also a high level of staining in the cell bodies, in some cases colocalized with AbSV2 staining. When the level of AbP2X6 or AbP2X7 labeling was less intense at the membranes, individual clusters of these receptors of about 1-μm diameter could be distinguished, like clusters of P2X receptors found on smooth muscle cells (3Hansen M.A. Balcar V.J. Barden J.A. Bennett M.R. J. Neurocytol. 1998; 27: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Barden J.A. Cottee L.J. Bennett M.R. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In summary, P2X2, P2X7, and P2X6 subunits seem to be in abundance on the membranes of most of the ganglion cells, although this is not the case for the other subunits, consistent with a recent general survey of P2X subtypes in the ganglion (7Xiang Z. Bo X. Burnstock G. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 256: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Colocalization of P2X receptors and vesicles is mostly confined to within the cell bodies, suggesting that the receptors are being transported to the terminals of the neurons in vesicles where they may act as autoreceptors (22Boehm S. Naunyn-Schmiedegers Arch. Pharmakol. 1994; 350: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Boehm S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 737-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, P2X clusters of the 1-μm size on the cell membrane are not colocalized with synaptic boutons.Table IP2X subtype labeling on superior cervical ganglionInside bodyNucleusCell processesCell membraneOverall labelP2X1ModerateNoneFew strong, most weakFew strong, most weakWeakP2X2RareNoneStrongSome strong, some moderateStrongP2X3Some strong, most unlabeledSome strong, most unlabeledSome moderateRareModerateP2X4FewSome strong, most unlabeledRareRareVery weakP2X5Few moderate, most unlabeledFew moderate, most unlabeledModerateFewWeakP2X6Some strong, most weakSome strong, most unlabeledModerateModerateModerateP2X7RareFew moderate, most unlabeledStrongSome strong, some moderateStrongIn colocalization experiments with SV2, P2X 2 was often found on the cell membrane and P2X 7 less frequently.

Open table in a new tab In colocalization experiments with SV2, P2X 2 was often found on the cell membrane and P2X 7 less frequently. No other subtype showed any association with synaptic vesicles in other locations. Endogenous P2X receptor subunits are found on rat superior cervical ganglion cells isolated into tissue culture, although the frequency with which diffuse or clustered distributions of P2X receptors exists either in the ganglion cells or on their membranes depends on the subunit type. Very few ganglion cells possessed AbP2X1 staining. Many of those cells stained for AbP2X1 showed a diffuse distribution of AbP2X1 in the cell body with only a minority that showed distinct membrane label associated with SV2 (Fig. 1 a). In contrast, AbP2X2 stained nearly all the cells in culture, with most of this stain found on the membranes (Fig.1 c) and not associated with SV2 (Fig. 1 d). Few ganglion cells showed much staining for AbP2X3, AbP2X4, and AbP2X5. The next highest level of staining for P2X subunits after AbP2X2 was again found for AbP2X6 and AbP2X7. By far the highest level of staining for each of these was found, as for AbP2X2, on the membranes of the cells, an example of which is shown for AbP2X6 in Fig. 1 e. The corresponding panel for SV2 stain is shown in Fig. 1 f. In summary then, P2X2, P2X7, and P2X6 subunits seem to be in abundance on the membranes of most of the ganglion cells in culture, while there are very few neurons with membrane labeling for P2X1, P2X3, P2X4, or P2X5. These observations therefore reflect the density of the P2X receptors found in these neurons in vivo (see TableI). Western blots show relative abundance of subtypes from whole SCG homogenates. Lane 1 in Fig. 2shows rabbit preimmune serum is devoid of bands. An intensely stained band corresponding to the molecular mass of glycosylated P2X2 at about 70 kDa reflects a high level of this subunit. The next most abundant subunit appears to be P2X7, although the level expressed in tissue from 1-day-old animals is much lower. The next most abundant subtype identified in Fig. 1 is P2X6, although this subtype also appears to be present at very low levels in day-old rat. The level of P2X3 appeared equally abundant, even in day-old tissue, while the levels of P2X4 and P2X5 appeared much lower. Each antibody had very similar affinity, with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay readings of 70,000–75,000 compared with 200 in preimmune serum. The level of P2X1 appears only moderate, and the major bands at 40 kDa are not glycosylated protein, so the majority of the species is unlikely to be inserted into the cell membrane. The properties of these P2X receptors on ganglion cells isolated into culture were determined by applying different purinergic receptor agonists to voltage-clamped cells and determining the resultant currents at different holding potentials. The great percentage of cells (92% representing 38 cells in 20 cultures) gave a relatively nondesensitizing response to applied ATP (50 μm) with peak values as high as several nanoamperes (Fig.3 a; 2.60 ± 0.37 nA (mean ± S.E.); n = 9) and were unresponsive to α,β-meATP (50 μm; Fig. 3 d). These are the results expected if the predominant P2X subunits present on ganglion cells are of the P2X2, P2X7, and P2X6 subtypes. As these ATP-generated currents are nondesensitizing, it was possible to determine their response to applied ATP at different holding potentials (Fig. 3 b). This showed that the ATP-generated currents increased continually with an increase in negative holding potential (Fig. 3 c). Ganglion cells in culture were infected with adenovirus Ad-CMV-P2X1-GFP and the distribution of the chimera near and at the plasma membrane determined at various times after the infection. At 24 h after infection, clusters of P2X1-GFP were observed on the cell membrane of most neurons. Even by 12 h after infection, a diffuse distribution of P2X1-GFP was observed throughout the cytoplasm of the neurons as well as in their plasma membranes as evidenced by the GFP fluorescence (Fig.4 c). The relationship between the staining of the extracellular domain of P2X1 and GFP at the plasma membranes of the neurons was determined using AbP2X1 antibody staining of fixed cells. The GFP fluorescence showed the chimera was closely associated with the intracellular face of the plasma membrane by 12 h after infection (Fig. 4 c). Staining of these cells with AbP2X1antibody showed that unlike the GFP, the extracellular domain of the P2X1 chimera was located at the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 d). At relatively long times after infection, 72 h, the number of P2X1-GFP clusters had increased over that at earlier times (Fig. 4 e), but the AbP2X1 labeling remained confined to the extracellular domain of the plasma membrane with the GFP located immediately under the membrane (Fig. 4 f). Ganglion cells possessing clusters of P2X1-GFP were observed under the fluorescent microscope and patch-clamped at a holding potential of −60 mV prior to application of purinergic agonists. Application of ATP (50 μm) gave a fast desensitizing current with a peak of about 1 nA (Fig.5 column A, trace a; 1.55 ± 0.43 nA; n = 9). Subsequent reapplication of ATP 2 min later to the same neuron at the same concentration gave only a very small current of about 100 pA (Fig.5, column A, trace b; 0.25 ± 0.06 nA; n = 9). This current was even smaller in response to a further reapplication of ATP (Fig. 5, column A, trace c). Such desensitization was observed in all infected neurons examined in this way and was greater the higher the concentration of ATP applied (compare Fig. 5, column A withcolumn B). However it may be noted that a small nondesensitizing component could be detected in these neurons (see for example Fig. 6, column A,trace a), which might reflect the action of ATP on nondesensitizing subunits.Figure 6Whole-cell currents due to application of α,β-meATP to cells infected with DNA for P2X1-GFP are large and show desensitization. Column A shows the results of applying α,β-meATP (2 μm) for the first time intrace a and then applying ATP (2 μm) 6 min later in trace b; in trace c α,β-meATP (2 μm) was then applied 10 min after trace b, and finally in trace d ATP was applied 10 min aftertrace c. Column B shows the results of applying α,β-meATP (2 μm) for the first time in trace a, 5 min later in trace b, and a further 5 min later intrace c; in trace d ATP (2 μm) was applied 5 min after trace c. The holding potential in each case was −60 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These observations suggested that the ganglion cells had been converted by infection from possessing a predominantly nondesensitizing P2X subunit (Fig. 5) to one that was desensitizing (Fig. 6). As desensitizing subunits are sensitive to α,β-meATP, but nondesensitizing subunits are not, a further test of the change in subunit dominance in infected ganglion cells was made using this purinergic agonist. Neurons with P2X1-GFP receptor patches responded with a desensitizing current of over 1 nA in response to application of the agonist (2 μm; Fig. 6, column B, trace a; 1.38 ± 0.51 nA; n = 7), with repeated applications at 5-min intervals leading to the peak response dropping to less than 400 pA (Fig. 6, column B,traces b and c). At the end of three such applications, the response to applied ATP (2 μm) was also small but greater than that of α,β-meATP (Fig. 6, column B, trace d). Some neurons gave very large desensitizing currents in response to α,β-meATP, over 3 nA (Fig. 6,column A, trace a). Subsequent application of ATP (2 μm; Fig. 6, column A, trace b) some 6 min later showed faster rates of desensitization, but the peak current was not greatly diminished (compare Fig. 6,column A, trace b with trace a). A further application of α,β-meATP 10 min later gave a very small response (Fig. 6, column A, trace c) as did that to ATP added another 10 min later (Fig. 6, column A,trace d). A further check on the conversion of the predominant subunit in the infected ganglion cells from nondesensitizing to desensitizing was made by first exposing the neurons with receptor clusters to ATP and then observing the effects of this on the subsequent response to α,β-meATP. ATP gave desensitizing responses of over 1 nA peak amplitude in two neurons (2 μm; Fig.7, column A, traces a and b; 1.84 ± 0.34 nA; n = 7), which then gave only very small currents in response to α,β-meATP applied 2 min later (Fig. 7, column A, trace b, and column B, trace b; 0.14 ± 0.09 nA;n = 3). Subsequent application of ATP 2 min later again gave only very small responses, although in one neuron a nondesensitizing component of the current of about 300 pA persisted through all applications of these agonists (Fig. 7, column B). The mechanism of decrease in the size of currents generated by the infected neurons on repeated exposure to agonists was next investigated. Confocal images were taken of neurons heavily infected with the DNA for P2X1-GFP following exposure to α,β−meATP (10 μm). The GFP fluorescence intensity decreased dramatically in less than 30 s after application of the agonist (compare Fig. 8, a withb) and to a further small extent thereafter (Fig. 8,c and d) in all six cases examined. Quantitative measurement of the percentage decrease in GFP fluorescence of three neurons exposed to α,β−meATP (10 μm) showed that this decreased by about 80% within 30 s (Fig.9). This change in fluorescence was not due to exposure of the neurons to the laser beam as it did not occur in any control neurons that were not exposed to agonist. These observations suggest an uptake of the chimera into acidic endosomes, as GFP is quenched under acidic conditions. To test this, monensin (5 μm) was used to block the pH differential in endosomes (24Chemaschi D. Porta C. Ghirardelli R. Manzoni C. Caremi I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There was no loss of P2X1-GFP fluorescence on exposure to α,β−meATP (10 μm) in the presence of monensin (Figs. 9 and 10). Preincubation of the cells in the P2X1 antagonist suramin (10 μm) also prevented the loss of fluorescence on exposure to α,β−meATP (10 μm). These observations indicate that the P2X ionotropic receptor undergoes spatial redistribution on exposure to agonist, probably involving internalization into endosomes.Figure 9Time course of disappearance of P2X1-GFP fluorescence of ganglion cells on exposure to α,β-meATP.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15485-15490Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) on the other, a further series of experiments was performed. These involved an examination of the effects of monensin (5 μm) on P2X1 current desensitization kinetics during a pulse of ATP (10 μm) as well as on the recovery from rundown measured electrophysiologically. There was no difference in the rapid rate of desensitization of P2X1 receptors in the presence of monensin (Fig. 11 B) compared with controls (Fig. 11 A). Furthermore, the extent of recovery from rundown of the P2X1 receptors when monensin was added between a test and a conditioning pulse of ATP (Fig.11 C) was the same as that when monensin was present for both test and conditioning ATP pulses (Fig. 11 B), which in turn was the same as that of controls (Fig. 11 A). There does not seem to be any causal relationship between the rate of internalization of the receptor and that of either the rapid rate of desensitization or the rate of recovery from rundown of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1989142722,"Abstract Papillomavirus E1 protein is the replication initiator that recognizes and binds to the viral origin and initiates DNA strand separation through its ATP-dependent helicase activity. The E1 protein also functions in viral DNA replication by recruiting several cellular proteins to the origin, including host DNA polymerase α and replication protein A. To identify other cellular proteins that interact with bovine papillomavirus E1, an HeLa cDNA library was screened using a yeast two-hybrid assay. The host cell sumoylating enzyme, Ubc9, was found to interact specifically with E1 both in vitro and in vivo. Mapping studies localized critical E1 sequences for interaction to amino acids 315–459 and strongly implicated leucine 420 as critical for E1·Ubc9 complex formation. In addition to binding E1, Ubc9 catalyzed the covalent linkage of the ubiquitin-like protein, SUMO-1, to E1. An E1 mutant unable to bind Ubc9 showed normal intracellular stability, but was impaired for intranuclear distribution. Failure to accumulate in appropriate nuclear subdomains may account for the previously demonstrated replication defect of a human papillomavirus 16 E1 protein that was also unable to bind Ubc9 and suggests that sumoylation is a functionally important modification with regulatory implications for papillomavirus replication."

The deduced amino acid sequence and the tertiary structure of hematopoietic PGDS classified the enzyme as a member of the Sigma class of GSTs. The enzyme isomerizes PGH2 to PGD2 selectively and effectively, whereas other GST isozymes catalyze the conversion of PGH2 nonselectively to produce PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2α(23Ujihara M. Tsuchida S.

The high specificity of PGDS for the production of PGD2 is attributed to the unique architecture of the catalytic pocket. The deep and wide catalytic cavity, formed by a long eave-like structure, and the several deep pockets within the cavity of PGDS are striking in comparison with the narrow, shallow cavities in other GSTs (24Ji X. von Rosenvinge E.C.

Based on the crystal structure of PGDS, a putative PGH2-binding mode was proposed (Ref. 27Kanaoka, Y., Ago, H., Inagaki, E., Nanayama, T., Miyano, M., Kikuno, R., Fujii, Y., Eguchi, N., Toh, H., Urade, Y., and Hayaishi, O.

To elucidate the structural basis of the highly specific and efficient catalysis of hematopoietic PGDS, we introduced site-directed mutations of eight amino acid residues putatively involved in catalysis and/or specific binding of the PGH2 substrate and examined the enzymatic and physicochemical properties of the mutant enzymes. In this paper, we show that Tyr8 and Arg14 are essential for activation of a thiol group of bound GSH in both PGDS and GST catalyses. We also demonstrate that substitution of amino acid residues in the long eave-like structure of the enzyme significantly affects both PGDS and GST catalyses and that the filling of an interdomain cleft by replacement with bulky amino acid residues diminishes only the PGDS activity. The Gene Amp kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), restriction endonucleases and a ligation kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan), and the SequiTherm Long-Read Cycle DNA LC sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) were purchased from the sources indicated. [1-14C]PGH2 was prepared from [1-14C]arachidonic acid (NEN Life Science Products). Primers designed for polymerase chain reaction were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Two external primers were designed for polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. Primer I (TGTCATATGCCCAACTACAAACTG) is the 5′-end forward sequence of the cDNA for rat hematopoietic PGDS and contains an NdeI site. Primer II (CGCGAATTCTTAGAGTTTTGTCTGTGG) is the 3′-end inverse sequence with anEcoRI site. The internal primers were designed to contain sense and antisense mutagenic factors with mismatched codons in the wild-type sequence. The mutated DNA was introduced into the pT7-7 vector (28Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). The constructed plasmids were amplified inEscherichia coli DH5α. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the prepared plasmids. Mutant enzyme was expressed and purified as described previously (22Kanaoka Y.

In brief, cells were collected and disrupted by sonication. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatant was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline with GSH-Sepharose 4B resin containing 1% Triton X-100 on an agitating platform at 4 °C for 3 h. After the resin had been washed with phosphate-buffered saline, the protein adsorbed on GSH-Sepharose 4B was eluted with 1 m sodium borate (pH 9.0) containing 1 m KCl or 10 mmGSH. Similar to the wild-type enzyme, all mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity by one-step GSH affinity chromatography. The purified mutant enzymes migrated to the same position as the wild-type enzyme in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (M r = 26,000). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar) with bovine γ-globulin as a standard. For Western blot analysis, the soluble fraction of each transformant was subjected to 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was immunostained with rabbit polyclonal antisera against rat hematopoietic PGDS and anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. For dot blot analysis, various amounts of the purified mutants including the wild-type enzyme were blotted onto a nylon membrane without denaturation and immunostained as described above. In the dot blot analysis, all purified mutants showed almost the same immunoreactivity against the anti-rat hematopoietic PGDS antiserum as the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). CD spectra of the wild-type and mutant enzymes were recorded on a J-600 spectropolarimeter (Jasco International Co. Ltd., Tokyo) at 10 °C in the presence of 1 mm GSH except when otherwise indicated. GST activity was measured by the spectrophotometric method (15Urade Y. Fujimoto N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12410-12415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 1 mm1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and 1 mm GSH in 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 6.5). PGDS activity was assayed in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 40 μm [1-14C]PGH2, 1 mm GSH, 1 mg/ml IgG, and an aliquot of the enzyme (30Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rates of all enzymatic reactions were calculated after subtracting the blank experiment without the enzyme. In the PGDS reaction, kinetic constants for PGH2 and GSH were measured with 1 mm GSH or 40 μm PGH2 and varying concentrations of the other substrate ranging from 0.1 to 10 mm; in the GST reaction, kinetic constants for CDNB and GSH were determined with 1 mm GSH or 1 mm CDNB and varying concentrations of the other substrate ranging from 0.1 to 10 mm. The activated thiol group of GSH bound to the enzyme was measured spectrophotometrically at 410 nm after incubation of the enzyme with DTNB, a thiol-specific reacting agent, under a low reactivity condition in 0.5 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) (31Pregel M.J. Strorer A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23552-23558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of rat hematopoietic PGDS (15Urade Y. Fujimoto N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12410-12415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Y8F, R14K/E, W104I, K112E, Y152F, C156L/Y, K198E, and L199F mutants were prepared to determine the catalytic mechanisms of PGDS and GST activities. Tyr8 and Arg14 were proposed to activate the thiol group of GSH, whereas the other residues are located in the putative PGH2-binding site (Fig.1). Mutants were expressed in E. coli, purified, and examined for retention of native structure. The expression level of the W104I and C156L mutants was comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig.2). The expression level of the Y8F, R14E/K, K198E, and L199F mutants varied from 70 to 40% of that of the wild-type enzyme. The lowest expression was observed for the K112E, C156Y, and Y152F mutants, being 12, 17, and 16% of the wild-type enzyme, respectively. Each mutant showed only one immunoreactive band at a position of the wild-type enzyme. All mutants could be purified by GSH affinity chromatography, indicating that the GSH-binding site was not structurally or functionally disrupted. The far-UV CD spectra of most of the mutants were similar to the wild-type spectrum and were characteristic of an α-helical dominant protein (Fig.3). However, the [θ]222 nm value decreased by 8% for W104I and L199F and increased by 20% for K112E as compared with the value for the wild-type enzyme. The CD spectrum of Y8F appeared to be intermediate between those spectra of the wild-type and K112E enzymes. The spectra of R14E/K, Y152F, C156L/Y, and K198E were the same as the wild-type spectrum. The deviations in the CD spectra of Y8F, K112E, W104I, and L199F suggest that these residues are structurally important.Figure 3CD spectra of the wild-type and mutant PGDS enzymes. The CD spectra of Y8F (dashed line), K112E (dashed and dotted line), and W104I (dotted line) are shown as those that deviated most from the wild-type spectrum (solid line).

There were three types of effects: retention of both activities, as in K112E, Y152F, K198E, and L199F; complete loss of only the PGDS activity, as in C156L/Y; and complete loss of both activities, as seen in Y8F, R14E/K, and W104I. The mutants associated with PGDS activity isomerized PGH2 to PGD2 specifically without enzymatic production of PGE2 and PGF2α, similar to the wild-type enzyme. Mutations of Lys112 and Cys156 in the PGH2-binding pocket severely affected PGDS activity, but the mutants retained some level of GST activity. As compared with the wild-type enzyme, K112E showed 10% of the PGDS activity and 50% of the GST activity, whereas C156L/Y completely lost the PGDS activity and had 27 and 11% of the GST activity, respectively. On the other hand, as observed for mutations of Tyr8, Arg14, and Trp104, complete loss of GST activity was accompanied by complete loss of PGDS activity. To further characterize the effect of each mutation, we determined the kinetic properties of the mutant proteins. When the kinetic parameters of the mutant and wild-type enzymes were examined, the PGDS and GST activities were saturable with increasing GSH concentration; alternatively, the PGDS and GST activities increased almost linearly up to 200 μmPGH2 and 2 mm CDNB. Therefore, only the apparent K m could be estimated with respect to the PGH2 and CDNB concentration (TableI).Table IKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant PGDSsEnzymePGDS activityGST activityGSHPGH2GSHCDNBK m(GSH)k cat(GSH)K m(PGH2)k cat(PGH2)K m(GSH)k cat(GSH)K m(CDNB)k cat(CDNB)mms −1mms −1mms −1mms −1WT0.1031.070.5021.700.502.003.005.00Y8FNDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDR14ENDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDR14KNDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDW104INDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDK112E0.183.420.494.302.231.923.660.60Y152F0.0829.500.5515.550.801.762.001.50C156LNDNDNDND1.110.550.600.70C156YNDNDNDND0.500.304.870.80K198E0.058.400.707.180.702.162.404.60L199F0.0929.601.0120.300.701.502.151.40K m and k cat for PGH2 and CDNB were determined in PGDS and GST catalyses, respectively;K m and k cat for GSH were determined in both reactions. The PGH2 and GSH concentrations were varied from 0.1 to 10 mm, and the CDNB concentration was varied from 0.1 to 4 mm. WT, wild-type; ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab K m and k cat for PGH2 and CDNB were determined in PGDS and GST catalyses, respectively;K m and k cat for GSH were determined in both reactions. The PGH2 and GSH concentrations were varied from 0.1 to 10 mm, and the CDNB concentration was varied from 0.1 to 4 mm. WT, wild-type; ND, not detected. In the wild-type enzyme, PGH2 binding apparently increased the affinity for GSH as evidenced by the lower K mfor GSH in the PGDS activity assay (K m(GSH) = 0.1 mm) than in the GST activity assay (K m(GSH) = 0.5 mm). This effect was also observed in all the mutants; and it is notable that for K112E, the K m value for GSH increased in both assays, although more significantly so in the GST assay. In contrast, Y152F, K198E, and L199F showed slightly lowerK m(GSH) values (0.05–0.09 mm) than the wild-type enzyme (0.1 mm) in the PGDS assay and a relatively small increase inK m(GSH) in the GST assay (0.7–0.8 mm) as compared with wild-type PGDS (0.5 mm). The apparent K m values for PGH2 and CDNB for the wild-type enzyme were calculated to be ∼500 μmand 3 mm, respectively. For almost all mutants, theK m values for PGH2 and CDNB were comparable to those obtained for the wild-type enzyme, with the exceptions of L199F, with a 2-fold decrease in affinity for PGH2, and C156L, with a 5-fold decrease inK m for CDNB. Among the mutants with both PGDS and GST activities, K112E and K198E showed the most remarkable changes in the k catvalues for PGDS activity determined with varying concentrations of either of the substrates. The efficiency of the PGDS activity of K112E (k cat(GSH) = 3.42 s−1and k cat(PGH2) = 4.30 s−1) was 9- and 5-fold reduced as compared with the wild-type enzyme (k cat(GSH) = 31.07 s−1 andk cat(PGH2) = 21.70 s−1). Mutations K198E decreased the turnover rate of the PGDS reaction 3.7- and 3-fold for GSH and PGH2, respectively (Table I). Neither K112E nor K198E significantly affected the conjugation of GSH to CDNB. The k cat(CDNB)for Lys112, but not Lys198, was significantly reduced as compared with the wild-type enzyme. C156Y/L, which had lost PGDS function, showed significantly reduced GST catalytic efficiency, with a 7-fold decrease ink cat(GSH) (0.30 s−1) and a 6.25-fold decrease in k cat(CDNB) (0.80 s−1) for C156Y and a 4-fold decrease ink cat(GSH) and a 7-fold decrease ink cat(CDNB) for C156L (0.55 and 0.70 s−1, respectively) in comparison with the wild-type enzyme (k cat(GSH) = 2.00 s−1 and k cat(CDNB) = 5.00 s−1). Mutation Y152F only slightly decreased the turnover rate of both reactions with respect to the varying GSH and PGH2 concentrations and considerably affected k cat(CDNB). On the other hand, the L199F mutation did not affect the PGDS function of the enzyme, but caused a substantial decrease in the k cat(GSH)and k cat(CDNB) for GST activity. Since all mutant enzymes bound to GSH-Sepharose, the loss of PGDS and GST activities in some of the mutants was not considered to be attributable to the loss of GSH binding. Therefore, we examined the reactivity of the thiol group of GSH bound to the mutants with a thiol-modifying agent, DTNB (Fig. 5). When wild-type PGDS was incubated with DTNB in the absence of GSH, no reaction was observed at pH 5.0, indicating that the two free cysteine residues in the wild-type protein were not titrated with DTNB. In solution with 0.5 mm GSH, DTNB was converted to 5-thio-2-benzoic acid at an initial rate of 15 mm/min (Fig.5, inset). The addition of the wild-type enzyme or the W104I, K112E, Y152F, C156L/Y, K198E, or L199F mutant increased the reaction rate exactly 2-fold, indicating that GSH had been activated. Interestingly, the W104I mutant, devoid of both PGDS and GST activities, could still bind GSH and apparently activate it. However, no enhancement of thiol activity was observed with Y8F and R14E/K, even though these mutants bound GSH as revealed by their purification on GSH-Sepharose. In the present mutational analysis of hematopoietic PGDS, we defined the role of Tyr8 and Arg14 in the activation of the thiol group of GSH bound to PGDS, identified amino acid residues contributing to the PGH2-binding site, showed the requirement for Trp104 in sustaining the catalytic cleft in an active form, and indicated the importance of the C-terminal domain eave-like structure for catalysis. Tyr8 and Arg14 are absolutely critical for catalysis as evidenced by the fact that Y8F and R14E/K lost both PGDS and GST activities (Fig. 4and Table I). However, these mutants bound to GSH-Sepharose, yet lost the ability to promote the DTNB reaction (Fig. 5), indicating that they are involved in activating the thiol group of GSH bound to the enzyme. These results agree with findings on other GSTs, except for Theta class GSTs (38Board P.G. Coggan M. Wilce M.C.J. Parker M.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), where a highly conserved tyrosine, corresponding to Tyr8 in PGDS, is thought to activate the SH group of the bound GSH by forming a hydrogen bond through the phenolic hydroxy group of the tyrosine (24Ji X. von Rosenvinge E.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the arginine residue corresponding to Arg14 in rat PGDS is also involved in catalysis in some systems (35Stenberg G. Board P. Carlberg I. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36Wang R. Newton D.J. Johnson A.R. Pickett C.B. Lu A.Y.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 247: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that the thiol group of GSH is activated by formation of a hydrogen bond with the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr8 and that Arg14 assists the GSH activation by forming a salt bridge with the α-glutamyl carboxy anion of GSH to electrostatically neutralize the negative charge and to maintain the active configuration of the bound GSH (Fig. 1 C). In addition to its interaction with GSH, Arg14 may also have an additional role of interacting with the hydroxy group of the ω-chain of PGH2at C-15 via hydrogen bonding in the isomerization reaction (Fig.1 B) (22Kanaoka Y. Ago H. Inagaki E. Nanayama T. Miyano M. Kikuno R. Fujii Y. Eguchi N. Toh H. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Cell. 1997; 90: 1085-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). When Trp104 of the C-terminal domain of PGDS was substituted with Ile, both PGDS and GST activities were lost (Fig. 4and Table I). The absence of the catalytic functions was not due to a lack of improper folding of the protein because the W104I mutant could be expressed in E. coli at a level comparable to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2) and could bind to GSH-Sepharose during purification. Furthermore, the thiol group of GSH bound to W104I was activated, as judged by the increased reactivity with DTNB (Fig. 5), most likely due to the hydrogen bonding with the Tyr8hydroxy group. Proper folding of the inactive W104I protein was also indicated by the far-UV CD spectrum, which was similar in shape to that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3). However, the deeper [θ]222 nm value of W104I compared with that of the wild-type enzyme indicates an increase in the α-helix content of the mutant. This increased content agrees with a role for Trp104 in forming a kinked backbone in the connecting loop between α-helices 4 and 5 within the eave-like structure of the enzyme (Fig. 1 A). Thus, a point mutation of Trp104 may expand α-helix 4 in hematopoietic PGDS, which is shorter than that found in other GSTs (22Kanaoka Y. Ago H. Inagaki E. Nanayama T. Miyano M. Kikuno R. Fujii Y. Eguchi N. Toh H. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Cell. 1997; 90: 1085-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition, due to the localization of Trp104 in proximity to the cyclopentane head of PGH2 and the unique direction of the indole ring of Trp104 parallel to α-helix 4 and the GSH backbone in hematopoietic PGDS, Trp104 is presumed to be making van der Waals contact with the hydrophobic substrate(s) of hematopoietic PGDS, being responsible for forming the remarkably deep and wide cleft, to accommodate lipophilic PGH2 inserted into the catalytic center (Fig. 1). Substitution of Trp104 is considered to result not only in the loss of an indole ring interacting with PGH2, but also in disruption of the overall structure of the active site and thereby PGDS and GST activities (Fig.1 B). These findings imply the importance of the eave-like structure in hematopoietic PGDS for catalysis and of the role of Trp104 in maintaining the active eave-like structure and thus proper functioning of the enzyme. The drastically reduced catalytic efficiency of the K112E mutant (Fig.4 and Table I) also supports the idea that residues in the eave-like structure in the C-terminal domain of PGDS are important for the catalysis of the enzyme. Lys112 is conserved throughout the members of the Sigma class of GSTs (39Thomson A.M. Meyer D.J. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This residue is located within α-helix 5 in hematopoietic PGDS (Fig. 1 A) and has been proposed to make a salt bridge with the C-1 carboxylate of PGH2 (Fig. 1 B) (22Kanaoka Y. Ago H. Inagaki E. Nanayama T. Miyano M. Kikuno R. Fujii Y. Eguchi N. Toh H. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Cell. 1997; 90: 1085-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The selective decrease in PGDS activity with only a slight change in the GST activity of the K112E mutant supports the model in which Lys112 is involved only in PGH2 activity (Fig. 4). Although the expression level of the K112E mutant was much lower than that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2) and the α-helix content of K112E was significantly decreased (Fig. 3), the maintenance of GST activity suggests that the disruptions in the structure are primarily localized at the PGH2-binding site. Because the Lys112 mutation significantly affected the catalytic activity of the enzyme, we also mutated Lys198, which is located in the vicinity of Lys112, on the other side of the carboxyl anion of PGH2 (Fig. 1 A). The K198E mutation decreased the PGH2 isomerization efficiency withk cat(GSH) andk cat(PGH2) values 4- and 3-fold decreased as compared with those of the wild-type enzyme (Table I) and increased the affinity for GSH with a K m value half that of wild-type PGDS. The K198E mutation had only a moderate effect on the GST activity (Fig. 4 and Table I) and no effect on the overall protein structure as judged by protein expression level (Fig. 2) and far-UV CD analysis (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results indicate that introduction of a positively charged residue on both sides of the eave-like structure of the catalytic cleft is important for PGDS function, probably by interacting with the carboxyl anion of PGH2. On the other side of the proposed PGH2-binding site, Cys156 at the boundary between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains of the catalytic cleft was proposed to interact with the PGH2 aliphatic chain. Mutation of Cys156 to either Leu or Tyr selectively abolished the PGDS activity, but the GST activity was still retained, supporting this model for PGH2 binding. The bulky side chains of Leu and Tyr most likely fill the center of the wide catalytic cleft between the N- and C-terminal domains of PGDS (Fig. 1) and sterically block the insertion of PGH2, preventing the interaction of the peroxide group of PGH2 with the activated thiolate of bound GSH. On the other hand, the GSH-binding region of the mutants is still open and allows the conjugation of GSH to CDNB, although with a lesser efficiency due to the partial blockage of the catalytic cleft. The expression level of C156Y was very low (Fig. 2), although there were no changes in its overall structure as judged by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3). Therefore, the replacement of Cys156 by an amino acid residue with an aromatic side chain may affect the folding process. The Y152F and L199F mutations had the least effect on the enzymatic catalysis of hematopoietic PGDS. Tyr152, together with Arg14, Glu96, and two water molecules bound at the bottom of the catalytic cleft (Fig. 1 C), is thought to form the hydrogen bonding network involved in the binding of GSH, as reported in the Pi class GSTs (40Prade L. Huber R. Manoharan T.H. Fahl W.E. Reuter W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 5: 1287-1295Google Scholar). The partial decrease in both PGDS and GST activities of Y152F (Fig. 4 and Table I) as well as its low expression level (Fig. 2) indicate that Tyr152 primarily contributes to sustaining an active architecture for the hydrogen bonding network within the catalytic cleft. C-terminal Leu199 underneath the eave-like structure of the catalytic cleft is assumed to play an important role in PGH2 binding because of its proximity to the cyclopentane ring of PGH2(Fig. 1, A and B). However, the kinetic parameters of the L199F mutant were not significantly changed with respect to PGDS catalysis and were only moderately altered in the case of GST activity (Table I). The L199F mutation caused a slight structural alteration of the protein since the CD spectrum analysis revealed that the α-helix content of L199F was higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3). The absence of a significant change in PGDS activity does not agree with the location of Tyr152and Leu199 in the proposed PGH2-binding pocket. It is possible that the mutation of these residues, which was designed to disrupt PGDS function, was in fact accommodated by subtle changes in the structure. In conclusion, our results agree with the proposed mechanism for PGH2 isomerization in hematopoietic PGDS, where Tyr8 and Arg14 are directly involved in activating the thiol group of GSH for nucleophilic attack on the peroxide group of the PGH2 substrate. Furthermore Lys112, Lys198, and Cys156 appear to delineate the PGH2-binding pocket, and mutational analysis of Trp104 and Lys112 established the importance of the unique eave-like structure in forming an extraordinarily wide active cleft in hematopoietic PGDS to accommodate PGH2, resulting in the highly specific and efficient catalysis.

The peptidoglycan itself is a highly complex molecule composed of a glycan (polymers of N-acetylated and nonacetylated (1Vollmer W. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20496-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) glucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid residues) with short stem peptides attached to the glycan chains. These peptides, when cross-linked by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs),1 interconnect different glycan chains enabling the bacteria to resist high osmotic pressures. The complexity of the peptidoglycan structure has been fully recognized after the introduction of a high resolution analytical technique, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (2Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Use of this technique for the analysis of stem peptide composition of the peptidoglycan of clinical and laboratory strains of S. pneumoniae showed a species-specific peptidoglycan characterized by highly conserved molar ratios of 18 different muropeptides (3Garcia-Bustos J.F. Chait B.T. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15400-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A peculiar feature of the pneumococcal peptidoglycan is the simultaneous presence of both directly and indirectly cross-linked (branched) components. In the latter, alanyl-serine or alanyl-alanine dipeptides form the cross-bridge between neighboring muropeptides (3Garcia-Bustos J.F. Chait B.T. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15400-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Severin A. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 168-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the species-specific peptidoglycan, the percentage of these branched peptides, although detectable, is very small (3Garcia-Bustos J.F. Chait B.T. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15400-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Severin A. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 168-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Severin A. Figueiredo A.M.S. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1788-1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell wall analysis by HPLC of the first high level penicillin-resistant clinical isolates, from South Africa and Hungary, revealed that in the peptidoglycan of these strains the proportion of branched muropeptides was greatly increased, and this abnormality of wall structure was to a significant degree co-transferred with resistance to penicillin during genetic transformation (6Garcia-Bustos J.F. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5414-5419Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the abnormally high proportion of branched muropeptides in the cell wall of the resistant strains may provide the bacteria with a set of cell wall precursors, the branched structure of which has a better “fit” into the altered, low affinity active site(s) (7Zighelboim S. Tomasz A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1980; 17: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) of the remodeled PBPs of the resistant pneumococcus (6Garcia-Bustos J.F. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5414-5419Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, examination of a larger number of penicillin-resistant isolates showed that the abnormally high proportion of branched wall peptides was not always associated with resistance to penicillin. In fact, the abnormality of wall composition detected in several isolates appeared to be related to the particular genetic lineage rather than being an obligatory correlate of resistance itself (4Severin A. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 168-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Severin A. Figueiredo A.M.S. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1788-1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae involves remodeling of the β-lactam target enzymes, the PBPs, in such a way that their affinity toward the antibiotic molecule is greatly reduced (7Zighelboim S. Tomasz A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1980; 17: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This is achieved by the construction of pbp mosaic genes that are believed to be the result of heterologous recombinational events in the case of clinical isolates (8Dowson C.G. Hutchison A. Brannigan J.A. George R.C. Hansman D. Linares J. Tomasz A. Smith J.M. Spratt B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8842-8846Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 9Laible G.

Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 829-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recent identification of the genetic determinants of the cell wall branching system murMN (12Filipe S.R. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) has allowed a reexamination of the relationship between muropeptide structure and penicillin resistance. It was shown that inactivation of the murMN operon resulted in the production of a peptidoglycan, both in penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant strains, from which all branched muropeptide components were missing, and, concomitantly, there was a complete loss of penicillin resistance in each one of several penicillin-resistant strains examined (12Filipe S.R. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The mechanistic connection between the functioning of murMN and the expression of the penicillin-resistant phenotype remains to be elucidated. Here we report the identification of the sites of action of the MurM and MurN proteins in the assembly of the dipeptide branches and describe the impacts of selective inactivation of murN and allelic replacement of murM on the composition of peptidoglycan.

Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5414-5419Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli strains containing pJDC9 or its derivatives were grown in the presence of 1 μg/ml and 1 mg/ml erythromycin (Sigma), respectively. Growth rates of the insertionally inactivated mutants of Pen6 were determined with cultures first grown in C + Y containing erythromycin at 1 μg/ml and then diluted 100-fold in fresh C + Y. The OD was then measured at 590 nm over the time.Table IRelevant properties of the strains and plasmids used in this studyStrainsRelevant characteristicsPen MICSourceμg/mlS. pneumoniae R36APenS laboratory strain0.01Ref. 13Avery O.T.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The chromosomal DNA fromS. pneumoniae was isolated as described previously (18Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated using the Wizard Plus Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega), and polymerase chain reaction products were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences were analyzed using DNASTAR software. RNA was prepared from exponentially growing cultures atA 590 of 0.5 and was extracted by using the FastRNA isolation kit (Bio101) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Primer extension analysis was performed by using primer ZOO36 (5′-TGTTCTTTGACAAACTGATC-3′) (Fig. 1), which was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and purified with the AGTC Gel Filtration Cartridges (Edge BioSystems). RNA from Pen6, R6Hex, and R36A (50 μg) was hybridized with the primer at 65 °C for 90 min and slowly cooled to room temperature. Reverse transcription was carried out by using SuperScript RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 90 min, and the reaction mixture was heated at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme. The reaction product was incubated with RNase H (3 units) at 37 °C for 30 min, ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in 10 μl of Sequenase stop solution, denatured, and applied to a 6% sequencing gel. Sequencing reaction mixtures prepared by using the T7 Sequenase Kit version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) primed by ZOO36 were also applied to the gel. S. pneumoniae strains were transformed according to published procedures (5Severin A. Figueiredo A.M.S. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1788-1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To induce competence, synthetic CSPα was added to the medium at a concentration of 250 ng/ml. The competent cells were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of plasmid DNA followed by the addition of 2 ml of C + Y and a 2-h incubation at 37 °C. Transformants were selected on blood agar plates (tryptic soy agar plus 3% (v/v) sheep blood) containing 1 μg/ml erythromycin. Population analysis profiles were determined by plating serial dilutions of early stationary phase cultures on plates of tryptic soy agar containing 5% (v/v) of sheep blood (Micropure Medical Inc., White Bear Lake, MN) and different concentrations of penicillin G (Sigma) (0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 μg/ml). The population analysis profiles were done with and without the presence of erythromycin 1 μg/ml in the medium. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 in air atmosphere for 24 h, and the number of bacteria capable of forming colonies in the presence of various penicillin concentrations was plotted against the concentration of penicillin in the agar medium. For gene disruption experiments by insertion-duplication mutagenesis, an internal fragment of murN was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using as template chromosomal DNA from R36A and cloned into pJDC9, a plasmid that does not replicate in S. pneumoniae (15Chen J.D. Morrison D.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 64: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The following primers were used-ZOO1KP (5′-TATGGTACCGGCCGATTTATACCCAACAAG-3′) and ZOO2BM (5′-TATGGATCCAGTCTCGCGCTTCTGCTTTTC-3′), giving origin to the plasmid pZOO3. Plasmid pZOO3 was used to inactivate the murNgene in Pen6 by transforming competent cells. The abnormalmurM gene from penicillin-resistant Pen6 strain was replaced by the murM gene from R36A laboratory strain by transforming competent cells from Pen6 with chromosomal DNA from R36AmurMN (R36A with inactivated murMN). Transformants were selected with erythromycin (1 μg/ml), and their penicillin susceptibility was confirmed. Revertants from these transformants that result from the loss of the plasmid inactivatingmurMN were selected by their penicillin resistance and erythromycin susceptibility. The excision of the plasmid carrying the erythromycin resistance marker allowed the reconstruction of activemurM allele from R36A. The allelic replacement of themurM gene was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers ZOO7 (5′-CATAGCGCTGGAACTCAC-3′) and ZOO30 (5′-ATATTCTCTACGTTCAGAGG-3′) followed by restriction withPstI and HindIII, two enzymes that cut the Pen6 allele but not the R36A allele. Pneumococcal cell walls were prepared by a previously published method (4Severin A. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 168-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Garcia-Bustos J.F. Chait B.T. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2143-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except for the process of breaking the cells, which was done by shaking with acid-washed glass beads with the help of FastPrep FP120 (Bio 101). Cell wall material (2 mg) was suspended in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and treated with affinity-purified pneumococcal amidase (5 μg) at 37 °C for 18–24 h with constant stirring. The products were dried, the precipitate was washed with acetone, and the peptides were extracted with acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol/water (25:25:50) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as already described (4Severin A. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 168-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Garcia-Bustos J.F. Chait B.T. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2143-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Garcia-Bustos J.F. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 447-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After removal of the solvents by evaporation in a SpeedVac, the peptides were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were separated with a Shimadzu LC-10AVP HPLC system, as described previously (4Severin A. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 168-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The column used was a Vydac 218TP54 (The Separations Group). The peptides were eluted with an 80-min linear gradient from 0 to 15% acetonitrile (Fisher) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce) pumped at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The eluted fractions were detected and quantified by determination of their ultraviolet absorption at 210 nm (A 210). The stem peptides generated by enzymatic hydrolysis of cell walls of mutants Pen6murN and Pen6murMN were recovered from the HPLC column and dried in the SpeedVac. The amino acid composition (21Atherton, N. D. (1989) in Techniques in Protein Chemistry (Hugh, T. E., ed) pp. 273–283Google Scholar) and the peptides' molecular mass were determined at the Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Technology Center. Approximately 1.1 nmol of sample from the stem peptides 3a, Ia, and 7a were used to obtain the sequence of the part of the stem peptide amenable to Edman degradation. The procedure was performed as recommended by the manufacturer's program in a Hewlett-Packard G-1000A protein sequencer using chemistry 3.5, and the phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were identified by on-line HPLC at the Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Technology Center. Determination of the transcription initiation site. Primer extension analysis was performed to determine the transcription start site using the primer ZOO36 that hybridizes with the murMNtranscript of Pen6 and R6Hex (Fig. 1). Based on this analysis, it was determined that the transcript that includes murM can initiate at two different adenine residues (Fig. 2 A) located 25 and 26 base pairs upstream of the murM start codon in the case of Pen6 (Fig. 1). In R6Hex, the transcript can initiate at an adenine or a thymine residue located 26 and 27 base pairs, respectively, upstream of the murM start codon (Figs. 1 and 2 B). These results indicate that the same region contains the promoter in both the penicillin-resistant strain Pen6 and in the susceptible strain R6Hex (Fig. 1). Inactivation of the murMN operon by insertion duplication mutagenesis in the penicillin-resistant strain Pen6 did not cause any significant change in growth rate of the cultures; the mass doubling times of the parental strain Pen6 and its Pen6murMNmutant were 34.0 ± 0.5 and 32.5 ± 0.3 min, respectively. However, when murN alone was inactivated the doubling time of the mutant increased to 48.5 ± 0.9 min. The rates of autolysis in the stationary phase of growth were the same for Pen6murMN and for the parental strain Pen6 (1.7 ± 0.3 × 10−3 and 2.3 ± 0.5 × 10−3 min−1, respectively), although the mutant culture started lysing sooner than the parental strain Pen6. While inactivation of murMN caused a virtually complete block in the expression of penicillin resistance (12Filipe S.R. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), inactivation ofmurN resulted only in a modest (2-fold) decrease of the MIC to penicillin (Fig. 3) despite the major impact of the inactivation on the composition of the peptidoglycan (see below). The cell wall of the Pen6murMN and Pen6murN was analyzed by HPLC (Fig.4, A and B). The stem peptide composition of the strains shown as a percentage of the total peptides of the peptidoglycan is presented in TableII, and the corresponding chemical structures are shown in Fig. 6. As was shown before (12Filipe S.R. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), disruption of the murMN operon led to the disappearance of all branched muropeptide monomers and dimers accompanied by a parallel increase in the percentage of linear structured stem peptides and in the appearance of novel peptide structures (peptides 10 and 11, Fig.4 A).Table IICell wall peptide composition of S. pneumoniae R36A, Pen6, Pen6murMN, and Pen6murNPeptidesR6HexPen6- murMR36APen6Pen6- murNPen6- murMNR36A18.217.52.51.623.312.020.93.10.72.34.33.1310.38.113.82.70.12.53a0.40.70.113.10.80.4I6.03.613.90.70.01.6Ia1.81.50.79.40.41.6II2.11.62.60.91.33.147.010.53.12.330.718.9III1.71.43.40.73.81.258.612.62.11.07.411.466.46.52.41.011.76.4712.19.110.75.77.96.77a0.50.30.212.60.01.0IV3.31.86.33.70.12.3V6.23.311.91.70.32.5IV/Va1.91.41.616.92.43.684.34.32.43.92.87.0VI5.21.79.84.42.25.9VIa3.45.71.28.00.23.999.85.111.27.80.35.4Total100100100100100100.0Monomers313837313426Larger than monomers696263696674Linear peptides264211106745Branched peptides745889903355B/L peptides2.91.48.08.50.51.3Structurally similar stem peptides differing only in the number of amino acid residues in the peptide branches and/or cross-links (i.e. peptide 3 and 3a, or 1 and 1a) are grouped together for easier comparison.

HPLC analysis of the cell walls of strain Pen6 in which themurN gene was inactivated showed major changes in the elution profile of stem peptides (Fig.5); the branched components found in the peptidoglycan of Pen6 disappeared, but in this case there was no increase of the linear peptides. Instead, inactivation of themurN led to the appearance of novel peptide components that were not seen before in pneumococcal cell wall preparations. Similarly, these novel stem peptides with anomalous retention times were also detected in the cell walls of the penicillin-susceptible strain R6Hex with inactivated murN (data not shown). Nevertheless, there was no change in the degree of cross-linking of the peptidoglycan in the Pen6murMN and Pen6murN mutants (as seen from the unchanged percentage of monomers relative to the total of peptides in Table II). Analysis of the peptide composition of the peptidoglycan from the murN mutant of Pen6 showed an accumulation of two novel peptides (3a and Ia; see Fig.6). Based on the results of molecular weight determination and amino acid composition, peptides 3a and Ia are proposed to be monomers with only one serine or one alanine, respectively, attached to the ε-NH2-terminal of the stem peptide lysine residue (TableIII). Components 7a, IV/Va, and VIa appear to be dimeric peptides that would result from the transpeptidation reaction of peptides 3a and Ia.Table IIIAmino acid composition, molecular weight, and proposed structures of peptides isolated from the mutants Pen6murMN and Pen6murNPeakAmino acid compositionExperimental [M+H]+Calculated [M+H]+Proposed structure3aGlx 1.0434.3432.5Ala-Gln-LysLys 1.0 -Ala 1.1SerSer 1.1IaGlx 1.0418.3416.5Ala-Gln-LysLys 1.0 -Ala 2.1AlaSer 0.07aGlx 1.0918.5918.0Ala-Gln-LysLys 1.0 -Ala 1.5SerSer 0.9 -Ala-Gln-Lys-Ala -SerIV/VaGlx 1.0902.4902.0Ala-Gln-LysLys 1.0 -Ala 2.0AlaSer 0.5 -Ala-Gln-Lys-Ala -SerVIaGlx 0.8886.4886.0Ala-Gln-LysLys 1.0 -Ala 2.4AlaSer 0.4 -Ala-Gln-Lys-Ala -Ala10Glx 0.91142.61142.3Ala-Gln-LysLys 1.0 -Ala 1.8Ala-Gln-Lys-AlaSer 0.0 -Ala-Gln-Lys-Ala11Glx 0.91540.81540.8Lys 1.0Ala-Gln-LysAla 1.8 -Ser 0.1Ala-Gln-Lys-Ala -Ala-Gln-Lys-Ala -Ala-Gln-Lys-Ala Open table in a new tab The structures of the peptides 3a, Ia, and 7a were confirmed by Edman degradation. According to the proposed structures (Table III), the only sources of free amino termini in stem peptide 3a would be two alanine residues, and in stem peptide Ia one alanine and one serine. The results of Edman degradation confirmed these predictions; only one alanine residue was released from peptide 3a, and similar amounts of alanine and serine were released from peptide Ia. Edman degradation of peptide 7a resulted in the release of the same number of serine residues as in peptide Ia but twice the amount of alanine, consistent with the proposed structure. The two new components detected in the peptidoglycan of cells with inactivated murMN operon (peptides 10 and 11) were tentatively identified (on the basis of amino acid composition and molecular mass) as trimers and tetramers composed of linear peptide units (Table III). The murM alleles from R36A and Pen6 encode proteins that differ by 15% at the amino acid level (12Filipe S.R. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To determine if the different peptidoglycan types of these two strains were related to the two different MurM proteins, we introduced the R36A murM allele into the Pen6 background by genetic transformation, in order to generate the construct Pen6murMR36A. Confirmation of efficient allelic replacement was obtained by sequencing the murMN operon of this mutant (data not shown). The cell wall composition of the mutant Pen6murMR36A was analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 5). The introduction of the murMallele from strain R36A caused a large increase in the representation of the monomeric linear peptide 1 (from 2.5% in the parental strain Pen6 to 17.5% in the allelic replacement mutant) and an increased proportion of the directly cross-linked tri-tetra dimer (from 3.1 to 10.5%). The percentage of branched peptide 3 was decreased from 13.8% (in Pen6) to around 8.1%, a value similar to that found in R6Hex (10.3%). (This value was considerably higher than the value found in strain R36A, 2.5%.) There was a considerable reduction in the proportion of the branched peptide I (from 13.9 to 3.6%) more pronounced than the reduction in peptide 3. Despite the extensive variation in the ratio of branched to linear peptides (from 8.0 in Pen6 to 1.4 in the mutant Pen6murMR36A) the level of cross-linking, determined by the percentage of all cross-linked muropeptide species, was similar in all mutants and in their parental strains (62% in the Pen6murMR36A and 63% in Pen6). The enzymes involved in the addition of lateral peptides to the ε-amino group of lysine have been identified in the Staphylococci family (22Sugai M. Fujiwara T. Ohta K. Komatsuzawa H. Ohara M. Suginaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4311-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Thumm G. Gotz F. Mol.

A. 2000; 97: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the case of Staphylococcus aureus, the synthesis of the pentaglycine bridge involves three enzymes: FmhB, responsible for the addition of the first glycine to the linear pentapeptide precursor (25Rohrer S. Ehlert K. Tschierske M. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9351-9356Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and FemA and FemB, involved in the addition of the glycyl residues 2 and 3 (26Maidhof H. Reinicke B. Blumel P. Berger-Bachi B. Labischinski H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 27Stranden A.M. Ehlert K. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and glycyl residues 4 and 5 (28Henze U. Sidow T. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), respectively. In S. aureus, the fmhB gene product was shown to be essential, which may be related to the fact that dimers of linear muropeptides are extremely rare in this bacterial species. In contrast to S. aureus, S. pneumoniae appears to be able to use either linear or branched cell wall precursors as substrates for the PBPs in the cross-linking reaction of peptidoglycan. The disruption of the murMN operon did not impair growth, indicating that the murMN genes are not essential inS. pneumoniae. However, the growth rate of the mutant Pen6murN was significantly reduced, suggesting that the semibranched peptides of this mutant may not be used as efficiently for some growth-limiting function in S. pneumoniae. A combination of genetic and biochemical studies described in this communication has allowed the clarification of the roles of themurM and murN gene products in the assembly of the branched muropeptides. Inactivation of the murMN operon in S. pneumoniaeabolished the addition of any amino acid residue to the ε-amino group of the stem peptide lysine, resulting in the production of a peptidoglycan that completely lacked muropeptides of branched structure (12Filipe S.R. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Selective inactivation of murN caused the formation of an unusual peptidoglycan in which all dipeptide branches were replaced by branches composed of only one seryl or alanyl residue. These results suggest that the MurN protein is involved with the addition of the second amino acid residue (alanine) and that the MurM protein is involved with the addition of the first amino acid (alanine or serine) to the cross-bridge. Interestingly, replacement of the dipeptide bridges by branches composed of single amino acids did not alter the overwhelmingly branched muropeptide composition of strain Pen6; the proportion of branched peptides was 89% in Pen6 and 90% in Pen6murN (see Table II). Furthermore, if one considers all branched muropeptides irrespective of whether they contain one or two amino acid residues, the characteristic proportions of the various specific branched muropeptide species also appeared to be retained in the Pen6murN mutant. These observations suggest that the amount of branched muropeptides in the pneumococcal peptidoglycan is primarily determined by the activity of the murM gene product. Additional evidence for the dominant role of murM is provided by the changes observed in the peptidoglycan composition of the penicillin-resistant strain Pen6 in which the mosaicmurM of this strain (12Filipe S.R. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was replaced by murM of the penicillin-susceptible strain R36A. The murM alleles from R36A and Pen6 differ by 15% at the amino acid level (12Filipe S.R. Tomasz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Comparison of the peptidoglycan of the two strains shows that Pen6 has a much higher percentage of branched peptides and can add an alanine or a serine as the first amino acid of the cross-bridge, whereas R36A only adds a serine residue efficiently. These differences may be related to the observed 15% difference at the amino acid level of the MurM. In order to determine if there were in fact any differences in the activity of the MurM from Pen6 and R36A, we transformed the R36AmurM allele into Pen6. This mutant Pen6murMR36Aonly diverges from the parental strain in the sequence ofmurM allele. Data in Table II show that the introduction of the R36A allele of murM shifted the peptidoglycan composition in the direction characteristic of the penicillin-susceptible strain: the proportion of total branched muropeptides was reduced from 89% (in Pen6) to 58% (in Pen6murMR36A), which is close to the proportion of branched peptides (55%) in strain R36A. The ratio of branched to linear peptides also changed from 8.0 (in Pen6) to 1.4 (in Pen6murMR36A), which is comparable with the ratio (1.3) seen in strain R36A. These results suggest that the MurM from R36A is not as efficient as the one from Pen6 in the addition of the first amino acid to the ε-NH2 group of the lysine residue. It is conceivable that these differences are related to different rates of transcription of the two kinds of murM genes. Based on the result obtained by primer extension analysis for the determination of the transcription initiation sites, we proposed a virtually identical promoter region for the murM genes in strains Pen6 and R36A/R6Hex. The fact that R6Hex has a murM allele identical to R36A but has a higher percentage of branched peptides indicates that additional factors may also contribute to the regulation of the amount of branched peptides in the peptidoglycan. However, when the murM allele from R36A is introduced in the background of Pen6 and therefore subject to the same regulation, the observed difference in the peptidoglycan composition should be due only to the differences in the protein. Therefore, compositional differences between the peptidoglycans of resistant and susceptible strains most likely reflect differences in the specific activities of the two types of MurM proteins. This possibility is currently under investigation. Analysis of the composition of the peptidoglycan from Pen6 and itsmurN and murMN mutants showed similar proportions of cross-linked species in the peptidoglycan, suggesting that the PBPs from strain Pen6 are not very specific regarding their substrates. In the absence of antibiotic, PBPs seem to be able to use either linear, branched or semibranched peptides as substrates for the transpeptidation reaction in the synthesis of peptidoglycan. On the other hand, when a β-lactam antibiotic is present in the medium, the bacteria seem to depend on the availability of branched or at least semibranched peptides for the expression of penicillin resistance. It should be noticed that in strain R6Hex 74% of all stem peptides have a branched structure, yet this strain is not resistant to penicillin, indicating that the presence of branched peptides alone is not sufficient for the expression of penicillin resistance. The fact that PBPs can efficiently cross-link either linear, branched, or semibranched peptides taken together with the fact that substituting the murM allele of Pen6 by the allele from R36A results in drastic changes in the peptidoglycan composition indicates that the primary determinants of the type of peptidoglycan stem peptide structure (linear versus branched peptides) must be MurM and MurN.

It is used to answer specific questions about protein structure and function, and at the same time it can render modified protein structures better suited to perform specific industrial roles. Protein engineering work has been canalized through two main approaches. The first approach (rational design) makes use of the available information about a given protein to predict specific amino acid changes that would result in a specific functional modification. The second approach is based on the generation of random sequence changes and selection of those that cause a desired modification. The iterative application of random mutagenesis and selection, in a process that mimics Darwinian evolution and that has been designated “directed evolution,” has proved very useful in different instances (1Chen K. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5618-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 2Kuchner O. Arnold F.H.

Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). A critical step of the directed evolution is to have an efficient procedure to generate a suitable repertoire of mutations. This has been greatly helped by the development of a method designated DNA shuffling that combines PCR-mediated1 random mutagenesis and recombination (5Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 6Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). The modification of an enzyme to achieve increased thermal resistance is a good practical example of protein engineering. A scheme of directed evolution can be easily applied if the enzyme has an activity easy to assay for. This is the case of two β-glucosidases (BglA and BglB) encoded by bglA and bglB genes fromPaenibacillus (Bacillus) polymyxa. The primary sequences of both proteins are 448 residues long, and both proteins exhibit 47% identity at the amino acid level (7Gonzalez-Candelas L. Ramon D. Polaina J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 95: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The two enzymes present different quaternary structures; BglA is an octamer of about 400 kDa, whereas BglB is a monomer of about 51 kDa (8Sanz-Aparicio J. Romero A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Madarro A. Flors A. Polaina J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 9Gunata Z. Vallier M.J. Sapis J.C. Bayonove C. Arnaudon V. Madarro A. Polaina J. Enz. Microb. Techn. 1996; 18: 286-290Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). They belong to the family 1 of glycosyl hydrolases (10Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar, 11Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 12Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Because it is characteristic of family 1 glycosyl hydrolases, the determination of the structure of BglA by x-ray diffraction revealed a (β/α)8 barrel conformation with the catalytic pair of residues, the acid/base and the nucleophile in β-strands 4 and 7, respectively (13Sanz-Aparicio J. Hermoso J.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Lequerica J.L. Polaina J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The structure of other members of the same family has also been determined. The core of the (β/α)8 barrel is highly homologous in all these structures, and the main regions of structural diversity are found in four loops connecting the C terminus of β-strands of the barrel with the N-end of the α-helices (14Barrett T.

Family 1 glycosidases catalyze the hydrolysis of β-glycosidic linkages by a double displacement mechanism involving the formation of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, resulting in the net retention of the anomeric configuration of the substrate (18Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 19McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Mutant BglA enzymes have previously been characterized with increased structural and cellular stabilities (20Sanz-Aparicio J. Hermoso J.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Gonzalez B. Lopez-Camacho C. Polaina J. Proteins. 1998; 33: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Gonzalez-Blasco G. Sanz-Aparicio J. Gonzalez B. Hermoso J.A. Polaina J. J. Biol.

We subjected P. polymyxa bglB gene to random mutagenesis and DNA shuffling-mediated recombination and screened for mutants encoding proteins with enhanced thermal resistance. We isolated and characterized different mutants with this property. One of the recovered mutations caused a remarkable increase in the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. The structural basis of the effect caused by these mutations was analyzed using homology based structural models of BglB. Escherichia coliDH5α was used as host strain for cloning and protein expression. Plasmid pLGBGB derives from pBG4/SC3 (7Gonzalez-Candelas L. Ramon D. Polaina J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 95: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It consists of an 1.6-kilobase insert of P. polymyxa DNA that contains the bglB gene, cloned in the polylinker region of vector pUC18 (22Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar). Plasmid pLGBGB was used as template in the error-prone PCR reactions conducted to generate mutations in thebglB gene. Plasmid ΔpUC18 was used as the cloning vector for mutagenized bglB preparations. This vector is a modified version of pUC18 that lacks the partial sequence of the lacZgene (21Gonzalez-Blasco G. Sanz-Aparicio J. Gonzalez B. Hermoso J.A. Polaina J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13708-13712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Random mutagenesis of the bglBgene of P. polymyxa was carried out by error-prone PCR amplification (23Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 24Liao X.B. Wise J.A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 88: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), by DNA shuffling (5Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 6Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar), or by a combination of both procedures. Error prone PCR amplification was performed basically as described by Gonzalez-Blasco et al. (21Gonzalez-Blasco G. Sanz-Aparicio J. Gonzalez B. Hermoso J.A. Polaina J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13708-13712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used as primers for the amplification ofbglB were JP27 5′-TGTGAGCTCTTGATTCCTGAAAGGACG-3′ in the direct orientation and AC25 5′-GGGTCTAGAATCCCCCTTTTCTATTTAAAA-3′ in the reverse orientation. DNA shuffling reactions were carried out as described by Stemmer (5Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 6Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The substrate for the DNase treatment was obtained by either standard or error-prone PCR amplification of the bglB gene. Fragments between 50–150 base pairs were purified with a Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) and reassembled in a PCR reaction without primers in a 50-μl volume for 20–40 cycles of amplification. The reassembly product was diluted 1:40 or 1:100 and used as template in an additional PCR run in a final volume of either 50 or 100 μl, that used primers JP27 and AC25 and 15–30 cycles of amplification. Mutagenized preparations of the bglB gene obtained after error-prone PCR or DNA shuffling reactions were ligated into the ΔpUC18 vector. This material was used to transform E. coli, selecting for ampicillin resistance. Transformant colonies with thermoresistant β-glucosidase activity were identified by the plate assay described by López-Camacho and Polaina (25Lopez-Camacho C. Polaina J. Mutat. Res. 1993; 301: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Plates containing transformant colonies were incubated at temperatures that cause inactivation of wild type BglB and then assayed for residual activity. To distinguish thermoresistant mutants from the wild type, the plates with the transformants were incubated for 1 h at 55 °C. To screen for highly thermoresistant clones resulting fromin vitro recombination of point mutations, the plates were incubated for 40 min at 70 °C. Expression and purification of wild type and mutant BglB glucosidases from E. coli was carried out following the same procedure described for BglA (26Lopez-Camacho C. Salgado J. Lequerica J.L. Madarro A. Ballestar E. Franco L. Polaina J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The cells from a bacterial culture expressing the bglB gene were collected and disrupted by sonication. The cell extract was treated with protamine sulfate to eliminate nucleic acids and subjected to several steps of gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The β-glucosidase activity was measured by usingp-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside as the substrate (27Gonzalez-Candelas L. Aristoy M.C. Polaina J. Flors A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 3173-3177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Irreversible thermal inactivation of crude enzyme preparations or purified samples, was measured as described by López-Camacho et al. (26Lopez-Camacho C. Salgado J. Lequerica J.L. Madarro A. Ballestar E. Franco L. Polaina J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thermal inactivation was modeled as a first order kinetic process, and the half-life (t m) of the enzymes was determined from the first order rate constants of inactivation, corresponding to the slopes of the lines obtained by plotting ln (percentage of residual activity)versus incubation time. Kinetic parameters (K m and k cat) were determined by fitting hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten curves with the program SigmaPlot version 4.00 (Jandel Scientific). The substrate and enzyme concentrations used in the determination of kinetic parameters were 0.2–15 mm and 6.3–12.6 nm, respectively. The effect of pH on the thermal resistance of the enzyme was determined as follows. Enzyme samples were added to prewarmed tubes containing 50 mm phosphate buffer at the corresponding pH (pH 7 or 4) and incubated at 47 °C. Aliquots were taken at different times and kept on ice for 4 h to allow the recovery of reversibly denatured enzyme. After this treatment, all the samples were adjusted at the same pH (7.0) and ionic strength. Residual β-glucosidase activity was measured at 37 °C with 5 mm p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside as the substrate. The reaction was stopped with 1 m sodium bicarbonate, and the released nitrophenol was quantified by determining absorbance at 400 nm. To determine the effect of reducing agents on the thermal resistance of the enzyme, parallel thermal inactivation assays were carried out with or without dithiothreitol (10 mm) in the assay buffer. The three-dimensional structures of wild type and mutant BglB proteins were modeled with the program SWISS-MODEL version 3.51 at the Expasy server (28Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar, 29Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of BglB that was subjected to modelling differs at two positions with respect to the sequence deposited in the data bases (accession number M60211). These differences, H376Q and G377R, were identified during the sequencing done to characterize mutant bglB genes obtained in this work and later found to be present in the wild type bglB gene as well. The resolved structures of five different family 1 glycosidases were used as modeling templates. The Brookhaven Protein Data Bank entries of these proteins are 1BGA, 1CBG, 1PBG, 1MYR, and 1GOW. The degree of identity between the templates and the bglBsequence was 47, 39, 31, 38, and 42%, respectively. Visualization and analysis of the modeled structures were done using Swiss-PdbViewer (28Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). The bglB gene encoding β-glucosidase B from P. polymyxa (BglB), contained in plasmid pLGBGB, was amplified by PCR under conditions that promote the misincorporation of nucleotides by Taq polymerase. The amplified material was ligated into vector ΔpUC18 and used to transform E. coli competent cells. Replica plates of the ampicillin resistant transformants were incubated under conditions that would inactivate wild type BglB and then assayed for β-glucosidase activity. Among about 10,000 transformant colonies that were screened, we recovered 10 clones that maintained the capability to hydrolyze the chromogenic substratep-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. As an alternative procedure to generate mutations, we used DNA shuffling. ThebglB gene was first amplified by error-prone PCR. The recovered DNA was digested with DNase I and subjected to a double-step PCR to reassemble full-size bglB gene molecules. This material, which was visible as a single band on an agarose gel, was recovered from the gel, ligated into ΔpUC18, and subsequently used to transform E. coli. Although only a few hundred transformant colonies were obtained, three of them expressed thermoresistant β-glucosidase activity. The increased thermal resistance of the β-glucosidase expressed by the mutant clones was confirmed by comparing the rate of thermal inactivation of crude preparations of these enzymes and wild type BglB. Among those clones that were more heat-resistant than wild type BglB, there were five that exhibited unique patterns of inactivation, indicating that they might contain independent mutations. These five mutant bglB alleles were sequenced to identify the mutations responsible for their enhanced heat resistance. Of the four mutations obtained by error-prone PCR, three were transitions, and the remaining one was a transversion. They corresponded to the following codon and amino acid substitutions: CAC → CGC (H62R), AAC → TAC (N223Y), ATG → ATA (M319I), and ATG → GTG (M319V). The additional mutation, obtained by DNA shuffling, was an ATG → ATT transversion that corresponded to the M361I substitution. Wild type BglB and the thermoresistant enzymes were purified to homogeneity. The purified enzymes were used to measure their thermal resistance and kinetic parameters. Fig.1 shows the irreversible thermal inactivation of the different enzymes at 50 and 55 °C. Half-life time values of the enzymes at both temperatures are listed in Table I. The purified N223Y enzyme showed about the same resistance as wild type BglB at both temperatures.Table IAbsolute and relative t m values for wild type BglB and mutant β-glucosidases at 50 and 55 °CEnzymet m50 °CRelative t m50 °Ct m 55 °CRelativet m 55 °CminminBglB wild type10.41.02.71.0H62R31.03.010.94.1N223Y9.70.92.81.1M319I19.61.97.42.8M319V14.41.42.81.1M361I25.32.45.32.0H62R/N223Y/M319I53.920.2H62R/N223Y/M319I/M361I13.44.9t m is the incubation time at a given temperature that causes a 50% irreversible thermal inactivation.

Table II shows the kinetic parameters obtained for the different enzymes. Ak cat value of 38.9 s−1 and aK m of 6.4 mm were obtained for wild type BglB. Four of the five mutants exhibited no significant differences in their kinetic parameters with respect to the wild type enzyme. However, mutant N223Y presented a k cat value of 15.4 s−1 and a K m of 0.7 mm. Thus, N223Y hydrolyses the β-glycosidic linkage at a lower rate than the wild type enzyme, but the overall catalytic efficiency of this mutant, expressed as thek cat/K m ratio, is about 4-fold greater than that of the wild type enzyme.Table IIKinetic parameters of wild type BglB and mutant β-glucosidasesEnzymek catK mk cat/K mRelative efficiencys −1mms −1 m −1BglB wild type38.896.46.08 × 1031H62R36.635.75.25 × 1031.06N223Y15.420.722.02 × 1033.68M319I33.056.35.25 × 1030.86M319V35.505.56.45 × 1031.06M361I37.165.96.30 × 1031.04H62R/N223Y/M319I14.860.353.86 × 1038.86 Open table in a new tab Mutations that cause increased thermoresistance often show additive or cooperative effects when present in the same sequence (31Wells J.A.

Several reports in the literature describe the construction of proteins with remarkably increased thermoresistance by combining the effect of several point mutations (4Cherry J.R. Lamsa M.H.

To test whether the thermoresistance of BglB could be enhanced by the combined action of the characterized mutations, we subjected the mutant bglBgenes to DNA shuffling, a process that promotes recombination. A DNA pool containing the five bglB genes carrying each one of the different thermoresistant mutations was used as starting material. The gene pool was amplified by PCR using standard (nonmutagenic) conditions, digested with DNase I, and reassembled following the shuffling procedure. The DNA recovered after the final PCR amplification, presumably composed of recombinant versions of thebglB gene, was cloned in a vector and used to transformE. coli. The transformant colonies were subjected to a thermal treatment that would cause the inactivation of any of the characterized BglB mutants and then assayed for residual β-glucosidase activity. Seven clones, of about 2,000 colonies screened, were identified that expressed β-glucosidase activity resistant to these conditions. The bglB allele present in the clone that exhibited the greatest thermoresistance was sequenced. It corresponded to the triple amino acid replacement H62R/N223Y/M319I. The triple mutant enzyme was purified and further characterized. As shown in Table II, its catalytic properties were very similar to those of the N223Y single mutant. Additionally, it exhibited a considerably greater thermoresistance than any of the single mutants. After 54 min of incubation at 55 °C, pure preparations of this enzyme still maintained half of the initial activity (Fig. 1 and Table I). It was remarkable that the most thermoresistant version of BglB, isolated by shuffling of the mutations, did not correspond to an enzyme that combined all the single mutations. To find out whether this was due to a shortcoming of the shuffling procedure, we used site-directed mutagenesis to construct a copy of the bglB gene that carried thermoresistant mutations in all four identified loci. The enzyme encoded by the resulting gene, which contained the H62R/N223Y/M319/M361I combination, was purified. We found that its thermal resistance (Table I) was four times lower than that of the triple mutant selected after the shuffling procedure. In the absence of an x-ray-based structure of BglB, we produced homology-based models of this enzyme using the Swiss Model program (28Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar, 29Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). To build the models we considered five family 1 proteins of known structure, whose amino acid sequences have extensive homology to that of BglB. These proteins are: β-glucosidase A fromP. polymyxa (BglA), the cyanogenic β-glucosidase fromTrifolium repens, 6-p-β-galactosidase fromLactococcus lactis, myrosinase from Sinapis alba, and β-glycosidase from Sulfolobus solfataricus. The degree of sequence identity between BglB and these proteins is: 47, 39, 31, 38, and 42%, respectively. A series of models of BglB were obtained using as templates either each one of the homologous proteins individually or different combinations of them. All the considered models provided a similar solution for the backbone structure of BglB. The α-carbon coordinates provided by the different models differed by only 0.6–1.2 Å, as would be expected given the homology of the sequences used as templates (28Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar, 38Chothia C. Lesk A.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). It is characteristic of retaining glycosyl hydrolases that the average distance between the carboxylic oxygen atoms of the two catalytic residues is about 5 Å, whereas in inverting enzymes this distance is greater: about 9 Å (19McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Models based on multiple templates were less reliable than the ones based on single templates, because they failed in predicting the distance between catalytic residues Glu167 and Glu356consistent with the assumed retaining mechanism of this enzyme. However, they proved useful for exploring possible amino acid side chain dispositions that would explain new interactions responsible for the phenotype of the mutants. Fig. 2 represents the structural model obtained for the BglB monomer based on BglA, displaying four of the characterized mutations. Mutations H62R, M319I, M319V (not shown), and M361I are located in loops that surround the cavity in which the active center is located. In contrast, mutation N223Y is in the middle of the barrel, at the C-end of β-strand 5, in close proximity to the catalytic center of the enzyme. Residue His62 is located in loop 1, which connects the C-end of the barrel's β-strand 1 to the N-end of α-helix 1. All models, except the one based on BglA alone, predict that the H62R substitution places the positive charge of Arg62 at a distance of 3.2 Å from the negative charge of Glu429, allowing the formation of a salt bridge (Fig.3). Additionally, the models predict a novel H-bond between these two residues. To test whether the predicted salt bridge was the cause of the increased thermoresistance caused by the H62R mutation, we compared the effect of pH on the thermal resistance of wild type and mutant enzymes. As shown in Fig.4, at pH 7 the H62R mutant enzyme exhibits much greater thermal resistance than the wild type, whereas at pH 4 the thermal resistance of both enzymes is very similar. This result indicates that the resistance conferred by the H62R mutation is due to an electrostatic interaction, in accordance with the prediction of the structural model.Figure 4Effect of pH on the thermal inactivation of wild type BglB and mutant H62R. Shown is the time course of irreversible thermal inactivation at 47 °C at pH 7 and 4 of wild type BglB and mutant H62R. ●, BglB wild type, pH 7; ○, H62R, pH 7; ▾, BglB wild type, pH 4; ▵, H62R, pH 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In three instances: M319V, M319I, and M361I, the replacement of a methionine led to an increase in thermal resistance. Given the susceptibility of methionine to oxidation (39Estell D.A. Graycar T.P. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6518-6521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was likely that the stabilization provided by these mutations would be due to protection of the enzyme against oxidation during incubation at high temperatures. Residues Met319 and Met361 are located in loops 6 and 7, respectively. In all BglB models these residues are on the surface of the protein, exposed to the solvent and therefore prone to oxidation. To test this hypothesis, we carried out parallel thermal inactivation assays in the presence or absence of 10 mmdithiothreitol in the assay buffer. The inactivation rate of the wild type enzyme in the presence of dithiothreitol was about four times slower than the rate observed in the absence of the reducing agent, whereas in the case of the M319I and M361I mutants the ratio of inactivation rates was only 1.5. These results indicate that the wild type is more sensitive than the mutants to oxidative inactivation and support the idea of the protective effect of the mutations against this effect. An additional effect associated to the M319V, M319I, and M361I mutations is due to the hydrophobic nature of the side chains of isoleucine and valine, which could contribute to better packing of the protein. Indeed, M361I replacement seems to fill up a depression on the surface of the protein, yielding a more compact structure. On the other hand, valine and isoleucine residues at position 319 fill up a cavity between the side chains of Val317, Ile302, and Glu321. Isoleucine fills up this cavity to a greater extent, which is consistent with the higher thermoresistance observed for mutant M319I with respect to that of mutant M319V. The different models predict that residue Asn223 is located at the C-end of β-strand 5, at the core of the catalytic center of the enzyme. Replacement of this residue by tyrosine places the aromatic ring of tyrosine in close proximity to Glu167, which participates in the hydrolysis of the substrate as the acid/base catalyst. Thus, the position and nature of this replacement are consistent with the observed effect of the mutation on the rate of catalysis and K m . We have used a random mutagenesis scheme to engineer a β-glucosidase. This approach allowed us to recover an enzyme variant with a 20-fold increase in the half-life of the enzyme at 55 °C and an 8-fold increase in catalytic efficiency. The structural analysis of mutant enzymes was hampered by the fact that BglB has proven refractory to crystallization. It is known that proteins sharing 35–50% sequence identity, whose structure has been solved by x-ray diffraction, differ very little in their α-carbon coordinates, showing a relative mean square deviation of 1–1.5 Å (38Chothia C. Lesk A.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Therefore, to circumvent the problem because of the absence of a crystallographic model of BglB, we considered 10 theoretical models based on solved homologous proteins sharing 30–50% sequence identity with this enzyme, which likely provide a good approximation to the actual structure. In all these models, the residues whose substitutions increase thermal resistance lie on loops connecting the β-strands of the barrel to the adjacent α-helices. This observation is consistent with the fact that loops are the regions of the α/β barrel with higher variability in sequence, where more amino acid replacements could occur without causing a deletereous change of the structure (13Sanz-Aparicio J. Hermoso J.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Lequerica J.L. Polaina J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In contrast, residue Asn223, whose mutation causes a change in the catalytic activity of the enzyme, is located in the active center in close spatial proximity to the catalytic residue Glu167. According to the structural models, the increase of thermoresistance can be explained by known mechanisms. Substitution H62R likely strengthens the interaction between loops number 1 and 8 through an ion pair. Many different studies have implicated this type of interaction in protein stabilization (13Sanz-Aparicio J. Hermoso J.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Lequerica J.L. Polaina J. J. Mol.

Elimination of chemically labile residues like Met or Asn that can undergo oxidation or deamidation at high temperatures is expected to render the enzyme more resistant to irreversible thermal denaturation (46Giordano A. Cannio R. La Cara F. Bartolucci S. Rossi M. Raia C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3043-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 47Vieille C. Burdette D.S. Zeikus J.G. Biotechnol. Annu.

This is the case of substitutions M319I, M319V, and M361I. Additionally, these substitutions might contribute to thermoresistance by another mechanism: improved packing efficiency (49Eriksson A.E. Baase W.A. Zhang X.J. Heinz D.W. Blaber M. Baldwin E.P. Matthews B.W. Science. 1992; 255: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 50Hurley J.H. Baase W.A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol.

Matthews B.W. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 158-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In this case the better packing would be provided by the branched side chains of Ile and Val in an hydrophobic environment. The fact that Ile and Val at position 319 stabilize the enzyme to a different degree strongly supports the packing effect of these substitutions. No significant increase in thermoresistance was observed for N223Y with purified protein preparations. Any benefit obtained from the substitution of the Asn residue seemed to be counterbalanced by other negative interactions. Although proximal to Glu167, Asn223 does not interact directly with the oxygen atoms of the catalytic residue. Therefore, it is not clear why changing this residue in mutant N223Y would cause a 50% reduction in the catalytic rate. One possibility is that the presence of the bulky side chain of tyrosine in the vicinity of the catalytic dyad might perturb the environment of these residues or result in a less favorable catalytic geometry. On the other hand, tyrosine residues are common at sugar binding sites of many glycosidic enzymes (19McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The decrease inK m observed for N223Y would be consistent with Tyr223 contributing to substrate binding. Different studies show that the combination of point mutations that affect a given property of a protein results in a considerable enhancement of this property, because of either an additive or cooperative effect (32Matthews B.W. Nicholson H. Becktel W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6663-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 33Imanaka T. Shibazaki M. Takagi M.

However, combining different mutations in a single protein molecule by site-directed mutagenesis implies a laborious task. We used DNA shuffling to promote random recombination between the single mutations and obtained an enzyme containing three mutations H62R/N223Y/M319I that exhibited a remarkable increase in thermoresistance. It was interesting that no novel mutations were found in the shuffled BglB molecules, despite the high mutagenesis rate of this procedure (5Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The characterization of the properties of the triple mutant H62R/N223Y/M319I indicated that these substitutions might have a cooperative effect. The half-life of the triple mutant at 55 °C was about 20 times that of wild type BglB. This enhancement was greater than what would be expected from an additive effect. In addition to the increased thermoresistance, the triple mutant showed a slightly lower K m value than the single mutant N223Y. This resulted in a further improvement of the catalytic efficiency of the triple mutant with respect to the wild type (about 8-fold). Changes in substrate binding affinity brought about by mutations distant from the binding site have previously been reported (54Yano T. Oue S. Kagamiyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5511-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 55Oue S. Okamoto A. Yano T. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2344-2349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Overall, this recombination step allowed us to simultaneously improve the thermal stability and the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. We tested the thermoresistance of the quadruple mutant H62R/N223Y/M319I/M361I, and it was lower than that of the triple mutant. This result indicated that even though the M361I substitution improved the thermoresistance of wild type BglB, it exerted a net negative effect in the presence of the other three substitutions. Our results provide information about critical properties of an enzyme, such as thermoresistance and catalytic efficiency, based on a straightforward procedure of isolation, identification, and structural analysis of random mutations. In this scheme, DNA shuffling was a powerful tool to generate new versions of the protein structure, among which recombinants of desired properties could be selected."

Indeed, platelets express some of the highest levels of tyrosine kinase activity of any cell in the body, with Syk and Src each making up approximately 0.1–0.2% of cellular protein. Nevertheless, resting platelets have relatively low levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, indicating that protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity must be relatively high (3Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Equine Vet. J. 1995; 27: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 4Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Cooray P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 640-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This is illustrated by the dramatic increase of tyrosine phosphorylation observed in platelets within 10 s of incubation with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor peroxovanadate (5Blake R. Walker T. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Several proteins undergo only transient increases in tyrosine phosphorylation upon agonist stimulation, e.g. the adapter LAT in response to GPVI1 activation (6Pasquet J.M. Gross B. Quek L. Asazuma N. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Judd B. Lee J.R. Koretzky G. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Watson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8326-8334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), further emphasizing the role of protein-tyrosine phosphatases in regulating platelet activation. The tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 both contain tandem SH2 domains within the N-terminus, enabling association with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. SHP-1 is restricted to hematopoietic cells, whereas SHP-2 is ubiquitous. SHP-1 has been intensively studied in the regulation of the immune system. Mutation of SHP-1 in mice is accompanied by defects in immunity and hematopoiesis (7Shultz L.D. Rajan T.V. Greiner D.L. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 302-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). SHP-1 is selectively recruited to the surface membrane in hematopoietic cells through interaction with a phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) leading to inhibition of immune receptor signaling (8Scharenberg A.M.

For example, recruitment of SHP-1 to CD22, in B-lymphocytes, leads to inhibition of signaling through the B cell antigen receptor (11Defranco A. Law D.A.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 13-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In a similar way, natural killer cells express killer inhibitory receptors that mediate negative regulation of cell cytoxicity via the recruitment of SHP-1 to the phosphorylated ITIM sequence of the killer inhibitory receptor (14Fry A.M.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and to bind to an ITIM sequence in the membrane protein PECAM-1 (CD31) following stimulation by thrombin (17Hua C. Gamble J.

Thrombin activation proceeds through a G protein-coupled signaling pathway but also leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of a wide spectrum of proteins through activation of protein kinase C and Ca2+(29Blake R.A. Asselin J. Walker T. Watson S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The role of tyrosine phosphorylation in thrombin-induced platelet activation is not established. Despite the fact that collagen and thrombin stimulate a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, the functional role of protein-tyrosine phosphatases in platelet regulation is still poorly understood. In particular, it is not known whether the SHP-1 exerts a selective inhibitory effect on the GPVI-regulated ITAM signaling pathway through interaction with an ITIM, analogous to that described in other immune cells. In the present study, we have addressed the role of SHP-1 in platelet activation by the collagen receptor GPVI. CRP (GCP*(GPP*)10GCP*G, single amino acid code, P* is hydroxyproline), cross-linked through the C-terminal cysteines as described previously (30Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D.

Motheaten (mev/mev) mice were from Jackson laboratory and were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions within the University of California, San Francisco animal care facility.

Experiments were stopped by addition of an equal volume of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmTris, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2% (v/v) Nonidet P40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.3). Non-lysed cells and debris were removed by centrifugation and lysates pre-cleared by mixing with protein A-Sepharose for 60 min at 4 °C (20 μl of a 50% (w/v) suspension of protein A-Sepharose in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.3)). SHP-1 was immunoprecipitated from 1 ml of lysate by 5 μl of rabbit anti-SHP-1. Following rotation for 60 min, protein A-Sepharose was added and rotation continued for a further 60 min. The pellet of protein A-Sepharose was washed in lysis buffer and three times in TBS-T before the addition of Laemmli buffer (4% SDS, 10% mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8). The GST fusion proteins containing the tandem SH2 domains, the catalytic domain, and the full-length protein were expressed and purified using glutathione-agarose. Precipitation of platelet proteins was performed in lysis buffer after pre-clearing of lysates with glutathione-agarose. 5 μg of GST fusion protein were used for precipitation with GST as control. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which had been blocked by incubation in 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin dissolved in TBS-T. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in TBS-T containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and incubated with membranes for 60 min at room temperature. Blots were washed for 120 min in TBS-T and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system. Anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-SHP-1 were used at 1 μg/ml and 1:1,000, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was diluted at 1:10,000. Immunoprecipitates were washed as described above and resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2). The reaction was started by addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 volume of HCl. The protein A-Sepharose pellet was washed by centrifugation and the supernatant was discarded. Samples were solubilized by addition of 30 μl of Laemmli buffer and boiled for 10 min. Samples (106 platelets) in Tyrode-HEPES were incubated with P-selectin antibody and anti-rat fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (5 μl each) for 10 min at room temperature. After a 5-fold dilution in Tyrode-HEPES, samples were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Immunoprecipitation studies reveal that SHP-1 was minimally tyrosine phosphorylated under basal conditions but underwent an increase in phosphorylation on tyrosine in response to the GPVI-selective agonist CRP, collagen, and thrombin. Tyrosine phosphorylation was maximal by 60 s and maintained this level for up to 10 min (data not shown). Major tyrosine phosphorylated proteins of 28 and 32 kDa and a minor band of 130 kDa coprecipitated with SHP-1 under basal conditions and underwent a further increase in phosphorylation in response to stimulation by all three agonists (Fig.1). An additional band migrating at 26 kDa was detected after stimulation in some studies. A broad band of 50–55 kDa that migrated in the region of the heavy chain and a minor band of 70 kDa were present only in CRP and collagen-stimulated platelets. These bands were shown to contain the tyrosine kinases Lyn, which is present as a doublet, and Syk, respectively, by Western blotting (Fig. 1). Cross-linking of Fcγ RIIA, which signals through a similar pathway to GPVI, induced SHP-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and coimmunoprecipitation of a heavily phosphorylated band of 40 kDa, which is the Fc receptor. Kinase assays were performed in vitro on SHP-1 immunoprecipitates to confirm the association with Src and Syk tyrosine kinases in CRP-stimulated platelets. SHP-1, along with several other bands, underwent a small increase in phosphorylation in the in vitro kinase assay following immunoprecipitation from non-stimulated platelets (Fig. 2). In contrast, several proteins underwent large increases in phosphorylation in the kinase assay following stimulation by CRP including SHP-1 itself, an uncharacterized protein of 40 kDa, and a broad band around 50–55 kDa which comigrates with Lyn. There were smaller increases in phosphorylation of unidentified proteins of 20, 38, 46, 70, and 90 kDa (Fig. 2). The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was partially inhibited in the presence of the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 consistent, with the presence of Lyn in the SHP-1 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2). In contrast, there was only a minimal increase in phosphorylation of SHP-1 and a band of 38 kDa in thrombin-stimulated platelets and surprisingly, there was dephosphorylation of several minor bands (Fig. 2). To investigate whether a Src family kinase lies upstream of SHP-1 phosphorylation in vivo, platelets were incubated with the specific Src kinase inhibitor PP1 prior to stimulation. PP1 completely inhibited the increase in phosphorylation of SHP-1 observed in response to CRP and markedly reduced the response to thrombin (Fig.3). Similar results were obtained in the presence of a second structurally distinct Src family kinase inhibitor PD173956 (data not shown). Interpretation of the result for GPVI, however, is hampered by the critical role of Src family kinases in the phosphorylation of the Fc receptor γ chain ITAM, which initiates the signaling cascade (25Ezumi Y. Shindoh K. Tsuji M. Takayama H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 26Briddon S.J. Melford S.K. Turner M. Tybulewicz V. Watson S.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 3847-3855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies revealed a similar level of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 in response to CRP and thrombin despite the lack of association of Src and Syk family kinases with the latter. This raises the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by a common mechanism in response to the two agonists and that it may have little functional significance with respect to the role of SHP-1 in the GPVI receptor-signaling cascade. This is supported by the observation that tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 is inhibited by the Ca2+chelator BAPTA-AM (10 μm) in response to thrombin and CRP (Fig. 3). Additionally, the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, induces a similar level of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 to thrombin and CRP, confirming a direct role for the cation in this pathway (data not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 therefore appears to be regulated by a common pathway downstream of Ca2+mobilization. The region of SHP-1 that mediates the association with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in CRP-stimulated platelets was investigated using recombinant GST fusion proteins encoding domains of the phosphatase. GST alone did not associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in control or stimulated platelets (Fig. 4). The tandem SH2 domains of SHP-1 (SH2) precipitated several tyrosine phosphorylated proteins from CRP-stimulated platelets, including a broad band of 50–70 kDa and additional bands of 26, 28, 32, 36, and 130 kDa. The bands of 50–55 kDa and 70 kDa were also precipitated by full-length SHP-1 (FULL) and by its catalytic domain (CAT), albeit to a lesser extent. A tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 130 kDa associated with full-length SHP-1 was seen in longer exposures from CRP-stimulated platelets. The proteins precipitated by the various constructs of SHP-1 were probed with antibodies to the tyrosine kinases Syk, Lyn, and SLP-76. Syk was precipitated strongly by the SH2 from CRP-stimulated platelets and to a lesser extent from non-stimulated platelets (Fig. 4). A lower level of Syk was precipitated by the catalytic domain from CRP-stimulated platelets. This raises the possibility that Syk is a substrate for SHP-1, accounting for the weaker association with full-length SHP-1 relative to the tandem SH2 domains. The tyrosine kinase Lyn was precipitated from CRP-stimulated platelets by all three fusion proteins. The adaptor molecule, SLP-76, was constitutively precipitated by the tandem SH2 domain of SHP-1 whereas a CRP-stimulated dependent association was seen with the full-length SHP-1. As for Syk, the apparently weak association of Lyn with the catalytic domain may be because of phosphatase activity. This is supported by the increased level of association of both proteins with the catalytic domain after inactivation of the phosphatase group with an oxidizing agent (data not shown). Syk and Lyn therefore associate with the tandem SH2 domains and catalytic regions of the phosphatase (Fig. 4). To investigate the role of SHP-1 in platelets, we performed studies on cells from mev/mev mice, which contain a mutation within the shp-1 gene that results in nearly complete loss of catalytic activity (7Shultz L.D. Rajan T.V. Greiner D.L. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 302-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Only a limited amount of tissue could be obtained from these mice, which die within a few weeks after birth. Moreover, the oldest animals were thrombocytopenic, which severely restricted the studies that could be performed (platelet number, 0.6 × 108/ml ± 0.2, n = 5 versus 3.2 × 108/ml ± 0.7,n = 5 for controls). Measurement of whole cell tyrosine phosphorylation in platelet lysates revealed the presence of a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 26 kDa in non-stimulated mev/mev platelets which was absent in control cells (Fig. 5). The 26-kDa protein migrates below the heavily phosphorylated 28- and 32-kDa proteins that bind to the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-1. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of other bands in non-stimulatedmev/mev platelets was similar to that in controls. A weak reduction in whole cell tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in response to CRP in the mev/mev platelets relative to controls (Fig.5). This was particularly striking for a broad 70-kDa band, which has been previously shown to contain Syk, SLP-76, and Btk. To investigate the effect of the mutant form of SHP-1 on the regulation of Lyn and Syk by CRP, these proteins were immunoprecipitated from control and stimulated platelets. Basal tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn was similar in control and mev/mev mice platelets (Fig. 5). As previously reported (26Briddon S.J. Melford S.K. Turner M. Tybulewicz V. Watson S.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 3847-3855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), stimulation by CRP had little effect on the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn in wild-type platelets, whereas in mev/mev platelets, there was a decrease in phosphorylation at 30 s that was maintained for up to 120 s (Fig. 5). Minimal phosphorylation of Syk was observed under basal conditions in both groups of platelets. However, the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk in CRP-stimulated platelets was reduced in mev/mev platelets relative to controls, most notably at early times of stimulation (Fig. 5). We monitored the expression of P-selectin, a marker of α-granule secretion, in response to CRP in control and mev/mevplatelets. The basal level of expression of P-selectin was not altered in mev/mev and control mice. However, expression of P-selectin in response to 1 μg/ml CRP was strongly reduced inmev/mev mice, and the response to a supramaximal concentration of CRP (10 μg/ml) was reduced by 50% relative to control platelets (Fig. 5). The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of the SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1, in GPVI signaling in platelets. SHP-1 is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to the collagen-related peptide, CRP, through a pathway that is regulated by Ca2+. Stimulation leads to the in vivo association of SHP-1 with a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated bands, including two major uncharacterized bands of 28 and 32 kDa and further bands of 50–55, 70, and 130 kDa. The tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk, which play critical roles in the GPVI signaling pathway, were identified as components of the 50–55- and 70-kDa bands, respectively. The major site of interaction of Syk, SLP-76, and Lyn with SHP-1 is through the tandem SH2 domains of the phosphatase, although both Syk and Lyn kinases also bind to the catalytic domain. Inactivation of the catalytic domain of SHP-1 through oxidation led to an increase in association with the tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk raising the possibility that Syk and Lyn are substrates for SHP-1 in vivo. Studies on mev/mev platelets were unable to establish, however, whether this is the case because of the general inhibition of response to GPVI. It is not known whether the interaction of Syk and Lyn with the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-1 is direct or via an intermediatory protein. A constitutive association of SLP-76 with SHP-1 via its N-terminal SH2 domain has been reported in B cells (32Mizuno K. Katagiri T. Hasegawa K. Ogimoto M. Yakura H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 457463Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We found a similar constitutive association in vitro in platelets, although no in vivo association with SHP-1 was detected. In T and natural killer cells, SLP-76 has been detected by farwestern using a non-active catalytic domain of SHP-1, suggesting it is a substrate of the phosphatase (33Binstadt B.A. Billadeau D.D. Jevremovic D. Williams B.L. Fang N. Yi T. Koretzky G.A. Abraham R.T. Leibson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27518-27523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We were unable to show such association in vitro using the catalytic domain of SHP-1 in precipitation assay in platelets. SHP-1 is also phosphorylated in response to the G protein-coupled receptor agonist thrombin through a pathway that is also regulated by Ca2+. Similarly, thrombin induces association of SHP-1 with proteins of 28, 32, and 130 kDa, although there is no interaction with Lyn and Syk. It appears that mobilization of Ca2+ mediates SHP-1 phosphorylation in platelets by multiple agonists, whereas association with Lyn and Syk is specific to the GPVI signaling pathway. A number of uncharacterized, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were observed to associate with SHP-1 in platelets. This includes two prominent bands of 28 and 32 kDa, which are present at low level in SHP-1 immunoprecipitates in resting cells and at high levels in CRP-stimulated samples and a 130-kDa protein, which is clearly seen in stimulated cells. A similar pattern of interaction of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins has been reported in SHP-2 immunoprecipitates in platelets stimulated by thrombin (19Edmead C.E. Crosby D.A. Southcott M. Poole A.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The interaction of these three phosphorylated proteins with SHP-1 is mediated solely through the SH2 domains of the phosphatase making it extremely unlikely that they are substrates. Their ability to associate with the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-1 suggests that they may help to localize the phosphatase to key regions in the cell. It is therefore of considerable interest to establish whether one or more of these proteins are transmembrane and whether they possess ITIMs. The 130-kDa protein migrates in the same region as PECAM-1, which contains an ITIM sequence and is expressed in platelets (17Hua C. Gamble J. Vadas M.A. Jackson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28332-28340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); however, we were unable to identify PECAM-1 as a component of this band in vivo through immunoblotting or re-immunoprecipitation combined with blotting for phosphotyrosine. Yang et al. (34Yang W. Tabrizi M. Berrad K. Yi T. Blood. 1998; 91: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported association of a 32-kDa band with SHP-1, but the interaction was through the C terminus suggesting that it is unrelated to the 28- and 32-kDa proteins observed in this study (34Yang W. Tabrizi M. Berrad K. Yi T. Blood. 1998; 91: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of SHP-1 in GPVI receptor signaling was investigated in platelets derived from mev/mev mice. An uncharacterized 26-kDa protein was heavily tyrosine phosphorylated inmev/mev platelets, and the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in whole cell lysates in response to CRP was reduced. There was a reduction in phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase Syk and expression of P-selectin, a marker of α-granule secretion, in response to CRP. Additionally, the tyrosine kinase Lyn was dephosphorylated in mev/mev platelets in response to CRP suggesting that another phosphatase underlies this dephosphorylation. The absence of active SHP-1 therefore exerts an inhibitory effect on GPVI receptor signaling, rather than causing potentiation as observed in other immune cells. The reduction in phosphorylation of Lyn may be a contributing factor to the inhibition of response to CRP through loss of phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain ITAM (25Ezumi Y. Shindoh K. Tsuji M. Takayama H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 26Briddon S.J. Melford S.K. Turner M. Tybulewicz V. Watson S.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 3847-3855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies onme/me mice, which do not express SHP-1, may shed further light on the role of the phosphatase in platelets. There is considerable interest in the identity of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 26-kDa protein, which is present inmev/mev platelets. This protein migrates below p28 and p32 and therefore appears to be distinct. Because the presence of this protein is unmasked in the absence of active SHP-1, it is possible that it is a substrate for the phosphatase. This contrasts with the p28 and p32 bands which are unlikely to be substrates for the reasons discussed above. In view of the fact that the absence of active SHP-1 reduces platelet activation to GPVI, it is important to establish whether this is brought about by the increase in phosphorylation of p26. If this is the case, the possibility that p26 has an ITIM group and is membrane localized is deserving of close attention. The functional significance of the present observations is unclear. In the majority of other hematopoietic cells, SHP-1 has been shown to exert an inhibitory influence on ITAM-dependent activation through its ability to bind to ITIMs and mediate dephosphorylation of key proteins in the activation cascade. It is possible that SHP-1 plays a similar role in platelets, possibly through recruitment to the 28-, 32- and 130-kDa proteins identified in this study, with Syk and Lyn serving as potential substrates. This may help to prevent unwanted platelet activation at key sites in the vasculature. However, platelets from motheaten viable mice are hyporesponsive to GPVI stimulation, suggesting a physiological role for SHP-1 in lowering the threshold for activation by GPVI. This will help to facilitate rapid platelet activation at sites of damage to the vasculature. We thank Dr. M. J. Barnes, Dr. C. G. Knight, and Dr. R. W. Farndale for the collagen-related peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1526567499,"Analysis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction has suggested the existence of at least two La autoantigen-encoding mRNAs that contain different 5′ noncoding regions (NCRs) linked to the same La coding region (Troster, H., Metzger, T. E., Semsei, I., Schwemmle, M., Winterpacht, A., Zabel, B., and Bachmann, M. (1994) J. Exp. Med.180, 2059–2067). La-encoding transcripts La1 and La1′ contain 115- and 483-nucleotide 5′ NCRs, respectively. To determine whether the various La transcripts are functional mRNAs, the expression and polysomal association of natural La1 and La1′ RNAs were examined. Although La1 transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, La1′ transcripts were predominantly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes, especially in B, T, and natural killer cells. Both La1 and La1′ transcripts associated with polysomes in natural killer cells, suggesting that these transcripts were functional mRNAs. Upon activation of B cells with the mitogens phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, the amount of La1′ mRNA, but not La1, declined. In contrast, after chemical activation of T cells, the amount of La 1 mRNA, but not La1′, declined. The mechanism by which the La1 and La1′ 5′ NCRs initiate translation initiation was tested in cultured human HeLa cells and in two different in vitro translation systems. It was found that both 5′ NCRs can mediate translation initiation by internal initiation. These findings indicate that the constitutive expression of La1 mRNA and the tissue-specific expression of La1′ mRNA can both allow La protein synthesis under conditions when cap-dependent translation is compromised, such as inflammation, apoptosis, or certain viral infections.

Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5412-5424Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In each case, La has been identified as a nuclear phosphoprotein that binds to small RNAs such as tRNA, 5 S rRNA (6Rinke J. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1982; 29: 149-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), U6 snRNA (7Rinke J. Steitz J.A.

In Drosophila, a small chromosomal deletion that removes the La gene was found to be lethal in homozygous larvae, suggesting a role for La inDrosophila development (15Bai C. Tolias P.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). La resides predominantly in the nucleus (16Simons F.H. Broers F.J. Van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Insights into the role of nuclear La was provided by Wolin and co-workers (17Pannone B.K. Xue D. Wolin S.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7442-7453Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) who showed that yeast La protein is required for the endonucleolytic processing at the 3′ end in many pre-tRNAs, the assembly of yeast U6 snRNPs, and the stabilization of a 3′-extended form of U4 RNA, thereby assisting formation of U4/U6 spliceosomal snRNP complexes (18Xue D.

From these observations it was concluded that La functions as a molecular chaperone for polymerase III transcripts to facilitate tRNA processing and for both polymerase II and III transcripts in the assembly of certain snRNP complexes (17Pannone B.K.

Recently, two yeast proteins containing a La motif were found to be associated with translating ribosomes (26Sobel S.G. Wolin S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3849-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and, although there is evidence that La protein can associate with 40 S ribosomal subunits (27Peek R. Pruijn G.J. Van Venrooij W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), La has not yet been shown to play a functional role in translation in intact cells. The most promising hint for participation of La in cytoplasmic events came from studies carried out with polioviral and hepatitis C viral mRNAs in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL)1 translation system, which lacks detectable levels of La. Addition of La to the RRL enhanced the translational efficiency of polioviral and hepatitis C viral mRNAs by factors 10 and 20, respectively (22Meerovitch K. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Lejbkowicz F. Kenan D.J. Chan E.K. Agol V.I. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3798-3807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that La protein is cleaved in poliovirus-infected cells by a virus-encoded protease (29Shiroki K. Isoyama T. Kuge S. Ishii T. Ohmi S. Hata S. Suzuki K. Takasaki Y. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2193-2200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, the N-terminal cleavage product of La, which retains the translation stimulatory activity, resided in the cytoplasm while the C-terminal cleaved fragment localized to the nucleus (29Shiroki K. Isoyama T. Kuge S. Ishii T. Ohmi S. Hata S. Suzuki K. Takasaki Y. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2193-2200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding supports the idea that La may have a cytoplasmic role in the poliovirus infectious cycle. The mechanism by which La affects translation of these RNAs is not known, but it is thought that La may act as an RNA chaperone that interacts with the 5′ noncoding regions (NCRs), either stabilizing or unwinding RNA structures that are involved in translation initiation. Two promoters have been described that can direct the transcription of two distinct La transcripts, La1 and La1′, which differ only in their 5′ NCRs (30Troster H. Metzger T.E. Semsei I. Schwemmle M. Winterpacht A. Zabel B. Bachmann M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2059-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These 5′ NCRs are predicted to be burdened with secondary structures and upstream AUG codons that may interfere with cap-dependent translation. To understand the roles of La1 and La1′ transcripts in the cell, the tissue distribution and translational efficiencies of La1 and La1′ mRNAs were compared. It was found that La1 and La1′ mRNAs display distinct expression patterns in human tissues and can be translated by internal initiation. These findings argue that La protein, like other cellular mRNAs that contain internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements (31Iizuka N. Chen C. Yang Q. Johannes G. Sarnow P. Sarnow P. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology 203: Cap-Independent Translation. Springer Verlag, Berlin1995: 155-177Google Scholar), can be synthesized under conditions when the components of the translation apparatus for cap-dependent translation are limiting.

For pEMCV, the EMCV IRES was amplified in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using gene-specific 5′ primers containing an EcoRI site at the 5′ end and 3′ gene-specific primers containing anNcoI site and inserted into pΔEMCV between the ΔEMCV and firefly luciferase at the EcoRI and NcoI sites. For pLa1′, the 5′ noncoding region of La1′ was amplified in a PCR using human genomic DNA (CLONTECH) and oligo primers A and B containing EcoRI and NcoI sites in the 5′ and 3′ gene-specific primers, respectively. The amplified DNA was cleaved with EcoRI and NcoI and inserted into pΔEMCV between ΔEMCV and firefly luciferase at the EcoRI and NcoI sites. For pLa1, the 5′ noncoding region of La1 was amplified by PCR using polyadenosine-containing RNA isolated from HeLa cells and oligo primers C and D, containing EcoRI andNcoI sites in the 5′ and 3′ gene-specific primers, respectively. The amplified DNA was digested with EcoRI andNcoI and inserted into pΔEMCV between the ΔEMCV and firefly luciferase at the EcoRI and NcoI sites.

HeLa cells were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid DNA and 12 μg of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's directions.Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were assayed 24 h later using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was harvested from U937, Daudi, Jurkat, and NKL-32 cells using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's directions. Cytoplasmic RNA was harvested from HeLa cells 48 h after transfection by lysing cells in 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 mNaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 0.1 mmEDTA. Polyadenosine-containing (pA+) RNA was isolated using OligotexTM (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Polysome-associated RNA was isolated as described previously (38Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA. 1998; 4: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Total and pA+ RNA were separated in 1% agarose gels in the presence of formaldehyde and MOPS buffer (39Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Smith, J. A., Seidman, J. G., and Struhe, K.

The Northern blots were hybridized in ExpressHyb (CLONTECH) to radiolabeled DNA probes corresponding to La1′ (nucleotides 250–483), to La1 (nucleotides 116–693), or to a 632-base pair fragment of firefly luciferase, generated using the RadPrime kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The autoradiographs were scanned using a Microtek ScanMaker E6, and the resulting images were labeled using Adobe Photoshop, version 3.0. Uncapped RNAs were synthesized using 5 μg of pRΔEF, T7EMCV, or T7La1 linearized with BamHI or T7La1′ linearized with SalI as templates. Briefly, the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in transcription buffer (80 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 12 mmMgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 40 mmdithiothreitol), 100 units of RNasin, 40 mm NTPs, 2.5 units of yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma), and 10 μg/ml T7 RNA polymerase (gift from B. Burnett, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center). Capped RNAs were synthesized in similar reactions except 1.5 mm7mGTP (New England Biolabs) was added to the reaction, and the concentration of GTP was reduced to 0.3 mm. Subsequently, the reactions were incubated with 3 units of DNase RQ1 at 37 °C for 20 min. After extraction with phenol/chloroform and precipitation with ethanol, RNA was resuspended in H2O and fractionated through a G25 Sephadex column to remove unincorporated nucleotides. The integrity of the RNAs was monitored by electrophoresis in agarose gels, and the amount of full-length RNA in each band was determined by comparison with known amount of marker RNA of similar length. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) was incubated with 5 ng of in vitro synthesized RNA at 30 °C for 45 min according to manufacturer's directions. HeLa translation lysates (15% v/v) (24McBratney S. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3523-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were incubated with 100 ng ofin vitro synthesized RNA at 30 °C for 45 min. The reactions were stopped by placing on ice, and Renilla and firefly luciferase activity was assayed as described above. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis (30Troster H. Metzger T.E. Semsei I.

Med. 1994; 180: 2059-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and transient transfection experiments followed by in situ hybridization (40Hilker M. Troster H. Grolz D. Hake U. Bachmann M. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 284: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 41Grolz D. Troster H. Semsei I. Bachmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 278-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) have indicated that the La autoantigen could potentially be expressed from at least two promoters. The first promoter is predicted to direct the synthesis of a 1.9-kb transcript (La1) that contains noncoding exon 1 linked to coding exons 2–11 (Fig.1 A). The 5′ NCR of the La1 transcript is 115 nucleotides in length with a 61% GC content (Fig.1 B). The second promoter, located in the first intron of La1, is predicted to synthesize a 2.3-kb transcript that starts with noncoding exon 1′ linked to coding exons 2–11 (Fig. 1 B). The 5′ NCR of the La1′ transcript is 483 nucleotides in length, has a 73% GC content, and contains three upstream AUG codons that precede short open reading frames (Fig. 1 B). In addition, the La1′ leader contains a stretch of 23 uridine residues, designated as polypyrimidine tract (PPT) in Fig. 1 B, which are located in the middle of noncoding exon 1′. Thus, the La1 and La1′ transcripts produce RNAs with different 5′ NCRs linked to same coding and 3′ noncoding regions. To test whether these predicted transcripts are found in cells, the expression and distribution of natural La1 and La1′ transcripts in human tissue was examined. A nitrocellulose blot containing polyadenylated RNAs, isolated from various human tissues and separated by size, was hybridized with radiolabeled DNA complementary to the La coding region. This labeled DNA should hybridize to both La1′ and La1 transcripts. Fig. 2 shows that the 1.9-kb La1 transcript was expressed in many human tissues (Fig. 2, top panel). La1 transcripts was ubiquitous in both adult and fetal human tissues, with highest levels in spleen, prostate, testis, ovary, heart, and brain and lowest levels in thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL), lung, and liver. Some of the tissues revealed the presence of slightly larger transcripts. To determine whether those signals identified La1′ transcripts, the blot was rehybridized to DNA probes specific for La1′ transcripts (Fig. 2, middle panel) or to control β-actin mRNA (Fig. 2, bottom panel). This analysis revealed that the presence of La1′ transcripts in most tissues were the highest in the PBL and spleen. Because the spleen is infiltrated by PBL, it was possible that the signal from the spleen reflected infiltrated PBL. In any case, the hybridization signals in Fig. 2 suggest that natural La1′ transcripts can be detected in specific human tissues. Next, the cell population in the PBL that expressed La1′ transcripts was identified. PBL represent a mixed population of cell types (42Janeway C.A. Travers P. Immunobiology. Garland Publishing Inc., London1997: 1-30Google Scholar). To begin to investigate which cell types contribute to the expression of La1′ transcripts, total RNA was isolated from cell clones representing monocytes (U937), B cells (Daudi), T cells (Jurkat), and natural killer cells (NKL-32). RNA samples were separated in denaturing agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose blots, and hybridized to radiolabeled DNA complementary to the coding region of La1 and La1′. Fig. 3 shows that La1 transcripts were expressed in all four cell types. In contrast, La1′ transcripts were expressed in Daudi, Jurkat, and NKL-32 cells but not detectably in U937 cells. When B and T cells encounter an antigen in the presence of stimulated T helper cells, they begin to proliferate to secrete antibodies or to produce cytokines, respectively. This activation step can be chemically induced by treating the cells with mitogens such as PMA and ionomycin (36Qiu D. Zhao G. Aoki Y. Shi L. Uyei A. Nazarian S. Ng J.C. Kao P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13443-13450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 43Weiss A. Imboden J.B. Adv Immunol. 1987; 41: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To determine whether the steady state levels of La1 and La1′ transcripts in B and T cells were affected by activation, total RNA was isolated from Daudi and Jurkat cells treated with PMA and ionomycin. The steady state levels of La1 and La1′ transcripts in nonactivated and activated cells were then compared by Northern analysis (Fig. 3). After mitogenic activation, the amount of La1′ was reduced in Daudi cells, whereas the amount of La1 was decreased by approximately 50% in Jurkat cells. The changes in La1 and La1′ transcripts were likely due to altered transcriptional activities of the La promoters, because the turnover rates of La1 and La1′ transcripts did not change significantly after mitogenic stimulation. 2M. S. Carter and P. S. Sarnow, unpublished observation. In addition, the levels of La1′ were comparable in activated Jurkat cells and in NK-32 cells. These findings suggest that La1 and La1′ transcripts could have distinct roles in cells of the immune system. The presence of La1′ transcripts in certain human cells does not necessarily imply that these RNAs are functional mRNAs that direct the synthesis of La protein. Although previous work has shown that transfected La1′ cDNAs were capable expressing translatable La1′ mRNA (45Grolz D. Laubinger J. Wilmer F. Troster H. Bachmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12076-12082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it remains to be determined whether natural La1′ mRNAs that are likely to be present at much lower levels in the cell are translated. To test whether natural La1′ transcripts were associated with polysome, cytoplasmic extracts prepared from NKL-32 cells were fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Fig.4 shows the separation of 40 S (fraction 4), 60 S (fraction 5), 80 S (fraction 6), and polysomal RNA-containing fractions 7–10. The fractionation of La1 and La1′ transcripts was monitored by Northern blot analysis with probes specific for each transcript. Fig. 4 shows that the La1 transcripts co-sedimented with the heaviest polysomal fractions, present in fractions 9 and 10. In contrast, La1′ transcripts predominantly sedimented with the lighter polysomal fractions 7 and 8. In control gradients containing 15 mm EDTA, which dissociates ribosome-RNA complexes (38Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA. 1998; 4: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 46Calzone F.J. Angerer R.C. Gorovsky M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 2145-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), both La1 and La1′ transcripts sedimented with the nonpolysomal fractions 3 and 4.2 Although there are few examples of association of nontranslatable RNAs with polysomes (47Krichevsky A.M. Metzer E. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14295-14305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), these results suggest that natural La1′ transcripts are translated within cells, even at the low concentration at which they are naturally expressed. The faster sedimentation rate of La1 mRNAs compared with La1′ mRNAs suggests, however, that La1 mRNAs are translated more efficiently in NKL-32 cells. The location of La1′ mRNAs in fractions 7 and 8 indicates that the 2.3-kb mRNAs are associated with approximately 3–5 ribosomes each, whereas substantially more ribosomes are present on each La1 mRNA molecule (Fig. 4). Whether this apparent difference in translational efficiency reflects a different mode of translational initiation by La1 and La1′ mRNA was examined next. The high GC content of the 5′ NCRs of both La transcripts and the multiple upstream AUG codons in the La1′ mRNA suggest that cap-dependent scanning may be an inefficient means of translational initiation for these mRNAs (48Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). To test whether the La leaders can mediate translation initiation by internal initiation (49Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA. 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar), vectors were constructed that can direct the expression of dicistronic mRNAs containing the coding region forRenilla and firefly luciferase as the first and second cistron, respectively (Fig.5 A). Expression ofRenilla luciferase provides an internal control for the steady state concentrations of the dicistronic RNAs. To block expression of firefly luciferase by ribosomes that failed to terminate at the Renilla stop codon, a landscape of RNA secondary structures, designated Δ (see “Experimental Procedures”), was inserted between the two cistrons. Transfection of Δ-containing constructs into HeLa cells resulted in low expression of firefly luciferase from the second cistron (Fig. 5 B, construct A). However, insertion of the 5′ NCR of La1′ between the Δ element and the second cistron (Fig. 5 B, construct B) resulted in a 10-fold increase in firefly luciferase expression. Surprisingly, insertion of the 5′ NCR of La1 also resulted in a similar increase in synthesis of firefly luciferase (Fig.5 B, construct C). Northern analysis showed that the dicistronic mRNA, expressed in transfected cells, remained largely intact (Fig. 5 C). A possible caveat to these experiments, however, is that the increase in synthesis of firefly luciferase from RNAs shown in constructs B and C was the result of small amounts of functionally monocistronic transcripts generated by nuclease activity, cryptic splicing, or expression of an unknown promoter in the 5′ NCRs of La1′ or La1. To examine these concerns, dicistronic mRNAs, such as those shown in Fig. 5, were transcribedin vitro by T7 RNA polymerase, and their translational efficiencies were examined in RRL and in HeLa cell extracts (50Iizuka N. Najita L. Franzusoff A. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7322-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Fig.6 shows the 5′ NCRs of La1′ (construct B) and La1 (construct C) increased the translation of the second cistron in both the RRL and in HeLa extract compared with the control construct A. Thus, evidence for translation of the second cistron was obtained in cultured HeLa cells, HeLa extracts, and from RRL. In addition, the turnover rate of functional dicistronic mRNAs was the same for each mRNA in the in vitro translation systems.2These findings suggest that it is unlikely that nuclease activities, splicing,"
https://openalex.org/W1966805276,"Abstract The extracytoplasmic folding of secreted proteins in Gram-positive bacteria is influenced by the microenvironment of the compartment into which they are translocated, namely the negatively charged matrix of the cell wall polymers. In this compartment, the PrsA lipoprotein facilitates correct post-translocational folding or prevents misfolding of secreted proteins. In this study, a secretion mutant of B. subtilis (prsA3) encoding a defective PrsA protein was mutagenized and screened for restored secretion of the AmyQ α-amylase. One mini-Tn10 insertion, which partially suppressed the secretion deficiency, was found to interrupt dlt, the operon involved in thed-alanylation of teichoic acids. The inactivation ofdlt rescued the mutant PrsA3 protein from degradation, and the increased amount of PrsA3 was shown to enhance the secretion of PrsA-dependent proteins. Heterologous or abnormal secreted proteins, which are prone to degradation after translocation, were also stabilized and secreted in increased quantities from a dlt prsA + strain. Furthermore, the dltmutation partially suppressed the lethal effect of PrsA depletion, suggesting that the dlt deficiency also leads to stabilization of an essential cell wall protein(s). Our results suggest that main influence of the increased net negative charge of the wall caused by the absence of d-alanine is to increase the rate of post-translocational folding of exported proteins."

This process is initiated by photoisomerization of a covalently linked chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, to all-trans-retinal, which forces a conformational change in G protein-coupled receptors of cone (cone pigments) and rod (rhodopsin) cells. This tightly regulated chain of enzymatic reactions that amplify and shape the signal also have built-in mechanisms that lead to the restoration of pre-bleach conditions. The amplification and restoration reactions, collectively termed phototransduction, are well understood at the molecular level (1Pugh Jr., E.N. Lamb T.D.

The current regenerative model first involves the reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol in photoreceptor cells. All-trans-retinol is transported to adjacent retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE),1 where it is stored in the form of insoluble retinyl esters, isomerized to 11-cis-retinol by an as yet unclear mechanism, oxidized to 11-cis-retinal by multiple RDH activities, and transported back to photoreceptor cells where it is reintroduced into empty opsin and cone photopigments (reviewed in Ref. 16Rattner A. Sun H. Nathans J. Annu Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 89-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Among these reactions, at least three steps display isomeric specificity: reduction of all-trans-retinal with respect to both dinucleotide and retinal substrates (see Fig. 1 A, forward), oxidation of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal also with respect to both dinucleotide and retinol substrates (Fig.1 A, reverse), and isomerization, which could occur with inversion or retention of configuration at the prochiral methylene hydroxyl group (Fig. 1 B). Law et al. (17Law W.C. Kim S. Rando R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 793-795Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) first reported on the stereospecificity of the retinoid cycle in the retina/RPE. The reduction of all-trans-retinal was asserted to be of pro-Rselective, whereas reduction of 11-cis-retinal hadpro-S specificity in terms of the dinucleotide NADH. With respect to the retinol specificity at the prochiral C15methylene hydroxyl group, it was proposed that all-trans-RDH was pro-R-specific, whereas 11-cis-RDH waspro-S-specific (18Law W.C. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4147-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, it was later determined that ROS all-trans-RDH was an NADPH-specific enzyme (19Palczewski K. Jager S. Buczylko J. Crouch R.K. Bredberg D.L. Hofmann K.P. Asson-Batres M.A. Saari J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13741-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and was almost completely unresponsive to NADH used in these original assays. The isomerization of all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol was proposed to occur with the inversion of configuration at the C15 carbon. Yet, production of 11-cis-retinol was very low in these early experiments (20Deigner P.S. Law W.C. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Science. 1989; 244: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), as compared with more recent studies (21Winston A. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2044-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Stecher H. Palczewski K. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 330-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Stecher H. Gelb M.H.

Because of these problems, the uncertainty in the elucidation of the stereospecificity of all-trans-RDH, and the complexity of activities involved in 11-cis-retinol oxidation, the conclusions of these studies were tentative. In this report, we present multiple analyses of the isomeric specificities of retinoid cycle reactions in the vertebrate retina. For reduction, all-trans-retinal is a highly preferential substrate for expressed photoreceptor all-trans-RDH (prRDH), with a minor utilization of 9-cis-retinal. Interestingly, despite the fact that prRDH is a member of SCAD, this RDH producespro-R-all-trans-retinol, and yet exclusively utilizes pro-S-NADPH. All-trans-RDH in ROS exhibits the same property, and these results, in addition to other biochemical findings (24Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11034-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), suggest that the main all-trans-RDH in ROS is prRDH. In RPE, we found that the redox reactions are mostly pro-S-specific for both 11-cis-retinol and NAD(P)H substrates. This is consistent with the idea that members of SCAD, including 11-cis-RDH, predominantly catalyze these reactions. However, pro-Ractivities could also be easily detected, suggesting a redundant pathway of 11-cis-retinol oxidation. Finally, the isomerization of all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol is catalyzed with the inversion of the configuration on the C15 carbon. These studies will have important implications in the identification of enzymes involved in retinoid metabolism in the vertebrate eye and also on the mechanisms by which the eye-specific 11-cis-retinal is produced. Fresh bovine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse (Schenk Packing Co., Inc., Stanwood, WA). ROS membranes were isolated from bovine retina using the sucrose gradient centrifugation method (25Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Apo-CRALBP was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified using Ni2+ column chromatography (26Crabb J.W. Chen Y. Goldflam S. West K. Kapron J. Redfern C.P.F.

Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar). To destroy endogenous retinoids, RPE microsomes were irradiated in a quartz cuvette (200-μl aliquots) for 5 min at 0 °C using a ChromatoUVE transilluminator (model TM-15 from UVP, Inc.) (20Deigner P.S. Law W.C. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Science. 1989; 244: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Stecher H. Palczewski K. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 330-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH; Sigma/Aldrich) was purified on a Mono Q column equilibrated with 10 mm BTP, pH 7.3, using a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl over 60 min at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The HLADH fraction (eluted at 1–3 min, 0.6 mg/ml) containing the highest dehydrogenase activity when assayed with pro-R-[4-3H]NADH and all-trans-retinal or 11-cis-retinal (see below) was used in further studies. l-Glutamic dehydrogenase (Sigma/Aldrich) was dialyzed against 10 mm BTP, pH 7.3, 0.1m NaCl before use. Human 11-cis-RDH was amplified by PCR from a human eye cup cDNA library (obtained from Donald Zack, John Hopkins University) with primers FH329 (5′-TCTAGAGCTATGTGGCTGCCTCTTC-3′) and FH330 (5′-CTCGAGTCAGTAGACTGCTTGGGCA-3′) through 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2 min and cloned in pCRII-TOPO vector. A His6 tag was added by PCR on pCRII-11-cis-RDH plasmid using primers FH329 and FH331 (5′-CTCGAGTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTAGACTGCTTGGGCAGGC-3′) through 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2 min. All PCR products were cloned in pCRII-TOPO vector and sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The coding sequence of human 11-cis-RDH-His6 was then transferred as a fragment XbaI-XhoI between the sitesXbaI and XhoI of pFastBac1 expression vector (Bac-to-Bac system, Life Technologies, Inc.). The expression cassette was then transferred into the baculovirus shuttle vector by transposition. Sf9 insect cells were transfected with the recombinant bacmid using the cationic liposome-mediated transfection (CellFECTIN reagent, Life Technologies, Inc.). The expression of recombinant proteins was tested 3 days after infection. Expression of 11-cis-RDH in HEK293 cells was obtained using recombinant baculovirus constructed using the same Bac-to-Bac expression system. A fragment BglII-XhoI from the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) covering the pCMV promoter was first cloned between the sites SnaBI and BamHI of pFastBac, to replace the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter with the cytomegalovirus promoter, giving the vector pFastCMV. The 18-amino acid truncated 11-cis-RDH-His6 was amplified by PCR on pCRII-11-cis-RDH plasmid with primers FH336 (5′-GCTATGAGGGACCGGCAGAGCCTG-3′) and FH331. The coding sequence of human 11-cis-RDH-His6 and the 18-amino acid truncated 11-cis-RDH were then transferred as a fragment EcoRI-EcoRI in the EcoRI site of pFastCMV expression vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant baculoviruses were generated as described above. After amplification, the recombinant baculoviruses were concentrated by centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. HEK293 were then infected with the concentrated recombinant baculoviruses, and the expression of recombinant proteins was tested 1 day after infection. Human prRDH 2The expressed human prRDH (20Deigner P.S. Law W.C. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Science. 1989; 244: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) was unstable in Genapol and was inactivated when incubated for 1 h at 40 °C. In similar conditions, ROS enzyme was stable. This stability difference could result from incorrect selection of initiation Met or the lack of specific proteins or modifications that stabilize prRDH. (24Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11034-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR from a human retinal cDNA library with primers FH341 (5′-AACATGGCCGCTGCACCCC-3′) and FH343 (5′-TCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTCTTGGCCGCACCCGC-3′), which adds an His6 tag at the C terminus, through five cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2 min. The PCR product was cloned in pCRII-TOPO vector and sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The coding sequence of human prRDH-His6 was then transferred as a fragment BamHI-XbaI in pFASTBac1 opened BamHI-XbaI. A prRDH recombinant baculovirus was then obtained by transposition in DH10BAC bacteria and amplified after transfection in Sf9 cells. The expression of recombinant proteins was tested 3 days after infection. The enzyme was also expressed in HEK293 cells as described for 11-cis-RDH; however, the expression level was only 5% of that found in Sf9 cells. Pellets of 11-cis-RDH-transfected Sf9 cells were washed twice with 20 mm BTP, pH 7.2, combined (12.5 ml), and resuspended in 12.5 ml of detergent solution (20 mm BTP, pH 7.2, 0.2% Genapol, 300 mm NaCl, 100 μm NAD, 2 mm benzamidine). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 80 min and ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (∼23 ml) was immediately mixed with glycerol (final 10%, v/v) and β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm). 11-cis-RDH was purified by Ni2+ column chromatography using 20 mm BTP, pH 7.2, 200 mm imidazole, 0.1% Genapol, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm NAD, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmbenzamidine as elution buffer. The final concentration of 11-cis-RDH was 22 μg/ml and stored at −80 °C. Dinucleotides were purified on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm BTP, pH 7.3, using a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl over 60 min at a flow rate of either 0.7 or 1 ml/min. Concentrations of NADH and NADPH (pH 7.3) were determined using ε = 6,220 at 340 nm, and concentrations of NAD and NADP (pH 7.3) were determined using ε = 18,000 at 260 nm (28Mercer E.I. Scott T.A. Concise Encyclopedia of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Walter de Gruyter Press, Berlin1997Google Scholar). The 4-3H-labeled NADH and NADPH (50–300 μm) were stored at −20 or −80 °C in their original elution buffers. All reactions involved with retinoids were carried out under dim red light and stored in DMF under argon at −80 °C. Retinoids were purified by normal phase HPLC (Beckman, Ultrasphere-Si, 4.6 × 250 mm) with 10% ethyl acetate/90% hexane at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min using an HP1100 with a diode array detector and HP Chemstation A.06.03 software. The latter feature allowed the online recording of UV spectra and identification of retinoid isomers according to their specific absorption maxima between 250 and 400 nm. The following absorption coefficients (29Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 313-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for isomers of all-trans-retinal and all-trans-retinol in EtoH or hexane: all-trans-retinal, ε = 48,000 at 368 nm; 9-cis-retinal, ε = 36,100 at 373 nm; 11-cis-retinal, ε = 36,100 at 365 nm; 13-cis-retinal, ε = 38,770 at 363 nm; all-trans-retinol, ε = 51,770 at 325 nm; 9-cis-retinol, ε = 42,300 at 323 nm; 11-cis-retinol, ε = 34,320 at 318 nm; and 13-cis-retinol, ε = 48,305 at 328 nm. Synthesis ofpro-S-[4-3H]NAD(P)H were carried out withl-glutamic dehydrogenase,l-[2,3-3H] glutamic acid (NEN Life Science Products), and NAD(P) as described previously (10Cideciyan, A. V., Haeseleer, F., Fariss, R. N., Aleman, T. S., Jang, G. -F., Verlinde, C. L. M. J., Marmor, M. F., Jacobson, S. G., and Palczewski, K.

Jager S. Buczylko J. Crouch R.K. Bredberg D.L. Hofmann K.P. Asson-Batres M.A. Saari J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13741-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The [3H]NADPH mixture (∼144 nmol) was added to a reaction buffer (final volume, 4.8 ml) containing ROS (2 mg of rhodopsin), MES (34 mm, pH 5.5), and all-trans-retinal (600 nmol). After 30 min of incubation at 33 °C, the reaction was stopped with MeOH, the retinoids were extracted with hexane, and the aqueous phase was evaporated. The resulting residue was dissolved in 10 mm BTP, pH 7.3, and the product, [4-3H]NADP, was purified on a Mono Q column. [4-3H]NADP (453 nmol) was then enzymatically reduced withl-glutamic dehydrogenase (300 μl) andl-glutamic acid (8 μmol) in the presence of ADP (300 nmol) at room temperature overnight to yieldpro-R-[4-3H]NADPH. pro-S-[4-3H]NADH (260 nmol) was mixed with 0.5 mg of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma/Aldrich) in 20 mm BTP, pH 7.3, and 12 μmol of freshly prepared aqueous acetaldehyde. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then evaporated to a volume of ∼0.5 ml. The oxidized dinucleotide, [4-3H]NAD, was purified on a Mono Q column. [4-3H]NAD (∼118 nmol) was enzymatically reduced by 400 μl of l-glutamic dehydrogenase and 2.5 μmol ofl-glutamic acid in the presence of 600 nmol of ADP. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature overnight to givepro-R-[4-3H]NADH. To a vial containing 100 μl of 16 mm all-trans-retinal or 11-cis-retinal, 500 μl of 9.6 mm[3H]NaBH4 in DMF (NEN Life Science Products, 520 mCi/mmol) was added. The vial was flushed with flowing argon, capped, and left at room temperature (all-trans-) or on ice (11-cis-) for 30 min with occasional vortexing. The reaction was stopped by adding 750 μl of H2O, and the vial was left opened on ice in a fume hood for several minutes. The product,pro-R,S-[15-3H]all-trans-retinol orpro-R,S-[15-3H]11-cis-retinol, was extracted with hexane and purified by normal phase HPLC. To a 1.5-ml polypropylene tube containing 5 mg of MnO2 in 100 μl of DMF, 253 μl of 3.33 mm pro-R,S-[15-3H]all-trans-retinol orpro-R,S-[15-3H]11-cis-retinol was added. The reaction mixture was flushed with argon, capped, and placed on a mixer at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then chilled on ice and mixed with 300 μl of ice-cold H2O. Retinoids were extracted with hexane and purified by normal phase HPLC. Synthesis of various stereospecific 15-3H-labeled retinols by different dehydrogenases is summarized in Table I.pro-R and pro-S designations were used for 15-3H-labeled retinols produced by HLADH because the stereospecificity of the enzyme is known.

The pooled hexane fractions were evaporated under a stream of argon, and the residue was redissolved in 300 μl of hexane. The sample was then purified by normal phase HPLC, and the 11-cis-retinol fraction was collected and used as a substrate for 11-cis-RDH. Activities of all-trans-RDH in ROS (2 mg of rhodopsin/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mNaCl) and prRDH (2.1 mg of protein/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine) were assayed by monitoring the production of either [15-3H]all-trans-retinol (reduction of retinal) or [4-3H]NADPH (oxidation of retinol) (19Palczewski K.

Radioactivity was measured in 350 μl of the organic phase by scintillation counting. The assay for the reverse reaction (oxidation) was carried out as follows (19Palczewski K. Jager S. Buczylko J.

The reaction mixture (100 μl) included sodium phosphate (final concentration, 80–90 mm; pH 7.5), ROS (8–16 μg rhodopsin) or prRDH (21 μg), DTT (1 mm), bovine serum albumin (30 μm), NADP (300 μm), andpro-R- orpro-S-[15-3H]all-trans-retinol (15–30 μm) added last to initiate the reaction. The reaction was incubated at 33 °C for 30 min and stopped with 400 μl of MeOH and 50 μl of 0.1 m NH2OH. After 6 min at room temperature on a mixer, 150 μl of 1 m NaCl and 400 μl of CH2Cl2 were added. After mixing and centrifuging to separate the phases, the lower phase was removed, and the upper phase was extracted three more times with 400 μl of CH2Cl2. Radioactivity was measured in 400 μl of the upper phase by scintillation counting. Reaction conditions (with 1 mm DTT) were as described for the above phase partition assay (reduction). Reactions were quenched with 400 μl of MeOH, 50 μl of 1m NaCl, and 500 μl of hexane. After mixing and separating phases, 400 μl of the upper phase was removed and dried down by a stream of argon. The residue was dissolved in 120 μl of hexane, and 100-μl aliquots of the hexane solution were analyzed by normal phase HPLC. The corresponding retinol fraction was collected and subjected to scintillation counting. The assay for 11-cis-RDH activity was similar to that for all-trans-RDH. The reduction assay (100 μl) for the production of [15-3H]11-cis-retinol included MES (final concentration, 50–90 mm; pH 5.5),pro-R- or pro-S-[4-3H]NADH (15–41 μm), or pro-S-[4-3H]NADPH (15–41 μm), 11-cis-RDH (0.1–0.2 μg) or RPE (10–20 μg), and 1 μl of 11-cis-retinal (1.2–66 μm) substrate stock added last to initiate the reaction. The reaction was incubated at 33 °C for 5–10 min and analyzed as above. Assays for all-trans-retinal, 9-cis-retinal, or 13-cis-retinal were carried out in the same way. The oxidation assay (100 μl) for the production of [4-3H]NADH included sodium phosphate (final concentration, 80–90 mm; pH 7.5), 11-cis-RDH (0.2 μg) or RPE (40 μg), DTT (1 mm), bovine serum albumin (30 μm), NAD (300 μm), andpro-R- orpro-S-[15-3H]11-cis-retinol (15–30 μm) added last to initiate the reaction. The assay was incubated at 33 °C for 30–35 min and analyzed as above. HLADH activit"

Proteins encoded by nonclustered homeobox genes have been shown to be essential for cell lineage differentiation and gene expression in pancreatic islets. Using specific antiserum in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and in vitro transcribed/translated proteins, the nuclear proteins binding domain B of the G3 enhancer-like element of the glucagon gene were identified in the present study as heterodimers consisting of the ubiquitously expressed homeodomain protein Prep1 and the also widely expressed PBC homeoprotein Pbx (isoform 1a, 1b, or 2). These heterodimeric complexes were found to bind also to the glucagon cAMP response element and to a newly identified element termed G5 (from −169 to −140). Whereas the expression of Prep1 or Pbx forms alone had no effect, coexpression of Pbx1a/1b-Prep1 inhibited the glucagon promoter when activated by cotransfected Pax6 or another transcription factor in non-glucagon-producing cells. In contrast, in glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cells, Pbx-Prep1 had no effect on GAL4-Pax6-induced mutant glucagon promoter activity or on Pax6-dependent wild-type glucagon promoter activity. Furthermore, 5′-deletion of G5 enhanced glucagon promoter activity in a non-glucagon-producing cell line but not in glucagon-producing islet cells. This study thus identifies a novel target and Hox-independent function of Pbx-Prep1 heterodimers that, through repression of glucagon gene transcription in non-glucagon-producing cells, may help to establish islet cell-specific expression of the glucagon gene.

Homeodomain proteins of the HOM/Hox gene clusters in Drosophila and vertebrates are critical regulators of cell fate and segment identity, differentiation, and cellular transformation during early development (1Gehring W.J.

Also, the nonclustered homeobox genes play critical roles in directing and maintaining cellular differentiation in many organs, including the pancreatic islets. The pancreatic islets of Langerhans are composed of four different cell types, α-, β-, δ-, and pancreatic polypeptide cells, which produce the hormones glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide, respectively (4Slack J.M.W.

Phenotypic analysis of null mutant mice bearing targeted disruptions of homeobox genes established an essential role for homeodomain factors in pancreas organogenesis, including the homeodomain proteins Pdx1, Hlxb9, and Nkx2.2, the LIM-homeodomain protein lsl-1, and the paired homeodomain proteins Pax4 and Pax6 (6Ahlgren U.

These proteins are also expressed in the adult pancreas, and it is becoming clear that most homeodomain proteins possess early functions involved in the differentiation of the various islet cell types as well as late functions involved in maintenance, function, and the optimal expression of hormone genes in mature islet cells (15Sander M.

Glucagon is a functional antagonist of insulin. It raises blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis (5Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J.

The glucagon gene is expressed early in development at embryonic day 9.5 in the mouse, concomitantly with the appearance of the dorsal pancreatic bud (4Slack J.M.W. Development. 1995; 121: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α-cell specificity of glucagon gene expression is conferred by the 5′-flanking region of the glucagon gene (18Drucker D.J.

Thus, homeodomain proteins binding to the glucagon gene seem to play a bivalent role as cell lineage-determining factors during embryonic islet cell differentiation and as transcriptional regulators critically involved in the maintenance of α-cell-specific cellular phenotype and glucagon gene transcription in the adult islet. In this study, the nuclear proteins binding to domain B of the G3 enhancer-like element of the glucagon gene are molecularly identified as heterodimers consisting of Pbx1/2, which are members of the PBC family of homeodomain proteins, and Prep1, which is related to theDrosophila HTH and vertebrate Meis homeodomain proteins. Pbx-Prep1 act as transcriptional repressors of glucagon gene transcription in non-glucagon-producing cells but not in glucagon-expressing pancreatic islet cells. These proteins have previously been shown to form complexes with various Hox proteins and thereby play important roles in regulating the specific activity of homeotic selector proteins (35Mann R.S. Affolter M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).

Chem., in press. To construct the plasmid −350(mutG3B)GluLuc base pairs −240 to −245 of the glucagon promoter within −350GluLuc were replaced by anEcoRI restriction site using a commercial PCR kit (Taq PCR Core Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Two fragments were obtained by using −350GluLuc as PCR template in combination with the following primer pairs (recognition sites of the indicated restriction enzyme are underlined): primer pair 1, upstream primer 5′-CGTACTCGAGATGGCCAAATAGCACATCAAGG-3′ (XhoI) and downstream primer 5′-CGGGAATTCTCTCAGTCAGGCGTGAAAAAC-3′ (EcoRI); primer pair 2, upstream primer 5-CGGGAATTCGGTGTATTTCAAACTACCCTT-3′ (EcoRI), downstream primer 5′-GTAGATCTAGACAGGTGGAGCTCCTTTGG-3′ (BglII). PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with an annealing temperature of 70 °C, respectively. PCR products were gel-purified, digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes, and cloned into theXhoI–BglII sites of pXP2 (45Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). Expression vector pBK-Pbx1a was constructed by inserting an EcoRI fragment of pSP65-Pbx1a (46Monica K. Galili N. Nourse J. Saltman D. Cleary M. Mol. Cell.

According to manufacturer's instructions,lac promoter sequences of pBK-CMV were excised bySpeI/NheI restriction enzyme digestion, and the linear vector was religated in order to get optimized eucaryotic expression of Pbx1a under control of a CMV promoter. All constructs were sequenced by the enzymatic method to confirm the identity and the orientation of the inserts. JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells (47Kohler P.O. Bridson W.E. J. Clin.

JEG-3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (3 μg of indicator plasmid/6-cm dish), and αTC2 and InR1-G9 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (2 μg of indicator plasmid/6-cm dish). Where indicated, expression plasmid pBAT14-Pax6 (12 or 23 ng/6-cm dish), pGAL4-Pax6 (900 ng/6-cm dish), pCMV-HNF-3β (12 ng/6-cm dish), pSG5c-ets1p68 (750 ng/6-cm dish), pSG5-Prep1 (750 or 2250 ng/6-cm dish), pSG5-Pbx1b (1 μg/6-cm dish), or pBK-Pbx1a (23 or 75 ng/6-cm dish) was cotransfected. These cotransfections were done with a constant DNA concentration, which was maintained by adding Bluescript (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). The transfection efficiency and possible unspecific squelching effects were checked by cotransfection of pGFPtpz-cmv[R] vector (Canberra-Packard, Dreieich, Germany) encoding a green fluorescent protein mutant (50 or 500 ng/6-cm dish). Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection, and the luciferase assay was performed as described previously (39Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence signals were determined by using 50 μl of cell extract per well in a 96-well microplate (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany), which was analyzed in a Fluorocount fluorometer (Canberra-Packard) equipped with a 485-nm (excitation)/530-nm (emission) filter pair. Nuclear extracts were prepared from αTC2 cells by the method of Dignam et al. (50Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) with the modification that after the chromatin extraction step an ammonium sulfate (0.3 g/ml) precipitation was included to concentrate proteins before dialysis. For use in in vitro transcription/translation reactions, the following cDNA constructs under the control of the SP6 or T7 promoter were used: pSP65-Pbx1a, pSP64-Pbx2, pSP65-Pbx3a (46Monica K. Galili N. Nourse J. Saltman D. Cleary M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), pSG5-Prep1, pSG5-Pbx1b (43Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Ferreti E. Mavilio F.

The cDNA expression vectors were transcribed and translatedin vitro using the TNT coupled transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, including SP6 or T7 polymerase and [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmids were added either alone (1 μg of plasmid/reaction) or co-translated by mixing 750 ng of pSG5-Prep1 and 1000 ng of Pbx-encoding plasmids/reaction. Translation products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized with a Fuji PhosphorImager. Synthetic complementary oligonucleotides with 5′-GATC overhangs were annealed and labeled by a fill-in reaction with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN, Eschwege, Germany) and Klenow enzyme. Nuclear extracts (20 μg of protein) or 2 μl of reticulocyte lysate were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor and with specific competitors, if indicated, in 20 μl (total volume) of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 140 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol for 10 min on ice. The assay was then performed as described (29Knepel W. Jepeal L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8725-8735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some binding reactions, specific antibodies to various homeodomain proteins were used. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μl of antibody in 20 μl (total volume) of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol for 30 min at room temperature. Following a 10-min incubation on ice with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), the labeled oligodeoxynucleotides were added, and the assay was then performed as described (29Knepel W. Jepeal L. Habener J.F. J. Biol.

Antibodies against Prep1 and Pbx proteins were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Heidelberg, Germany). The antibodies αPbx1, αPbx2, and αPbx3 are directed against isoform-specific N-terminal parts of the corresponding protein; αPbx1 and αPbx3 thereby simultaneously recognize the long and short splice variants 1a/1b and 3a/3b, respectively. αPbx1/2/3 specifically detects a C-terminal peptide common to long Pbx1a, Pbx2, and Pbx3a isoforms. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from αTC2 cells using a commercial kit (Fast Track 2.0TM; Invitrogen). The quality of the RNA was assessed by electrophoresis in a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel. RT-PCR was performed using a rTth DNA polymerase-including commercial kit (Gene AmpTMThermostable rTth Reverse Transcriptase RNA PCR Kit, Roche Molecular Systems) with primers as follows: primer pair Prep1, upstream primer 5′-AAGATCTCAGCATCTTGC-3′ and downstream primer 5′-TGTTGACTTGGAGTAGTGTC-3′ (size of the expected product: 183 bp); primer pair Pbx1, upstream primer 5′-CACTGCTACCAATGTGTC-3′ and downstream primer 5′-TCCATCACTGTATCCTCC-3′ (size of the expected products: 229 bp (Pbx1a) and 116 bp (Pbx1b)); primer pair Pbx2, upstream primer 5′-GCCACAGCCGCACCAGCTCC-3′ and downstream primer 5′-CCTTAGAGGCCCCATTCTTCC-3′ (size of the expected product: 503 bp) (46Monica K. Galili N. Nourse J. Saltman D. Cleary M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar); primer pair Pbx3, upstream primer 5′-GCACACGCAGTAGCAGCAGC-3′ and downstream primer 5′-TGTGGCCAGAGATTAGTTAG-3′ (size of the expected products: 381 bp (Pbx3a) and 269 bp (Pbx3b)) (46Monica K. Galili N. Nourse J. Saltman D. Cleary M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The PCRs were conducted as follows: 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles. Control for DNA contamination was performed by omitting the reverse transcriptase step in parallel samples. After agarose gel electrophoresis, the products obtained were verified by extraction, subcloning (pCR® 2.1, Invitrogen), and cycle sequencing (Thermo sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; IRD-800 labeled primers, MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany)). Healthy tissue of a partially inflamed human pancreas was formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and cut into 2-μm-thick sections. Prior to incubation with primary antibodies, sections to be stained were placed in 10 mm citrate buffer at pH 6.0 and irradiated by microwaves at 750 W for 15 min. Every 5 min, evaporated citrate buffer was replaced by fresh buffer. Subsequently, sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with antibodies against glucagon (α-glucagon), Prep1 (αPrep1), or Pbx1a, -2, and -3a (αPbx1/2/3) at a dilution of 1:10. Unbound primary antibodies were then rinsed off with Tris, pH 7.4, before being stained with a commercial ChemMate kit (Dako, Hamburg, Germany). The slides were then rinsed with water and counterstained with hematoxylin for 2 min at room temperature. Finally, slides were rinsed again with water and coverslipped. For a negative control, incubation with the primary antibody was omitted. G3B-binding proteins (G3B-BP) have been characterized in nuclear extracts from various islet cell lines as well as non-islet cells. In the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, G3B-BPs typically form two protein complexes with slightly different mobilities (29Knepel W. Jepeal L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8725-8735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Knepel W. Vallejo M. Chafitz J.A. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Their binding to a labeled G3B probe is competed by an oligonucleotide containing a winged helix protein binding site from the transthyretin promoter (TTR-HNF3) (36Diedrich T. Fürstenau U. Knepel W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Using mRNA from pancreatic islet cells (αTC2, InR1-G9, HIT, or mouse islets) and a pair of degenerate primers targeting highly conserved sequences within the winged helix DNA binding domain (57Clevidence D.E. Overdier D.G. Tao W. Qian X. Pani L. Lai E. Costa R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3948-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), cDNAs encoding the members of the winged helix family of transcription factors HNF-3β, HNF-3γ, ILF, MNF, and FKH4 were obtained by RT-PCR. After expression in bacteria, these proteins did not bind G3B in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (data not shown), suggesting that the nuclear G3B-BPs may belong to a different class of DNA-binding proteins. Sequence comparison reveals that the sequence of domain B of the glucagon G3 element is similar to known DNA-binding sites of three families of interacting homeodomain proteins, the Hox, PBC, and HTH/Meis/Prep1 families of homeoproteins (Fig. 1) (35Mann R.S. Affolter M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, an oligonucleotide (PbxHoxCon), containing a consensus binding site (Pbx-responsive sequence) for Pbx-Hox or Pbx-Prep1 heterodimers (52Lu Q. Wright D.D. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3938-3948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), competed for the binding of G3B-BPs to labeled G3B in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. It did so with higher potency than TTR-HNF3 (Fig.2 A). To test more directly whether nuclear G3B-BPs contain homeodomain proteins, specific antibodies were used. The Pbx proteins are members of the PBC family of homeodomain proteins and comprise three highly related proteins, Pbx1, -2, and -3, that are encoded by distinct genes. Two forms of Pbx1 and Pbx3, designated a and b, result from differences in splicing in the 3′-portion of their transcripts (46Monica K. Galili N. Nourse J. Saltman D. Cleary M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 58Nourse J. Mellentin J.D. Galili N. Wilkinson J. Stanbridge E. Smith S.D. Cleary M.L.

Cell. 1993; 74: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The alternative b forms of Pbx1 and Pbx3 are C-terminally truncated and thus shorter (about 40 kDa) than Pbx1a, Pbx2, and Pbx3a (all about 50 kDa) (46Monica K. Galili N. Nourse J. Saltman D. Cleary M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6149-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the addition of a Pbx-specific antibody (αPbx1/2/3), which recognizes the 50-kDa Pbx isoforms 1a, 2, and 3a, completely disrupted the binding of the slower migrating G3B-BP complex, whereas the faster migrating complex remained unaffected. This suggests the presence of a long Pbx form within the slower G3B-BP complex (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). In contrast, the binding of nuclear G3B-BPs was not affected by antiserum directed against the homeodomain protein Cdx2 (60James R. Erler T. Kazenwadel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15229-15237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the G3A-binding protein Pax6, which in addition to a paired domain also contains a homeodomain (61Walther C. Gruss P. Development. 1991; 113: 1435-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and7). The mammalian Pbx proteins and their homologue EXD from Drosophila have been shown to bind certain DNA elements cooperatively with other homeodomain proteins including Engrailed-2 (62Peltenburg L.T.C. Murre C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 338"

For the first time a number of M4 family members, also known as thermolysin-like proteases, has been characterized with an identical substrate set and a uniform set of assay conditions. Characterization with peptide substrates as well as high performance liquid chromatography analysis of β-casein digests shows that the M4 family is a homogeneous family in terms of catalysis, even though there is a significant degree of amino acid sequence variation. The results of this study show that differences in substrate specificity within the M4 family do not correlate with overall sequence differences but depend on a small number of identifiable amino acids. Indeed, molecular modeling followed by site-directed mutagenesis of one of the substrate binding pocket residues of the thermolysin-like proteases ofBacillus stearothermophilus converted the catalytic characteristics of this variant into that of thermolysin.

Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998: 350-369Google Scholar) of which thermolysin (TLN; EC 3.4.24.27) is the prototype. The phylogenetic tree for the M4 family is shown in Fig.1 A. The family contains only secreted eubacterial endopeptidases from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative sources. All members of this comprehensive family are produced as pre-pro-proteins. During export the pre-sequence (signal sequence) is cleaved off, whereas the prosequence has been shown to assist in proper folding by acting as a molecular chaperone (2Wetmore D.R. Wong S.-L. Roche R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 747-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the prosequence can act as a specific inhibitor (3Wetmore D.R. Wong S.-L. Roche R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), thus preventing (4O'Donohue M.J. Beaumont A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26477-26481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) unwanted proteolytic activity in the cytoplasm (2Wetmore D.R. Wong S.-L. Roche R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 747-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The mature enzymes are all of moderate size, around 35 kDa (316 amino acids for thermolysin). These proteases contain the typical HEXXH amino acid motif, require Zn2+ions for their activity, and contain multiple Ca2+ ions (up to four) for stability. All enzymes are optimally active at neutral pH (1Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998: 350-369Google Scholar, 5Feder J. Keay L. Garrett L.R. Cirulis N. Moseley M.H. Wildi B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 251: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For several of these enzymes three-dimensional structures are available (6Weaver L.H. Kester W.R. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 7Stark W.

Structure ( Lond. ). 1998; 6: 1185-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In fact, thermolysin was among the first proteins for which the structure was solved. Although considerable sequence diversity exists within this family (Fig. 1 B), there is a high degree of structural conservation. All members for which the structure has been solved were shown to consist of two major domains. The N-terminal domain contains mainly β-sheets, whereas the C-terminal domain predominantly contains α-helices. The active site is located in the cleft between these two domains. In those enzymes of which the structure has been determined, the catalytically essential Zn2+ ion is located at the bottom of this cleft (Fig.2). In a significant number of published structures in which TLN was co-crystallized with inhibitors (6Weaver L.H. Kester W.R. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar,10Gaucher J.F. Selkti M. Tiraboschi G. Roques B.P. Tomas A. Fournié-Zaluski M.-C.

Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2506-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), the residues involved in catalysis could be identified. The family also includes enzymes from pathogens such asLegionella, Listeria, Clostridium,Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, andVibrio. For example, pseudolysin, the TLP fromPseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to cause tissue damage by degrading collagens, elastin, and fibronectin (15Morihara K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 242-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas the TLPs from Listeria sp. appear to be involved in the maturation of specific virulence factors (16Domann E. Leimeister-Wachter M. Goebel W. Chakraborty T. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 65-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the active site organization of M4 peptidases exhibits similarity to those of a number of eukaryotic metallopeptidases, in particular to members of the matrix metalloproteases (17Dhanaraj V. Ye Q.-Z. Johnson L.L. Hupe D.J. Ortwine D.F. Dunbar Jr., J.B. Rubin J.R. Pavlovsky A. Humblet C. Blundell T.L. Drug Des. Discov. 1996; 13: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). These latter enzymes were shown to be involved in a number of important processes in man, including the processing of precursors that play modulation roles in the formation of tumors. In addition, metalloendopeptidases are involved in many cellular processes such as exocytosis, cell-cell fusion, and neuropeptide hydrolysis (18Lennarz W.J. Strittmatter W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Consequently, metalloproteases of the M4 family have attracted increasing attention as model proteins for the development of specific inhibitors that can be applied for disease treatment (19Marie-Claire C. Ruffet E. Antonczak S. Beaumont A. O'Donohue M.J. Roques B.P. Fournié-Zaluski M.-C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13945-13984Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, several members of this protease family are applied in industry, e.g. in baking, brewing, and leather processing (20Rao M.B. Tanksale A.M. Ghatge M.S. Deshpande V.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 597-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thermolysin is being used for the synthesis of the artificial sweetener aspartame (20Rao M.B. Tanksale A.M. Ghatge M.S. Deshpande V.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 597-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have characterized several TLPs of Bacillusand Staphylococcus species. The availability of an impressive amount of sequence, structural, and kinetic data renders this group of proteases an ideal subject for rational design strategies. Although some of the family members have been characterized individually (5Feder J. Keay L. Garrett L.R. Cirulis N. Moseley M.H. Wildi B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 251: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Feder J. Biochemistry. 1968; 6: 2088-2093Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Feder J. Schuck J.M.

Kitayaki M. Takahashi S. Oda K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), a consistent comparison with an identical substrate set and a uniform set of assay conditions has never been conducted. Previously it was suggested that TLPs exhibit a preference for large hydrophobic P1′ residues (Leu or Phe) (1Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998: 350-369Google Scholar, 17Dhanaraj V. Ye Q.-Z. Johnson L.L. Hupe D.J. Ortwine D.F. Dunbar Jr., J.B. Rubin J.R. Pavlovsky A. Humblet C. Blundell T.L. Drug Des.

Biochemistry. 1970; 14: 2784-2791Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that the S1′ pocket is the major determinant of the substrate specificity (21Feder J. Biochemistry. 1968; 6: 2088-2093Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we show that the TLP family is an extremely homogeneous family in terms of catalysis, even though there is a significant degree of sequence variation. Furthermore, we show that existing differences in specificity and activity between two individual members can be canceled by a single amino acid substitution.

Venema G. Proteins. 1992; 14: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The purified TLP-sau of Staphylococcus aureus (29Sabat A. Kosowska K. Poulsen K. Kasprowicz A. Sekowska A. van den Burg B. Travis J. Potempa J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 973-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (aureolysin, EC 3.4.24.29) was kindly provided by Dr. J. Potempa. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the polymerase chain reaction-based mega-primer method, essentially as described by Sarkar and Sommer (30Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers were designed such that mutant clones could be recognized by the appearance or disappearance of an endonuclease restriction site (28Eijsink V.G.H. Vriend G. van der Vinne B. Hazes B. van den Burg B. Venema G. Proteins. 1992; 14: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of mutated fragments of the nprT gene were verified by DNA sequence analysis. A three-dimensional model of TLP-ste was built on the basis of homology with thermolysin (86% sequence identity) using the molecular modeling program WHAT-IF (31Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). The modeling procedures have been described in detail elsewhere (32Vriend G. Eijsink V.G.H. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1993; 7: 367-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because of the high sequence similarity, the model was expected to be sufficiently reliable for prediction and analysis of the effects of most amino acid substitutions (32Vriend G. Eijsink V.G.H. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1993; 7: 367-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33Mosimann S. Meleshko R. James M.N.G. Proteins. 1995; 23: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This has been confirmed by the fact that the model has been used for the successful design of various stabilizing mutations (34Veltman O.R. Vriend G. Hardy F. Mansfeld J. van den Burg B. Venema G.

Production and purification of the enzymes were performed as described earlier (28Eijsink V.G.H. Vriend G. van der Vinne B. Hazes B. van den Burg B. Venema G.

Before determining the kinetic parameters, protease preparations were desalted to 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.3, 5 mm CaCl2, and 20% isopropanol using pre-packed PD-10 gel filtration columns supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Specific activities of the TLPs toward casein were determined according to a method adapted from Fujii et al. (26Fujii M. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Aiba S. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 831-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 0.5 μg of protease was incubated in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 0.8% (w/v) casein and 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 ml of a solution containing 100 mm trichloroacetic acid, pH 3.5. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme activity needed to liberate a quantity of acid-soluble peptide corresponding to an increase inA 275 nm of 0.001/min. The k cat /K m andK m values for furylacryloylated di- and tripeptides of the enzymes were determined at 37 °C in a thermostated Perkin-Elmer Lambda 11 spectrophotometer. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 50 mm Tris, 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 5% Me2SO, 0.5% isopropanol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 100 μm to 2.5 mm substrate, and the reaction was followed by measuring the decrease in absorption at 345 nm (Δε345 = −317m−1·cm−1) (21Feder J. Biochemistry. 1968; 6: 2088-2093Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All substrates were supplied by Bachem. Stock solutions of the furylacryloylated dipeptides 3-(2-furylacryloyl)-l-glycyl-l-leucineamide and 3-(2-furylacryloyl)-l-glycyl-l-phenylamide, and of the furylacryloylated tripeptides 3-(2-furylacryloyl)-l-glycyl-l-leucine-l-alanine and 3-(2-furylacryloyl)-l-glycyl-l-phenylalanine-l-leucine were prepared by dissolving the peptides in Me2SO. The apparent second order rate constantk cat /K m was determined by varying the enzyme concentrations (over a 50-fold range) under pseudo-first-order conditions and measuring the initial activity, essentially according to the method described by Feder (21Feder J. Biochemistry. 1968; 6: 2088-2093Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The K i forN-[α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-oxyhydroxyphosphinyl]-l-leucine-l-tryptophan (phosphoramidon) was determined by a 10-min preincubation of a 0.1 nm protease solution with varying concentrations of the inhibitor (10−8 to 10−3m) in 50 mm Tris and 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.01%Triton X-100. Subsequently, enzyme activity was determined using 100 μm3-(2-furylacryloyl)-l-glycyl-l-leucine-l-alanine as substrate. K i values were calculated by the method described by Hunter and Downs (39Hunter A. Downs C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 157: 427-446Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For the determination of thermal stability, 0.1 μmpurified protease solutions (in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.3, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.5% 2-propanol, and 62.5 mm NaCl) were incubated at various temperatures for 30 min, after which the residual proteolytic activity was determined with casein as a substrate (26Fujii M.

Thermal stability was quantified by T50, being the temperature giving 50% residual activity after a 30-min period of incubation (32Vriend G. Eijsink V.G.H. J. Comput. Aided Mol.

The proteolytic properties of the mutant enzymes toward β-casein (Sigma-Aldrich) were determined by means of HPLC. β -Casein (1 mg ml−1) was incubated in 50 mm Tris and 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100 with each of the TLP variants at a molar ratio of 1,000:1 at 37 °C for 24 h. The peptides resulting from hydrolysis were derivatized with dansyl chloride. The proteolytic products were separated by loading a sample corresponding to 50 μg of β-casein on a reversed phase column (RP-304, Bio-Rad). The mobile phase used was 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. Absorption of the eluting peptides was monitored at 254 nm. To investigate the activity of the various M4 proteases on large protein substrates, the activity toward casein was determined. Casein was selected as a standard substrate for activity measurements because it behaves as a noncompact and largely flexible structure (41Holt C. Sawyer L. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), thus rendering all scissionable motifs accessible to the same extent for the various proteases at all temperatures employed. Indeed, we have shown previously that digestion of β-casein with TLP-ste at different temperatures yielded identical degradation products (42van den Burg B. Vriend G. Veltman O.R. Venema G. Eijsink V.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Table I. Most of the wild-type enzymes show similar specific activities, with a variation of a factor of approximately 3. The major exception is TLP-cer, which is much less active on casein than the other enzymes tested.Table ISpecific activity and thermostability of TLPsSpecific activity 1-aS.D. are less than 10% of the values given.T 50 1-bThe error margin amounts to approximately 0.3 °C.ΔT 50to TLNSequence identity to TLNUnits × 10 −3° C° C%TLP-cer1.468.618.373TLP-ste2973.413.586TLN4286.90.0100TLP-sub4758.628.348TLP-sau8855.131.845TLP-ste F133L5774.912.0861-a S.D. are less than 10% of the values given.1-b The error margin amounts to approximately 0.3 °C. Open table in a new tab To determine the thermal stability and the optimal temperature for catalysis of the various proteases, we determined the T50(43Eijsink V.G.H. Veltman O.R. Aukema W. Vriend G. Venema G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) values and the temperature dependence of activity toward casein. The T50 values are given in Table I. These values correlate well with the temperature optima of the TLPs as shown in Fig.3 in the sense that the most thermally labile protease shows the lowest optimum temperature. To facilitate comparison, the maximum activity of the different TLPs has been normalized to 100%. Between closely related TLPs a correlation exists between the degree of sequence identity and the difference in thermal stability (see Table Ifor a comparison of the sequence identity and the ΔT50values). In all cases, the temperature optimum is just below the T50 value determined, which is a direct result of the experimental procedures: the T50 values were determined with a 30-min incubation period followed by determination of the remaining activity at 37 °C, whereas the temperature optima were determined during a 1-h incubation period at the indicated temperatures. As a consequence, this longer incubation period can be expected to lead to a higher degree of inactivation at the elevated temperatures. Inspection of Fig. 3 shows that the shape of the curve of TLN differs as compared with those of the other TLPs. Of the enzymes tested only TLP-sub and TLN shows Arrhenius behavior; the activity increases exponentially with the temperature. TLP-sau deviates from the other TLPs by showing an unexpectedly broad temperature optimum, suggesting that thermal (in)activation of this protease might differ from that in the other proteases. To determine the P1′ substrate specificity, the activities of the various M4 proteases toward di- and tripeptide substrates were determined. Their activities on dipeptide and tripeptide substrates are shown in TablesII and III, respectively. The results show that both substrates with a Leu as well as with a Phe as P1′ residue are efficiently hydrolyzed by TLPs. As with casein, TLP-cer shows a relatively low activity toward dipeptide substrates. With dipeptide substrates, most TLPs prefer Leu over Phe at the P1′ position, as shown by the Phe/Leu ratio for dipeptides. In contrast, the M4 family is often described as having an equal P1′ preference for Leu and Phe (1Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.

The diversity or similarity in primary amino acid sequence (Fig.1 B) is not reflected in either different or similar cleavage efficiencies for the peptide substrates tested. In fact, the substrate specificity of TLN is much more similar to that of TLP-sub than to that of TLP-ste, contrary to what might be expected on the basis of sequence similarity (45% and 86% identity, respectively). With the exception of TLP-cer, all activities on peptide substrates are less than one order of magnitude different from those of TLN.Table IIActivity of TLPs on dipeptide substrates and inhibition constants for phosphoramidonk cat/K MPhe/Leu ratiok cat/K MK iinhibition phosphoramidon 2-bS.D. are less than 10% of the values given.FaGLa 2-aS.D. are less than 15% of the values given.FaGFa 2-aS.D. are less than 15% of the values given.s −1 · M −1 × 10 −3nmTLP-cer0.640.460.72.1 × 102TLP-ste2.203.401.513 TLN12.253.880.321 TLP-sub3.200.170.16.1 × 103TLP-sau3.475.481.63.0 × 103TLP-ste F133L17.156.310.417 FaGLa, 3-(2-furylacryloyl)-l-glycyl-l-leucine amide; FaGFa, 3-(furylacryloyl)-l-glycyl-l-phenylamide.2-a S.D. are less than 15% of the values given.2-b S.D. are less than 10% of the values given.

In contrast, the inhibition constant for the inhibitor phosphoramidon, which was specifically designed for TLN, seems to correlate with the sequence difference. The TLPs that are phylogenetically close to TLN are much more sensitive to phosphoramidon as compared with those that are more distant. To examine whether differences in substrate specificity can be observed on large peptide substrates, HPLC analyses were performed on β-casein hydrolysates by the various TLPs. Fig. 4shows a detail of the reversed phase HPLC analyses of the peptides that were formed upon digestion of β-casein with the TLPs. A number of characteristic and reproducible products could be identified for each of the TLPs. Although the preference toward the small peptides used showed little variation, differences in the digestion patterns of β-casein are clearly detectable. This illustrates that differences can be much more readily detectable on large protein substrates than on small peptide substrates. The results presented above suggest that differences in substrate specificity between TLP variants are not correlated with overall sequence dissimilarities. To examine whether such differences might be reflected in the structure of the active site and substrate binding pockets, molecular modeling of the active sites of the different variants was employed. For several members of the family (TLN, TLP-cer, TLP-sau, and elastase) high resolution x-ray structures are available. In addition, models have been constructed for TLP-sub and TLP-ste. The latter models have previously been shown extremely useful for identifying structural features involved in thermal stability (32Vriend G. Eijsink V.G.H. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1993; 7: 367-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 42van den Burg B. Vriend G. Veltman O.R. Venema G. Eijsink V.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The fact that the amino acid conservation in and around the active sites is very high suggests that they are structurally similar. We decided to compare the active sites of TLN and TLP-ste in more detail to identify structural features that could explain the observed differences in substrate specificity. The two enzymes are highly similar (86% sequence identity). In particular, in the active site regions the sequence conservation is very high. Therefore, the constructed model for TLP-ste is expected to be highly reliable in this region. Our recent close inspection of the model of TLP-ste and careful comparison with the TLN structures available revealed that one of the major differences between the two TLPs in the active site region concerns residue 133, which is a Leu in TLN but a Phe in TLP-ste. From these studies it is now concluded that the S1′ subsite is composed of the side chains of Phe-130, Phe-133 or Leu-133, Val-139, and Leu-202. Furthermore, inspection of the S1′ pocket and the conformation of the various P1′ side chains in TLN-inhibitor complexes (1TLP.PDB, 1–7TMN.PDB, 4–8TLN.PDB) shows that the P1′ side chain is sandwiched between the 133 and the 202 S1′ residues (Fig.5). It might be anticipated that the large Phe-133 residue in the S1′ pocket will influence the binding of substrates in this specificity-determining pocket to a considerable extent. To test this hypothesis, Phe-133 in TLP-ste was substituted by Leu, and the effects on substrate specificity were determined. As documented in Tables IIand III, the TLP-ste mutant shows enzymatic characteristics on di- and tripeptides that are much more TLN-like than TLP-ste-like. In addition, this mutation almost doubled the activity toward casein (Table I). Furthermore, the reversed phase HPLC patterns obtained with the TLP-ste F133L mutant showed some TLN-specific peaks, whereas some TLP-ste-specific peak continue to be present as well. However, the temperature optimum, the shape of the temperature curve, and the thermal stability of the single mutant remained identical to wild type TLP-ste. The present study shows a correlation between the thermal stability and sequence identity of the various TLPs. This correlation with sequence identity does not exist for the differences in activity and specificity on both peptide substrates and casein. Although differences in specificity on the peptide substrates used are relatively small, HPLC analysis of digestion patterns of β-casein does show specific digestion patterns. The fact that the differences in activity and specificity can be canceled by mutating one amino acid in a substrate binding pocket indicates that a small set of identifiable amino acid residues, not overall sequence differences, is responsible for the differences in performance of these enzymes. The comparison of the thermostability of closely related TLPs showed that a correlation exists between the sequence identity and the difference in thermal stability. However, inspection of Fig. 3 shows that TLP-sub and TLN are the only two enzymes of which the thermal activation shows Arrhenius-like behavior. A previously described hyperstable variant of TLP-ste (42van den Burg B. Vriend G. Veltman O.R. Venema G. Eijsink V.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) does not show this behavior (44van den Burg B. de Kreij A. van der Veek P. Mansfeld J. Venema G. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1999; 30: 35-40PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it seems unlikely that thermal stability underlies this difference between these two and the remainder of the enzymes studied. Rather a process such as hinge bending (45Veltman O.R. Eijsink V.G.H. Vriend G. de Kreij A. Venema G. van den Burg B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5305-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 46van Aalten D.M.F. Amadei A. Linssen A.B.M. Eijsink V.G.H. Vriend G. Berendsen H.J.C. Proteins. 1995; 22: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) could be a more likely cause for the difference between these two sets of enzymes. The comparison of the enzymatic performance, i.e. activity and specificity, of TLPs from Bacilli andStaphylococcus indicates that overall divergence in primary sequence is not correlated with differences in activity and substrate specificity. In contrast, local sequence differences in the active site and binding pockets seem to be responsible for the majority of the differences in activity and substrate specificity. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that both thek cat /K m for the di- and tripeptide substrates differ less than 1 order of magnitude between the various enzymes, with the exception of TLP-cer, and as shown by the TLP-ste F133L mutant, the observation that the activity and substrate specificity of one variant can be changed into that of another by mutating just one binding pocket residue. However, this hypothesis seems to be contradicted by the apparent relation between theK i for phosphoramidon and the sequence difference. This relation can be explained by the fact that the most important residue for phosphoramidon binding is Phe-114 (6Weaver L.H. Kester W.R. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 14Kester W.R. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2506-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 47Matthews B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) present in both TLN and TLP-ste (low K i), whereas the 114 position in TLP-cer, -sub, and -sau is occupied by an Ala (highK i). The similarity in activity and specificity of the various TLPs toward peptide substrates does not exclude the possibility that overall sequence differences can play a role in activity and specificity toward larger proteinaceous substrates. Analysis of the digestion patterns of β-casein indicated that there are clear differences in substrate specificity on protein substrates. However, the mutant TLP-ste F133L, which changes the specificity of TLP-ste to that of TLN on peptide substrates, also changes the digestion pattern on β-casein into a more TLN-like pattern. Although other explanations cannot be excluded, this suggests that the observed differences in specificity are mainly caused by differences in the active site and binding pockets and not by overall sequence differences. The present study is the first example of an approach in which the enzymatic and catalytic properties of a significant number of members of the M4 peptidase family are compared under identical conditions. The need of such a comparison is obvious in view of the roles of members of this family in processes as diverse as pathogenicity and industrial applications. The notion that overall differences in sequence do not correlate with substrate specificity enabled us to modify the substrate specificity by site-directed mutagenesis of those residues directly involved in substrate binding and catalysis. Indeed, a single amino acid substitution converted catalytic characteristics of one family member into that of another. Consequently it can be envisaged that specific inhibitors, for example to be used for blocking disease-related members of the metalloprotease family, can be designed on the basis of amino acid residues identified in TLPs. Thus, this study provides additional arguments for the potential of TLPs as a model system in the search for novel metalloprotease inhibitors. Both for the development of specific inhibitors as well as for the improvement of biocatalysts, a better understanding of existing relations between sequence, structure, and function is of considerable importance."

Ceramide has been suggested to play important roles in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, inflammation, and the regulation of the eukaryotic stress response. Although ceramide can be generated by de novo synthesis through ceramide synthase, for the majority of cellular responses, it is generated from sphingomyelin by the action of neutral or acidic sphingomyelinases (1Kronke M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Levade T. Jaffrezou J.-P. Biochim. Biophys.

These enzymes are sphingomyelin-specific phosphodiesterases that hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond of sphingomyelin yielding ceramide and phosphocholine. Different sphingomyelinase activities have been described in eukaryotes and prokaryotes and are distinguished by their localization, pH optima, and requirement for metal ions. However, only a few enzymes have been characterized at the molecular level. The best characterized of these enzymes is the acidic sphingomyelinase, which is deficient in patients with Niemann-Pick disease (2Levade T. Jaffrezou J.-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and the bacterial Mg2+-dependent neutral sphingomyelinases (NSM) (4Matsuo Y. Yamada A. Tsukamoto K. Tamura H.-O. Ikezawa H. Nakamura H. Nishikawa K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Purification of mammalian NSM involved in signaling and subsequent determination of its primary structure have proved very difficult. Recently, one putative clone has been isolated; however, the expression resulted in a very modest increase in hydrolysis of exogenous SM (5Chatterjee S. Han H. Rollins S. Cleveland T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37407-37412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The clone has no obvious sequence similarity with other sphingomyelinases, but is surprisingly similar to isochorismate synthase; 2The data base searches and alignments were performed using BLAST 2 and CLUSTAL W, Version 1.8. 2The data base searches and alignments were performed using BLAST 2 and CLUSTAL W, Version 1.8. the significance of this similarity needs to be further explored. Other mammalian clones (mouse and human) have been isolated based on their sequence similarity to bacterial NSM (6Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This is potentially a powerful approach since, at least for some C-type phospholipases (7Heinz D.W. Essen L.-O. Williams R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 635-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), there is an evolutionary link suggesting that the bacterial enzymes could be descendants from eukaryotic proteins as they are usually not required for the bacterial life-cycle and are often found in pathogens functioning as bacterial toxins. Properties of mammalian clones with similarity to bacterial NSM have been studied further, demonstrating NSM activity in vitro, magnesium dependence, and the localization to the ER (6Tomiuk S.

It has also been suggested that in brain, the cloned enzyme represents one of several activities that can hydrolyze SM in vitro, whereas it seems to be the main activity in many other tissues (8Fensome A.C.

We have also shown that the murine enzyme has a requirement for reducing agents and is reversibly inhibited by oxidized glutathione and reactive oxygen species (8Fensome A.C. Rodrigues-Lima F. Josephs M. Paterson H.F. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1128-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the function of this enzyme in signaling and its activity toward cellular SM have not been clearly demonstrated and would require further studies (9Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J.

D'Adamio L. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that the cloned enzyme could be involved in ceramide-mediated apoptosis triggered by T cell receptor activation. Recently, it has also been shown that the enzyme has phospholipase C activity toward specific lysophospholipids (9Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38131-38139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Based on activities detected in vitro, we refer to the mouse and human clones as mammalian enzymes with neutral sphingomyelinase and lysophospholipid phospholipase C activities (NSM/lysoPLC). Although some insights into the properties of the cloned enzyme have been described, the functional significance of sequence similarities and differences between bacterial and mammalian proteins has not been investigated. In this study we aimed to identify residues that are essential for catalysis and those involved in reversible inhibition by reactive oxygen species. Determinants for localization to the ER, a specific property of the eukaryotic enzymes, have also been analyzed. Our data suggest that bacterial and mammalian enzymes have a common catalytic mechanism involving conserved histidine residues. A property that is not shared with the bacterial enzymes is the redox state-dependent reversible regulation of activity which could involve the formation and breakage of S-S bonds between cysteine residues, whereas the transmembrane region contains the main determinants for the ER localization.

Single point mutations were introduced into the constructs (specified in the figure legends) using a cassette mutagenesis strategy employing an overlap extension PCR protocol. All oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table I. A similar strategy was used to generate a construct in which the eight conserved cysteine residues were mutated, and this construct was termed “super mutant” (Smut). First, several single mutations were combined using unique restriction sites and the resulting construct subsequently used as a template to generate further mutations. Constructs were then transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue. All constructs were subsequently sequenced to check that only the desired mutation had been introduced into the sequence.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesisPrimer sequence (5′–3′)1-aThe mutated nucleotides are underlined and in bold.Mutant (forward) His-136 → AlaGTGACT GCT CTACATGCT His-138 → AlaGACTCATCTA GCT GCTGAG His-151 → AlaCTTTGCA GCC CGTGTGGCC His-272 → AlaCTCTGAT GCC GAGGCCCTC Cys-16 → AlaCAATCTCAAC GCC TGGGACATC Cys-83 → AlaAGGCAGTGGCCTC GCT GTG Cys-176 → AlaGTTCTATTG GCT GGAGACC Cys-188 → AlaCCTGGGC GCC TGCTGC Cys-189 → AlaGGGCTGC GCC CTGCTGAAAG Cys-221 → AlaCCCAAGAAC GCC TACGTCAGC Cys-252 → AlaCACGTCTGC GCT GAGACTCTG Cys-342 → AlaGTGTTGCTG GCC GTCCTGGCWild type (forward) Cys-16 → Ala/Cys-83 → Ala/Cys-176 → Ala and His-136 → Ala/His-138 → Ala/His-151 → AlaGACGCTCTTGATGTTGTTTT Cys-188 → Ala/Cys-189 → AlaGTACAGCCGACAGAAGGA Cys-221 → Ala/Cys-252 → Ala/Cys-342 → Ala and His-272 → AlaGATGCTTTCGTTGAGACTGWild type (backward) Cys-16 → AlaGTGTGGTGGATGAACTGG Cys-83 → Ala/Cys-188 → Ala/Cys-189 → Ala and His-136 → Ala/His-138 → Ala/His-151 → AlaCTGTGAGGGTCACAGCCTG Cys-221 → Ala/Cys-252 → Ala/Cys-342 → Ala and His-272 → AlaCGGAATTCTTAAGCTCTGTCCCCCTCC1-a The mutated nucleotides are underlined and in bold.

GST fusion proteins were prepared as described previously (8Fensome A.C. Rodrigues-Lima F. Josephs M. Paterson H.F. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1128-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Eluted GST fusion protein was buffer exchanged into 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmDTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. Purity of the preparation was more than 90%, and only minor protein contaminants could be detected. PolyHis-NSM/lysoPLC protein was prepared essentially as described for GST-NSM/lysoPLC, but no DTT was included in the buffers. The supernatant was added to 2 ml of nickel resin incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 90 min. Subsequently, the resin was washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 6, and proteins eluted with 250 mm imidazole in the same buffer. The eluate was buffer exchanged into 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. Myc-tagged proteins were expressed in COS cells as described previously (8Fensome A.C. Rodrigues-Lima F. Josephs M. Paterson H.F. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1128-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared and used in the disulfide bond-sensitive electrophoretic shift assay described below. Constructs of various deletion mutants with the GFP tag at the N terminus were transfected into COS cells as described previously (8Fensome A.C. Rodrigues-Lima F. Josephs M. Paterson H.F. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1128-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, washed in PBS, and mounted prior to visualization using confocal microscopy. For expression studies (Western blotting) and activity measurements of the deletion mutants, the post-nuclear supernatant was prepared (8Fensome A.C. Rodrigues-Lima F. Josephs M. Paterson H.F. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1128-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and analyzed as described below. For the analysis of the wild type and mutant enzymes in most experiments, measurements of neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase activity (NSM activity) were performed. The activities were measured using radiolabeled substrate as described previously (8Fensome A.C. Rodrigues-Lima F. Josephs M. Paterson H.F. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1128-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme preparations were incubated with [14C]sphingomyelin for 1 h at 37 °C. Concentration of Triton X-100 in the assay was 0.1%, and the substrate concentration relative to the detergent was 22 mol %. Following quenching and phase separation, a sample of the aqueous phase was analyzed by scintillation counting. For measurement of lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) hydrolyzing activity, the assay was performed as described by Sawai et al. (9Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38131-38139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with [14C-palmitoyl]lyso-3-phosphatidylcholine as substrate. The activity was measured in the absence or in the presence Triton X-100 at the concentrations used in the NSM assay. Purified recombinant protein (15 μl) was preincubated with various concentrations of DEPC or sulfhydryl reagents (freshly diluted in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.05% Triton X-100) in a final volume of 20 μl for 15 min at room temperature and the remaining activity assayed using the standard assay in the presence of DTT. For controls, the enzyme was preincubated in the presence of buffer only. In the case of DEPC, reactions were quenched by 500 μm imidazole. The specific reaction of DEPC with His residues was monitored using a Beckman spectrophotometer by scanning UV absorbance from 220 to 300 nm at the times specified in the figure legend. Protection against inhibition by DEPC was performed by preincubating purified GST-NSM/lysoPLC with increasing concentrations of SM, PC (0.5, 1, and 2 mm final concentrations), or MgCl2 (2, 5, and 10 mm final concentrations) in a total volume of 7 μl for 10 min at room temperature, followed by treatment by DEPC (200 μm final concentration, total volume 8 μl) as described above. The WT and mutant proteins were subjected to analysis by steady-state kinetics. Reactions were performed under the standard assay conditions with initial velocities measured at SM concentrations ranging from 22 to 350 μm (1.4–22 mol %). The kinetic data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation and kinetic parameters (K m , V m ,k cat,k cat/K m ) were determined from secondary Lineweaver-Burk plots. The WT and mutant enzymes were examined by intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy using a Proton Technology Instruments fluorimeter. Equal concentrations of enzymes (3 μm) in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm CHAPS were used. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Buffer alone was used for a blank and subtracted from the other spectra. Breakage or formation of disulfide bonds in purified polyHis-tagged NSM/lysoPLC or Myc-tagged enzymes were monitored by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions as described by Mahoney et al. (21Mahoney C.W. Pak J.H. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28798-28804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), followed by Western blotting with anti-polyHis antibody or anti-Myc antibody. Aliquots (5–10 μl) of purified polyHis-NSM/lysoPLC were reduced by increasing concentrations of DTT for 15 min at room temperature, mixed with SDS-sample buffer without reducing agent, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For reversible breakage/formation of disulfide bonds, aliquots of polyHis-NSM/lysoPLC were first reduced or oxidized by 1 mmDTT or 1 mm H2O2 (final concentrations) for 15 min at room temperature. To assess the reversibility of the reaction, the excess of the reagent from the first reaction (reduction or oxidation) was removed by ultrafiltration with Microcons (Millipore) before addition of the reducing or oxidizing reagent in a second incubation. The protein mobility was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Protein concentrations were determined from a standard curve generated from BSA standards using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Samples for gel electrophoresis were combined with reducing 4× SDS sample buffer, unless otherwise noted, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For Western blotting, following separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline/Tween containing 5% dried milk powder for 1 h. Primary antibody, anti-GST (1:15,000), anti-polyHis (1:1000), anti-GFP (1:1000), or anti-Myc (1:2000), was added for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline/Tween followed by washing. Secondary antibody (anti-mouse, 1:2000) was added for 30 min. Following washing, ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for detection. In addition to the mammalian enzymes cloned according to sequence similarity to bacterial NSM, other eukaryotes including yeast, nematodes, fruit fly, and silk worm, have homologous sequences. Several of these sequences were aligned in Fig. 1showing that the mouse enzyme, used in our studies, shared 20%, 28%, 42%, and 81% identity with B. cereus, yeast (S. pombe and S. cerevisiae), C. elegans, and human enzymes, respectively. The regions of strongest conservation (shaded in Fig. 1) are also found in other phosphodiesterases although overall similarity was very low. Furthermore, the three-dimensional fold of the B. cereusenzyme has been predicted and modeled using the structure determined for DNase I (4Matsuo Y. Yamada A. Tsukamoto K. Tamura H.-O. Ikezawa H. Nakamura H. Nishikawa K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on this prediction and supporting experimental evidence (4Matsuo Y. Yamada A. Tsukamoto K. Tamura H.-O. Ikezawa H. Nakamura H. Nishikawa K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Tamura H.-O. Tameishi K. Yamada A. Tomita M. Matsuo Y. Nishikawa K.

Acta. 1993; 1203: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the function of several residues in the B. cereus enzyme have been suggested. For example, His-151 is likely to function as a general acid and His-296 as a general base in the catalytic reaction, whereas Asp-195 and Asn-197 have been implicated in the interaction with the phosphate group of SM. A comparison of predicted secondary structure and the -fold recognition for mammalian enzymes (Fig. 1) with bacterial NSM and DNase I strongly suggests that the large N-terminal part (residues 1–290 in the mouse enzyme) adopts the same general fold. Furthermore, several residues (His-136, His-272, Asp-178, Asn-180) are in a similar position as the critical residues implicated in catalysis in the bacterial NSM. However, there are examples where the function of similarly positioned residues in prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes is not conserved; in phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cs, the function of general base His in the bacterial enzyme is not carried out by a His in a similar position in the mammalian sequence but by a residue unique to eukaryotic enzymes (7Heinz D.W. Essen L.-O. Williams R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 635-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The comparison of NSM sequences reveals the presence of two His residues (His-138 and His-151) in the vicinity of His-136, which are only present in eukaryotic sequences (Fig. 1). In addition to the regions of similarity with bacterial NSM, all eukaryotic sequences have a C-terminal extension (Fig. 1). This region is predicted to incorporate two transmembrane domains (residues 325–346 and 353–375 in mouse sequence); this is consistent with mammalian enzymes being integral membrane proteins (8Fensome A.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5710-5717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Despite some similarities, there are other specific features of different sequences. For example, murine and human enzymes are characterized by a high content of Cys residues, eight of which are conserved between the two sequences (Fig. 1). Our previous study has demonstrated that some Cys residues are highly reactive and that the reduced state is essential for activity (8Fensome A.C. Rodrigues-Lima F. Josephs M. Paterson H.F. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1128-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These properties are not shared with the bacterial enzymes and in the case of B. cereus (23Tomita M. Ueda Y. Hiro-omi T. Taguchi R. Ikezawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1203: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) formation of one disulfide bridge is required for the enzyme activity, whereas the addition of reducing agents has an inhibitory effect. To examine the functional significance of structural similarities and differences described above, we analyzed the murine enzyme using chemical modification of specific residues and mutagenesis. In particular, we focused on the function of His and Cys residues and the C-terminal extension present in eukaryotic enzymes. For the chemical modification studies, mouse enzyme expressed as a GST fusion protein was used. This recombinant enzyme was produced and purified from bacteria and has been shown to have properties identical to protein expressed in either insect or mammalian cells (8Fensome A.C. Rodrigues-Lima F. Josephs M. Paterson H.F. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1128-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For the specific modification of His residues, DEPC is the most widely used reagent (24Schriver Z. Hu Y. Sasisekharam R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10160-10167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine whether His residues are important for the enzyme activity toward SM, recombinant enzyme was preincubated with increasing concentrations of DEPC and residual NSM activity measured. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the enzyme was fully inhibited by DEPC at concentrations ranging from 100 to 500 μm. Even at a low concentration of DEPC (20 μm), 40% inhibition of enzyme activity was observed. The specific reaction of DEPC with His residues can be determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 240 nm. The spectra (Fig. 2 A, inset) recorded at 5- and 15-min intervals during the modification of the enzyme confirmed that His residues were being specifically modified, since only an increase in absorban"

The level of TPA induction, however, is limited due to the presence of a repressor element that shows similarity to a non-canonical E-box (AACGTG). Mutation or deletion of the repressor element led to enhanced induction by TPA or epidermal growth factor in cervical squamous cell and breast carcinoma cell lines. Repression was dependent on the adjacent AP-1 site, without discernible alteration in the binding affinity or composition of AP-1. We investigated the following two possible mechanisms for E-box-mediated repression: 1) CpG methylation of the core of the E-box element, and 2) binding of a distinct protein complex to this site. Point mutation of the CpG methylation site in the E-box showed loss of repressor activity. Conversely, in vitro methylation of this site significantly reduced TPA induction. In vitro gel shift analysis revealed distinct and TPA-dependent binding of USF1 and USF2 to the repressor element that required nucleotides within the E-box. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that USF, c-Myc, and Max proteins were associated with the FGF-BP promoter in vivo. Overall, these findings suggested that the balance between trans-activation by AP-1 and repression through the E-box is an important control mechanism for fine-tuning the angiogenic response to growth factor-activated pathways.

Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the switch to an angiogenic phenotype of a tumor is an integral part of the development of anti-angiogenic therapy. One way in which the angiogenic pathway can be stimulated is through the activation of fibroblast growth factors (FGF-1 and FGF-2)1 that are present at high levels in most tissues where they are bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans and sequestered in the extracellular matrix (1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vlodavsky I. Bashkin P. Ishai-Michaeli R. Chajek-Shaul T. Bar-Shavit R. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Klagsbrun M. Fuks Z. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 638: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Tumor cells can release FGF-2 activity through the induced expression of an FGF-binding protein (FGF-BP), which is secreted from tumor cells and binds and mobilizes stored FGF-2, leading to the activation of FGF-2-dependent processes such as angiogenesis (3Wu D. Kan M. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-BP is found in only a limited number of epithelial tissues where its expression is tightly regulated. During mouse embryonic development, FGF-BP expression is up-regulated in the epithelial layers of the skin, intestine, and lung where it coincides with development of these tissues (5Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After peak FGF-BP expression at embryonic day 18, levels drop significantly after birth and remain low in most tissues of the adult mouse (5Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In human tissues, FGF-BP expression is low but was found to be significantly up-regulated in certain tumors including squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) derived from skin, cervix, lung, or head and neck region (4Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-BP is also highly expressed in some colon cancers (6Czubayko F. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Aigner A. Tuveson A.T. Berchem G. Wellstein A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and breast adenocarcinomas. 2A. T. Riegel and A. Wellstein, unpublished data. A functional role for FGF-BP in these tumors has been shown through the use of ribozyme targeting, where as little as 20% reduction in FGF-BP steady-state mRNA levels led to a decrease in tumor growth and angiogenesis of xenografted cervical SCC and colon tumors (6Czubayko F. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Aigner A. Tuveson A.T. Berchem G. Wellstein A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Thus it appears that for at least some tumors, FGF-BP expression is rate-limiting for tumor growth and angiogenesis. A relationship between FGF-BP expression and tumor formation has also been established by the observation that levels of FGF-BP increase during 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene- and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced mouse skin carcinogenesis (5Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We subsequently found that FGF-BP gene transcription is directly induced by TPA or epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment of SCC cell lines (7Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Harris V.K. Coticchia C.M. Kagan B.L. Ahmad S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10802-10811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Analysis of the FGF-BP promoter showed that TPA and EGF induction is mediated within the first 118 base pairs of the proximal promoter and requires several positive regulatory cis-elements in the FGF-BP promoter including Sp1, AP-1, and C/EBP (7Harris V.K.

In addition, we identified a region of the promoter between the AP-1 and C/EBP sites that mediated a repressive effect on FGF-BP transcription. Deletion or mutation of the repressor region had no effect on basal activity of the promoter but significantly enhanced the level of TPA induction (7Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), indicating that this region of the promoter functions to limit the overall response to TPA induction of FGF-BP gene expression. In this study, we investigate more closely the mechanisms by which the FGF-BP repressor region can limit transcriptional induction of this gene in response to either TPA or EGF. The human cell lines ME-180 and HeLa (cervical squamous cell carcinoma), BT-549 (ductal breast carcinoma), and MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in improved minimum essential medium (IMEM) (Biofluids Inc., Rockville, MD) without phenol red and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human FGF-BP promoter fragments were cloned into the pXP1 promoterless luciferase reporter vector and have been described elsewhere (7Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A.

The FGF-BP promoter constructs from −118 to +62 carrying a mutated AP-1 site (mAP-1 and mAP-1/m-58) or mutated E-box (m-55/−56) were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (7Harris V.K.

Briefly, point mutations were introduced into complementary overlapping PCR primers that convert the AP-1/E-box site from GTGAGTAACGTG (−66 to −55) toTGGAGCAACGTG orTGGAGCAATGTG to generate the mAP-1 Luc and mAP-1/m-58 Luc constructs, respectively. For the m-55/−56 Luc construct, PCR primers were generated to introduce point mutations at positions −55 and −56 of the E-box, converting the site to GTGAGTAACGGT (−66 to −55). Primary and secondary PCRs were carried out exactly as described previously (7Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and cloned into the pXP1 BamHI site. pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase vector (Promega) was used as transfection efficiency control. 24 h before transfection, cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of either 750,000 cells/well (ME-180) or 250,000 cells/well (all other cell lines). For each transfection, 1.0 μg of FGF-BP promoter-luciferase construct, 0.2 ng of pRL-CMV (transfection efficiency control), and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) were combined and added to cells for 3 h in serum-free IMEM. The transfected cells were treated for 18 h in serum-free IMEM containing vehicle alone (Me2SO, 0.1%), TPA (100 nm), or EGF (5 ng/ml). Cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (7Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Due to a slight background TPA or EGF induction of pRL-CMV, results shown have been normalized for protein content and not for Renillaluciferase activity. Protein content of cell extracts was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Results from transient transfection of all FGF-BP promoter/luciferase constructs were consistent using multiple plasmid preparations. All results were analyzed for statistical significance using t test analysis. ME-180 cells were grown to 80% confluency on 150-mm dishes, serum-starved for 16 h, and treated with vehicle alone (Me2SO, 0.1%) or with 100 nm TPA for 1 h. Nuclear extract preparation, probe labeling, and binding reactions were carried out exactly as described previously (7Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), using 5 μg of ME-180 nuclear extracts and 200 ng of poly(dI-dC). Reactions were incubated 10 min on ice. 50-Fold molar excess (unless indicated otherwise) of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides or 2.0-μg supershift antibodies were added and incubated for another 10 min before adding 20 fmol of labeled probe. 0.2 μg of USF-1 or USF-2 blocking peptides were added concurrently with the antibodies. Reactions were carried out 40 min on ice and analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All promoter fragments for gel shift were generated by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides. Sequence of the consensus AP-1 element was 5′-CTAGTGATGAGTCAGCCGGATC-3′. Supershift antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and included antibodies for c-Myc (N-262), Max (C-17), Mad-1 (C-19), Mad-2 (C-17), Mad-3 (E-20), Mad-4 (C-20), USF-1 (C-20), and USF-2 (N-20); the Fos-specific antibodies c-Fos (K-25), c-Fos (4Czubayko F.

Blocking peptides for USF-1 and USF-2 were also purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-ARNT polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Chris Bradfield (McCardle Laboratory). 20 μg of FGF-BP promoter constructs −118/+62 and m-58 were CpG-methylated in vitro with 10 units of SssI methylase (CpG methylase) (New England Biolabs), 160 μm S-adenosylmethionine (New England Biolabs), and magnesium-free buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 10 mmEDTA. Methylation reaction was carried out for 5 h at 37 °C. Plasmids were purified by phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation prior to transfection. Complete CpG methylation was confirmed by digestion with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzymeHpaII (New England Biolabs). Approximately 107 ME-180 cells were serum-starved for 16 h followed by treatment for 1 h with 10−7m TPA. Proteins were cross-linked to DNA by adding formaldehyde directly to culture medium to a final concentration of 1% for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed and scraped into 1 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell pellets were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) for 10 min on ice. Lysates were sonicated on ice to an average DNA length of 100–500 base pairs and centrifuged to remove cell debris. Supernatant was diluted 5-fold in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 140 mm NaCl, 1× protease inhibitors) and pre-cleared with 50 μl of GammaBind TMPlus SepharoseTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 20 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 50 μg of bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted, and 10 μg of antibody (see previous section) was added to supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected with GammaBindTM Plus SepharoseTM and washed (9Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). DNA was eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 for 15 min at room temperature. Cross-links were reversed by incubating eluates at 65 °C for 4 h in 0.2 m NaCl, followed by digestion with 40 ng/μl proteinase K in 10 mm EDTA, 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.5, for 2 h at 45 °C. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. PCRs contained 4% of input DNA or 20% of immunoprecipitated DNA along with 10 pmol of primers, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1× PCR buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Primers used were from −369 to −350 and from −47 to −73 of the FGF-BP promoter (7Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Plasmid containing −1829 to +62 of the FGF-BP promoter was used as a control template. After 22 cycles of PCR, samples were run on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and probed with an FGF-BP-specific primer from −118 to −99 end-labeled with T4 kinase. Band intensities were quantitated by PhosphorImager, and the amount immunoprecipitated was expressed as percent of total input. We previously discovered that deletion of the region between −57 and −47, situated between the AP-1 and C/EBP sites, resulted in enhanced TPA induction of transcription (7Harris V.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), indicating the involvement of a negative regulatory element in the TPA regulation of FGF-BP. This region has no homology to any known transcription factor binding sites except for the presence of an imperfect E-box between −60 and −55. To characterize further the FGF-BP repressor element, we tested whether mutations in this region would disrupt repressor activity and lead to enhanced TPA or EGF induction of the promoter. The region of the FGF-BP promoter between −118 and +62 harbors all of the necessary elements for full induction by both TPA (7Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and EGF (8Harris V.K. Coticchia C.M. Kagan B.L. Ahmad S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10802-10811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Internal deletion from −57 to −47 generated in the context of the −118 to +62 promoter showed significantly increased induction by both TPA and EGF when transfected into ME-180 cervical squamous carcinoma cells (Fig. 1 A). In addition, introduction of a C to T point mutation at position −58 within the E-box showed a dramatically increased response to TPA, going from a 7- to 18-fold induction (Fig. 1 A). EGF induction of the −58 mutant was also highly increased, going from a 5.5- to 10-fold induction (Fig. 1 A). Loss of repression was not reflected at the level of basal promoter activity since the repressor mutant constructs −57/−47 and m-58 had the same uninduced promoter activity as the wild-type −118/+62 (7Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Harris V.K. Coticchia C.M. Kagan B.L. Ahmad S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10802-10811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, the region between −58 and −47 of the FGF-BP promoter appears to function in limiting the overall transcriptional response to both TPA and EGF. In order to determine whether repressor activity on the FGF-BP promoter existed in other cell types, we tested the TPA and EGF response of the wild-type −118/+62 or the E-box point mutant (m-58) promoter constructs in other cell lines. The −58 mutant showed significantly enhanced TPA induction in HeLa (cervical squamous carcinoma) and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines (Fig. 1 B). In cell lines where the FGF-BP promoter was EGF-responsive, such as HeLa and BT-549 (breast), the fold EGF induction of the −58 mutant was also consistently higher (Fig. 1 C). These data indicate that repression of the FGF-BP promoter is a general mechanism of FGF-BP transcriptional regulation in response to TPA or EGF stimulation. The proximity of the AP-1 site to the repressor mutations raised the possibility that the observed increase in the TPA response was due to its impact on the juxtaposed AP-1 site. To test the possible influence that the −58 mutation may have on the AP-1 site, we generated double mutant constructs carrying the −58 mutation in conjunction with mutations in either the AP-1 site or the C/EBP site. We have shown previously that EGF or TPA induction of FGF-BP partly depends on the AP-1 and C/EBP sites in the promoter, since mutation of the AP-1 site (mAP-1), or deletion of C/EBP (delta C/EBP) results in a significant decrease in the amount of induction by EGF and TPA with no effect on basal promoter activity (Fig. 2 and Refs. 7Harris V.K.

Mutations in the AP-1 site have also been shown to disrupt AP-1 binding (7Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). As shown in Fig. 2, the −58 mutation alone showed an enhanced TPA response, whereas mutation of the −58 and AP-1 sites together showed no loss of repression. Instead, the m-58/mAP-1 double mutant displayed a similar level of TPA or EGF induction as that of the mAP-1 single mutant construct. Conversely, the −58 mutation in combination with a deleted C/EBP site resulted in loss of repression and increased TPA and EGF induction (Fig. 2). Therefore, the effect of the −58 mutation is not dependent on the C/EBP site but is dependent on an intact AP-1 site since the mAP-1/m-58 construct does not result in a loss of repression.Figure 5Characterization of transcription factor binding to the FGF - BP promoter repressor element.

Comp, competitor DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The AP-1 dependence of repressor activity prompted us to confirm that the −58 mutant phenotype was not simply a consequence of altered AP-1 binding affinity to the FGF-BP AP-1 site. We carried out gel shift competition analysis of the AP-1 site in the presence or absence of the −58 mutation. By using a promoter fragment that spans the AP-1/repressor element (−70 to −51) as a probe, we could detect AP-1 binding (upper complex) and binding of additional proteins that are specific to the repressor element (Fig.3 A, upper panel and Refs. 7Harris V.K.

Kagan B.L. Ahmad S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10802-10811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When the −58 point mutation was introduced into the repressor site, the lower complexes disappeared, and only the AP-1 complex was bound (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). Competition with an unlabeled consensus AP-1 element (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2–4) or with the FGF-BP AP-1 element (lanes 5–7) could effectively compete for AP-1 binding. Both competitors reduced AP-1 binding to the probe at concentrations between 10- and 20-fold molar excess, as determined by quantitation of the AP-1 band intensity. Similarly, competition for AP-1 bound in the presence of the −58 mutation also occurred at concentrations between 10- and 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled AP-1 elements (Fig. 3 A, lanes 8–14). Although quantitation of AP-1 binding to the m-58 probe suggests a decreased AP-1 binding affinity, this may be due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate quantitation of band intensity in the presence of multiple bands (Fig.3 A, upper panel). Nevertheless, these results indicate that the enhanced TPA induction caused by the −58 mutation cannot be explained by increased AP-1 binding affinity. Alternatively, the −58 mutation could potentially alter the composition of AP-1 by flanking the AP-1 site with nucleotides that favor binding of different AP-1 family members, leading to increased transcriptional activation. We have published elsewhere that EGF activation of ME-180 cells led to increased binding of c-Fos and JunD proteins to the FGF-BP AP-1 site (8Harris V.K. Coticchia C.M. Kagan B.L. Ahmad S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10802-10811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We asked which AP-1 family members were bound to the FGF-BP promoter after TPA treatment and whether the composition of AP-1 changed in the presence of the −58 mutation. Gel supershift analysis was carried out using the −70/−51 FGF-BP promoter fragment as a probe in the presence of TPA-treated ME-180 extracts and antibodies specific for individual members of the AP-1 family (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–10). Supershift of the AP-1 complex occurred in the presence of cross-reactive Fos and Jun antibodies (lanes 2 and 7, respectively) as well as with specific antibodies for c-Fos (lane 3), Fra2 (lane 6), and JunD (lane 10). The binding of c-Fos, Fra2, and JunD was also prevalent in the presence of the −58 mutation (Fig. 3 B, lanes 13, 16 and 20). Overall, these experiments demonstrate that although repressor activity mediated through the −58 site is dependent on the adjacent AP-1 site, the −58 mutation had no obvious impact on either AP-1 binding affinity or the composition of the AP-1 complex. We hypothesized that one possible effect of the −58 mutation could be that the C to T point mutation leads to loss of transcriptional repression through disruption of a CpG methylation site. The −57/−47 deletion is consistent with this hypothesis since this mutation also destroys the −58 CpG methylation site. In vivo cytosine methylation occurs preferably at CpG dinucleotides and is closely associated with transcriptional repression of genes with CpG sites in their promoter region (10Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether methylation of the −58 CpG site could mediate repression of FGF-BP promoter induction, we tested the effect of in vitro methylation of the FGF-BP promoter constructs on their transcriptional response to TPA. The wild-type −118/+62 and the m-58 promoter constructs were methylated in vitro with SssI methylase so that each plasmid would differ in its CpG methylation pattern only at the −58 site (Fig. 4). Complete methylation of each plasmid construct was confirmed by digestion withHpaII (data not shown). Transfection of the methylated −118/+62 plasmid into ME-180 cells resulted in a significant 50% decrease in the level of TPA induction compared with the unmethylated −118/+62 plasmid (Fig. 4). On the other hand, methylation of the m-58 promoter construct, which is unmethylated at position −58, demonstrated a similar level of TPA induction compared with the unmethylated m-58 construct (Fig. 4). Both methylated constructs displayed an equivalent decrease in basal promoter activity which was 20% lower than the unmethylated plasmids (data not shown) and w"

It belongs to the family of P-type ATPases in which the hydrolysis of ATP is linked with ion translocation through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of an aspartic acid residue in the ATPase protein (Scheme FS1). Transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP to the protein is activated by a series of protein conformational changes associated with the binding of two calcium ions at cytoplasmically facing sites in exchange for protons (“the Ca2+ binding transition” H n E2 → Ca2E1). The dephosphorylation (H n E2P → H n E2) is triggered by Ca2+/H+ exchange at luminally facing sites. Structural studies of the Ca2+-ATPase have revealed a large cytoplasmic head, which through a stalk is connected with the transmembrane domain (7Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The head is made up of two cytoplasmic loops of the peptide chain, and the phosphorylated aspartic acid residue (Asp351) resides in the largest of these. The membrane domain comprises ten transmembrane helices (M1–M10), encompassing sites for binding and translocation of Ca2+and H+ (3Andersen J.P. Biosci.

The stalk consists of extensions of some of the transmembrane helices continuing into the cytoplasmic head. The tight coupling between the catalytic and vectorial processes, associated with the cytoplasmic head and the membrane domain, respectively, is dependent on intramolecular communication through the interconnecting stalk. Mutations to residues in stalk segment S4 have been shown to impair the transition between the two major phosphoforms of the enzyme, Ca2E1P → H n E2P, suggesting an important role of this segment in transmission of ATP-derived energy required in the membrane domain for Ca2+ translocation (3Andersen J.P.

Stalk segment S5 could be another important mediator of the intramolecular communication, but its role is less well understood compared with the role of S4. We have previously demonstrated that replacement of Lys758 in S5 with isoleucine leads to concurrent increase in the rate of dephosphorylation H n E2P → H n E2 and decrease in the rate of the Ca2+ binding transition H n E2 → Ca2E1 (12Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the tight coupling between ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ translocation has been found to be abolished by replacement of Tyr763 at the M5S5 boundary with glycine (13Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 908-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have inquired about the functional importance of many of the other residues in stalk segment S5. Would mutations to other S5 residues give rise to functional consequences similar to those observed for the Lys758 → Ile and the Tyr763 → Gly mutants, and do stalk segments S4 and S5 play separate roles in intramolecular signaling? In addition to Lys758, several other residues in the S5 region are well conserved among the P-type ATPases, such as the charged or polar residues Asp737, Asp738, Asn739, and Arg751, the aromatic residues Phe740 and Tyr754, the aliphatic residues Ile743, Val744, and Val747, and Gly750 (14Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the importance of these and other residues located in S5 and at the M5S5 boundary (see Fig. 1), by studying the functional consequences of their replacement for the overall and partial reactions of the enzyme.Figure 1Schematic α-helical presentation of stalk segment S5 between Asp737 and Leu764 with indication by inverted color of the residues substituted in the present study.

Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomes containing expressed wild-type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase were harvested by differential centrifugation, and expression levels were quantified by a specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (16Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using as standard expressed wild type for which the concentration was determined by measurement of the capacity for phosphorylation by inorganic phosphate in the presence of 30% dimethyl sulfoxide (12Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Total microsomal protein was determined by the dye binding method of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). For determination of Ca2+-activated ATPase activity, microsomes were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C either in the presence or absence of 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187 in a medium containing 50 mm TES/Tris,1pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and various concentrations of CaCl2 to set the desired free Ca2+concentration, as calculated using the MAXC computer program and constants therein (18Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the microsomes was determined by measuring the amount of Pi liberated (12Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using the method of Baginski et al. (19Baginski E.S. Foa P.P. Zak B. Clin. Chem. 1967; 13: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis referable to Ca2+-ATPase activity was calculated following subtraction of the amount of Pi liberated in the presence of 4 mm EGTA without added Ca2+. The turnover rate was calculated as mol Pi liberated/mol Ca2+-ATPase/s. To study the vanadate inhibition of ATPase activity, the indicated concentrations of monovanadate were obtained from metavanadate as described previously (20Andersen J.P. Møller J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).45Ca2+ uptake in the microsomal vesicles was determined in the absence of ionophore and in the presence of 5 mm potassium oxalate (to act as Ca2+ trap inside the vesicles), using a Millipore filtration method (12Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To study the time course of phosphorylation of enzyme initially present in the Ca2+-deprived form, microsomes preincubated in a medium containing 40 mmMOPS/Tris, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, and 1 or 2 mmEGTA were mixed with a medium of a composition producing final concentrations of 40 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 2 or 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm free Ca2+, followed by acid quenching at serial time intervals by further mixing with the double volume of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 100 mm H3PO4. The time course of phosphorylation of enzyme initially present in the Ca2+-saturated form was studied in the same way except that the medium used for preincubation contained 0.1 mm Ca2+ instead of EGTA. For experiments at pH 6.0, 40 mm MES adjusted to pH 6.0 with Tris was present instead of 40 mm MOPS/Tris. The phosphorylation reactions were carried out either at 0 °C, using a manual mixing technique (12Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), or at 25 °C, using the Bio-Logic quench flow module QFM-5 (Bio-Logic Instruments, Claix, France) as described previously (21Sørensen L.-M. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The quench flow technique was also used to study Ca2+dissociation from the enzyme by monitoring the phosphorylation following simultaneous addition of EGTA and [γ-32P]ATP to Ca2+-saturated enzyme (21Sørensen L.-M. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Microsomes suspended in 40 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μmCaCl2 were mixed with an equal volume of 40 mmMOPS/Tris, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 4 mm EGTA, and 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP, followed by acid quenching 34 ms later. Dephosphorylation of enzyme phosphorylated by [γ-32P]ATP was studied at 0 °C using the manual mixing technique (12Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Microsomes were phosphorylated for 15 s at 0 °C in a medium containing 40 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm CaCl2, 2 μm[γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187, followed by addition, 5 s prior to acid quenching, of either nonradioactive ATP (purified by ionic exchange chromatography to remove contaminant ADP) to a final concentration of 600 μm, or ADP with EGTA to final concentrations of 1 mm each. In all the above described phosphorylation experiments, the acid-precipitated protein was washed by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Weber and Osborn (22Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a 7% polyacrylamide gel at pH 6.0. Radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase band was quantified by imaging using a Packard Cyclone™ Storage Phosphor System. For phosphorylation from32Pi, microsomes were incubated 10 min at 25 °C in a medium containing 100 mm MES/Tris, pH 6.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 30% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and 0.5 mm32Pi. Dimethyl sulfoxide was present to increase the Pi affinity, thus ensuring that 0.5 mm Pi was saturating in the wild type (23de Meis L. Martins O.B. Alves E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4252-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Champeil P. Guillain F. Venien C. Gingold M.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To study dephosphorylation, the phosphorylated microsomes were cooled to 0 °C and subsequently diluted 20-fold into ice-cold medium containing 50 mm TES/Tris, pH 7.0, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 5 mmnonradioactive Pi, with or without 100 mm KCl, followed by acid quenching at serial intervals (2, 4, 6, and 10 s after the dilution). The acid-quenched protein was analyzed as described above. All data presented in the figures and table or described in the text are average values of 2–5 experiments. Standard deviations are given in the table and are shown in the figures when larger than the size of the symbol. Time courses of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation were either fitted to monoexponential functions corresponding to first-order kinetics, using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS, Inc.), or were fitted by computer simulation of a simplified reaction cycle as described previously (21Sørensen L.-M. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mutants analyzed in the present study are presented in Fig. 1. An expression level of 200–400 pmol Ca2+-ATPase/mg of total microsomal protein was achieved for the wild-type Ca2+-ATPase, i.e.several hundred-fold higher than that of the endogenous COS cell Ca2+-ATPase. The various mutants represented by single-letter code without parentheses in Fig. 1 were expressed to wild-type level, whereas the expression levels were very low for the mutations shown in parentheses. The low levels of expression of mutants Phe740 → Ala, Ile743 → Gly, Val747 → Gly, and Gly750 → Leu precluded functional characterization but less drastic alterations to the same residues, mutations Phe740 → Leu, Ile743 → Ala, Val747 → Ala, and Gly750 → Ala resulted in expression to wild-type level, thereby enabling characterization of the functional importance of these residues. For Arg751, only the conservative replacement with lysine gave rise to a protein that could be expressed to a level comparable with the wild-type level, whereas insignificant expression was found for mutants with alanine, isoleucine, or glutamate substitutions, either by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or by Western blotting (Fig.2). Two inversion mutants moving Arg751 one position in either direction were also produced, Gly750-Arg751 → Arg750-Gly751 and Arg751-Ala752 → Ala751-Arg752, but as illustrated in Fig. 2, only the Arg751-Ala752 → Ala751-Arg752 mutant could be expressed to a significant level. To determine the overall functional consequences of the various amino acid substitutions, we measured the steady-state turnover number for ATPase activity at 37 °C in the presence of 5 mm MgATP and various Ca2+concentrations, with and without the calcium ionophore A23187 (25Reed P.W. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6970-6977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calcium ionophore allows passive efflux of Ca2+ that has been actively transported into the microsomal vesicles, and for the wild-type enzyme, this leads to a 2-fold increase in the maximum turnover rate, because the luminal Ca2+ concentration is diminished, thereby relieving the “back inhibition” of the rate-limiting Ca2E1P → H n E2P transition caused by Ca2+ binding at luminal low affinity sites. All the mutants that could be expressed to a normal level, except Arg751 → Lys and the inversion mutant Arg751-Ala752 → Ala751-Arg752, displayed ATPase activity, and the turnover rates determined at optimum Ca2+ concentration are given in Table I, both for the presence and absence of ionophore. The maximal turnover rates of mutants Val744 → Gly, Val747 → Ala, and Arg762 → Ile were considerably lower than that of the wild type. Furthermore, mutants Val744 → Gly, Val747 → Ala, and Gly750 → Ala showed diminished activation by ionophore, and for mutant Arg762→ Ile we observed an anomalous, slightly inhibitory, effect of the ionophore on the ATPase activity, similar to that previously described for mutant Lys758 → Ile (12Sørensen T.

Open table in a new tab The average values corresponding to 2–5 determinations are presented ± S.D. Examples of the data are shown in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5. The overall reaction (ATP hydrolysis) was studied at 37 °C, and the partial reactions (phosphorylation and dephosphorylation) were at 0 °C. The disappearance of the activating effect of the calcium ionophore could be the consequence of uncoupling of ATP hydrolysis from Ca2+ transport (13Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 908-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To test for uncoupling,45Ca2+ uptake in the microsomes was determined. All mutants displaying ATPase activity, including Val744→ Gly, Val747 → Ala, Gly750 → Ala, and Arg762 → Ile, were able to transport Ca2+actively, and the ratios between Ca2+ transport and ATPase activity did not differ significantly among mutants and wild type (data not shown). Hence, there was no indication of an uncoupling of ATPase activity from Ca2+ transport in any of the mutants. In this situation, the reduced activation by the calcium ionophore may be explained by a shift of the rate-limiting step away from the Ca2E1P → H n E2P transition sensitive to back inhibition by accumulated Ca2+. In fact, an inhibitory effect of the ionophore on the turnover rate, as observed for mutant Arg762 → Ile, might be expected under conditions where the Ca2+ binding transition, H n E2 → Ca2E1, is rate-limiting, because the ionophore exerts a direct inhibitory effect on this step (12Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When added in large doses, the ionophore causes strong inhibition of the Ca2+ binding transition of the wild type (26Hara H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16584-16590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and even the low ionophore concentration used here to make the membranes leaky should exert some inhibitory effect. In the wild type, the effect on the steady-state ATPase activity of this inhibition is masked because of the simultaneous relief of the back inhibition of the Ca2E1P → H n E2P transition, but if the Ca2+binding transition has become rate-limiting for the cycle, the inhibitory effect of the ionophore should manifest itself as a decrease in the turnover rate, as actually seen for mutant Arg762→ Ile. Examples of Ca2+ titration of the ATPase activity in the presence of ionophore are shown in Fig.3, and the K 0.5values for Ca2+ activation are indicated for all the mutants in Table I. The activation by Ca2+ reflects Ca2+ binding at the cytoplasmically facing high affinity sites, whereas the inhibition seen at high Ca2+concentrations reflects in part the back inhibition by Ca2+binding at the luminal sites and in part the effect of replacing MgATP by CaATP (27Shigekawa M. Wakabayashi S. Nakamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8698-8707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lund S. Møller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1654-1664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Andersen J.P. Lassen K. Møller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mutants Val744 → Gly, Val744 → Ala, and Val747 → Ala, the apparent affinity for Ca2+ at the activating sites was 1.5–2-fold increased (K 0.5 decreased) relative to wild type. By contrast, the apparent affinity was reduced 2- and 4-fold, respectively, in mutants Gly750 → Ala and Arg762 → Ile. In the other mutants, theK 0.5 values for Ca2+ activation did not deviate or deviated only insignificantly from wild type. Having established the impact of the various mutations on the overall enzyme function, we studied the partial reactions. First, the Ca2+-activated phosphorylation by [γ-32P]ATP was determined after 15 s of incubation with 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 100 μm Ca2+ at 0 °C. All the mutants exhibiting ATPase activity were able to form a phosphoenzyme intermediate under these conditions, whereas the two expressed mutants that were inactive with respect to ATP hydrolysis, Arg751→ Lys and Arg751-Ala752 → Ala751-Arg752, showed no measurable phosphorylation. Further examination showed that the latter mutants were unable to phosphorylate also in the presence of 10 mmCa2+ at 0 °C as well as in the presence of 100 μm or 10 mm Ca2+ at 25 °C (data not shown). The kinetics of the reaction sequence consisting of dissociation of protons from H n E2, Ca2+ and ATP binding, and subsequent phosphorylation to form Ca2E1P and H n E2P (Scheme FS1) were studied at 0 °C at pH 7.0. The enzyme was preincubated in the absence of Ca2+ (presence of EGTA), and phosphorylation was initiated by the simultaneous addition of CaCl2 and [γ-32P]ATP to yield final concentrations of 100 μm Ca2+ and 2 μm[γ-32P]ATP. Examples of the data are shown in Fig.4. The time courses of phosphorylation could be fitted to a monoexponential function, and the derived rate coefficient is given in Table I for all the mutants. A significant enhancement of the rate of phosphorylation relative to wild type was found for six mutants, more than 2-fold in mutants Val747→ Ala (shown in Fig. 4) and Met757 → Gly and somewhat less in Ile743 → Ala, Glu748 → Ala, Glu749 → Ala, and Gln759 → Ala. In another four mutants, Asp737 → Ala, Asp738 → Ala, Ala752 → Leu (shown in Fig. 4), and Tyr754→ Ala, a significant decrease in the phosphorylation rate was found (in Asp738 → Ala and Ala752 → Leu the rate was about half that of wild type). Under the experimental conditions applied here, the phosphorylation rate of the wild type is limited by one or more of the steps in the Ca2+ binding transition (H n E2 → Ca2E1) and not by ATP binding or phosphoryl transfer (Ca2E1 → Ca2E1P) (12Sørensen T.

https://openalex.org/W2012678244,"Atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isotype-specific interacting protein (ASIP) specifically interacts with the atypical protein kinase C isozymes PKCλ and PKCζ. ASIP and atypical PKC, as well as their Caenorhabditis elegans counterparts (PAR-3 and PKC-3, respectively), are thought to coordinately participate in intracellular signaling that contributes to the maintenance of cellular polarity and to the formation of junctional complexes. The potential role of ASIP in other cellular functions of atypical PKC was investigated by examining the effect of overexpression of ASIP on insulin-induced glucose uptake, previously shown to be mediated through PKCλ, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. When overexpressed in these cells, which contain PKCλ but not PKCζ, ASIP was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous PKCλ but not with PKCε or with Akt. The subcellular localization of PKCλ was also altered in cells overexpressing ASIP. Overexpression of ASIP inhibited insulin stimulation of both glucose uptake and translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, but it did not inhibit glucose uptake induced by either growth hormone or hyperosmolarity both of which promote glucose uptake in a PKCλ-independent manner. Moreover, glucose uptake stimulated by a constitutively active mutant of PKCλ, but not that induced by an active form of Akt, was inhibited by ASIP. Insulin-induced activation of PKCλ, but not that of phosphoinositide 3-kinase or Akt, was also inhibited by overexpression of ASIP. These data suggest that overexpression of ASIP inhibits insulin-induced glucose uptake by specifically interfering with signals transmitted through PKCλ. Atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isotype-specific interacting protein (ASIP) specifically interacts with the atypical protein kinase C isozymes PKCλ and PKCζ. ASIP and atypical PKC, as well as their Caenorhabditis elegans counterparts (PAR-3 and PKC-3, respectively), are thought to coordinately participate in intracellular signaling that contributes to the maintenance of cellular polarity and to the formation of junctional complexes. The potential role of ASIP in other cellular functions of atypical PKC was investigated by examining the effect of overexpression of ASIP on insulin-induced glucose uptake, previously shown to be mediated through PKCλ, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. When overexpressed in these cells, which contain PKCλ but not PKCζ, ASIP was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous PKCλ but not with PKCε or with Akt. The subcellular localization of PKCλ was also altered in cells overexpressing ASIP. Overexpression of ASIP inhibited insulin stimulation of both glucose uptake and translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, but it did not inhibit glucose uptake induced by either growth hormone or hyperosmolarity both of which promote glucose uptake in a PKCλ-independent manner. Moreover, glucose uptake stimulated by a constitutively active mutant of PKCλ, but not that induced by an active form of Akt, was inhibited by ASIP. Insulin-induced activation of PKCλ, but not that of phosphoinositide 3-kinase or Akt, was also inhibited by overexpression of ASIP. These data suggest that overexpression of ASIP inhibits insulin-induced glucose uptake by specifically interfering with signals transmitted through PKCλ. protein kinase C phosphoinositide atypical PKC isotype-specific interacting protein 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid growth hormone low density microsome plasma membrane immunoglobulin G multiplicity of infection plaque-forming unit Members of the protein kinase C (PKC)1 family of serine-threonine kinases were originally identified as effectors of lipid-mediated intracellular signaling (1Nishizuka Y.

Three classes of PKC isozymes have been defined: conventional PKC, consisting of PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ; novel PKC, comprising PKCδ, PKCε, PKCη, and PKCθ; and atypical PKC, including PKCλ and PKCζ (2Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2362) Google Scholar,3Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Atypical PKC isozymes are distinct from other members of the PKC family in that they are not activated by diacylglycerol or phorbol esters (1Nishizuka Y.

Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These isozymes are thought to act downstream of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase. PKCζ is activated in vitroby phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (5Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a cellular product of PI 3-kinase action, whereas PKCλ was shown in transfected cells to contribute in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner to trans-activation of the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (phorbol ester)-responsive element induced by platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor (4Akimoto K.

Furthermore, both the phosphorylation and activity of atypical PKC stimulated by growth factors were shown to be inhibited by either a pharmacological inhibitor of or a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase (4Akimoto K.

Atypical PKC isotype-specific interacting protein (ASIP) was recently identified as a protein that specifically associates with atypical PKC (10Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). ASIP does not contain any known catalytic domain but possesses three PDZ domains (10Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), which mediate protein-protein interactions at the plasma membrane (11Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). PAR-3, theCaenorhabditis elegans ortholog of ASIP, also interacts with the worm counterpart of atypical PKC (PKC-3) (12Tabuse Y. Izumi Y. Piano F. Kemphues K.J. Miwa J. Ohno S. Development. 1998; 125: 3607-3614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Worm embryos lacking PAR-3 show severe defects in asymmetrical cell division, and PKC-3-depleted cells show a phenotype highly similar to that of PAR-3-depleted cells (12Tabuse Y. Izumi Y. Piano F. Kemphues K.J. Miwa J. Ohno S. Development. 1998; 125: 3607-3614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bazooka, a protein essential for asymmetrical cell division in Drosophila neuroblasts, has been identified as a fly ortholog of ASIP and PAR-3 (13Schober M. Schaefer M. Knoblich J.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 14Wodarz A. Ramrath A Kuchinke U. Knust E. Nature. 1999; 402: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Although a fly homolog of atypical PKC has not been identified, these observations, together with the fact that ASIP and PKCλ colocalize at junctional complexes in mammalian cells (10Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), suggest that ASIP and atypical PKC coordinately function in the maintenance of cellular polarity and cell-cell interaction. We have now investigated whether ASIP also contributes to other cellular functions of atypical PKC. Stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin in its target cells, such as skeletal muscle and adipocytes, is an important biological action of this hormone. Pharmacological and molecular biological evidence has revealed that PI 3-kinase plays a major role in insulin-induced glucose uptake (15Holman G.D. Kasuga M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 16Ogawa W. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism by which activation of PI 3-kinase results in glucose uptake remains unclear, we and others have shown that a kinase-deficient mutant of atypical PKC inhibits insulin-induced glucose uptake (7Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Bingzhi Y. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 8Kotani K. Ogawa W.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that a constitutively active mutant of atypical PKC stimulates glucose uptake in quiescent cells (8Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, microinjection of antibodies specific to PKCλ inhibited insulin-induced translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (18Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These results support the hypothesis that atypical PKC participates in the signaling pathway by which insulin stimulates glucose uptake. To elucidate whether ASIP contributes to insulin stimulation of glucose uptake, we have examined the effects of overexpression of ASIP on glucose uptake induced by insulin and by various other stimuli, as well as on the activation of signaling molecules by insulin, in cultured adipocytes. We now provide evidence that overexpression of ASIP inhibits insulin-induced glucose uptake by specifically interfering with signaling mediated through PKCλ. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained and induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described previously (8Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to PKCλ that were generated in response either to a peptide corresponding to amino acids 197–213 (αλ197) or to a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 190–240 (αλ190) of mouse PKCλ were as described (8Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to ASIP (10Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), to GLUT4 (19Hashiramoto M. James D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), or to Akt (the latter of which recognize all three isoforms of Akt) (20Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) were described previously. Polyclonal antibodies to PKCε, a monoclonal antibody to PKCλ, polyclonal antibodies to Akt2, and a monoclonal antibody to the T7 epitope tag were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Transduction Laboratories, Upstate Biotechnology, and Novagen, respectively. Construction of an adenovirus vector encoding ASIP will be described elsewhere. 2T. Onishi and S. Ohno, manuscript in preparation. In short, cDNA encoding T7 epitope-tagged rat ASIP (10Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pAxCAwt (21Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), and an adenovirus vector containing the cDNA was generated by transfecting 293 cells with the resulting plasmid and DNA-terminal protein complex with the use of an adenovirus expression kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). Adenovirus vectors encoding constitutively active mutants of PKCλ or Akt (AxCAλΔPD and AxCAMyr-Akt, respectively) were described previously (8Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H.

Matsuzaki H. Kikkawa U. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6286-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with various adenovirus vectors as described (17Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and subjected to experiments after ∼48 h. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were deprived of serum for 16–20 h, incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for the indicated time, and then immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen. For assay of PI 3-kinase activity, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (PY20; Transduction Laboratories); the resulting immunoprecipitates were washed, and PI 3-kinase activity in the washed precipitates was assayed as described previously (20Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For assay of Akt activity, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Akt, and the resulting precipitates were assayed for kinase activity with histone 2B as substrate, as described (20Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For assay of PKCλ activity, cells were lysed as described previously (4Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takayanagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S.-I. Mizuno K. Hirai S.-I. Kazulauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with αλ197. The resulting immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A (50 mmMOPS-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 20 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), once with buffer A containing 1m NaCl, and once with a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA. The precipitates were then incubated for 14 min at 30 °C with 0.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a reaction mixture (25 μl) containing 35 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 40 μm unlabeled ATP, and 30 μm myelin basic protein as substrate. All protein kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the reaction mixtures were then fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The radioactivity incorporated into substrates was determined with a Fuji BAS 2000 image analyzer. Glucose uptake was assayed as described previously (8Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected (or not) with adenovirus vectors were incubated for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5.6 mm glucose and 0.5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were washed twice with DB buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm MgCl2) and then incubated in DB buffer with 100 nm insulin for 10 min, growth hormone (GH) (0.5 μg/ml) for 10 min, or 300 mm sorbitol for 60 min. DB buffer (1 ml) containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) and 0.1 mm 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose (1 μCi) was added to each well, and after 5 min, the cells were washed with DB buffer and then solublized with 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The radioactivity incorporated into the cells was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. 3T3-L1 adipocytes in 10-cm plates were deprived of serum for 16–20 h, incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for 15 min, washed three times with HES buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose) on ice, and gently scraped into HES buffer containing 250 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The cells were then passed through a 22-gauge needle 10 times, after which the low density microsome (LDM), plasma membrane (PM), and cytosolic fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation as described (23Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). After determination of protein concentration with the use of the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce), equal amounts of protein (∼20 μg) from each fraction were subjected to immunoblot analysis with various antibodies. ASIP was identified as a protein that specifically interacts with the atypical PKC isoforms PKCλ and PKCζ (10Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). We therefore first examined whether ASIP binds to atypical PKC in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which express PKCλ exclusively (8Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were infected (or not) with an adenovirus vector that encodes T7 epitope-tagged ASIP (AxCAASIP), lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to T7 or to PKCλ or with control immunoglobulin G (IgG). The resulting immunoprecipitates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to T7 or to PKCλ. A protein of ∼180 kDa, corresponding to the molecular size of ASIP, was recognized by antibodies to T7 in the immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to either T7 or PKCλ, but only when the cells had been infected with AxCAASIP (Fig. 1). Conversely, a protein of ∼80 kDa, corresponding to the molecular size of PKCλ, was recognized by antibodies to PKCλ in the immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to PKCλ or to T7. No marked immunoreactive bands were detected in the immunoprecipitates prepared with control IgG. These data indicate that PKCλ associates with ASIP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The immunoprecipitates with antibodies to PKCλ prepared from noninfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes did not react to antibodies to ASIP (data not shown). This may be because a relatively small amount of ASIP protein is expressed in the cells. To investigate the specificity of the interaction between ASIP and PKCλ, we performed similar experiments with antibodies to PKCε or to Akt. However, the 180-kDa protein recognized by antibodies to T7 was not evident in the immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to either PKCε or Akt, and neither PKCε nor Akt was detected in the immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to T7 (Fig. 1). The interaction of ASIP with PKCλ thus appeared to be specific, consistent with previous observations (10Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with insulin did not affect the interaction between ASIP and PKCλ (data not shown). We next investigated the effect of overexpression of ASIP on the subcellular localization of PKCλ. 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected (or not) with AxCAASIP were lysed, and LDM, PM, and cytosolic fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to either ASIP or PKCλ. ASIP was detected only in the LDM fraction of noninfected cells, indicating that endogenous ASIP is abundant in this fraction (Fig. 2). In cells infected with AxCAASIP, however, ASIP was apparent not only in the LDM fraction but also in the PM and cytosolic fractions. Endogenous PKCλ was abundant in the LDM and cytosolic fractions of noninfected cells, with a relatively small amount also apparent in the PM fraction. Overexpression of ASIP reduced the amount of PKCλ in the cytosolic fraction and increased it in both the LDM and PM fractions. Exposure of infected or noninfected cells to insulin had no marked effect on the intracellular distribution of ASIP or of PKCλ. Thus, overexpression of ASIP altered the intracellular localization of endogenous PKCλ. Given that PKCλ is thought to participate in insulin-induced glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (8Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of overexpression of ASIP on these actions of insulin. Infection of the cells with AxCAASIP resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the amount of ASIP protein as assessed by immunoblot analysis; the amount of ASIP in cells infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 150 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell was ∼20 times that of endogenous ASIP (Fig.3 A). Insulin induced an ∼7-fold increase in glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes within 10 min (Fig. 3 A). Expression of ASIP inhibited insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner, with ∼50% inhibition apparent at an m.o.i. of 150 pfu/cell; ASIP had little effect on the basal level of glucose uptake apparent in the absence of insulin. We next investigated the effect of ASIP on the translocation of GLUT4 by subcellular fractionation. Treatment of noninfected cells with insulin reduced the amount of GLUT4 in the LDM fraction and increased the amount of GLUT4 in the PM fraction (Fig. 3 B). Infection of cells with AxCAASIP, at an m.o.i. of 150 pfu/cell, markedly inhibited the insulin-induced decrease in the amount of GLUT4 in the LDM fraction as well as the increase in its abundance in the PM fraction. The extent of ASIP-induced inhibition of GLUT4 translocation was similar to that of ASIP-induced inhibition of glucose uptake. The amount of GLUT4 in total cell lysates was not affected by overexpression of ASIP (data not shown). These results suggest that overexpression of ASIP inhibited insulin-induced glucose uptake by preventing the intracellular translocation of GLUT4. GH and hyperosmolarity each stimulate glucose uptake by promoting translocation of GLUT4 (24Tanner J.W. Leingang K.A. Mueckeler M.M. Glenn K.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Toyoda N. Robinson F.W. Smith M.M. Flanagan J.E. Kono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2117-2122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that glucose uptake induced by these stimuli was not inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of PKCλ (8Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that it is independent of PKCλ. Infection of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with AxCAASIP at an m.o.i. of 150 pfu/cell, a virus dose sufficient to inhibit insulin-induced glucose uptake by ∼50%, had no effect on hyperosmolarity induced glucose uptake and actually potentiated GH-induced glucose uptake (Fig.3 C), suggesting that expression of ASIP inhibits glucose uptake by specifically interfering with signaling through PKCλ. To examine further this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of ASIP on glucose uptake stimulated by a constitutively active mutant of PKCλ. The λΔPD mutant lacks the pseudosubstrate domain and exhibits a kinase activity markedly greater than that of the wild-type enzyme (8Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that ASIP binds to the kinase domain of atypical PKC (10Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), it is likely that ASIP also interacts with λΔPD. Consistent with our previous observation (8Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell.

Overexpression of ASIP inhibited λΔPD-induced glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A). Expression of constitutively active mutants of Akt also stimulates glucose uptake and translocation of GLUT4 in adipocytes (26Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 27Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van-Obberghen E. Le-Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, infection of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with AxCAMyr-Akt, an adenovirus vector that encodes a constitutively active mutant of Akt (22Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Kuroda S. Hino Y. Ando M. Kotani K. Konishi H,. Matsuzaki H. Kikkawa U. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6286-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in the absence of insulin (Fig. 4 B). However, expression of ASIP did not inhibit Myr-Akt stimulation of glucose uptake, suggesting that ASIP does not interrupt signaling through Akt. To elucidate further the mechanism by which ASIP inhibits insulin-induced glucose uptake, we investigated the effects of overexpression of this protein on the activation of various signaling molecules by insulin. Insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase or of Akt was not affected by ASIP (Fig. 5,A and B). Furthermore, overexpression of ASIP had no effect on the insulin-induced translocation of Akt to the PM fraction (Fig. 5 C). Finally, we examined the effect of ASIP overexpression on kinase activity immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PKCλ. Exposure of cells to insulin increased the amount of kinase activity, measured with myelin basic protein as substrate, in such immunoprecipitates by a factor of ∼1.8 (Fig. 6 A). Overexpression of ASIP inhibited the insulin-induced kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner, with complete inhibition apparent at an m.o.i. of 150 pfu/cell (Fig. 6 A). The amount of PKCλ protein in the immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to PKCλ was increased by expression of ASIP in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown), with an ∼2-fold increase apparent at an m.o.i. of 150 pfu/cell (Fig. 6 B). Given that cell permeable pharmacological inhibitors or activators of atypical isoforms of PKC are not available, the cellular functions of these isozymes have been explored with the use either of pseudosubstrate peptides that specifically compete with endogenous substrates for kinase activity or of mutant enzymes that either are constitutively active or act in a dominant negative manner. Such tools have revealed putative roles for atypical PKC in oocyte maturation (28Dominguez I. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mucnico M.M. Berra E. Garcı́a de Herreros A. Cornet M.E. Sanz L. Moscat J. Mol. Cell.

Another approach to investigating the cellular functions of signaling molecules is to identify proteins that directly interact with them. Several proteins that associate with atypical PKC have been identified, including p62/ZIP (32Puls A. Schmidt S. Grawe F. Stabel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6191-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), LIP (33Diaz-Meco M.T. Mucnico M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31706-31710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA that encodes ASIP was also isolated as a result of screening an expression library with PKCζ as a probe (10Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). With the use of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, we have now shown that overexpression of ASIP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes inhibited insulin stimulation of both glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation. GH and hyperosmolarity (sorbitol) also stimulate glucose uptake but in a manner insensitive to a dominant negative mutant of PKCλ (8Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these stimuli induce glucose uptake through a PKCλ-independent mechanism. Our observation that overexpression of ASIP did not inhibit glucose uptake in response to either GH or hyperosmolarity suggests that ASIP attenuates glucose uptake not by an effect on a common component of the transport machinery but by interfering with specific signals transmitted through PKCλ. This hypothesis was further supported by the observation that ASIP inhibited glucose uptake induced by a constitutively active mutant of PKCλ but not that induced by an active form of Akt. It is not clear why overexpression of ASIP enhanced glucose uptake induced by GH. Given that a dominant negative mutant of PKCλ did not exhibit such an effect (8Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is not likely that prevention of signaling through PKCλ was responsible for this action of ASIP. We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that overexpression of ASIP affects not only PKCλ-mediated signaling but also an unidentified signaling pathway that contributes to GH-induced glucose uptake. The results of the present and previous (26Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 27Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van-Obberghen E. Le-Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) studies have shown that constitutively active mutants of Akt stimulate both glucose uptake and the translocation of GLUT4 in quiescent cells. However, studies on the effects of kinase defective Akt mutants on insulin-induced glucose uptake or translocation of GLUT4 have produced conflicting results (20Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar,37Cong L.N. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). It is thus unclear whether Akt plays a role in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. We have now shown that the activation of Akt by insulin was not affected in cells overexpressing ASIP, whereas insulin-induced glucose uptake in these cells was inhibited by ∼50%. Moreover, insulin-induced translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane, thought to be an important step in Akt activation (39Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), was not inhibited by ASIP, consistent with the observation that ASIP did not associate with Akt in intact cells. It is not likely that ASIP inhibits insulin-induced glucose uptake by interfering with signaling downstream of Akt, because ASIP had no effect on glucose uptake induced by a constitutively active mutant of Akt. Although our data do not exclude a role for Akt in insulin stimulation of glucose uptake, insulin-induced activation of Akt alone is likely not sufficient to fully stimulate glucose uptake, at least in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Immunocytochemical analysis of MDCKII and NIH 3T3 cells has revealed that endogenous ASIP is specifically localized to regions of cell-cell contact, most likely at tight junctions, whereas PKCλ not only colocalizes with ASIP in these regions but is also distributed throughout the cytoplasm (10Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). With the use of subcellular fractionation analysis, we have now shown that overexpression of ASIP alters the subcellular localization of endogenous PKCλ in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Whereas PKCλ was abundant in the LDM and cytosolic fractions of control cells, overexpression of ASIP resulted in a decrease in the amount of PKCλ in the cytosolic fraction and in marked and small increases in the amounts of the isozyme in the LDM and PM fractions, respectively. The observation that recombinant ASIP was also abundant in the LDM and PM fractions is consistent with the notion that the altered subcellular localization of PKCλ is attributable to its direct interaction with ASIP. The mechanism by which ASIP inhibits PKCλ signaling in the pathway that leads to glucose uptake remains unclear. Our observation that the amount of PKCλ immunoprecipitated by antibodies to this isozyme from cells overexpressing ASIP was about twice that precipitated from control cells might be explained if one ASIP molecule interacts with multiple PKCλ molecules or if ASIP forms a multimeric complex in cells. Despite the increase in the amount of PKCλ protein, the kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates prepared from cells overexpressing ASIP was lower than that in precipitates prepared from control cells, suggesting that PKC activity is suppressed when it is bound to ASIP. It is thus possible that overexpression of ASIP inhibits PKCλ activity in the cells, thereby resulting in inhibition of insulin-induced glucose uptake. At present, we do not know the mechanism how overexpression of ASIP reduces PKCλ activity. Because the activity of PKC isoenzymes is regulated by its phosphorylation (3Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar), it is possible that ASIP affects phosphorylation of specific residues of PKCλ. Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that ASIP, as well as its worm (PAR-3) and fly (Bazooka) counterparts, participates in asymmetrical cell division or maintenance of cellular polarity (10Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar,12Tabuse Y. Izumi Y. Piano F.

Because ASIP does not contain any known catalytic domain but does possess PDZ domains, which are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions, it is possible that ASIP acts as a cellular scaffold that provides a location for atypical PKC to transmit signals that establish cell polarity. Moreover, ASIP is phosphorylated in vitro(10Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), and our recent experiments showed that ASIP is phosphorylated in intact cells via a PKC-dependent manner. 3Y. Tamai and S. Ohno, manuscript in preparation. It is possible that overexpression of ASIP may displace PKCλ from a compartment in which it plays a role in glucose uptake or may compete with an unidentified substrate that is involved in glucose uptake. Identification of the cellular compartment in which PKCλ acts, or of molecules with which it interacts, to mediate signaling that leads to glucose uptake should help to clarify the molecular mechanism of this important biological effect of insulin."

C-terminal Src kinase high performance liquid chromatography insulin receptor cytoplasmic kinase domain of the IR tris-phosphorylated core kinase domain of the human insulin receptor insulin receptor kinase N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl Protein kinases are enzymes that catalyze transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group from ATP to the alcoholic side chains of amino acid residues on their substrate proteins and peptides. They play important roles in signaling and have been subject to intensive cell biologic, enzymologic, structural, and kinetic scrutiny. Elucidation of the chemical reaction mechanisms of these enzymes is proving to be important in defining the details of their regulation and for designing inhibitors.The reaction mechanism of phosphoryl transfer reactions can favor either an associative or dissociative pathway (Fig.1). In the extremes, these are distinguished by dependence on versus independence from nucleophilicity of the phosphoryl acceptor, respectively, distances between the γ-phosphorus atom and the attacking and leaving group oxygens, and other factors (1Herschlag D.

Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1874-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The associative pathway would benefit from proton abstraction prior to formation of the transition state so that a more reactive oxygen anion is formed, whereas that proton is retained in the dissociative transition state. Earlier kinetic and crystallographic studies of protein kinases, especially the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, demonstrated the importance of a conserved aspartyl residue that is essential for the enzyme-catalyzed reaction (8Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 9Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H.

The location of this Asp166 side chain in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase crystal structure was close enough to the serine hydroxyl that it could create a more reactive nucleophile by removal of the seryl or threonyl proton, in accordance with an associative mechanism (8Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 9Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H. Huber R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), but other kinetic evidence was interpreted as favoring a dissociative pathway (5Zhou J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2977-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Adams J.A.

Never the less, similar positioning of the conserved aspartyl side chain in other protein kinase structures has been offered as further supporting evidence for proton abstraction, thus generating a more reactive entering oxygen as a basis for catalysis (e.g. see Ref. 15Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Skamneli V.T. Oikonomahos N.G. Owen D.J. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6646-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). On the other hand, as discussed by Mildvan (2Mildvan A.S. Proteins. 1997; 29: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), distances as short as 2.7 Å between the entering oxygen and the γ-phosphorus could be estimated from modeling studies (16Madhusudan Trafny E.A. Xuong N.H. Adams J.A. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Protein. Sci. 1994; 3: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and as long as 5.3 Å from NMR (17Granot J. Mildvan A.S. Bramson H.N. Kaiser E.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3537-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); the latter indicates a reaction pathway with a more dissociative character. Furthermore, the mechanism of phosphoryl transfer in chemical reactions of phosphate monoesters, as models for enzyme-catalyzed reactions, appears to be dissociative with relatively little contribution of nucleophilicity to the transition state (18Herschlag D. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 7597-7606Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 19Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2145-2148Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar).

Soc. 1998; 120: 6851-6858Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it would seem that protein kinases should follow a more dissociative pathway.For protein tyrosine kinases, the ability to vary nucleophilicity by aromatic ring substitution on tyrosine facilitated a chemical analysis of the phosphoryl transfer reaction catalyzed by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk).1 Analyzing the pH-independent kinetic parameters for a series of substituted tyrosine derivatives with p Ka s ranging from 5.2 to 10, it was shown that kcat and kcat/Km were relatively independent of nucleophilicity of the attacking phenolic residue, yielding a very small Bronsted nucleophile coefficient (0 < βnuc < 0.1) (6Kim K. Cole P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11096-11097Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The pH-rate profiles also demonstrated that the chemically more reactive phenoxide anion species was enzymatically less reactive than the neutral phenol species. Further studies with Csk revealed that the reverse reaction, where the fluorotyrosyl peptide is the leaving group, gave a Bronsted leaving group coefficient (β1g) of −0.3 (3Cole P.A. Sondhi D. Kim K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This supports protonation of the phenolic Oη in both directions. Thus, evidence from the forward and reverse reactions together suggest that the character of the transition state for Csk is mostly dissociative (26Kim K. Cole P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6851-6858Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Fluorotyrosyl analogs have also been used with the insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase (27Martin B.L. Wu D. Jakes S. Graves D.J. J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 16205-16209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the opposite conclusion had been reached in those studies; i.e. the transition state for phosphoryl transfer seemed to be associative. Therefore, the analysis reported here was undertaken to specifically address this discrepancy between Csk and IR, making use of the following three advances since the earlier work of Graves and co-workers (27Martin B.L. Wu D. Jakes S. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7108-7111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yuan C.-J. Jakes S. Elliott S. Graves D.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7681-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 3) The ternary complex of the catalytic core with a tyrosyl peptide substrate and MgATP analog has been determined, which establishes a distance between Oη of the reactive Tyr and the γ-phosphorus atom of the adenine nucleotide (32Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Our results with the autophosphorylated and maximally activated IRKD support a dissociative mechanism for this protein kinase, show an increase in p Ka of the enzyme-bound fluorotyrosyl group compared with aqueous solution, and demonstrate that this fluorotyrosyl side chain can form hydrogen bonds virtually identical to those between the unmodified tyrosyl residue of the substrate and the catalytic core of the kinase.RESULTSThe insulin receptor is not a soluble kinase; it is a heteromeric transmembrane protein whose intracellular kinase activity is regulated by extracellular insulin binding (44Lane M.D. Ronnett G. Slieker L.J. Kohanski R.A. Olson T.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1985; 67: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To perform these studies in a manner similar to those done with the soluble enzyme Csk, we have utilized the highly purified and activated (autophosphorylated) cytoplasmic portion of the IR. The IRKD was previously shown to be a good model for the holomeric receptor's basal and activated states, and these features are retained by the conserved catalytic core used in crystallization (33Kohanski R.A.

The tetrafluorotyrosyl peptide substrate (fluoro-IRS727) was chosen for these studies, because the unmodified form (IRS727) was cocrystallized with the catalytic core of the IRKD (32Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The peptide-inhibition studies were done using IRS939 as the substrate because of signal to noise considerations in the peptide phosphorylation assays.Kinetic AnalysisKinase assays of IRS727 using the IRKD revealed somewhat different kinetic parameters than those reported previously for the full-length IR (35Shoelson S.E. Chatterjee S. Chaudhuri M. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This was possibly because of differences in assay procedures and kinase or reagent purity. Here, global fitting of the data from our steady-state assays gave the following kinetic parameters at pH 7: kcat = 14 ± 2 s−1, and Km = 0.18 ± 0.02 mm IRS727. Analysis of fluoro-IRS727 showed that it was apparently a poorer substrate than IRS727 at pH 7, with kcat = 0.5 ± 0.1 s−1, and Km = 0.21 ± 0.05 mm. Given the observed rate reduction, and previous claims that no phosphorylation was detected with a different fluorotyrosyl peptide (27Martin B.L. Wu D. Jakes S. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7108-7111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yuan C.-J. Jakes S. Elliott S. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16205-16209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), structural identity of the phosphorylated fluoro-IRS727 product was confirmed rigorously by mass spectrometric analysis after HPLC purification. In addition, >95% conversion to phosphorylated fluoro-IRS727 was observed after prolonged incubation with activated IRKD, determined by the HPLC-based assay (not shown).To assess further the significance of these findings, pH-rate profiles were performed with peptide substrates for IRKD. Preliminary experiments confirmed that IRKD enzymatic activity versustime appeared stable between pH values of 6 and 10. In this range, phosphorylation of IRS727 showed little change in kcat (Fig. 2) or kcat/Km (not shown) 3It was not possible to precisely measure the kcat/Km dependence on pH because of inadequate signal to noise ratios and the tendency of activated IRKD to autodephosphorylate at high enzyme concentration, which would have been employed to increase net product formation and improve the signal. with increasing pH values. In contrast, fluoro-IRS727 showed a marked 18-fold decrease in kcat with increasing pH values; the highest activity was observed at pH 6.0, and a p Ka = 7.6 was calculated for the basic limb (Fig. 2). These results suggest that a group present in fluoro-IRS727 but not in IRS727 requires protonation for enzymatic processing. This group is likely to be the tetrafluorotyrosine side chain. The p Ka = 7.6 is higher than the p Ka = 5.7 measured spectrophotometrically for the fluoro-IRS727 in aqueous solution (Fig.2, inset). This implies that the tetrafluorotyrosine's p Ka is higher when the substrate is bound to the enzyme. At pH 7.0, protonated fluoro-IRS727 in solution is only 5% of the total, calculated from the Henderson-Hasselbach equation and the p Ka of 5.7 of the free peptide. The value kcat/Km , which reflects the protonation equilibrium of the free substrate, should be 20-fold greater than the observed value, because only the neutral phenolic form is the substrate. With this correction it can be calculated that this tetrafluorotyrosyl peptide is only 2-fold less efficient as a substrate than the tyrosyl peptide.Figure 2The pH dependence of kcat for fluoro-IRS727. The log(kcat) was plotted versus the reaction pH values for IRS727 (squares) and for fluoro-IRS727 (circles). The inset shows the spectrophotometric titration of fluoro-IRS727 (triangles). The dotted lines are the best theoretical fit for these data, assuming a single ionizable group in both cases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the phenolate form of the peptide would bind to the enzyme, we measured the inhibitory properties of fluoro-IRS727 at pH 9, where the tetrafluorophenolic group would be fully deprotonated in free solution, and the peptide would be minimally active as substrate (kcat = 0.04 s−1) compared with the varied peptide substrate IRS939 (kcat = 12 ± 2 s−1;Km 0.040 ± 0.002 mm). Fluoro-IRS727 is a linear competitive inhibitor against IRS939, with Ki = 0.59 ± 0.14 mm determined from a global fit of the data (Fig. 3). Therefore the phenolate form of fluoro-IRS727 binds weakly to the kinase.Figure 3Competitive inhibition by fluoro-IRS727.Inhibition of IRS939 phosphorylation was determined at pH 9.0, and the data are presented as a double-reciprocal plot. Reaction conditions are given under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentrations of fluoro-IRS727 were 0 mm (solid circles), 0.32 mm (open circles), and 0.63 mm(inverted solid triangles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Crystal Structure of the Binary ComplexTo gain better insight into the interaction of the tetrafluorotyrosyl group with active site residues in the kinase, the crystal structure of the fluoro-IRS727 complexed with the IRKD core was determined at 2.6-Å resolution (Fig. 4). When compared with the ternary complex of the autophosphorylated core with the unmodified IRS727 and Mg-5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate (32Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), the P0 residue (the reactive tyrosine) of the substrate peptide and key residues in the active site with which it makes contact are virtually unchanged (root mean square deviation of 0.2 Å for the side-chain and main-chain atoms of residues Asp1132 and Arg1136 and the P0 tetrafluorotyrosine). Importantly, the distance between the phenolic hydroxyl and Asp1132 is nearly the same in the fluoro-IRS727 complex (2.8 Å) as in the ternary complex (2.7 Å), indicating that a hydrogen bond is made between these groups in both cases. In addition, the distance between the phenolic Oη and the Nη of Arg1136 is unperturbed, and the hydrogen bond between Nη of Arg1136 and Oδ2 of Asp1132 is also maintained. Together these describe a triangle of hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 4). This structure is compatible with the significant elevation of the phenolic p Ka in the complex compared with free solution.Figure 4Electron density map in the active site of the binary complex between IRK3P and the tetrafluorotyrosine-containing peptide. Shown is an Fo −Fc omit map (30.0–2.6 Å, 3ς contour) in which the side chains of Asp1132, Arg1136, and the tetrafluorotyrosine (Tyr(4F)) were omitted from the map calculation.

A. 1996; 93: 8160-8166Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Mounting evidence suggests that these enzymes affect catalysis by enhancing but not fundamentally altering the non-enzymatic mechanisms. Among the experimental approaches most consistently applied to chemical and enzymatic reactions has been linear free energy relationships to probe the mechanistic role of nucleophilicity (1Herschlag D. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 7587-7596Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Herschlag D. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 7597-7606Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Measurements of βnuc ≤ 0.3 for non-enzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions involving phosphate monoesters suggested only a small impact of nucleophilicity in formation of the transition state and therefore favored a dissociative mechanism (1Herschlag D. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 7587-7596Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Epstein J. Plapinger R.E. Michel H.O. Cable J.R. Stephani R.A. Billington C.A. West G.R. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. B 1172–1182Google Scholar). Extending this conclusion to protein kinases would suggest that proton abstraction, to generate the chemically more reactive anionic oxygen, should not be a significant feature of enzyme-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer.This hypothesis can be tested directly using substrates for protein tyrosine kinases, which offer the unusual opportunity to alter nucleophilicity of the entering oxygen in an enzymatic phosphoryl transfer reaction by modification of the aromatic ring in the substrate (6Kim K. Cole P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11096-11097Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Cole P.A. Burn P. Takacs B. Walsh C.T. J. Biol.

Systematic substitution of hydrogens with fluorine confers a broad range of p Ka effects and allows Bronsted coefficients to be determined. This approach has provided compelling evidence to support a dissociative transition state for the reaction catalyzed by Csk (6Kim K. Cole P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11096-11097Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Kim K. Cole P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6851-6858Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar) but an associative transition state for the reaction catalyzed by IR (27Martin B.L. Wu D. Jakes S. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7108-7111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yuan C.-J. Jakes S. Elliott S. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16205-16209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There were two important concerns not addressed specifically in the study on Csk that are addressed here and that allowed us to re-evaluate the basis for an apparent discrepancy between Csk and IRK catalytic mechanisms. First, because the fluorine atomic radius is only 0.2 Å greater than the hydrogen atomic radius, these substitutions should not impose steric constraints on orientation of the P0 residue in the active site. That has been confirmed by comparison of two structures, showing the virtual absence of any positional difference between the enzyme-bound P0 tetrafluorotyrosine, reported here, and the enzyme-bound P0 tyrosine reported previously by Hubbard (32Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Indeed, this shows that positioning of the phosphoryl-acceptor oxygen occurs even in the absence of MgATP (or analog), at least in a ground state binary complex. This structural observation (Fig. 4) allows greater confidence in the significance of kinetic studies using fluorine-substituted tyrosyl peptides with respect to the phosphoryl transfer mechanism of the natural tyrosine-containing substrates.Second, it was presumed that the p Ka of the fluorotyrosyl derivatives may be altered in the enzyme-bound state (27Martin B.L. Wu D. Jakes S. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7108-7111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kcat versus pH profile likely represents the p Ka of the phenolic group when the substrate is bound to the enzyme (in the ternary complex). It is apparently elevated 1.5–2 pH units when compared with aqueous solution (Fig. 2). The increased p Ka in the bound state is also supported by the x-ray structure, which shows a hydrogen bond present between Asp1132 and the tetrafluorotyrosine phenol. These crystals were grown at pH 8.5, and in order for the neutral phenol to be the major species in the complex at this pH we would expect a higher p Ka in this complex (perhaps 2–3 units greater than for the free peptide). These crystals lack an ATP analog that could affect the p Ka of the phenolic group. Additionally, the p Ka in the solid state may be harder to assess given the presence of large quantities of polyethylene glycol and other factors that might govern crystallization. However, the physical basis for p Ka elevation observed in these kinetic experiments could be the electrostatic repulsion that would result from simultaneous deprotonation of the substrate-hydroxyl and the conserved catalytic aspartyl side chain, whose proximity has been established for IRK (see Ref. 32Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar and Fig. 4).The elevated p Ka may appear surprising at first glance, because the enzymatic reaction ultimately catalyzes proton removal concomitant with phosphoryl transfer. However, we can estimate βnuc ≈ 0.1 by taking into account the fact that kcat/Km should represent all steps prior to the first irreversible step and that kcat/Km of fluoro-IRS727 (solution p Ka = 5.7) is only 2-fold less than IRS727 (the tyrosyl group in solution will have a p Ka = 10). This small value is in good agreement with the βnucdetermined for protein tyrosine kinase Csk using a broader range of fluorotyrosyl derivatives (6Kim K. Cole P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11096-11097Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Kim K. Cole P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6851-6858Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reaction mechanism for IRK favors a dissociative pathway such that facilitation of proton removal early in the reaction coordinate is unnecessary, and apparently unfavorable, as discussed above. Our finding that the phenolate form of fluoro-IRS727 was a weak competitive inhibitor and not a substrate further supports this view. It seems clear, therefore, that a neutral phenolic group of the P0 residue is required for enzymatic processing by IRK, as with Csk, and the transition states for IRK and Csk are likely to be similar.This and other published evidence (1Herschlag D. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 7587-7596Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2Mildvan A.S. Proteins. 1997; 29: 401-416Crossref PubMed"

Based upon the ability of the related serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2) to protect cells against tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced cell death, this study was initiated to investigate the potential cytoprotective activity of PI10. Two different expression systems (i.e.plasmids encoding either PI10 alone or PI10 fused to the tag: enhanced green fluorescent protein, EGFP) were utilized to stably transfect an eukaryotic model cell system (i.e. HeLa cells) that neither expresses PAI-2 nor PI10. The level of PI10 expression in the stable transfectants was found to correlate with their resistance to TNFα-induced cell death. Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that PI10 is able to form SDS-stable complexes (i.e. M r >100,000) with a cytosolic protein(s). Increased levels of the PI10-containing complexes can be detected by TNFα treatment by preventing intracellular degradative activities with the proteasome inhibitorN-carbobenzyloxy-leucine-leucine-norvalinal. PI10-containing complexes are dissociated with conditions known to separate classical protease-serpin complexes (i.e., 1.5 m ammonium hydroxide in the presence of SDS).

The unique tissue and subcellular distribution for this serpin raises the possibility that PI10 may play a key role in normal hematopoietic development, a process that requires the regulation of cell viability, growth, and differentiation. The ability of diverse types of serine protease inhibitors to prevent cell death suggests that intracellular proteases other than cysteine aspartic-specific proteases can also participate in this process (for reviews, see Refs. 4Kumar S. Harvey N.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 5Patel T. Gores G.J. Kaufmann S.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This concept is supported by the observation that the ov-serpin PAI-2 is able to confer resistance from the cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in two cell lines (i.e. HT1080 (6Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20960-20964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HeLa (7Dickinson J.L. Bates E.J. Ferrante A. Antalis T.M. J. Biol.

Unfortunately, highM r SDS-stable complexes between PAI-2 and another molecule have not been observed during these cell death experiments, thus impeding further research on the pathway. Based upon (i) the high amino acid homology (48%) between PAI-2 and PI110 (1Riewald M. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26754-26757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and (ii) our observations that patients with acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia express high levels of PI10 (2Riewald M. Chuang T.L. Neubauer A. Schleef R.R.

Because cells in the monocytic lineage are likely to be exposed to concentrated doses of cytokines, including TNFα, this study was designed to determine whether PI10 also exhibits cytoprotective activity against TNFα.

Pillemer E. Levitt J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1747-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, flat bottom microtiter plates were precoated overnight with affinity-purified rabbit anti-PI10 (10 μg/ml in PBS, 4 °C). The wells were blocked with blotto (5% skimmed milk powder in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 2 h, 37 °C). Test samples and standard curves of purified PI10 were diluted in blotto containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 5 mg/ml goat IgG (Sigma) prior to their incubation (2 h, 37 °C) in the antibody-coated wells. Bound PI10 was detected by sequential incubation with biotin-labeled rabbit anti-PI10 (5 μg/ml, 100 μl/well; 1 h), a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA: 1;1,000 dilution; 30 min), and the substratepara-nitrophenyl phosphate. The resulting color change was measured at 405 nm over 10 min. The assay exhibited a linear range between 0.25 and 5 ng/ml. The specificity of assay for PI10 was confirmed by preabsorption of the biotinylated rabbit anti-PI10 using purified PI10 conjugated to Sepharose.

Briefly, rabbit antisera to GFP (product 8363, CLONTECH) or non-immune rabbit serum (1 μg/ml, respectively) were incubated (1 h, 4 °C) with protein A-Sepharose beads. In indicated experiments, the antibodies were directly coupled to cyanogen-activated Sepharose using the manufacturer's instructions. Washed beads were incubated (16 h, 4 °C) with either nuclear lysates or cytosol derived from the transfected cells. The beads were washed by centrifugation, eluted with boiling/reducing SDS-sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody to GFP (#8362-1, 1:500 dilution, CLONTECH) as the primary detecting antibody. Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG followed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitative immunoblotting was performed by modifying previously described procedures (10Riewald M. Morgenstern K.A. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7160-7167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) to utilize a dose response of purified GFP (0.01–1 ng/lane; CLONTECH) that was included on each immunoblot. Quantification of immunoreactive bands was performed using a laser densitometer and Image Quant software (both from Molecular Dynamics) (10Riewald M. Morgenstern K.A. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7160-7167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Cytolysis was quantitated using crystal violet staining as described by Dickinson et al.(7Dickinson J.L. Bates E.J. Ferrante A. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27894-27904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 104 cells/well in triplicate in 96-well plates for 24 h prior to experimental analysis. Cells were washed and incubated (8 h) in complete growth medium supplemented with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) and TNFα (0–100 ng/ml as indicated in the text). Washed cells were stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 10% ethanol. The dye was eluted with 33% acetic acid, and the absorbance was measured at 480 nm. Duplicate experiments measured cell viability by addition of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals Cell Proliferation Reagent WST-1, 10 μl/well) as described by the manufacturer. EGFP/PI10-transfected HeLa cytosol was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-GFP. The immunoprecipitates were solubilized by incubation (2 h, 37 °C) with 2% SDS. The protein A-Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation and the solubilized proteins incubated (20 min, 22 °C) with an equal volume of either 3m ammonium hydroxide, pH 12, or PBS. Samples were neutralized by dialysis against PBS containing 0.2% SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting with mAb anti-GFP. Based upon the experimental approach suggested by Dickinson et al. (7Dickinson J.L. Bates E.J. Ferrante A. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27894-27904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), the eukaryotic model cell line “HeLa” was selected because these cells neither express PAI-2 (7Dickinson J.L. Bates E.J. Ferrante A. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27894-27904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) nor PI10 (2Riewald M. Chuang T.L. Neubauer A. Schleef R.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thus permit experimental analysis in the absence of endogenously produced PAI-2 or PI10. Because PI10 is present both as a cytoplasmic and a nuclear molecule, we utilized direct immunoblotting of total cell lysates in conjunction with an ELISA for PI10 as a means to identify clones producing PI10. The inset to Fig.1 A demonstrates a representative immunoblotting profile obtained with a pCI/β-gal-transfected (lane 1) and a pCI/PI10-transfected (lane 2) clone. PI10 production was identified by the specific presence of a M r 42,000 protein using rabbit anti-PI10 (lane 2 versus lane 1); however, the binding of normal rabbit IgG (lane 3) to several high M r electrophoresed proteins hindered the initial identification of other M rspecies of PI10. Because studies in the laboratories of both Baglioni (6Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20960-20964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Antalis (7Dickinson J.L. Bates E.J. Ferrante A. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27894-27904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) utilized a crystal violet staining assay to correlate the expression of PAI-2 with a resistance to TNF-induced cell death, a similar protocol was employed to extend this type of analysis to PI10. Fig. 1 A shows a representative experiment demonstrating that four clones of pCI/PI10-transfected HeLa cells are more resistant to TNF-induced cytotoxicity than three clones of pCI/β-gal-transfected HeLa cells. Our laboratory (3Chuang T.L. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11194-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) has described previously the identification of clones of HeLa cells expressing either the fluorescent tag EGFP or the fusion construct EGFP/PI10. Analysis of their sensitivity to TNFα revealed that the clones expressing EGFP/PI10 were also more resistant to TNFα-induced cytotoxicity than those cells expressing EGFP alone (Fig. 1 B). Plotting the log of the concentration of TNFα required for 50% cell death for the PI10- and the EGFP/PI10-expressing clones against the log of the PI10 concentration expressed by a particular clone revealed a linear relationship (Fig. 1 B, inset). The PI10- and EGFP/PI10-transfected cells were also analyzed for their resistance to TNFα utilizing a tetrazolium salt-based assay that measures mitochondrial dehydrogenase as a marker for cell viability (7Dickinson J.L. Bates E.J. Ferrante A. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27894-27904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and results similar to those obtained with the crystal violet staining assay were obtained (data not shown). These data indicate that PI10 expression reduces a cell's sensitivity to TNFα/cycloheximide-induced cell death and the concentrations of PI10 required for this effect are comparable with those previously observed using cells transfected with PAI-2 (7Dickinson J.L. Bates E.J. Ferrante A. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27894-27904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To investigate potential mechanisms by which PI10 might protect cells against TNFα-induced cytotoxicity, it was necessary to optimize an assay that detects trace levels of PI10 associated with another protein. Previous studies in our laboratory with EGFP/PI10 (3Chuang T.L. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11194-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have revealed that the EGFP moiety is not only a practical fluorophore for monitoring the targeting of PI10 into the nucleus but also a useful tag for combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting experiments. Because our present TNFα-mediated cytotoxicity experiments with PI10 extend published observations obtained with cells transfected with the ov-serpin PAI-2 (6Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20960-20964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dickinson J.L. Bates E.J. Ferrante A. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27894-27904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), a molecule that is primarily localized to the cytoplasm (6Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20960-20964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dickinson J.L. Bates E.J. Ferrante A. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27894-27904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), we attempted to utilize the EGFP tag to immunologically enrich and characterize the forms of PI10 both in the nucleus and in cytosol prepared from the transfected cells. As reported previously (3Chuang T.L. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11194-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-GFP is able to immunoprecipitate aM r 80,000 form of EGFP/PI10 from the nuclei isolated from EGFP/PI10-transfected HeLa cells (Fig.2 A, lane 1). Bands at M r 55,000 are also present in samples immunoprecipitated with either rabbit anti-GFP (lanes 1,3, 5, and 7) or rabbit IgG (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) and are caused by the binding of the immunoblotting detection reagents to the electrophoresed rabbit Ig-heavy chains (3Chuang T.L. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11194-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Prolonged exposures are shown in Fig. 2 to permit the detection of trace species of EGFP/PI10 (e.g. M r 30,000 bands in Fig.2 A, lane 1). These small molecular species may represent cleavage product of EGFP/PI10. In comparison, analysis of cytosol preparations revealed that EGFP/PI10 was not only present as aM r 80,000 species but also as a series of highM r bands that co-migrated with the 210-kDa marker (Fig. 2 A, immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP inlane 3 versus normal IgG in lane 4). These high M r species of EGFP were not present in the nuclei or cytosol isolated from cells transfected with EGFP alone (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–8), thus indicating that these species of EGFP were dependent upon the presence of PI10 in the fusion construct. To further delineate the spectrum of EGFP/PI10 species present within the transfectants, we covalently coupled rabbit anti-EGFP to Sepharose beads and utilized these reagents to immunoprecipitate cytosol of several HeLa clones. Fig. 2 Bshows data from six EGFP/PI10-transfected HeLa clones (lanes 2–7) that demonstrates (i) the major species of EGFP/PI10 in the clones migrates at M r 80,000, (ii)M r 210,000 species of EGFP/PI10 are present in all 6 cytosolic samples, and (iii) degradative species of EGFP/PI10 vary between clones. Because polymers of PAI-2 can be detected by electrophoretically separating cell extracts under nondenaturating conditions (11Ny T. Mikus P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the possibility existed that the high M r forms of EGFP/PI10 were caused by insufficient denaturating conditions. Therefore, we investigated to determine whether similar highM r species could be detected in cells transfected with a construct encoding the coding sequence for PAI-2 fused to EGFP. A representative transient transfection experiment is shown in Fig. 2 C that indicates the primary species of EGFP in the cytosol of EGFP/PAI-2-transfected cells migrates with aM r 85,000 (lane 3). No highM r forms of EGFP were detected in the EGFP- or EGFP/PAI-2-transfected cells (lanes 2 and 3, respectively) utilizing an exposure that permits the detection of highM r EGFP-containing forms within the cytosol of EGFP/PI10-transfected cells (lane 4). Similar results were obtained using three clones of HeLa cells stably transfected with pEGFP/PAI-2 (data not shown). These data confirm the observations of several groups indicating the absence of high M rspecies of PAI-2 within cells (for reviews, see Refs. 11Ny T. Mikus P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 12Bachmann F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 175-179Google Scholar, 13Kruithof E.K.O. Baker M.S. Bunn C.L. Blood. 1995; 86: 4007-4024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thus indicate a specificity for PI10 in the formation of these highM r EGFP-containing species in HeLa cytosol. Kumar and Baglioni (6Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20960-20964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) noted the disappearance of intracellular PAI-2 during TNFα-induced cell death, and this observation led to the hypothesis that PAI-2 was interacting with a TNFα-activated intracellular protease, which was subsequently eliminated by the cell's degradative machinery. Because the ubiquitin/proteasome system is currently recognized as the major pathway for selective protein metabolism/degradation within cells (for review, see Ref. 14Kornitzer D. Ciechanover A. J. Cell Phy. 2000; 182: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), experiments were performed using the proteasome inhibitor N-carbobenzyloxy-leucine-leucine-norvalinal (CLLN) (15Haas M. Page S. Page M. Neumann F.-J. Marx N. Adam M. Veigler-Heitbrock H.W.N.D. Brand K. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 63: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to inactivate this system. Treatment of EGFP/PI10-transfected clone 2C2 with CLLN followed by immunoblotting revealed an increase in the M r 210,000 EGFP/PI10 species (Fig.3 A, lane 3) in comparison to nontreated cells (lane 2). In the combined presence of TNFα/cycloheximide and CLLN, the intensity of the highM r species of EGFP/PI10 in the transfect cell cytosol was further increased (lane 5). To quantitate the changes in the EGFP-immunoreactive species that co-migrates with theM r 210,000 marker, the immunoblots were scanned with a laser densitometer and compared with a concomitantly processed dose-response curve of purified GFP. TableI presents data obtained with three representative EGFP/PI10-transfected clones, indicating that the presence of CLLN during TNFα/cycloheximide-induced cell death results in a 7–9-fold increase in the M r 210,000 EGFP/PI10 cytosolic species. High M r species of EGFP was not detected in the cytosol of EGFP-transfected cells under any condition, including treatment with TNF/cycloheximide ± CLLN (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6–9).Table IQuantitative immunoblotting analysis of the high M r forms of EGFP/Pl10 during TNFα/cycloheximide-induced cell deathCloneMr 210,000 EGFP-immunoreactive materialCycloheximide aloneCycloheximide + CLLNCycloheximide + TNFαCycloheximide + TNFα + CLLNng/mg cytosolic proteinGFP/PI10 C2C0.76 ± 0.172.28 ± 0.340.98 ± 0.387.21 ± 0.92GFP/PI10 C2E21.92 ± 0.313.97 ± 0.552.23 ± 0.4713.48 ± 1.73GFP/PI10 C2H80.28 ± 0.090.85 ± 0.210.31 ± 0.112.57 ± 0.33GFP/Pl10-transfected HeLa clones were treated with the indicated reagents.

Cytosol was prepared, subjected to immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and quantitative immunoblotting as described under “Materials and Methods.” Although the high M r forms of EGFP/PI10 suggest the activation of a cytosolic protease(s) and its subsequent formation of an SDS-stable complex with PI10, the related ov-serpin PAI-2 has been observed to form SDS-stable interactions with proteins utilizing amino acids other than the reactive site residue. More specifically, PAI-2 can be cross-linked to vitronectin and other structural proteins utilizing a series of glutamine residues in the loop connecting helix C and D (16Jensen P.H. Schuler E. Woodrow G. Richardson M. Goss N. Hojrup P. Petersen T.E. Rasmussen L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15394-15398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to further characterize the highM r forms of EGFP/PI10 by examining their sensitivity to conditions known to dissociate complexes between several classical serpins and their respective proteases. For example, 1.5m ammonium hydroxide in the presence of SDS is able to dissociate complexes formed between either anti-thrombin (17Danielson A. Bjork I. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), α2-anti-plasmin (18Wiman B. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9291-9297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or PAI-1 (19Philips M. Juul A.G. Thorsen S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 802: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and their target proteases. Fig.3 B shows a representative experiment in which EGFP/PI10-transfected HeLa clone C2E2 were treated with TNFα/cycloheximide in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor CLLN to induce a spectrum of high M r forms of cytosolic EGFP/PI10. These forms were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP, and the SDS-solubilized material was treated with either PBS (Fig.3 B, lane 2) or ammonium hydroxide (lane 3). Following neutralization and SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting with MAB anti-GFP, immunoreactive species of EGFP/PI10 aboveM r 100,000 were detected only in samples treated with PBS/SDS (lane 2). In contrast, EGFP/PI10-immunoreactive species greater than M r 100,000 were not detected in samples treated with ammonium hydroxide/SDS (lane 3). The high M r forms of EGFP present in the immunoprecipitates of EGFP/PI10-transfected HeLa clone 2C2 and clone C2H8 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 4, respectively) were also dissociated by ammonium hydroxide/SDS treatment (data not shown). These observations implicate the existence of a complex between EGFP/PI10 and one or more proteases; however, the predominant use of immunologic reagents against GFP led us to document the presence of PI10 in these high M r species. Therefore, rabbit anti-PI10 was coupled to Sepharose beads and used in conjunction with Sepharose-anti-GFP and Sepharose-IgGnormalbeads to immunoprecipitate cytosol of CLLN- and TNFα/cycloheximide-treated HeLa clone C2H8. Fig. 3 C shows a representative experiment demonstrating that both Sepharose anti-GFP (lane 2) and Sepharose anti-PI10 (lane 3) are able to immunoprecipitate M r 80,000 EGFP/PI10, as well as high M r forms of the construct. Similar immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting results were obtained using the cytosol of clones C2C and C2E2 (data not shown). These studies indicate that the transfer of the gene encoding PI10 into HeLa cells results in recombinant protein expression that correlates with both the formation of high M rPI10-containing complexes and a reduced cytotoxicity to TNFα. Thus, cytoprotective activity against TNFα is not restricted to PAI-2, which raises the potential of a common function for other ov-serpins containing arginine as the P1 reactive site residue. Our observed increase in the M r 210,000 PI10-containing complexes during TNFα/cycloheximide-induced cytotoxicity suggests that a serine protease is activated during this process and consistent with the concept that multiple proteases play a role in the death of cells (4Kumar S. Harvey N.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 5Patel T. Gores G.J. Kaufmann S.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The inability of numerous researchers to detect protease-PAI-2 complexes within either normal or transfected cells (11Ny T. Mikus P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 12Bachmann F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 175-179Google Scholar, 13Kruithof E.K.O. Baker M.S. Bunn C.L. Blood. 1995; 86: 4007-4024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) would suggest that the target proteins for PAI-2 and PI10 are different; however, an alternative explanation can be proposed based upon the unique ability of certain serpins to react against the pro- or single-chain form of proteases. A relevant example is the ability of PAI-1, but not PAI-2, to generate high M r SDS-stable complexes with single-chain u-PA in comparison to the rapid inactivation of two-chain u-PA by both PAI-1 and PAI-2 (20Manchanda N. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20032-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Is it possible that an analogous situation exists concerning the reactivity of PI10 and PAI-2 for various single- and two-chain proteases within HeLa cells? The ability of PI10 to form SDS-stable intermediates with a set of cytoplasmic proteins in both resting and TNFα-stimulated cells provides researchers a useful probe for both identifying these molecules and clarifying their role in the cell death process."
https://openalex.org/W2033196164,"The human neutrophil granule location of precursors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), MMP-8 and -9, has been established, but that of the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) has not. In this study, labeling for TIMP-1, pro-MMP-8, pro-MMP-9, and established granule marker proteins reveals that TIMP-1 is mainly located in distinct oval, electron translucent organelles, a little larger than azurophil granules. A lack of labeling for the fluid phase endocytic marker, bovine serum albumin-gold, the lysosome-associated membrane protein markers, and for glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins, which are enriched in secretory vesicles, indicates the non-endosomal, non-lysosomal, and non-secretory nature of this organelle. Density gradient cofractionation with the least dense, secretory population and some pleomorphism of the organelle suggest it is a ""vesicle"" rather than a ""granule"" population. Colocalization with pro-MMP-9 or pro-MMP-8, in minor subpopulations, suggests that TIMP-1 vesicle biogenesis occurs between metamyelocytic and terminal differentiation and before secretory vesicle synthesis. Pulse-chased IgG-coated latex beads and immunolabeling show that specific and azurophil granules fuse with the phagosome whereas TIMP-1 and pro-MMP-9-containing organelles do not. This suggests that these play no role in phagosomal destruction of IgG-opsonized bacteria. Separate localization and colocalization of these proteins may, however, facilitate fine regulation of extracellular proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1574007400,"Abstract The small GTPase Rit is a close relative of Ras, and constitutively active Rit can induce oncogenic transformation. Although the effector loops of Rit and Ras are highly related, Rit fails to interact with the majority of the known Ras candidate effector proteins, suggesting that novel cellular targets may be responsible for Rit transforming activity. To gain insight into the cellular function of Rit, we searched for Rit-binding proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening. We identified the C-terminal Rit/Ras interaction domain of a protein we have designated RGL3 (RalGEF-like 3) that shares 35% sequence identity with the known Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs). RGL3, through a C-terminal 99-amino acid domain, interacted in a GTP- and effector loop-dependent manner with Rit and Ras. Importantly, RGL3 exhibited guanine nucleotide exchange activity toward the small GTPase Ral that was stimulated in vivo by the expression of either activated Rit or Ras. These data suggest that RGL3 functions as an exchange factor for Ral and may serve as a downstream effector for both Rit and Ras."

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 induce IκB-α phosphorylation, leading to IκB-α degradation and translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus where it activates genes important in inflammatory and immune responses. TNF and interleukin-1 actions are typically terminated by desensitization, and IκB-α reappearance normally occurs within 30–60 min. We found that in normal human FS-4 fibroblasts maintained in the presence of TNF, IκB-α protein failed to return to base-line levels for up to 15 h. Removal of TNF at any time during the 15-h period resulted in complete IκB-α resynthesis, suggesting that IκB-α reappearance was prevented by continued TNF signaling. Long term exposure of FS-4 fibroblasts to TNF led to a persistent presence of IκB-α mRNA, sustained IκB kinase activation, continuous proteasome-mediated degradation of IκB-α, and sustained nuclear localization of NF-κB. Continuous exposure of FS-4 cells to TNF did not lead to a sustained activation of p38 or ERK mitogen-activated protein kinases, suggesting that not all TNF-induced signaling pathways are persistently activated.

The NF-κB family is comprised of several proteins, including p65/RelA, RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105, and p52/p100.

NF-κB is normally sequestered within the cytoplasm due to its interaction with IκB proteins, which bind to the NF-κB Rel homology domain and mask its nuclear localization sequence.

TNF initiates a signaling cascade that leads to IκB degradation by binding to cell surface TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Subsequent signaling (reviewed in Refs. 7Darnay B.G.

The 700–900-kDa IKK complex, comprising the IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ subunits, directly phosphorylates IκB (9Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

Unmasking of the nuclear localization sequence following proteasome-mediated degradation of IκB permits NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, leading to transcriptional activation of a variety of genes. One of the genes transcriptionally activated by NF-κB is the gene encoding IκB-α (12Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), which upon its translation in the cytoplasm returns to the nucleus to dissociate NF-κB-DNA ternary complexes (13Turpin P. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6804-6812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), thereby turning off transcription of NF-κB-driven genes. In addition, newly synthesized IκB-α interacts with NF-κB dimers in the cytoplasm and prevents NF-κB translocation to the nucleus. This autoregulatory loop serves to terminate NF-κB activation so as to prevent the protracted expression of mediators of host defense and inflammation that are regulated by NF-κB. There exist other mechanisms to prevent the deleterious effects that would likely result from persistent cytokine signaling. In view of the well known acute toxicity and chronic inflammatory disorders resulting from TNF overexpression (14Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 15Feldmann M. Brennan F.M. Maini R. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 17: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Kollias G.

The most common mechanism of desensitization involves the down-modulation of cell surface TNFR expression, which can occur by receptor-mediated endocytosis (17Tsujimoto M. Yip Y.K. Vilcek J. Proc.

Alternatively, TNF signaling may be blocked at some point along the intracellular signaling cascade by factors that inhibit the association or function of signaling intermediates in the TNF pathway, such as TRAF-interacting protein (TRIP (24Lee S.Y. Lee S.Y. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar)) and the recently identified silencer of death domain (SODD) protein (25Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In most cells, TNF induces IκB-α degradation within 15 min, which is followed by IκB-α resynthesis and complete reappearance of IκB-α protein within approximately 30 min to 2 h (12Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 26de Martin R. Vanhove B. Çhen Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Complete reappearance of IκB-α protein commonly occurs even if cells are maintained in the continuous presence of TNF (27Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22176-22183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and this has been ascribed to the previously mentioned autoregulatory NF-κB loop and to cellular desensitization to TNF action. We show here that in normal human diploid FS-4 fibroblasts stimulated with TNF, IκB-α is rapidly degraded but IκB-α reappearance is incomplete because cells do not become desensitized to TNF signaling, and newly synthesized IκB-α continues to be phosphorylated and degraded. Continued signaling by TNF in these cells is evidenced by persistent activation of the IKK complex, ongoing proteasome-mediated IκB-α degradation, continued nuclear localization of p65/RelA, and the persistent presence of IκB-α mRNA. We also demonstrate that not all TNF signaling pathways are persistently activated in FS-4 cells, as TNF did not produce a sustained activation of the ERK and p38 MAP kinases. Our results challenge the paradigm that TNF signaling (and cytokine signaling in general) is always rapidly terminated by desensitization. Normal human FS-4 diploid fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). For use in experiments cells at passage 14 were split into 10-cm plates and serum-starved for 2–5 days in DMEM containing 0.25% FBS.

Protein A-Sepharose was purchased fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), and protein A/G-agarose from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A GST-IκB-α construct encoding the N-terminal 62 amino acids of the human IκB-α sequence was provided by Deborah Alpert (New York University School of Medicine). Paraformaldehyde, dimethyl sulfoxide, Hoechst nuclear dye, and Triton X-100 were obtained from Sigma. All radioactive isotopes, including [α-32P]dCTP, [γ-32P]dATP, and35S-Express Protein Labeling Mix, were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Immunoblotting analysis was performed as described previously (30Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in an Nonidet P-40-based lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmpyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 mm sodium fluoride). Lysates were boiled for 5 min in denaturing sample buffer, separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) with 5% milk, and incubated for 16 h with shaking with the appropriate antibody at 4 °C. All antibody dilutions were prepared in TBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide. Anti-IκB-α was used at a dilution of 1:250, and anti-phospho-IκB-α was used at 1:1000. Antibodies against both p38 and phospho-p38 were used at a 1:1000 dilution, anti-ERK was used at 1:500, and anti-phospho-ERK was used at 1:20,000. Detection was accomplished with the use of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or horseradish peroxidase-protein A secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad), both at 1:3000 in TBS, 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence substrate kit (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were lysed in denaturing solution (4 m guanidine isothiocyanate, 25 mmsodium citrate, 0.5% Sarkosyl, and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol). RNA was extracted using phenol/chloroform as described previously (31Gerecitano J. Perle M.A. Vilcek J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). RNA pellets were dissolved in formamide, and 12–15 μg of RNA was electrophoretically separated and transferred via capillary action onto nylon membranes (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell). RNA was cross-linked to the membranes, and membranes were prehybridized for 45 min at 68 °C with QuikHyb (Stratagene). Murine IκB-α and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes (31Gerecitano J. Perle M.A. Vilcek J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the RediPrime random primer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 37 °C. Labeled probes were boiled with salmon sperm DNA, added to the QuikHyb solution, and hybridized with the membranes for 1–3 h at 68 °C. Membranes were then washed in 2× SSC (0.3 mNaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate) with 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min, followed by washes in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, and finally 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Autoradiography was then performed. Whole cell lysates were prepared as described for immunoblotting. The IκB kinase (IKK) complex was immunoprecipitated with an antibody to IKKα (3 μg) for 1–2 h at 4 °C, and immunocomplexes were collected with protein A/G-agarose (1–2 h, 4 °C). The agarose beads were then washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol). Half of the immunoprecipitated fraction was separated via SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the IKKα antibody (1:500) to ascertain that equal amounts of the IKK complex were immunoprecipitated for all treatment conditions. The remainder of the immunoprecipitated IKK complexes was then incubated with a kinase buffer mixture containing 10 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/sample, and 5 μg of GST-IκB-α/sample for 30 min at 30 °C. The kinase reaction was terminated by boiling the samples in reducing sample buffer. Samples were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE; the gel was dried, and autoradiography was performed. To quantify their intensity, autoradiography bands were subjected to densitometric analysis (NIH Image 1.61). Serum-starved FS-4 fibroblasts were plated on glass coverslips precoated with 0.1% gelatin (150,000 cells/coverslip) in 24-well plates. After the appropriate treatments cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. The permeabilized cells were blocked in TBS, 5% bovine serum albumin (1–2 h, room temperature), and then incubated with anti-p65/RelA antibody (1 μg/ml final concentration) for 1–2 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (12 μg/ml final concentration) for 1–2 h at room temperature while shielded from light. Cells were next washed with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and with PBS, counterstained with Hoechst nuclear dye (1 μg/ml) for 10–15 min, and washed with PBS. Coverslips were then mounted on microscope slides and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Serum-starved FS-4 cells were either left untreated or stimulated with TNF as indicated. The cells were then washed and incubated for 1 or 2 h in methionine- and cysteine-free labeling DMEM (Cellgro) containing 0.5 mCi of 35S-Express Protein Labeling Mix. The labeling medium was then removed, and the cells were either immediately lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (for control and t = 0 time points) or “chased” in complete DMEM, 0.25% FBS medium for the indicated times. Cells were then lysed, and supernatants were precleared with normal rabbit serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose. IκB-α was then immunoprecipitated from supernatants with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against IκB-α (4 μg/sample, 1–2 h, 4 °C) and collected with protein A-Sepharose (1–2 h, 4 °C). The beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.4% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The beads were then boiled in the presence of reducing sample buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried and exposed to film. The autoradiography bands were subjected to densitometric analysis, and all values were normalized to and expressed as a fraction of thet = 0 value (designated as “mean normalized arbitrary densitometric units”) and plotted versus time. Logarithmic or exponential curves were fit to the data points and used to calculate estimates of the IκB-α half-life under different treatment conditions. A fraction of the immunoprecipitate was separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the IκB-α antibody to ascertain that equal amounts of lysate were loaded for all treatment conditions (not shown). Normal human diploid FS-4 fibroblasts were treated with either TNF or IL-1 for periods ranging from 15 min to 15 h. The cells were then lysed, and the presence of IκB-α was determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig.1). A 15-min exposure to either TNF or IL-1 led to the complete disappearance of IκB-α. Upon further incubation of cells in the presence of TNF or IL-1, IκB-α gradually reappeared. However, in cells incubated with TNF, IκB-α protein remained below the level seen in unstimulated cells. In contrast, in cells treated continuously with IL-1, the reappearance of IκB-α protein over time was more complete, with IκB-α reaching a level similar to that seen in unstimulated cells by about 4 h. To explain the difference in the extent of IκB-α reappearance in cells treated with TNF and IL-1, we considered the possibility that IL-1 might be more rapidly depleted from the culture medium than TNF. We therefore treated cells with either TNF or IL-1 for 15 h and then restimulated cells with fresh TNF or IL-1 for 15 min (Fig.2). When fibroblasts were restimulated with the homologous ligand, there was no significant decrease in IκB-α, whereas subsequent treatment with the heterologous ligand (i.e. addition of IL-1 to TNF-treated cultures or addition of TNF to IL-1-treated cultures) led to the complete disappearance of IκB-α in 15 min. These findings indicate that following 15 h of continuous treatment with either TNF or IL-1, FS-4 cells are refractory to restimulation with the homologous ligand but are responsive to restimulation with the heterologous ligand. These results further suggested that the complete IκB-α reappearance in IL-1-treated cells was not due to depletion of IL-1 from the culture medium or the loss of its biological activity. As restimulation of cells with the heterologous ligand led to a rapid and complete IκB-α degradation, it is also reasonable to conclude that the apparatus necessary for the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκB-α is intact in cells treated for 15 h with TNF or IL-1. Analysis of IκB-α levels in cells treated for various lengths of time with both TNF and IL-1 simultaneously showed that results at the early time points resembled those seen in TNF-treated cells, whereas the 15-h result was similar to that seen in cells treated with IL-1 alone (data not shown). We next sought to determine whether the failure of complete IκB-α reappearance in TNF-treated cells was reversible. We therefore treated FS-4 cells with TNF for periods ranging from 15 min to 15 h. In one group of cultures, TNF was removed after the initial 15 min treatment (i.e. after IκB-α disappearance), and the cells were then incubated in TNF-free medium for the remainder of the indicated times, whereas other groups were maintained in the continuous presence of TNF until the end of the incubation period (Fig.3 A). This experiment showed that IκB-α protein returned to levels seen in the control cultures by about 2 h following the removal of TNF. In contrast, in the continuous presence of TNF, IκB-α levels remained below control levels for up to 15 h. TNF is known to signal through two cell surface receptors, with TNFR1 being the main signaling receptor (7Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 8Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). To determine whether TNFR1 accounts for the failure of complete IκB-α reappearance in TNF-treated FS-4 cells, we repeated the preceding experiment with a TNF mutein protein that can bind to TNFR1 but not to TNFR2 (32Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Everaerdt B. Loetscher H. Gentz R. Brockhaus M. Lesslauer W. Tavernier J. Brouckaert P. Fiers W. Nature. 1993; 361: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 33Schwenger P. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8089-8094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The results of this experiment (Fig. 3 B) were virtually identical to the findings obtained with wild-type TNF. A TNFR2-selective mutant TNF protein failed to induce IκB-α degradation in the FS-4 cells (not shown). Together, these data suggested that TNFR1 plays a major, if not an exclusive, role in the ability of TNF to modulate the reappearance of IκB-α following its TNF-driven degradation. Our next series of experiments was designed to investigate the mechanism whereby complete IκB-α reappearance was curtailed in the continuous presence of TNF. In one group of experiments we used Northern blot analysis to study steady-state IκB-α mRNA levels in FS-4 cells incubated for periods ranging from 30 min to 18 h, either in the continuous presence of TNF or with TNF removed from the cultures following an initial 15-min stimulation. Peak steady-state IκB-α mRNA levels were reached at 1 h under both continuous and “pulse treatment” conditions (Fig. 4). In the continuous presence of TNF, IκB-α mRNA was sustained near this peak level for up to 18 h. In contrast, IκB-α mRNA levels decreased rapidly upon TNF removal from the culture medium. This result showed that the failure of IκB-α protein to return to control levels in the continuous presence of TNF was not due to a decreased availability of IκB-α mRNA. In fact, our observation that IκB-α mRNA levels were sustained in the continuous presence of TNF, but not when TNF was removed after 15 min, is the opposite of what is seen at the protein level (Fig. 3 A). Increased IκB-α mRNA levels in cells treated continually with TNF probably reflect persistent TNF signaling, with ongoing TNF-mediated NF-κB activation likely to be driving the transcription of IκB-α under these conditions. We then considered the possibility that ongoing proteasome-mediated degradation of IκB-α in cells treated continually with TNF may explain the failure of complete IκB-α reappearance, despite the presence of higher levels of IκB-α mRNA in such cells. FS-4 cells were stimulated with TNF for periods ranging from 5 min to 15 h and treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 as indicated (Fig. 5). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies directed against IκB-α and N-terminally phosphorylated IκB-α. Pretreatment of cells with MG132 decreased TNF-induced IκB-α degradation (Fig. 5, lanes 4and 6, upper and middle panels). Importantly, in cells incubated with TNF for 1, 4, and 15 h, MG132 treatment resulted in the appearance of the phosphorylated IκB-α species as well as in greatly increased levels of IκB-α. These findings indicate that proteasome-mediated degradation of inducibly phosphorylated IκB-α is likely to be important in the failure of IκB-α to return to control levels in cells maintained in the presence of TNF. Seeking further evidence for persistent TNF signaling, we examined the activity of the IKK complex. The IKK complex includes the IKKα and IKKβ subunits and is responsible for the inducible phosphorylation of IκB-α (3Rothwarf, D. M., and Karin, M.

FS-4 cells were incubated for periods ranging from 15 min to 15 h, either in the continuous presence of TNF or with TNF present only during the initial 15 min. The IKK complex was immunoprecipitated, incubated with GST-IκB-α in an in vitro kinase reaction, then resolved on SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography (Fig.6). Results from this experiment indicated that IKK was very strongly activated at 15 min after TNF stimulation. In cells maintained in the continuous presence of TNF, IKK activity decreased gradually at later times but was still detectable after 15 h. Densitometric analysis revealed that the strength of the phosphorylated band at 15 h was roughly 6% of the level observed after a 15-min stimulation. IKK-mediated IκB-α phosphorylation decreased faster when TNF was removed after a 15-min stimulation, with no kinase activity detectable by 15 h. To investigate further the effect of TNF stimulation on NF-κB activation, we examined the subcellular localization of p65/RelA in TNF-treated cells (Fig. 7). Cells were treated with TNF for the times shown, and where indicated TNF was removed after an initial 20-min stimulation. Fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with an antibody against p65/RelA and a Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody and were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Whereas p65/RelA was present in the cytoplasm of untreated cells, cells treated with TNF for 20 min, 1 h, or 15 h showed p65/RelA exclusively in the nucleus, consistent with a persist"

We recently reported that the region extending from −1888 to +46, which includes the promoter, is not capable of conferring expression to human CYP7A1 promoter lacZ transgenes in the livers of mice, but that expression is observed with transgenes containing the entire structural gene. To locate liver-specific elements in other segments of the human gene, DNase I hypersensitivity studies were performed with transcriptionally active, liver-derived HepG2 cells and with transcriptionally inactive HeLa cells. Three DNase I hypersensitivity sites were detected within the first intron of the humanCYP7A1 gene, but only in HepG2 cells. Transient transfection experiments with HepG2 cells revealed a transcriptional repressor within intron 1. Five binding sites for the CAAT displacement protein (CDP) were detected within intron 1. Since CDP is a nuclear matrix protein, two methods were employed to localize nuclear matrix attachment sites within intron 1 of the human CYP7A1 gene. A matrix attachment site was found throughout the entirety of intron 1. Gel retardation experiments and cell transfection studies provided evidence for the repression mechanism. Repression is achieved by displacement by CDP of two hepatic activators, namely HNF-1α and C/EBPα, that bind to three different sites within intron 1.

Additionally, CDP represses transactivation mediated by these two activators. cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase CAAT displacement protein hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 CAAT enhancer-binding protein matrix attachment region DNase I-hypersensitive base pair(s) bovine serum albumin apolipoprotein B chloramphenicol acetyltransferase human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat oxysterol receptor farnesyl receptor special AT-rich sequence-binding protein The rate-limiting step in the major pathway leading to bile acid biosynthesis from cholesterol in humans is catalyzed by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1).1This enzyme is encoded by a single-copy gene that is expressed only in the liver, thus providing a good model for studying liver-specific gene regulation. Transcription of the human and rodent CYP7A1gene is modulated by various hormones (for reviews, see Refs. 1Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar and 2Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), by cholesterol and its derivatives, as well as by bile acids. Additionally, in rats and rabbits, expression of this gene follows a circadian rhythm (3Lavery D.J. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1871-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 4Kai M.H.

Erickson S.K. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1064-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in these regulatory processes remain obscure. Recently, two members of the orphan receptor family, namely the oxysterol receptor LXR and the farnesyl receptor FXR, have been implicated in dietary regulation of the rat CYP7A1 gene. Cholesterol derivatives such as oxysterols are ligands for LXR, which binds to the proximal promoter region of the rat gene, thus stimulating transcription (6Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 7Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B.

Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Similarly, bile acids are the ligands for FXR, and binding of FXR to the rat promoter represses transcription by an as yet, undetermined mechanism. It has not been established whether similar mechanisms operate in the regulation of the human gene, although the DNA sequence of the LXR binding site is not conserved between rodents and humans. Indeed, in humans, the LXR site is replaced by a binding site for the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-1 (9Chen J. Cooper A.D. Levy-Wilson B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our goal is to identify the liver-specific regulatory elements required for the in vivo expression of the human CYP7A1gene. Earlier work identified functional binding sites for several liver-enriched transcription factors in the segment from −764 to +1 of the human CYP7A1 gene (the promoter region). Nevertheless, the segment from −1888 to +46 was not sufficient to confer hepatic expression upon a lacZ reporter gene in transgenic mice, suggesting that additional key hepatic regulatory elements may reside upstream of position −1888, within introns, or 3′ of the structural gene. To identify additional hepatic-specific regulatory elements, DNase I hypersensitivity (DH) studies were carried out. They revealed three DH sites within intron 1 of this gene. Transient transfection studies with HepG2 cells demonstrated that intron 1 has a repressor activity and that the main protein binding to this region is the CAAT displacement protein, CDP (10Barberis A. Superti-Furga G. Busslinger M. Cell. 1987; 50: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Because CDP has been shown to be an integral component of the nuclear matrix, we examined the possibility that intron 1 may harbor nuclear matrix attachment sites (MARs). Our experiments demonstrated that intron 1 contains a MAR. In addition to the chromatin organizational function of the nuclear matrix, MARs have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of transcription. For example, transcription of the variable region of the rearranged immunoglobulin μ gene requires an enhancer localized in the first intron of the gene that is flanked by MARs (11Cockerill P.N. Yuen M.H. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5394-5397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments with transgenic mice demonstrated that activation of the μ gene promoter requires the MARs that flank the intronic enhancer (12Jenuwein T. Forrester W.C. Fernandez-Herrero L.A. Laible G. Dull M. Grosschedl R. Nature. 1997; 385: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the MARs collaborate with the μ enhancer to generate an extended domain of “open” chromatin, accessible to regulatory proteins. Furthermore, nuclear matrix fractions from mammalian cell lines contain DNA binding sites related or identical to those for several transcription factors such as SP1, ATF, C/EBP, AP1, Oct-1, and others (13van Wijnen A.J. Bidwell J.P. Fey E.G. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8397-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an intronic nuclear matrix protein has been shown to repress transcription of the HIV-1 LTR (14Hoover T. Mikovits J. Court D. Liu Y.L. Kung H.F. Raziuddin Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Additionally, the MAR-binding protein SATB1 (special AT-rich sequence-binding protein) has been shown to participate in negative regulation of the murine mammary tumor virus LTR in lymphoid tissues (15Liu J. Bramblett D. Zhu Q. Lozano M. Kobayashi R. Ross S.R. Dudley J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5275-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this report, it is shown that repression of the humanCYP7A1 gene is mediated by the MAR-bound repressor CDP and involves displacement of two hepatic transcriptional activators, HNF-1α and C/EBPα, from their binding sites within intron 1 of theCYP7A1 gene. Plasmids −898CAT and −764CAT have been described previously (16Cooper A.D. Chen J. Botelho-Yetkinler M.J. Cao Y. Taniguchi T. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3444-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To make plasmid p7αI1–764CAT, the 1541-bp full-length human CYP7A1 intron 1 along with 23 bp of exon 1 and 71 bp of exon 2 was amplified by PCR using primers IntI5 (5′-GCC TGC AGA CTA GTC TTA TTC TTG GAA TTA GA GAA G) and IntI3 (5′-GCC TGC AGA CTA GTA GAG GTG GTT CAC CCG TTT GC). The resulting 1585-bp PCR product was digested with SpeI and ligated intoSpeI-digested p-764CAT (16Cooper A.D. Chen J. Botelho-Yetkinler M.J. Cao Y. Taniguchi T. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3444-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to create p7αI1–764CAT. Alternatively, to make p7α-764-I1CAT, the SpeI ends were filled using Klenow DNA polymerase and dNTPs and intron 1 was subsequently ligated into a pOCATlink vector that had been digested with HinCII and phosphatased. The final step for the construction of p7α-764-I1CAT involved ligation of theBamHI fragment containing the CYP7A1 promoter into the BamHI site of pOCATlink situated upstream of intron 1. The orientations of the promoter fragment and of I1 were determined by DNA sequencing. 5′ p7αI1–764CAT, containing 563 bp from the 5′ half of human CYP7A1 intron 1 plus 23 bp of exon 1, was derived from p7αI1–764CAT by digestion with ClaI, and the resulting 591-bp fragment was gel isolated and ligated intoClaI-digested p-764CAT. Orientation was determined by DNA sequencing. 3′ p7αI1–764CAT contains 928 bp from the 3′ half ofCYP7A1 intron 1 and 71 bp of exon 2. It was constructed by digestion of p7αI1–764CAT with ClaI followed by re-ligation. Intron 1 was sequenced by the dideoxy termination method of Sanger et al. (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The CYP7A1 HCDP TATA CAT and 2C3 TATA CAT constructs as well as the apoB HCDP TATA CAT and 2C3 TATA CAT constructs were prepared by blunt-end ligation of the kinased, double-stranded oligonucleotides followed by ligation into a blunt-ended, phosphatased TATA CAT plasmid. Integrity of these constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. HepG2 cells were cultured in monolayers as described previously (16Cooper A.D. Chen J. Botelho-Yetkinler M.J. Cao Y. Taniguchi T. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3444-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DNase I hypersensitivity studies and transient transfection assays with HepG2 cells were described before (16Cooper A.D. Chen J. Botelho-Yetkinler M.J. Cao Y. Taniguchi T. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3444-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A control plasmid (RSV-βgal) to monitor for differences in transfection efficiencies between plasmids, was always included at 5 μg/transfection, and all experiments were performed three times in duplicate. Nuclear matrices were prepared according to the procedure of Cockerill and Garrard (18Cockerill P.N. Garrard W.T. Cell. 1986; 44: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). In brief, nuclei (∼1 mg of nucleic acids/ml) in RSB (10 mmNaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)), 0.25 m sucrose, and 1 mmCaCl2, were digested with 100 μg of DNase I/ml (Worthington) for 1–2 h at 23 °C. After centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellets were resuspended in RSB, 0.2 m sucrose, and an equal volume of a cold solution containing 4 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) was added. After 10 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 15 min, the pellets were extracted twice by suspension in a cold solution of 2m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25 mg of BSA/ml and then centrifuged for 15 min at 4500 × gat 4 °C. The nuclear matrices were then washed with RSB, 0.25m sucrose, and 0.25 mg of BSA/ml at 4 °C and resuspended in the same solution. Although fresh preparations were used in most experiments, occasionally matrices were stored for up to 3 months at −20 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol. DNA binding assays were performed by the protocol of Cockerill and Gerrard (18Cockerill P.N. Garrard W.T. Cell. 1986; 44: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). In brief, 60 μg of nuclear matrix proteins in 10 μl were added to 90 μl of an assay solution prepared to yield a final concentration of 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 2 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.25 mg of BSA/ml, 20 ng of 32P-end-labeled DNA fragments/ml, and sheared, denatured Escherichia coli DNA (50–1000 μg/ml) as unlabeled competitor. Under our experimental conditions, the ratio of labeled DNA fragments to matrices was such that 20–50% of the input DNA bound specifically to matrix proteins. Incubation was for 1–2 h on a shaker at room temperature (23 °C), followed by the addition of 500 μl of assay buffer without DNA and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C to recover the matrices. The pellets were washed in 1 ml of assay buffer without carrier DNA, followed by solubilization of matrix-bound DNA in 0.5% SDS, overnight treatment with 0.4 mg of proteinase K/ml, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation after addition of 10 μg of unlabeled carrier DNA. The purified matrix-bound DNA fragments were resolved on 1% agarose gels (40 mm Tris acetate and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.8)), and the dried gels were autoradiographed. Nuclear halos were prepared as described by Mirkovitch et al. (19Mirkovitch J. Mirault M.-E. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1984; 39: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10A 260 units of nuclei in 10 μl of isolation buffer (3.75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.05 mmspermine, 0.125 mm spermidine, 1% (v/v) thiodiglycol, 20 mm KCl), with 0.1% digitonin, were heated at 37 °C for 20 min to stabilize the nuclei. Seven milliliters of low salt extraction buffer (5 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.25 mmspermidine, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm KCl, 0.1% digitonin, 25 mm 3,5-diiodosalicylic acid, lithium salt (Sigma) was slowly added at room temperature. After 5 min at room temperature, histone-depleted nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 2400 × g for 20 min at room temperature. The pellet was then washed four times with 8 ml of digestion buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.05 mm spermine, 0.125 mm spermidine, 20 mm KCl, 70 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% digitonin, 100 kallikrein inactivator units of Trasylol/ml, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Appropriate restriction enzymes were then added at 1000 units/ml, and digestion proceeded for 3 h at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Solubilized DNA (S) was separated from nuclear scaffold-associated DNA (P) by centrifugation at 2400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. DNA from S and P fractions was recovered after digestion with proteinase K in the presence of 1% SDS, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Naked DNA purified from intact nuclei was digested similarly (and was labeled T, for total DNA). In each experiment, the amount of DNA recovered in S and P was determined from the A 260 of each fraction. Twenty micrograms of each sample was electrophoresed on agarose gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose paper (Schleicher & Schuell BA85) by the method of Southern. The filters were subjected to UV cross-linking and prehybridized for 2–4 h at 42 °C in 5× SSPE (0.75 m NaCl, 50 mmNaH2PO4·H2O, 5 mmEDTA (pH 7.5)), 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution (1% Ficoll, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1% BSA in 1.5× SSC), and 100 μg of salmon sperm DNA/ml. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C in the same solution containing 2 × 106 cpm of32P-labeled probes/ml (∼2–4 × 106cpm/μg). The filters were washed twice in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 5–10 min and exposed to x-ray film. COS cells were transfected (as described above) with 10 μg of expression plasmids for either CDP (pMT2.CDP), C/EBP-α (pMSV.C/EBPα), or HNF-1α (pGEM.HNF-1α), and cellular lysates enriched for these proteins were prepared as described previously (20Lee S.Y. Nagy B. Brooks A.R. Wang D.M. Paulweber B. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Binding sites for transcription factors CDP, HNF-1α, and C/EBPα were identified within CYP7A1 intron 1, using the online TRANSFAC 3.5 data base sequence search and analysis service (21Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). Single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed, purified, and end-labeled according to procedures previously described (22Brooks A.R. Blackhart B.D. Haubold K. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7848-7859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The larger oligonucleotide probes used in the C/EBPα/CDP displacement studies were generated using PCR with either CDP site 2 in combination with the antisense I1-C/EBPα oligonucleotide (probe 2C) or with CDP site 3 antisense oligonucleotide (probe 2C3) and I1FCAT plasmid DNA as template. The probe for C3 was similarly made using PCR but with the I1-C/EBPα oligonucleotide and the antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to site 3-CDP. Antibodies specific for CDP, HNF-1α, and C/EBPα were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. Binding reactions and electrophoretic analyses of DNA-protein complexes were performed as described elsewhere (22Brooks A.R. Blackhart B.D. Haubold K. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7848-7859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically 1 ng of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was incubated with extracts (5–10 μg of protein) for 20 min at 25 °C. Competition assays were performed utilizing 200 ng of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides. For supershift reactions, the binding reaction was preincubated at 25 °C for 15 min prior to the addition of 5–10 μg of antibody, and antibody binding reactions were incubated an additional 15 min at 25 °C. DNA-protein and antibody supershifted complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing 0.5× TBE gels and were visualized by autoradiography of dried gels. The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed below.

DH sites reflect an open chromatin structure which could facilitate binding of transcriptional activators or repressors. To this end, nuclei from transcriptionally active HepG2 cells and from transcriptionally inactive HeLa cells were incubated with DNase I as indicated in the top panel of Fig. 1, followed by digestion withApaI and PstI to generate a 4578-bp fragment from the region of interest. In HepG2 cells (Fig. 1, top left), the original fragment was progressively digested by DNase I; concomitant with this process, four DH sites emerged and were named DH1, -2, -3, and -4. DH1 maps in the promoter region and has been previously reported by this laboratory (16Cooper A.D. Chen J. Botelho-Yetkinler M.J. Cao Y. Taniguchi T. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3444-3452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The three new DH sites (DH2, -3, and -4) all mapped within intron 1, at the positions indicated at the bottom of Fig. 1. DH2 and DH4 were very strong, whereas DH3 was weaker. These DH sites were absent in nuclei from HeLa cells (Fig. 1, top right), indicating that it is the chromatin structure of this region in HepG2 cells (but not in HeLa cells) that makes these DNA sites open and available for interaction with nuclear proteins. Next we asked whether intron 1 may harbor a regulatory activity. Accordingly, a 1585-bp fragment containing intron 1 was inserted in both orientations upstream of a CYP7A1promoter CAT gene construct (−764CAT) and tested for its ability to modulate the activity of the promoter in transient transfection assays with HepG2 cells (Fig. 2 B). For simplicity, the CAT activity of the promoter alone was set at 1.0, and the data are presented as the mean value of 6 transfections ± standard deviation. In its forward orientation, intron 1 (I1F) decreased transcriptional activity of the CYP7A1 promoter almost 10-fold, whereas in the reverse orientation (I1R), the reduction was less pronounced. Intron 1 was also cloned upstream of another liver-specific promoter, that from the human apolipoprotein B gene (apoB). Again, intron 1 reduced transcriptional activity of the apoB promoter in both orientations by about 5-fold. These data establish the presence of a transcriptional repressor within the first intron of the human CYP7A1 gene. In an attempt to further localize the repressor, we took advantage of the knowledge of the locations of DH sites 2, 3, and 4 and divided intron 1 into two segments; one containing its 5′ end (5′I) and including DH2 and another 3′ segment (3′I) containing DH sites 3 and 4. Fragments 5′I and 3′I (Fig.2 A) were inserted upstream of the human CYP7A1 and apoB promoters and transfected into HepG2 cells. The results in Fig.2 B show that 5′I and the 3′I segments repressed both the CYP7A1 and the apoB promoter by about 3–5-fold. The 5′I1R construct repressed both promoters by about 3-fold. Finally, the 3′I1F segment also repressed both promoters between 3- and 5-fold. These data indicate that functional negative regulatory elements are present in each of the two segments of intron 1. To further validate our results, we made a construct in which intron 1 was cloned in between exon 1 and the reporter gene, to mimic its natural location in the human CYP7A1 gene. In this construct, intron 1 repressed the activity of the reporter gene by 10-fold, just as it did when placed upstream of the promoter. From our data in Fig. 2, we conclude that the repressor effect of intron 1 is independent of position, orientation, and promoter context, reminiscent of a silencer. In an attempt to identify the repressor protein(s) involved in the activity of intron 1, we searched a transcription factor binding site data base for matches to sequences within intron 1 (21Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). We noticed several matches to the recognition sequence for the CCAAT displacement protein CDP. CDP belongs to a subgroup of a homeodomain family of DNA binding factors, thecut family, because its homeodomain resembles thecut homeodomain first identified in Drosophila(23Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7757-7761Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). CDP has been implicated in several systems as a transcriptional repressor of developmentally regulated genes (10Barberis A. Superti-Furga G. Busslinger M. Cell. 1987; 50: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 24Lievens P.M.J. Donady J.J. Tufarelli C. Neufeld E.J. J. Biol.

For these reasons, the five sites representing the best matches to the CDP binding site and that were situated in the vicinity of the DNase I-hypersensitive sites (shown in Fig. 1 A) were studied further. Oligonucleotides encompassing these sites were synthesized and tested for binding to CDP from a COS cell extract enriched in CDP protein in gel retardation assays. First, the ability of these five potential CDP oligomers to compete for binding of CDP to the high affinity CDP binding site from the gp91 phox gene promoter was evaluated (25Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gp91 phox probe formed the expected retarded complexes with CDP (Fig.3 B, lane 1); specificity of binding was evidenced by competition with a 100-fold excess of non-radioactive gp91 phox oligomer (lane 2). A CDP antibody supershifted the retarded complexes (lane 8), providing unequivocal evidence that the retarded complexes observed with gp91 phox were due to binding to this probe by CDP. As observed in lanes 3–7, sites 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 from the human CYP7A1 gene competed well for binding of CDP to the consensus gp91 phox probe, providing the first evidence that these four sites indeed represent CDP-binding sites. This preliminary observation was confirmed directly using each one of the oligomers for sites 1–5 as probes in gel shifts with the CDP-enriched extract (Fig. 4). In Fig. 4 A, binding of CDP to sites 1 (lane 1) and 2 (lane 5) is demonstrated. Specificity of binding is shown in lanes 2 and6, respectively. The gp91 phox oligomer competes well for binding of CDP to site 1 (lane 3) and site 2 (lane 7). Finally, a CDP antibody supershifts CDP complexes representing binding to sites 1 and 2 (lanes 4 and 8). A similar gel is shown in Fig. 4 B, demonstrating binding of CDP to site 3 (lanes 1–4), site 4 (lanes 5–8), and site 5 (lanes 9–12) of intron 1 of the CYP7A1 gene. The combined data in Fig. 4demonstrate that sites 1–5 within intron 1 of the humanCYP7A1 gene are bound by CDP.Figure 4Binding of CDP to sites 1–5 of the human CYP7A1 gene. Panel A shows a gel retardation experiment with CDP site 1 and CDP site 2 probes, andpanel B shows a gel shift experiment with CDP sites 3, 4, and 5 as probes. The layout of the figure is similar to that in panel B of Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because CDP has been reported to be a nuclear matrix protein, we asked whether intron 1 harbored nuclear MARs. Two methods were employed to answer this question. In the first method (18Cockerill P.N. Garrard W.T. Cell. 1986; 44: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), nuclear matrix proteins are first isolated and challenged with32P-labeled DNA segments in the presence of increasing amounts of E. coli DNA as a nonspecific competitor. After centrifugation to remove the unbound radioactive DNA, the labeled DNA is resolved on agarose gels. Fig. 5illustrates our data with several matrix “bound” and “unbound” DNA segments of interest. The left portion ofpanel A shows that a 600-bpNdeI-StuI fragment (see map inlower panel C), contained entirely within intron 1, does bind strongly to matrix proteins, even in the presence of a large excess of E. coli DNA (300 μg). Similarly, the 441-bp StuI-XbaI fragment contained entirely within intron 1 is also bound by nuclear matrix proteins (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5–7), indicating that the MAR region probably extends 3′ of theStuI site toward the XbaI site (seemap in panel C). Finally, a 209-bpNotI-NdeI fragment from the 5′-most segment of intron 1 that does not contain exon 1 sequences, also binds to the nuclear matrix (Fig. 5 A, lanes 8–10). The combined data in Fig. 5 A indicate that the MARs may extend over the entire length of intron 1. Two segments of the CYP7A1 gene that were not bound to matrix proteins are shown in Fig. 5 B. The first is a 306-bp segment located 3′ of the 5′ AluI repeat (lanes 1–4) where it is clear that binding was totally absent in the presence of 250 μg of E. coli DNA competitor (lane 2).

The rat Kir7.1 gene spans >40 kilobases (kb) and consists of eight exons; the first four exons encode the 5′-untranslated region that is unusually long (∼3 kb). The coding region is located in exons 5 and 6. In the testis, exon 4 is processed as four exons (4a–4d), whereas it is recognized as a single exon in the small intestine. The three major species of rat Kir7.1 mRNA (1.4, 2.2, and 3.2 kb) were found to arise from alternative usage of the two promoters and polyadenylation signals and by alternative splicing of the 5′-noncoding exons. The splicing pattern of the 5′-noncoding exons is quite complex and highly tissue-specific, suggesting that complex mechanisms may operate to regulate the Kir7.1 expression. Deletion and mutational analysis of the promoter activity indicated that the rat Kir7.1 gene is regulated by cAMP through a CCAAT element. The cAMP induction was also demonstrated using the rat follicular cell line FRTL-5 endogenously expressing Kir7.1.

Davidson N. Lester H.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 2Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The functional Kir channels are formed by association of four such 2TM/1P subunits and are characterized by their ability to conduct large inward currents at potentials negative to the K+equilibrium potential and small outward currents at more positive potentials. The presence of inward rectifier K+ channels was recognized as early as 1949 (3Katz B. Arch. Sci. Physiol. 1949; 2: 285-299Google Scholar), and since then the channels have been characterized mainly by a combination of electrophysiological and pharmacological techniques. In the past 7 years, however, triggered by the first molecular cloning of the ATP-regulated inward rectifier ROMK1 (4Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and the classical strong rectifier IRK1 (5Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), a large number of Kir family members have been cloned, expressed in recombinant systems, characterized, and classified into seven subfamilies, Kir1–Kir7, based on their sequence similarities and functional properties such as the sensitivity to ATP (Kir1 and Kir6) and coupling with G proteins (Kir3). The above mentioned ROMK1 and IRK1 are now called Kir1.1 and Kir2.1, respectively. In addition to the molecular dissection aimed at clarifying the structure-function relationship, cloning of Kir family members also helped the determination of their tissue distributions by Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry, which in turn, together with the electrophysiological properties, provided useful information concerning their physiological roles. The functions of the Kir family members include maintenance of the resting membrane potential, regulation of the duration of action potential, coupling of cellular metabolism with membrane excitability, and secretion and absorption of K+ions across plasma membranes of epithelial cells to maintain K+ homeostasis. Kir7.1, the latest member of the Kir family, was first described by Krapivinsky et al. (6Krapivinsky G. Medina I. Eng L. Krapivinsky L. Yang Y. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) in 1998 by computer-assisted data base search combined with molecular cloning for full-length cDNA. Using similar approaches, other groups including ours have also identified the same channel independently (7Partiseti M. Collura V. Agnel M. Culouscou J.M. Graham D.

J. 1999; 342: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Kir7.1 shares the 2TM/1P membrane topology with other members but is unique in exhibiting very low single channel conductance, which is due to the replacement with methionine of the positively charged arginine residue in the pore region that is conserved among other Kir family members (6Krapivinsky G.

As for physiological functions, Kir7.1 has been suggested to help set membrane potential by providing a steady background K+ current (6Krapivinsky G. Medina I. Eng L. Krapivinsky L. Yang Y. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and to be involved in the transepithelial transport of potassium (8Döring F. Derst C.

Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) based, respectively, on its uniquely low single channel conductance and on its high expression in ion-transporting epithelial cells. We further suggested its functional coupling with Na+,K+-ATPase based on their colocalization, revealed by immunohistochemistry, in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and small intestine and the follicular cells of the thyroid gland (9Nakamura N. Suzuki Y. Sakuta H. Ookata K. Kawahara K. Hirose S. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For better understanding of the physiological roles of Kir7.1, it is also necessary to know how its levels and activity are regulated to allow the channel to fulfill the needs of particular tissues and cells. In the present study, as a first step to address this question, we isolated the rat Kir7.1 gene, determined its structure and the splicing patterns of the transcript, and showed that the expression of the Kir7.1 gene is under the control of cAMP. Interestingly, deletion and mutational analysis of the promoter region indicated that the cAMP sensitivity is conferred through an inverted CCAAT element rather than the CRE or AP-1 sites as recently recognized in the promoters of the CFTR (12Pittman N.

Another question we addressed here is how multiple species of Kir7.1 mRNA are generated, since three major species of the Kir7.1 message have been demonstrated to occur in the rat in a tissue-specific manner: 2.2-kb species in the testis and 3.2- and 1.4-kb species in other tissues. A rat testis cDNA library constructed in λZAP II (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was screened using an EcoRI fragment of rat Kir7.1 cDNA (9Nakamura N. Suzuki Y. Sakuta H. Ookata K. Kawahara K. Hirose S. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Filters were prehybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 42 °C and then hybridized overnight at 42 °C in the same solution containing 32P-labeled probe. Filters were washed twice in 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 20 min and once in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 2 h. Positive inserts were subcloned into pBluescript II SK− (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) by the in vivo excision and recircularization process in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol and sequenced. A rat genomic library constructed in λEMBL3 SP6/T7 (CLONTECH) was screened as described above. Eight positive inserts were digested withXbaI and NheI or DraI andStuI, and the digests were subcloned into pBluescript II SK− using a XbaI or EcoRV restriction site, respectively, and sequenced. To isolate the 5′-flanking region of the rat Kir7.1 gene, a rat GenomeWalking kit (CLONTECH), which is a tagged rat genomic library, was subjected to nested PCR using Advantage Genomic Polymerase (CLONTECH). The first round PCR was performed using a primer for the tagged sequence of the library, AP1 (5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′), rat Kir7.1-specific primer UP-4R (5′-CCTCTAACCTAGCGATACAGTAGTAAGCG-3′, antisense), and the following conditions: six cycles of 94 °C for 25 s and 72 °C for 4 min and then 32 cycles of 94 °C for 25 s and 67 °C for 4 min, with a final elongation of 67 °C for 4 min. The second round PCR was performed using the primers AP2 (5′-ACTATAGGGCACGCGTGGT-3′, for the tagged sequence nested to AP1) and UP-5R (5′-TGTCGACCTTCAGAGCTGCATCTTCAGGCG-3′, antisense), and the following conditions: five cycles of 94 °C for 25 s and 72 °C for 4 min and then 22 cycles of 94 °C for 25 s and 67 °C for 4 min, with a final elongation of 67 °C for 4 min. PCR products were gel-purified, subcloned, and sequenced. RNA was isolated from rat brain, kidney, small intestine, and testis, and poly(A)+RNA was purified using an mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Single strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of mRNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and an oligo(dT)12–18 primer. To isolate alternative spliced forms with different 5′-UTR sequences in small intestine, PCR amplification was performed using the primers S1 (5′-AGGCGTTGGTCCACTTTCCT-3′, sense) and A1 (5′-AAGATACACAAGACCTCTTTGAGCAC-3′, antisense) and the following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min and then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, with a final elongation of 72 °C for 15 min. To determine tissue-specific usage of 3′-UTR exons, PCR amplification was performed using the primers S4 (5′-CGCCTGCAGTTCCTCTCAGCAATGCAA-3′, sense) and A3 (5′-TGAAACTAGAGATACAGACTGT-3′, antisense) and the following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min and then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, with a final elongation of 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were gel-purified, subcloned, and sequenced. 3′-RACE was performed using a 5′/3′-RACE kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of rat small intestine or testis poly(A)+ RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and an oligo(dT)-anchor primer (5′-GACCACGCGTATCGATGTCGACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT(A/C/G)-3′). The cDNA was amplified using an anchor-specific primer (5′-GACCACGCGTATCGATGTCGAC-3′), and the sense primer P2 (5′-CGCCTGCAGGTCTCTGCTGTACTCTAT-3′) and reamplified with the same anchor-specific primer and the primer S4. PCR products were gel-purified, subcloned, and sequenced. To determine the transcription start site of the rat Kir7.1 gene, the CapSite™ hunting method (16Maruyama K. Sugano S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 138: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) was used in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). CapSite cDNA® from rat small intestine or testis, in which the 5′-terminal m7GpppN cap structure of mRNA was removed and recapped by the 3′-end of a specific 38-mer oligonucleotide (rOligo; 5′-CAACGCAATGTTCCATGCGGTGTCGCATACTACGCATT-3′) was subjected to nested PCR. The first round PCR was performed using therOligo-specific primer 1RC (5′-CAAGGTACGCCACAGCGTATG-3′) and rat Kir7.1-specific primer A6 (5′-TCAACTTGGCTGAGGTGACATT-3′, for amplification of small intestine CapSite cDNA), A1 (for small intestine CapSite cDNA), or A4 (5′-TCTCCTCTGTTAGCTGCCAGT-3′, for testis CapSite cDNA). The second round PCR was performed using the rOligo-specific primer 2RC (5′-GTACGCCACAGCGTATGATGC-3′) and rat Kir7.1-specific primer A7 (5′-ATAATGGCACAGAGGATACAGCAC-3′, for small intestine), A8 (5′-CTTTACAATTCCTGCTGTCCAT-3′, for small intestine), or A5 (5′-TGTCATGGACAGTGATGATCA-3′, for testis). The reactions were performed using the following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min and then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 60 s, with a final elongation of 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were subcloned and sequenced. The transcription start sites were determined by identification of the boundary sequence between rOligo and rat Kir7.1 mRNA sequence. DNA was sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method using a SequiTherm Long-Read cycle sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) and an automated laser fluorescent DNA sequencer (model 4000, LI-COR; Lincoln, NE). DNA sequences were analyzed using the computer program GENETYX-MAC (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan). Exon-intron boundaries were identified by comparing the genomic and cDNA sequences. All DNA fragments of the promoter regions 1 and 2 were amplified by PCR using rat genomic DNA as the template, subcloned into the pBluescript II SK− vector, and verified by sequencing. The promoter region 1 from nt +76 to −1067 (numbered with respect to the transcription initiation site) was amplified using the upstream primer tagged with the XhoI restriction site (5′-TCCCTCGAGATCTATCATCTCTACAGTCTA-3′) and the downstream primer tagged with the HindIII restriction site (5′-GGCAAGCTTCGTTTAGTTTGTTGTCAAGTG-3′). The amplified fragment was subcloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pBluescript II SK− vector (designated pBS-P1) or pSEAP2-Basic vector (CLONTECH, designated pP1). The pP1 vector was digested with XhoI and BglII or ApaI, end-filled with Klenow fragments (Takara) and recircularized to generate plasmids containing segments of the promoter region from nt +76 to −551 or −315, respectively (designated pP1b or pP1c). The pBS-P1 vector was digested with XhoI andHpaI, end-filled, and recircularized. And then the segment of the promoter region from nt +76 to −668 was excised withKpnI and HindIII and subcloned into the same sites of the pSEAP2-Basic vector (designated pP1a). The promoter region 2 from nucleotide +64 to −969 (numbered with respect to the transcription initiation site) was amplified using the upstream primer tagged with the HindIII restriction site (5′-TGGAAGCTTTTACTTCAAACAAACAGTGT-3′) and the downstream primer tagged with the EcoRI restriction site (P2R1; 5′-AAGGAATTCGGAAGCTAGCAGACTCTTGTC-3′). The amplified fragment was subcloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pSEAP2-Basic vector (designated pP2). The pP2 vector was digested with HindIII and EcoRV, end-filled, and recircularized to generate a plasmid containing a segment of the region from nucleotide +64 to −357 (designated pP2b). The segments of the region from nucleotide +64 to −551, −188, or −91 were amplified using the upstream primers tagged with the XhoI restriction site (5′-TGGCTCGAGCCTTTGCAATTAAGAAAGGGG-3′; P2F3, 5′-TGGCTCGAGGCTTTCTCCAGAGTTGTTAAG-3′; or 5′-TGGCTCGAGCCTGCAGACTAAGTGACCCAAT-3′, respectively) and the downstream primer P2R1. The amplified fragments were subcloned into the XhoI and EcoRI sites of pSEAP2-Basic vector (designated pP2a, pP2c, and pP2d, respectively). To change nucleotides −96 to −99 (5′-TTGG-3′) to 5′-GCTT-3′ in the pP2c plasmid, site-specific mutagenesis was performed as follows. First PCR was performed using P2F3 and the mutagenic primer (5′-GTCTGCAGGGGGGAAGCTTAGCTCTGATCA-3′). Second PCR was performed using the amplified fragment of the first PCR and P2R1, and the resulting fragment was subcloned into the XhoI andEcoRI sites of the pSEAP2-Basic vector (designated pP2c-mut). COS-7 (in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum) and CHO-K1 cells (in Ham's modified F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum) were seeded on 35-mm plates to give 70–90% confluency at the transfection. The appropriate SEAP reporter vector (2 μg) was co-transfected with the pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH, 1 μg) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA (3 μg total) with Plus reagent (12 μl) and LipofectAMINE reagent (8 μl) were first added to Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies) in separate tubes to a total volume of 200 μl each. The solutions were combined and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. An additional 1.6 ml of Opti-MEM I was added, and the mixture was applied to one dish of cells, which was then returned to the tissue culture incubator. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of standard culture medium with or without 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP. After 48-h transfection, the medium was harvested for measurement of SEAP activity, and the cells were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline for measurement of concentration of green fluorescent protein. SEAP activity was measured using a Great EscAPe SEAP fluorescence detection kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The culture medium containing SEAP (50 μl) was diluted with an equal volume of 1× dilution buffer and incubated at 65 °C for 30 min to inactivate the endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. The sample was mixed with assay buffer (194 μl) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Next, the sample was incubated with 1 mm4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (6 μl) at room temperature for 1 h, and then the fluorescence was measured at 460 nm when excited at 360 nm using a CytoFluor-4000 plate reader. Concentration of green fluorescent protein was determined by measuring the green fluorescence in cell lysates at 530 nm when excited at 480 nm. The SEAP activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by the green fluorescent protein concentrations and then averaged from 3–6 independent measurements. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. FRTL-5 cells (ATCC CRL 8305; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), a strain of rat thyroid follicular cells, were grown in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) calf serum and a six-hormone mixture (6H medium) containing somatostatin (10 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (10 nm), transferrin (5 μg/ml), glycyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine acetate (10 ng/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), and TSH (1 milliunit/ml). For measuring the effects of TSH, insulin, and 8-Br-cAMP on the levels of Kir7.1, the cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then maintained in culture medium without TSH and insulin (4H medium) for a period of 4 days before experiments. Under this condition, TSH, insulin, and 8-Br-cAMP were added to the cells in 4H medium at 1 milliunit/ml, 10 μg/ml, and 1 mm, respectively. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from the rat stomach, small intestine, and testis, using an mRNA purification kit. Poly(A)+ RNA (3 μg/lane) was electrophoresed and transferred to a Magna nylon membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA) and hybridized with a32P-labeled rat Kir7.1 cDNA probe. In the case of determining the effects of TSH and cAMP on the Kir7.1 message levels, total RNA was isolated from FRTL-5 cells using the method described previously (9Nakamura N. Suzuki Y. Sakuta H. Ookata K. Kawahara K. Hirose S. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Total RNA (30 μg/lane) was electrophoresed and transferred to a Magna nylon membrane and hybridized with32P-labeled rat Kir7.1, Na+,K+-ATPase α1 subunit, or β-actin cDNA. Hybridization was performed in the solution containing 50% formamide, 5× SSPE, 2× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C for 16 h, and the membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 20 min and once in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS overnight at 55 °C. The membranes were exposed to an imaging plate, and the results were analyzed using a BAS-2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). FRTL-5 cells were washed six times in Hanks' balanced salt solution, scraped from culture dishes, and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized immediately. The extract was then centrifuged at 20000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatants (10 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After blocking in TBST (150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, the blot was incubated with a previously characterized anti-Kir7.1 peptide antiserum (9Nakamura N.

J. 1999; 342: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) at a 1:1000 dilution overnight at 4 °C, incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Tago, Burlingame, CA) at a 1:3000 dilution for 4 h at 4 °C, and then developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (BCIP/NBT) as chromogenic substrates. A rat genomic DNA library, constructed in λEMBL3, was screened for the Kir7.1 gene using, as a probe, the previously cloned cDNA (9Nakamura N. Suzuki Y. Sakuta H. Ookata K. Kawahara K. Hirose S. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Eight positive clones (Fig.1 A) were isolated and sequenced. By comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the genomic clones with the already known cDNA sequence, most of the exon-intron organization was defined including the exons coding for the entire open reading frame and 3′-untranslated region (Fig.1 A, exons 5–8). However, the number of exons that encode the 5′-untranslated region and their positions could not be determined because of lack of the 5′-UTR sequence information; although our cDNA clone covered the entire 3′-UTR, it contained only a partial sequence of the 5′-UTR. To determine the complete 5′-UTR sequence, therefore, we isolated cDNA clones from a rat testis cDNA library and sequenced them (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, the 5′-most sequence of cDNA was determined by nested PCR amplification of cap site cDNA prepared from rat testis and small intestine mRNA (Figs. 1 B, 4, and 5). Again, comparison of the cDNA and genomic DNA sequences allowed us to determine the complete exon-intron organization of the rat Kir7.1 gene (Fig. 1 A). The cDNA sequences suggested alternative splicing of Kir7.1 pre-mRNA in the 5′-UTR as described later in detail (Fig.1 B).Figure 4Determination of transcription start site and sequence analysis of its 5′-flanking region (promoter 1).

Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 138: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) was used to determine the transcription start site of the rat Kir7.1 gene. CapSite cDNA from rat small intestine or testis was subjected to nested PCR. The first round PCR was performed using the rOligo-specific primer 1RC and rat Kir7.1-specific primer A6 (for amplification of small intestine CapSite cDNA) or A4 (for amplification of testis CapSite cDNA), whose positions are shown in B.

For negative control, the second round PCR was performed using the primer 2RC alone (lanes 2 and 4). The resulting products were analyzed by 1.3% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. DNA size marker (in bp) is shown on the left.

DNA binding by 186 CII is unusual in that the invertedly repeated half sites are separated by 20 base pairs, or two turns of the DNA helix, rather than the one turn usually associated with this class of proteins. Here, we investigate quantitatively the DNA binding properties of CII and its interaction with RNA polymerase at the establishment promoter,p E. The stoichiometry of CII binding was determined by sedimentation equilibrium experiments using a fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide and purified CII. These experiments indicate that the CII species bound to DNA is a dimer, with additional weak binding of a tetrameric species at high concentrations. Examination of the thermodynamic linkages between CII self-association and DNA binding shows that CII binds to the DNA as a preformed dimer (binding free energy, 9.9 kcal/mol at 4 °C) rather than by association of monomers on the DNA. CII binding induces in the DNA a bend of 41 (± 5) degrees. The spacing between the binding half sites was shown to be important for CII binding, insertion or removal of just 1 base pair significantly reducing the affinity for CII. Removal of 5 or 10 base pairs between binding half sites eliminated binding, as did insertion of an additional 10 base pairs. CII binding atp E was improved marginally by the presence of RNA polymerase (ΔΔG = –0.5 (± 0.3) kcal/mol). In contrast, the binding of RNA polymerase at p Ewas undetectable in the absence of CII but was improved markedly by the presence of CII. Thus, CII appears to recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter. The nature of the base pair changes in mutant phage, selected by their inability to establish lysogeny, are consistent with this mechanism of CII action.

Even relatively simple prokaryotic systems usually involve several linked protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, the mechanistic and thermodynamic features of which must be defined in order to gain a full appreciation of the system (see, for example, Refs. 1Kim B.

We were interested in understanding the nature of the interactions involved in the self-association and DNA binding of bacteriophage 186 CII protein, the concentration of which inside the bacterial host cell ultimately decides the fate of that infected cell. Upon infection of the host cell, coliphage 186 can pursue one of two independent but interchangeable life cycles: lytic development or lysogeny. The region of the 186 genome controlling the fate of the phage (and its host) consists of two face-to-face promoters,p R and p L (Fig.1), which control transcription of the lytic and lysogenic operons, respectively. As p Ris a much (approximately 200-fold) stronger promoter thanp L (8Dodd I.B. Kalionis B. Egan J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the choice between lysis and lysogeny does not reflect simple competition between these promoters, as is thought to be the case in the related coliphage P2 (11Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Webster R.G. Granoff A. Encyclopedia of Virology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London1999: 1087-1094Crossref Google Scholar). Rather, establishment of the lysogenic state in 186 requires a single additional promoter (p E), activated by the CII protein, to transiently increase leftward (lysogenic) transcription and hence initiate production of the maintenance repressor, CI, and the integrase protein, Int (10Neufing P.J. Shearwin K.E. Camerotto J. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CI then represses the lytic promoter,p R, to maintain lysogeny and autogenously control its own transcription, 1I. Dodd, R. Schubert, and J. B. Egan, manuscript in preparation. whereas Int catalyzes integration of the phage DNA into the host chromosome. CII is required only for establishment of lysogeny but not its maintenance (10Neufing P.J. Shearwin K.E. Camerotto J. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Lamont I. Richardson H. Carter D.R. Egan J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5286-5288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cII is the second gene of the 186 lytic transcript (Fig. 1). The 18.7-kDa protein product of the cII gene contains a helix-turn-helix motif in the N-terminal region, identified by the method of Dodd and Egan (13Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5019-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The CII-DNA interaction is unusual in that the half sites for binding (7-base pair perfect inverted repeats) are centered at –38 and –58 relative to the start of transcription and thus are two turns of the helix apart, rather than the one helical turn normally associated with the helix-turn-helix class of DNA-binding protein. We have shown previously that CII associates in solution from monomers to tetramers (10Neufing P.J. Shearwin K.E. Camerotto J. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the symmetrical nature of the CII binding site suggests the involvement of multimeric proteins, one cannot simply extrapolate to conclude that tetramers are also the “active” DNA binding species. In addition, the question of whether monomeric proteins multimerize on the DNA or whether preexisting multimers in solution bind DNA has important energetic implications for the mechanism of transcription activation. DNA binding by CII has been investigated in terms of stoichiometry, bending, binding free energies, and spacing requirements. In addition, we show that CII and RNA polymerase are the only proteins required for efficient activation of p E. RNA polymerase binding at p E in the absence of CII is negligible but is much stronger when CII is present. Thus, CII appears to activate transcription by recruiting RNA polymerase to the promoter.

Between these repeats are restriction sites (XbaI, HpaI, and SalI) to allow insertion of small DNA fragments containing the binding site of interest. pBend5-p E wt was generated by inserting oligonucleotide p E wt (see Fig. 5) into theHpaI site of pBend 5.

This low copy number plasmid, which produces functional CII as tested by complementation, was used as the source of CII in the in vivo β-galactosidase assays. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Geneworks (Adelaide, Australia) or Life Technologies, Inc. The sequences of oligonucleotides used for DNA binding studies are shown in Fig. 5. Other oligonucleotides, used as sequencing and/or PCR primers, were as follows: Apl control (top strand), 5′-TTGATGGCAAGTGTTGGCAAACAGAGTCAAATCA-3′ (anneals to its complement and used as a negative control in the sedimentation equilibrium experiments; CII does not recognize this sequence, but the 186 helix-turn-helix protein Apl does bind specifically);p E wt-F (top strand), 5′-AGGATGCAACATGTTTGATTTTCAGGTTTCCAAACATCCCCACTATGA-3′ (anneals to its complement (below) and used in sedimentation equilibrium experiments; the CII binding site is shown in boldface); pE wt-F (bottom strand), 5′-fluorescein-TCATAGTGGGGATGTTTGGAAACCTGAAAATCAAACATGTTGCATCCT-3′; 168, 5′-GCTCTAGAGCCGTAAAGGCTGCAAGAA-3′ (anneals to 23287–23304 and contains the XbaI site shown in boldface); 169, 5′-GGGGTACCCCGCCAGCTTCGCCATGTTG-3′ (anneals to 23503–23520, contains KpnI site shown in bold); 174, 5′-GCTCTAGAGAAAGAAGAGCAGTTGCG-3′ (anneals to 23341– 23358, contains an XbaI site; used as PCR primer in DNase I footprinting); biotin-34, 5′-biotin-CGGTCAAGTACATCCACGTT-3′ (anneals to 22965–22984, used as a PCR primer in DNase I footprints); SK, 5′-CGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGATC-3′ (PCR primer for DNase I footprints); biotin-RSP, 5′-biotin-GGAAACAGCTATGACCATG3′ (PCR primer for DNase I footprints); CII Bam biotin, 5′-biotin-CGGGATCCGGTCAGACGCTCATCAGA-3′ (anneals to 23768–23785; PCR primer for DNase I footprints); pBend SK, 5′-TAGTGGATCCCCCGGGCTGCA-3′ (used to amplify by PCR the circularly permuted region of pBend5-p E wt); and pBend KS, 5′-CGACGGTATCGATAAGCTTGG-3′ (used to amplify by PCR the circularly permuted region of pBend5-p E wt). CII purified as described by Neufing et al. (10Neufing P.J. Shearwin K.E. Camerotto J. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CII concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically, using an extinction coefficient of 7900m−1 cm−1at 280 nm (10Neufing P.J. Shearwin K.E. Camerotto J. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It was assumed that CII was 100% active in DNA binding. Escherichia coli RNA polymerase was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Sedimentation experiments were performed with a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and a four-hole An60Ti rotor. Approximately 100 μl of sample and 105 μl of reference solution were loaded in the sectors of the aluminum centerpieces. Following 24 h of centrifugation, scans were compared at 3-h intervals to ensure that equilibrium had been reached. Data were collected at 260 and 490 nm and at a spacing of 0.001 cm as the average of three absorbance measurements per radial position. The buffer for all experiments was 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5 (TEG 150). DNA was prepared for centrifugation as follows. Equimolar amounts of the complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed by heating to 90 °C for 2 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides were then ethanol-precipitated, purified by polyacrylamide gel (12%) electrophoresis, ethanol-precipitated again after elution from the gel, and resuspended in TEG150 buffer. Concentrations of the oligonucleotides were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients of 8.3 × 105m−1cm−1 (22Hagmar P. Bailey M. Tong G. Haralambidis J. Sawyer W.H. Davidson B.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) at 260 nm and 6.8 × 104m−1cm−1 at 490 nm for p Ewt-F. Protein was prepared for centrifugation by exhaustive dialysis against TEG 150, and the dialysate was used as the reference solution for centrifugation. Buffer density (ρ) was measured in an Anton-Paar precision density meter to be 1.03953 g/ml at 5 °C and 1.03644 g/ml at 20 °C. The partial specific volumes (v¯∞) of the predicted CII-DNA complexes were calculated as a weight average value of thev¯∞ for CII (0.724 ml/g) (10Neufing P.J. Shearwin K.E. Camerotto J. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and DNA (0.55 ml/g) (23Cohen G. Eisenberg H. Biopolymers. 1968; 6: 1077-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) according to Equation 1,v̄=MCIIv̄CII+MDNAv̄DNAMCII+MDNAEquation 1 where M CII andM DNA are the molecular weights of CII and oligonucleotide, respectively. Thus, the partial specific volume for the protein-DNA complex was 0.644 ml/mg for a CII dimer bound top E wt-F and 0.672 ml/mg for a CII tetramer bound to p E wt-F. Sedimentation data were analyzed, using Sigmaplot 4.0 for Windows (SPSS), by globally fitting equilibrium distributions (absorbanceversus radial distance) to Equation 2, the basic sedimentation equilibrium equation.Ar=Ar,0exp(M(1−v̄ρ)ω2(r2−r02)/2RT)+eEquation 2 In Equation 2, A r and A r,0 are the absorbances at radial distance (r andr 0), M is apparent molecular weight,v¯∞ is the partial specific volume, ρ is the solution density, ω is the rotor speed in radians per second, T is the temperature in Kelvin,R is the gas constant, and e is a baseline error term. M, A r,0, and ewere fitting parameters. Double-stranded DNA fragments with one strand 32P end-labeled for gel shift assays or DNase I footprints were generated by PCR in which one of the PCR primers had been 32P end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase. One μl of the appropriate phage stock was used as the template for the PCRs. For gel shift assays, the 252-bp double-stranded32P-labeled PCR product (generated using primers 168 and 169) was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the DNA was eluted from the gel slice overnight at 37 °C, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in binding buffer before use. For DNase I footprints, the PCR products, generated using one32P end-labeled primer and one biotinylated primer, were passed over a PCR purification spin column (Geneworks) and attached to paramagnetic streptavidin-beads (Dynal), as described previously (24Sandaltzopoulos R. Becker P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1511-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Unlabeled template DNA for the in vitro transcription assay was generated by PCR (20 μl) using primers 168 and 169 and containing 1 μl of 186+ phage stock as template. The 252-bp PCR product was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before use. Binding reactions (10 μl) were prepared by addition of DNA (∼50 cpm), CII (exhaustively dialyzed against TEG 150), and binding buffer (TEG 150). Each reaction also contained 50 ng of sheared salmon sperm DNA to minimize nonspecific binding. Reactions were left on ice for at least 30 min to allow attainment of equilibrium, and 6 μl was loaded onto running 15% polyacrylamide (1× TBE) gels containing 10% glycerol. Gels were electrophoresed at 4 °C at constant current (20 mA) for approximately 2 h. Upon completion of electrophoresis, gels were dried, exposed to a phosphorimager screen, and quantitated using the volume integration feature of the Imagequant software package (Molecular Dynamics). The fraction of DNA bound in each lane was calculated as counts for the retarded band divided by counts for the whole lane and corrected for a small degree of protein independent smearing using a no protein control. Results were fitted to the appropriate binding equation using Sigmaplot 4.0 (SPSS). The values of fractional saturation were then corrected for the small amount of incompetent (nonbinding) DNA (2Smith T.L. Sauer R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The DNA concentration was sufficiently low that total protein concentration could be substituted for free protein concentration. Footprinting experiments were performed essentially according to Sandaltzopoulos and Becker (24Sandaltzopoulos R. Becker P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1511-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This method uses magnetic bead technology to facilitate sample preparation. Double-stranded DNA fragments for footprinting were prepared by PCR using a 32P end-labeled primer and a biotinylated unlabeled primer. Following PCR, the PCR (20 μl) was passed over a PCR purification spin column (Geneworks) to remove any unincorporated biotinylated primer that would compete with full-length product for binding to the beads. The eluate from the spin column (60 μl) was added to 75 μl of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads), prepared according to the manufactures recommendations, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature to allow the biotinylated, radiolabeled PCR product to bind. The beads were then washed several times, resuspended in 50–100 μl of binding buffer, and stored at 0 °C for up to 1 week. Bead DNA (5 μl, ∼6000 cpm) was added to binding buffer containing appropriate CII concentrations, in a total volume of 40 μl. The footprint binding buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 75 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 1 μm bovine serum albumin. These binding reactions were incubated at 37 °C for at least 30 min to allow attainment of equilibrium, prior to addition of DNase I (5 ng). The DNase I reaction was allowed to proceed for exactly 2 min at 37 °C before being stopped with 50 μl of stop solution (4M NaCl, 100 mm EDTA). The beads were washed once with 100 μl of 2m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA and once with 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and resuspended in 6 μl of loading buffer (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA). The reactions were heated to 90 °C for 3 min, and 5 μl was loaded immediately onto a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was at 1500 V (constant voltage) for approximately 2 h. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried onto filter paper, exposed overnight to a phosphorimager screen, and viewed using Imagequant. Binding affinities were quantitated according to Brenowitz et al.(25Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

The upper and lower end points of the transition curves were included as adjustable parameters in the curve fitting procedure. DNA concentrations were sufficiently low that total protein concentration could be equated to free protein concentration. A 48-base pair DNA fragment containing the CII binding site (p E wt; see Fig. 5) was prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides and was ligated into the HpaI site of pBend 5 (17Zwieb C. Adhya S. Kneale G.G. Methods in Molecular Biology. 30. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994Google Scholar) to give pBend-p E wt. A 325-bp region from this plasmid containing 17 circularly permuted restriction sites and the CII binding site was then amplified by PCR using primers pBend SK and pBend KS. This fragment was labeled by inclusion of [α-32P]ATP (10 μCi) in the PCR. The PCR product was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and aliquots were digested in 10-μl reactions with MluI, NheI, ClaI,XhoI, EcoRV, SmaI, NruI,RsaI, or BamHI. Digestion produced three fragments, including a 168-bp fragment containing the CII binding site located at various positions within the fragment. Two μl of this digest was used in binding reactions for determination by gel shift assay of the electrophoretic mobility of the protein-DNA complex. Binding reactions were in TEG 50 buffer and contained 500 nm CII. Samples were loaded on 8% polyacrylamide, 0.5× TBE gels containing 10% glycerol and run at 20 mA constant current. Loading dye was run in a separate lane. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to a phosphorimager screen, mobilities were quantitated using Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics), and the bend angle was quantitated according to Equation 3, μMμE=cosα2Equation 3 where α is the bend angle and μM and μE are the relative mobilities of DNA fragments containing the binding site at the middle and at the end of the fragment, respectively. λRS45 and pMRR9 share portions of the N terminus of both the ampicillin gene and thelacZ gene, thus allowing any promoter insert in pMRR9 to be recombined into the phage. Lysogenization of this recombinant phage gives a single copy chromosomal fusion. Strain NK7049 (18Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene. 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) transformed with the appropriate pMRR9 derivative was used as the host for growth of the λRS45 phage vector. Phage stocks obtained were plated on NK7049, and single recombinant plaques were selected on the basis of color in the presence of X-gal and purified once by streaking across a lawn of NK7049. Independent blue lysogens from at least two recombinant plaques were purified by restreaking. Single copy status of these lysogens was confirmed by PCR (26Powell B.S. Court D.L. Nakamura Y. Rivas M.P. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5765-5766Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). For assay ofp E β-galactosidase activity, the appropriate CII expression plasmid (pPN72 or its parent pACYC184) was transformed into these lysogens, and liquid cultures were started by picking single colonies directly from the transformation plates. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described (27Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1992Google Scholar) with the exception that the cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and permeabilized with 30 μl of chloroform. Runoff assays (20-μl reaction volume) were performed at 37 °C in footprint buffer containing CTP, GTP, and ATP (all at 200 μm), 20 μmunlabeled UTP, 5 μCi (83 nm) of [α-32P]UTP, 150 nm RNAP, 250 nm CII, 5 nm template DNA, and 4 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega). Reaction mixtures without template DNA were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C prior to starting the reactions by the addition of template DNA. Transcription was allowed to proceed for 20–40 min, before 8-μl aliquots were removed and added to an equal volume of 90% formamide loading buffer. Samples were heated for 2 min at 90 °C prior to separation of the products by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. 32P end-labeled HpaII-digested pUC DNA (Geneworks) was used as a marker to estimate the size of the RNA transcripts. Gels were dried and exposed overnight to a phosphorimager screen. Images were analyzed using Imagequant software. Control experiments showed that the generation of runoff transcripts was dependent upon the addition of both RNAP and template DNA. In previous work, analytical ultracentrifugation of purified CII protein revealed the existence of a monomer-dimer-tetramer self-association equilibrium in solution (10Neufing P.J. Shearwin K.E. Camerotto J. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is worth emphasizing at this point that the oligomeric form of a DNA-binding protein determined at one particular concentration in solution does not necessarily correlate with the oligomeric form of the protein bound to DNA. For example, bacteriophage λ CII has been shown to form tetramers in solution (28Ho Y.S. Lewis M. Rosenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9128-9134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it has not to our knowledge been demonstrated that tetramers are the active DNA binding species, although this is often assumed. The symmetrical nature of the 186 CII binding site suggests the involvement of an oligomeric species in binding and thus the possibility of thermodynamic linkage between protein self-association and DNA binding, a common theme in the regulation of gene expression. As a first step in investigating any such linkage, we wished to determine the stoichiometry of CII binding to its operator. Sedimentation equilibrium, using a fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide, was the method employed (6Wu X. Spiro C. Owen W.G. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20820-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Bailey M.F. Davidson B.E. Minton A.P. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The use of absorbance optics in sedimentation equilibrium to determine the stoichiometry of a protein-DNA interaction is complicated by the significant spectral overlap between protein and DNA in the 260–280-nm range (30Laue T.M. Senear D.F. Eaton S. Ross J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2469-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Use of a fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide, however, allows separation of the protein and DNA signals. By monitoring the equilibrium distribution at 490 nm, the absorption maximum of fluorescein, the apparent molecular weight of the oligonucleotide can be determined in the presence and absence of the protein in question. In the presence of an interacting protein, the apparent molecular weight will reflect that of the protein-DNA complex (provided the DNA is fully occupied), and thus, the stoichiometry of the interaction can be estimated (6Wu X. Spiro C. Owen W.G. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20820-20827Abstract"

Thus neuroglian adhesion generates a spatial cue for polarized assembly of ankyrin and the spectrin cytoskeleton. Here we characterized a chimera of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of rat CD2 fused to the cytoplasmic domain of neuroglian. The chimera was used to test the hypothesis that clustering of neuroglian at sites of adhesion generates the signal that activates ankyrin binding. Abundant expression of the chimera at the plasma membrane was not a sufficient cue to drive ankyrin assembly, since ankyrin remained diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm of CD2-neuroglian-expressing cells. However, ankyrin became highly enriched at sites of antibody-induced capping of CD2-neuroglian. Spectrin codistributed with ankyrin at capped sites. A green fluorescent protein-tagged ankyrin was used to monitor ankyrin distribution in living cells. Enhanced green fluorescent protein-ankyrin behaved identically to antibody-stained endogenous ankyrin, proving that the polarized accumulation of ankyrin was not an artifact of fixing and staining cells. We propose a model in which clustering of neuroglian induces a conformational change in the cytoplasmic domain that drives polarized assembly of the spectrin cytoskeleton.

We propose a model in which clustering of neuroglian induces a conformational change in the cytoplasmic domain that drives polarized assembly of the spectrin cytoskeleton. enhanced green fluorescent protein polymerase chain reaction Spectrin forms a submembrane protein scaffold in a variety of eukaryotic cell types. The scaffold is thought to consist primarily of α2β2 spectrin tetramers cross-linked into a hexagonal lattice by their interaction with actin filaments. The major attachment between spectrin and the plasma membrane occurs through the protein ankyrin, which functions as an adapter linking the β subunit of spectrin to the cytoplasmic domains of integral membrane proteins (1Lux S.E. Palek J. Handin R.I. Lux S.E. Stossel T.P. Blood: Principles and Practice of Hematology. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1995: 1701-1818Google Scholar). Recent studies have established a role for the spectrin cytoskeleton in the formation of specialized plasma membrane domains of polarized cells. A number of integral membrane proteins have been found to interact directly with ankyrin (2Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8703-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Maddux P.B. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 91-106PubMed Google Scholar), and their behavior is altered by mutations in ankyrin or spectrin. Voltage-gated sodium channels failed to accumulate at axon initial segments of ankyrinG knockout mice, leading to impaired action potential firing (4Zhou D. Lambert S. Malen P.L. Carpenter S. Boland L.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Similarly, a reduced level of L1 was observed in axons of ankyrinBknockout mice (5Scotland P. Zhou D. Benveniste H. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The basolateral accumulation of Na,K-ATPase was severely perturbed in epithelial cells of Drosophila β spectrin mutants (6Dubreuil R.R. Wang P. Dahl S.C. Lee J.K. Goldstein L.S.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These results support a model in which the spectrin cytoskeleton acts to capture and stabilize interacting proteins, leading to their accumulation within specialized functional domains of the plasma membrane. Although the downstream effects of spectrin and ankyrin mutations on other interacting proteins are being elucidated, relatively little is known about the upstream cues that polarize the distributions of ankyrin and spectrin. The same is true of other cytoskeletal proteins that are thought to modulate the accumulation of interacting membrane activities. For example, dystrophin is known to stabilize the expression of a complex of dystrophin-associated glycoproteins at the sarcolemma (7Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Gaver M.G. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 8Campbell K.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 675-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain protein Disks large is required for the accumulation of fasciclin III and coracle at septate junctions of Drosophila epithelial cells (9Woods D.F. Hough C. Peel D. Callaini G. Bryant P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and for K+ channel clustering at synapses in the nervous system (10Tejedor F.J. Bokhari A. Rogero O. Gorczyca M. Zhang J. Kim E. Sheng M. Budnik V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations of the PDZ protein lin7 result in mislocalization of the let23 tyrosine kinase (11Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The PDZ protein InaD is responsible for the formation of signaling protein complexes in the rhabdomeres of Drosophilaphotoreceptor cells (12Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). However, the upstream cues responsible for targeting of each of these cytoskeletal proteins are poorly defined. The identification of such cues and their mechanisms is therefore of broad relevance. One of the cues that leads to polarized assembly of the spectrin cytoskeleton is cell-cell adhesion. Expression of neuroglian, which contains an ankyrin binding site in its cytoplasmic domain, causes a dramatic redistribution of ankyrin and spectrin to sites of cell-cell contact in Drosophila S2 cells (13Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Human L1 expressed in S2 cells has the same effect, indicating that the polarizing activity of L1 family members is conserved between Drosophila and mammals (14Hortsch M.K. O'Shea K.S. Zhao G. Kim F. Vallejo Y. Dubreuil R.R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 61-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases the accumulation of ankyrin is observed exclusively at cell contacts, even though the adhesion molecule itself is abundantly distributed over the remainder of the cell surface. Thus cell adhesion appears to generate a signal that specifies the recruitment of ankyrin exclusively by those neuroglian molecules present at cell contacts. Several possible signaling mechanisms were tested and ruled out in previous studies of wild type and mutant neuroglian molecules (13Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Hortsch M. Homer D. Malhotra J.D. Chang S. Frankel J. Jefford G. Dubreuil R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here we tested the hypothesis that the aggregation and/or immobilization of neuroglian at cell contacts triggers ankyrin recruitment. A transgene composed of the extracellular domain of rat CD2 fused to the cytoplasmic domain of neuroglian (CD2/NRG) was expressed in S2 cells, and the conditions necessary to activate accumulation of ankyrin were identified. An important advantage of this approach is that it allowed high level expression of the cytoplasmic domain of neuroglian without the formation of large, unwieldy cell aggregates that are induced by authentic neuroglian. We studied the behavior of ankyrin in response to expression of the CD2/NRG chimera by antibody staining and by monitoring the distribution of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)1-tagged ankyrin in living cells. The results support a model in which clustering of neuroglian activates the polarized accumulation of ankyrin at sites of cell-cell contact. DrosophilaS2 cells were cultured under standard conditions (16Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) using Schneider's medium and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). A stably transfected cell line was used to produce a natural isoform of neuroglian (NRG167) under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter (17Hortsch M. Wang Y.-M.E. Marikar Y. Bieber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18809-18817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Neuroglian expression was induced by the addition of 0.7 mm CuCl2 to the growth medium for 24 h. Transient expression of recombinant ankyrin and neuroglian transgenes in S2 cells was carried out by transfection essentially as described by Chen and Okayama (18Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4792) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding rat CD2 was a generous gift from Dr. Nick Brown (19Dunin-Borkowski O.M. Brown N.H. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An NcoI-HindIII fragment of the CD2-coding region, extending from the start codon to codon 18 of the cytoplasmic domain, was spliced into the pUp2 vector (20Lee J. Coyne R. Dubreuil R.R. Goldstein L.S.B. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1797-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) at the start site of the ubiquitin promoter. A HindIII site was introduced at codon 16 of the cytoplasmic domain of a neuroglian cDNA (17Hortsch M. Wang Y.-M.E. Marikar Y. Bieber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18809-18817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) by PCR. The cytoplasmic domain of the resulting CD2/neuroglian chimera, confirmed by DNA sequencing, includes the first 18 amino acids of CD2 followed by amino acids 15–85, the neuroglian cytoplasmic domain. A control construct encoding truncated CD2 (CD2Δ) was identical except that it lacked the cytoplasmic fragment of neuroglian and had an in-frame stop codon immediately after codon 18 of the cytoplasmic domain. A fusion of the ankyrin-coding sequence with the EGFP coding sequence was produced from a previously described myc-tagged Drosophila ankyrin transgene (13Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). An NcoI site was engineered at the position of the ankyrin stop codon by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing of the PCR product. A NcoI-NotI fragment of the EGFP-coding region (CLONTECH Laboratories) was spliced to the ankyrin-coding sequence. Drosophila S2 cells were processed for antibody staining and microscopy as described previously (13Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) either before or after treatment of live cells with anti-CD2 antibody. Briefly, cells were immobilized on Alcian blue-coated microscope slides, fixed in 2% fresh formadhehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline, then equilibrated in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for antibody staining. Primary antibodies were used as follows: ankyrin, 1:250 affinity-purified rabbit antibody (21Dubreuil R.R. Yu J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10285-10289Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); neuroglian, 1:1000 culture supernatant of mouse hybridoma clone 1B7 (22Bieber A.J. Snow P.M. Hortsch M. Patel N.H. Jacobs J.R. Traquina Z.R. Schilling J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1989; 59: 447-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar); β-spectrin 1:500 (23Byers T.J. Husain-Chishti A. Dubreuil R.R. Branton D. Goldstein L.S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); CD2, 1:88 mouse anti-rat CD2 (Serotec). Affinity-purified fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) and Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were used at 1:1000 dilutions. In capping experiments, S2 cells and transiently transfected CD2/NRG and CD2Δ S2 cells were incubated live with anti-rat CD2 antibody (1:88) in fly Ringer's solution for 2 h in microcentrifuge tubes, rinsed in fly Ringer's, and microcentrifuged for 30 s at setting 3 (Eppendorf 5415C) three times. Cells were either transferred to Alcian blue-coated slides (primary capping alone) or were further treated with goat anti-mouse Texas red antibody (1:1000 in fly Ringer's; secondary capping) before transfer to slides. Once transferred to slides, cells were stained as above for CD2 and either ankyrin or β spectrin. Capping experiments were also carried out with cells expressing ankyrin-EGFP. Stably transfected cells carrying the metallothionein promoter-neuroglian transgene (13Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected with the ubiquitin promoter-ankyrin-EGFP transgene then induced to express neuroglian by addition of CuCl2 to the medium 2 days later. Live cells were transferred to viewing chambers for confocal microscopy of cell aggregates. Digital images were captured using an Olympus I × 70 microscope with Fluoview software. In parallel experiments S2 cells were transiently co-transfected with ankyrin-EGFP and CD2 transgenes and processed for live cell capping with primary and secondary antibodies 2 days later, as described above. Live cells were viewed by epifluorescence and photographed using an ausJena Jenalumar photomicroscope. Images were obtained on photographic film, digitized using a Polaroid SprintScan scanner, and edited using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. Western blotting was carried out as described previously (24Dubreuil R. Byers T.J. Branton D. Goldstein L.S.B. Kiehart D.P. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2095-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Total S2 cell proteins (5 × 105 cells/lane) were dissolved in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose strips were stained with rabbit anti-ankyrin (1:250), mouse anti myc-epitope tag (1:500; Ref. 25Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar), or mouse anti rat CD2 (1:200) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000;Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories). Capped S2 cells expressing CD2/NRG or CD2Δ were scored for the expression of fluorescent antibody-stained caps using the rhodamine channel. To score primary antibody-treated cells, cells were fixed before the addition of fluorescent secondary antibody. Fifty cells were scored for ankyrin or β spectrin colocalization at caps in each experiment, and results were expressed as a percentage of total capped cells. Control uncapped cells were scored for the presence of conspicuous CD2 staining, then scored for ankyrin colocalization. Expression of the adhesion molecule neuroglian inDrosophila S2 tissue culture cells leads to the formation of large aggregates of cells as well as the recruitment of ankyrin specifically to sites of cell-cell contact (13Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To study the ankyrin recruitment process independently of cell-cell adhesion, we engineered a chimeric protein composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of rat CD2 fused to the cytoplasmic sequence of the NRG167 isoform of neuroglian (Fig.1). A truncated form of CD2 (CD2Δ), lacking most of the cytoplasmic domain, was used as a control. TheDrosophila ubiquitin promoter, which directs high level constitutive expression of transfected genes in S2 cells, drove expression of both constructs. Expression of the CD2/NRG chimera (Fig.1, lane 3) and CD2Δ (lane 2) was demonstrated in Western blots of transiently transfected S2 cultures probed with mouse anti-rat CD2 antibody. No reaction of the antibody was observed in control non-transfected S2 cells (lane 1). The CD2Δ product migrated with a relative mobility of 30 kDa (lane 2) and the CD2/NRG chimera migrated at 42 kDa. These mobilities are consistent with glycosylated products having predicted molecular masses of 28 and 38 kDa, respectively. Expression of recombinant CD2 molecules and their effects on assembly of ankyrin in S2 cells were examined by immunofluorescent staining of transiently transfected populations. Typically less than 50% of the cells in the population expressed recombinant CD2, and among these there was a broad range of expression level (data not shown). Cells were fixed and permeabilized for antibody staining. Conspicuous uniform plasma membrane staining and variable intracellular staining were observed in cells expressing either CD2/NRG or CD2Δ (Fig.2, column 1). There was no detectable effect of CD2 expression on the intracellular distribution of ankyrin (column 2). Ankyrin staining was found in a variable speckled pattern throughout the cytoplasm of S2 cells, whether or not the cells were transfected. Thus the presence of the neuroglian cytoplasmic domain in S2 cells was not sufficient to bring about a detectable redistribution of ankyrin to the plasma membrane. The distribution of ankyrin was also examined after capping CD2 by the addition of anti-CD2 antibody to living cells. Capping was induced by the sequential addition of monoclonal anti-CD2 antibody and fluorescent goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. The addition of antibody to living cells resulted in extensive capping of both CD2/NRG and CD2Δ (Fig. 2,column 3). Cap morphology varied from numerous small islands of staining (arrows) to large polar caps (arrowhead). After capping, cells were fixed and permeabilized for staining with rabbit anti-ankyrin antibody (Fig. 2,column 4). CD2/NRG-expressing cells exhibited a dramatic redistribution of ankyrin to capped sites (Fig. 2, E andF), although not all caps were associated with detectable ankyrin staining (e.g. Fig. 2 F,asterisk). In contrast, capped cells expressing CD2Δ never exhibited a detectable redistribution of ankyrin (Fig. 2, Gand H). Thus colocalization of ankyrin with the CD2/NRG chimera was dependent on the presence of the neuroglian cytoplasmic domain as well as capping of the receptor. The effects of CD2/NRG expression on ankyrin distribution were quantified in large populations of transfected cells (Fig.3). The fraction of cells with caps that exhibited colocalization of ankyrin was expressed as a percentage of total capped cells (n = 50). Forty percent of cells expressing the CD2/NRG chimera exhibited prominent ankyrin colocalization. About 20% of cells treated with primary antibody alone also exhibited recruitment of ankyrin to cap sites. Treatment of cells with monoclonal primary antibody alone was expected to induce formation of CD2 dimers rather than caps. However, antibody binding appears to induce a conformational change in CD2 that favors lateral clustering of molecules in the plane of the membrane (26Li J. Smolyar A. Sunder-Plassmann R. Reinherz E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, although caps formed by primary antibody alone were not as prominent or compact as those induced with primary and secondary antibodies (data not shown), there was a conspicuous redistribution of CD2/NRG as well as ankyrin in primary antibody-treated cells that was distinct from non-antibody-treated control cells. CD2/NRG capping was also expected to induce a redistribution of β spectrin, since ankyrin is the adapter protein that links spectrin to the plasma membrane. There was a dramatic redistribution of β spectrin in capped CD2/NRG cells (Fig. 4,A and B). The β spectrin in control cells (not shown) and capped CD2Δ cells (Fig. 4, C and D) was found in a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm and in numerous perinuclear puncta, as described previously (27Dubreuil R.R. Maddux P.B. Grushko T. MacVicar G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Quantification of the β spectrin redistribution revealed that it was not as efficient as ankyrin redistribution (Fig. 3, right), but it was equally dependent on the cytoplasmic domain of neuroglian and capping. Thus antibody capping of CD2/NRG induced assembly of a membrane cytoskeleton complex of ankyrin and spectrin comparable with what was previously observed in S2 cells expressing authentic neuroglian (13Dubreuil R.R.

The response of ankyrin to neuroglian expression was also monitored in cells expressing a recombinant ankyrin-EGFP construct (Fig.5). It was important to establish that the patterns of ankyrin staining in S2 cells were not an artifact of fixing and/or permeabilizing the cells. The NcoI start site of EGFP was fused to a modified ankyrin-coding sequence in which the stop codon was replaced with an NcoI site. The ankyrin template used also included an amino-terminal myc epitope tag (13Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Expression of the desired product was confirmed in Western blots of transfected cells (Fig. 5). A unique 197-kDa product was detected in transfected cells by rabbit anti-ankyrin antibody (lane 2) and by an antibody against the myc epitope (lane 4) but not in control untransfected cells (lanes 1 and 3). Thus the ankyrin-EGFP product was abundantly expressed and stable in S2 cells. The ankyrin-EGFP marker was monitored in living, neuroglian-expressing S2 cells by confocal microscopy. Ankyrin-EGFP was excluded from the nucleus but was otherwise diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm of non-aggregated cells (not shown). A confocal through-focus series revealed that ankyrin-EGFP was dramatically redistributed to sites of cell-cell contact in neuroglian-expressing cells (Fig.6 A, arrow). No ankyrin-EGFP above the background of cytoplasmic staining was detected at non-contact regions of the plasma membrane (arrowhead). Thus the distribution of ankyrin-EGFP in living cells precisely matched the previously described distribution of ankyrin in antibody-stained cells (13Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Ankyrin-EGFP was also used to monitor the effects of expression and capping of CD2/NRG in living S2 cells (Fig. 6 B). Cells were treated with primary and secondary antibody as described above, then directly viewed and photographed while still alive. Antibody treatment caused a dramatic redistribution of CD2/NRG and CD2Δ into caps (Fig.6 B, arrows). Ankyrin-EGFP codistributed with caps in cells expressing the chimera but not in cells expressing truncated CD2 (Fig. 6 C, arrows). Ankyrin-EGFP was not detectably associated with the plasma membrane before antibody-induced capping (data not shown). Thus the dramatic enrichment of ankyrin at sites of antibody-induced capping of CD2/NRG and at sites of neuroglian-mediated cell-cell adhesion was not an artifact of the processing steps used in antibody labeling experiments. Previous studies established that the cytoplasmic domain of neuroglian recruits ankyrin to sites of cell-cell adhesion in neuroglian-expressing S2 cells (13Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Hortsch M. Homer D. Malhotra J.D. Chang S. Frankel J. Jefford G. Dubreuil R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Several possible explanations for the polarizing effect of neuroglian on ankyrin were proposed, including 1) mobilization of neuroglian to cell contacts, thereby sequestering the ankyrin binding site, 2) transmission of an allosteric signal that selectively activates ankyrin binding by neuroglian molecules engaged in extracellular adhesion, and 3) inhibition of ankyrin binding to neuroglian at non-contact sites by tyrosine phosphorylation within the ankyrin binding site of neuroglian. However, each of these mechanisms was ruled out in previous studies of wild type and mutant neuroglian molecules (13Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Hortsch M. Homer D. Malhotra J.D. Chang S. Frankel J. Jefford G. Dubreuil R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A fourth mechanism, local activation of ankyrin recruitment by clustering of neuroglian molecules in the plane of the membrane, had not been tested. The finding here that ankyrin codistributes with a CD2-neuroglian chimera only after antibody-induced capping provides compelling evidence that ankyrin binding to neuroglian is modulated by receptor clustering. It was important to establish that the apparent concentration of ankyrin at sites of neuroglian clustering was not an artifact of either cell aggregation or the processing steps used in antibody-staining experiments. The CD2/NRG chimera used here made it possible to uncouple ankyrin recruitment from cell adhesion and to exert precise control over the time-course of ankyrin recruitment. The chimera could be expressed at high levels without recruiting ankyrin to the plasma membrane. It was not possible to express authentic neuroglian without inducing aggregation and ankyrin recruitment once neuroglian accumulated to a sufficient level. The fixation and permeabilization steps before antibody staining were a source of further concern. Most of the neuroglian in cell aggregates was present at non-contact regions of the plasma membrane but was extracted during permeabilization with detergent (13Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Consequently, ankyrin and neuroglian both appeared to be concentrated at cell contacts in antibody-stained cells. Use of the ankyrin-EGFP fusion described here made it possible to monitor the distribution of ankyrin without cell processing artifacts. Ankyrin-EGFP strictly codistributed with sites of neuroglian-mediated adhesion and not with the distribution of total neuroglian. The behavior of ankyrin-EGFP in CD2/NRG-expressing S2 cells was remarkably different from the behavior of EGFP-tagged ankyrin in mammalian cells. When ankyrinG-EGFP was expressed in human kidney 293 cells it was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm and was not detectably associated with the plasma membrane. When co-expressed with intact neurofascin, ankyrinG-EGFP was efficiently recruited to the plasma membrane, whether or not the cells formed aggregates (28Zhang X. Davis J.Q. Carpenter S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30785-30794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus the recruitment of ankyrin to the plasma membrane by rat neurofascin was independent of cell adhesion. This is in marked contrast to Drosophila ankyrin-EGFP, which only associated with the plasma membrane at cell contacts in neuroglian-expressing cells or with antibody-induced caps in CD2/NRG-expressing cells (this study). The difference in the ankyrin recruiting activities of the two proteins was unexpected given the sequence conservation of their ankyrin binding sites (70% identity over 27 residues; Fig. 6). Further comparison of the properties of neurofascin and neuroglian provided the rationale for a model to explain the regulated recruitment of ankyrin in response to neuroglian adhesion. Biochemical studies revealed that the cytoplasmic domain of neurofascin behaves as a dimer in solution (28Zhang X. Davis J.Q. Carpenter S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30785-30794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytoplasmic domain of neuroglian did not detectably dimerize in yeast two-hybrid experiments (13Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Since the ankyrin binding regions of neuroglian and neurofascin are conserved, it is likely that the dimerization site of neurofascin resides in the more divergent upstream region of the cytoplasmic domain. Further inspection of the ankyrin binding regions of neurofascin and neuroglian revealed a high density of acidic amino acids (8/27 residues). We integrated these observations (acidic character, dimeric versus monomeric states, and constitutive versus regulated association with ankyrin) into a simple model in which repulsion of negative charges in the cytoplasmic domain drives a conformational change that activates the ankyrin binding activity of L1 family members (Fig.7). In the model, neurofascin is constitutively active because the native molecule exists as a dimer in which the acidic cytoplasmic domains are juxtaposed. The CD2/NRG chimera is activated by antibody cross-linking of the extracellular domain, which mimics the activated state of the neurofascin molecule. Although this working model is speculative, it illustrates many of the questions that will be important to address in future experiments. One question concerns the valency of the ankyrin interaction with L1 family members. Molecular and biochemical studies indicate that there are two binding sites for neurofascin in mammalian ankyrins and that a single ankyrin can simultaneously interact with two neurofascin molecules as well as band 3 (29Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, there is no direct evidence that both sites are utilized or required in situ. The model posits that a single ankyrin molecule associates with the cytoplasmic domains of two neuroglian or neurofascin molecules, although 1:1 binding of ankyrin to neuroglian would also serve to mask charges. We attempted to address the valency of ankyrin in the present study without success. CD2/NRG was co-expressed with authentic neuroglian in S2 cells to ask if recruitment of ankyrin to cell contacts by neuroglian would lead to a simultaneous recruitment of CD2/NRG. CD2 staining was observed at cell contacts (data not shown), but the same result was obtained with CD2Δ, indicating that recruitment to cell contacts occurred via the extracellular domain of CD2 rather than the ankyrin binding site of neuroglian. Thus other experimental approaches, perhaps using different neuroglian chimeras, will be required to determine the number of neuroglian molecules that associate with ankyrin in situ. Neuroglian molecules are likely to be clustered at cell contact sites by diffusion-mediated trapping. Clustering of adhesion molecules at adhesive sites by this mechanism is thought to enhance the strength and stability of cell contacts (30McCloskey M.A. Poo M.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2185-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Podack E.R. Kupfer A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 32Dustin M.L. Golan D.E. Zhu D.-M. Miller J.M. Meier W. Davies E.A. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30889-30898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The model described here suggests that clustering of neuroglian is also responsible for the selective recruitment of ankyrin to cell contacts. In addition, the model provides a rationale to explain inside-out regulation of neuroglian-mediated adhesion (15Hortsch M. Homer D. Malhotra J.D. Chang S. Frankel J. Jefford G. Dubreuil R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Tuvia S. Garver T.D. Bennett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mutations in the cytoplasmic domains of neuroglian and neurofascin that interfere with ankyrin binding dramatically reduce the efficiency of extracellular adhesion. It was difficult to reconcile this finding with the earlier observation that a lipid-linked form of neuroglian altogether lacking a cytoplasmic domain mediated robust cell-cell adhesion (17Hortsch M. Wang Y.-M.E. Marikar Y. Bieber A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18809-18817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In one case the activity of the cytoplasmic domain was required for efficient cell adhesion; in the other case it was not. These observations can be reconciled by assuming that the cytoplasmic domain of neuroglian has an inhibitory effect on adhesion caused by charge repulsion. The inhibitory effect can be relieved either by removing the cytoplasmic domain, as in the case of lipid-linked neuroglian, or by masking the charges with ankyrin in the case of wild type neuroglian. This hypothesis can be tested in future studies by manipulating the density and distribution of charges in the cytoplasmic domain of neuroglian and assaying effects on ankyrin recruitment and adhesion. The model proposed here suggests that ankyrin binding to neuroglian is activated by receptor clustering. An alternative interpretation of the data is that ankyrin is constitutively bound to neuroglian in the absence of clustering, but the concentration of ankyrin at unclustered sites is below its threshold of detection. Clustering of neuroglian could conceivably elevate the ankyrin concentration above that threshold. This alternate explanation seems unlikely for a number of reasons. First, threshold of detection was not an issue with mammalian ankyrin-EGFP, which was dramatically redistributed to the plasma membrane in response to neurofascin expression (28Zhang X. Davis J.Q. Carpenter S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30785-30794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Drosophila ankyrin labeled with the same EGFP tag did not codistribute with neuroglian at non-contact regions of the plasma membrane in neuroglian-expressing cells or with uncapped CD2/NRG. Second, not all of the caps formed by antibody treatment of CD2/NRG-expressing cells were positive for ankyrin. This result is more consistent with an induced association that is moderately efficient as opposed to accretion of ankyrin that is constitutively associated with neuroglian. In the latter case, ankyrin staining should always be observed when its receptor is clustered. Third, ankyrin did not colocalize with neuroglian at non-contact regions of the S2 cell plasma membrane under conditions where detection of ankyrin relative to neuroglian was not limiting (13Dubreuil R.R. MacVicar G.R. Dissanayake S. Liu C. Homer D. Hortsch M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Antibody-staining experiments suggest that the enrichment of neuroglian staining at cell contacts is relatively small compared with the dramatic enrichment of ankyrin at contacts. We suggest that the enrichment of ankyrin is caused by an increase in the affinity of the ankyrin-neuroglian interaction that is brought about by receptor clustering. There are likely to be additional activating mechanisms that operate during assembly of the cytoskeleton, even within the L1 family of proteins. In the nervous system, spectrin, ankyrin, sodium channels, and neurofascin all codistribute at the node of Ranvier (34Bennett V. Lambert S. Davis J.Q. Zhang X. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 107-120PubMed Google Scholar). However, targeting to the node does not require cell-cell adhesion since these molecules also form node-like clusters in cultured neurons in response to a protein factor secreted by oligodendrocytes (35Kaplan M.R. Meyer-Franke A. Lambert S. Bennett V. Duncan I.D. Levinson S.R. Barres B.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In light of this result, it is not surprising that the recruitment of ankyrin to the plasma membrane by neurofascin in 293 cells was independent of cell-cell adhesion. One possibility is that recruitment of ankyrin by neurofascin at the node is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which is known to have a potent modulatory effect on ankyrin binding in vitro (36Garver T.D. Ren Q. Tuvia S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Direct coupling of cytoskeleton assembly to cell adhesion provides a way to propagate positional information during the development of polarized cells. Neuroglian is expressed in polarized epithelial cellsin vivo where the clustering mechanism described here is likely to have a role in polarized assembly of the spectrin cytoskeleton (27Dubreuil R.R. Maddux P.B. Grushko T. MacVicar G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The model provides a conceptual framework for further studies aimed at elucidating the structural basis for ankyrin recruitment by L1 family members. The model may also be relevant to understanding the interactions of other plasma membrane-associated cytoskeletal complexes, such as dystrophin and PDZ domain proteins, with their respective membrane receptors.

The crystal structure of 59 protein revealed a two-domain α-helical protein, whose N-terminal domain has strong structural similarity to the DNA binding domain of high mobility group family proteins (Mueser, T. C., Jones, C. E., Nossal, N. G., and Hyde, C. C. (2000) J. Mol. Biol. 296, 597–612). We have previously shown that 59 protein binds preferentially to fork DNA. Here we show that 59 protein binds to completely duplex forks but cannot load the helicase unless there is a single-stranded gap of more than 5 nucleotides on the fork arm corresponding to the lagging strand template. Consistent with the roles of these proteins in recombination, we find that 59 protein binds to and stimulates 41 helicase activity on Holliday junction DNA, and on a substrate that resembles a strand invasion structure. 59 protein forms a stable complex with wild type 41 helicase and fork DNA in the presence of adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). The unwinding activity of 41 helicase missing 20 C-terminal amino acids is not stimulated by 59 protein, and it does not form a complex with 59 protein on fork DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1557947614,"Cholesteryl esters present in nascent very low density lipoproteins are generated in a reaction catalyzed by acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). To examine the effect of cholesteryl esters on the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins, we transiently overexpressed human (h) ACAT-1 in the livers of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor(-/-) mice using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. Overexpression of hACAT-1 increased hepatic total and esterified cholesterol but did not reduce hepatic free cholesterol due to a compensatory increase in the rate of de novo cholesterol synthesis. Overexpression of hACAT-1 markedly increased the plasma concentration and hepatic secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins but had no effect on the clearance of very low density lipoprotein-apoB from plasma indicating that cholesteryl esters play an important role in regulating the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. ACAT activity has been implicated in the regulation of the LDL receptor pathway by dietary fatty acids. It has been hypothesized that unsaturated fatty acids, by enhancing ACAT activity, reduce the amount of free cholesterol in a putative regulatory pool that feeds back on LDL receptor expression. We directly tested this hypothesis in hamsters by transiently overexpressing hACAT-1 in the liver. Enhanced cholesterol esterification in the liver resulted in a compensatory increase in de novo cholesterol synthesis but no induction of LDL receptor expression suggesting that fatty acids regulate LDL receptor expression via a mechanism independent of ACAT."
https://openalex.org/W2000453037,"The CYP4A fatty acid ω-hydroxylases are involved in important physiological processes such as the regulation of vascular pressure. A previous study of chimeras of the rat CYP4A2 and CYP4A3 enzymes established that the regiochemistry of fatty acid hydroxylation is determined by the first 119 amino acid residues (Hoch, U., Zhang. Z. P., Kroetz, D. L., and Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (2000) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 373, 63–71). The role of the individual amino acid differences in this region has therefore been examined by site-specific mutagenesis to determine which residues actually control the ω- versus(ω-1)-regiospecificity. The results indicate that regiospecificity is controlled by the presence or absence of a three-residue insert (Ser-114, Gly-115, Ile-116) in CYP4A3 and by the residue at position 119 (CYP4A3 numbering). Furthermore, analysis of the absolute stereochemistry of the 11-hydroxylauric acid product indicates that this stereochemistry is not very sensitive to changes in the residues that line the substrate access channel. These results define a model of the specificity determinants of an important class of cytochrome P450 enzymes."
