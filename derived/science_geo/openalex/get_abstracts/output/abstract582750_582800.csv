https://openalex.org/W2603131170,"Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is transforming our views of proteins by revealing how their structures and dynamics are closely intertwined to underlie their functions and interactions. Compelling representations of proteins as statistical ensembles are uncovering the presence and biological relevance of conformationally heterogeneous states, thus gradually making it possible to go beyond the dichotomy between order and disorder through more quantitative descriptions that span the continuum between them."
https://openalex.org/W2598218053,"The concentration of free cytosolic Ca2+ and the voltage across the plasma membrane are major determinants of cell function. Ca2+-permeable non-selective cationic channels are known to regulate these parameters, but understanding of these channels remains inadequate. Here we focus on transient receptor potential canonical 4 and 5 proteins (TRPC4 and TRPC5), which assemble as homomers or heteromerize with TRPC1 to form Ca2+-permeable non-selective cationic channels in many mammalian cell types. Multiple roles have been suggested, including in epilepsy, innate fear, pain, and cardiac remodeling, but limitations in tools to probe these channels have restricted progress. A key question is whether we can overcome these limitations and develop tools that are high-quality, reliable, easy to use, and readily accessible for all investigators. Here, through chemical synthesis and studies of native and overexpressed channels by Ca2+ and patch-clamp assays, we describe compound 31, a remarkable small-molecule inhibitor of TRPC1/4/5 channels. Its potency ranged from 9 to 1300 pm, depending on the TRPC1/4/5 subtype and activation mechanism. Other channel types investigated were unaffected, including TRPC3, TRPC6, TRPV1, TRPV4, TRPA1, TRPM2, TRPM8, and store-operated Ca2+ entry mediated by Orai1. These findings suggest identification of an important experimental tool compound, which has much higher potency for inhibiting TRPC1/4/5 channels than previously reported agents, impressive specificity, and graded subtype selectivity within the TRPC1/4/5 channel family. The compound should greatly facilitate future studies of these ion channels. We suggest naming this TRPC1/4/5-inhibitory compound Pico145."

Here we examine a relatively new form of fraud, the use of photo-ID containing a graphical morph between two faces. Such a document may look sufficiently like two people to serve as ID for both. We present two experiments with human viewers, and a third with a smartphone face recognition system. In Experiment 1, viewers were asked to match pairs of faces, without being warned that one of the pair could be a morph. They very commonly accepted a morphed face as a match. However, in Experiment 2, following very short training on morph detection, their acceptance rate fell considerably. Nevertheless, there remained large individual differences in people’s ability to detect a morph. In Experiment 3 we show that a smartphone makes errors at a similar rate to ‘trained’ human viewers—i.e. accepting a small number of morphs as genuine ID. We discuss these results in reference to the use of face photos for security."
https://openalex.org/W2603541511,"Cash transfers and vouchers are forms of 'demand-side financing' that have been widely used to promote maternal and newborn health in low- and middle-income countries during the last 15 years.This systematic review consolidates evidence from seven published systematic reviews on the effects of different types of cash transfers and vouchers on the use and quality of maternity care services, and updates the systematic searches to June 2015 using the Joanna Briggs Institute approach for systematic reviewing. The review protocol for this update was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015020637).Data from 51 studies (15 more than previous reviews) and 22 cash transfer and voucher programmes suggest that approaches tied to service use (either via payment conditionalities or vouchers for selected services) can increase use of antenatal care, use of a skilled attendant at birth and in the case of vouchers, postnatal care too. The strongest evidence of positive effect was for conditional cash transfers and uptake of antenatal care, and for vouchers for maternity care services and birth with a skilled birth attendant. However, effects appear to be shaped by a complex set of social and healthcare system barriers and facilitators. Studies have typically focused on an initial programme period, usually two or three years after initiation, and many lack a counterfactual comparison with supply-side investment. There are few studies to indicate that programmes have led to improvements in quality of maternity care or maternal and newborn health outcomes.Future research should use multiple intervention arms to compare cost-effectiveness with similar investment in public services, and should look beyond short- to medium-term service utilisation by examining programme costs, longer-term effects on service utilisation and health outcomes, and the equity of those effects."

https://openalex.org/W2599717621,"CareToy system is an innovative tele-rehabilitative tool, useful in providing intensive, individualized, home-based, family-centred Early Intervention (EI) in infants. Our aim was to evaluate, through a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) study, the effects of CareToy intervention on early motor and visual development in preterm infants. 41 preterm infants (range age: 3.0–5.9 months of corrected age) were enrolled and randomized into two groups, CareToy and Standard Care. 19 infants randomized in CareToy group performed a 4-week CareToy program, while 22 allocated to control group completed 4 weeks of Standard Care. Infant Motor Profile (IMP) was primary outcome measure, Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and Teller Acuity Cards were secondary ones. Assessments were carried out at baseline (T0) and at the end of CareToy training or Standard Care period (T1). T1 was the primary endpoint. After RCT phase, 17 infants from control group carried out a 4-week CareToy program, while 18 infants from the CareToy group continued with Standard Care. At the end of this phase, infants were re-assessed at T2. In RCT phase, delta IMP total score and variation and performance sub-domains were significantly higher (P<0.050) in CareToy group if compared to Standard Care group. Similar results were found for Teller Acuity Cards, while no differences between groups were found for AIMS. No differences were found in any outcome measure results (T2-T0), between infants who started CareToy training before or after one month of standard care. This RCT study confirms the results of a previous pilot study, indicating that CareToy system can provide effective home-based EI.

https://openalex.org/W2602367518,"Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived circulating protein, accumulates in the heart, vascular endothelium, and skeletal muscles through an interaction with T-cadherin (T-cad), a unique glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cadherin. Recent studies have suggested that this interaction is essential for adiponectin-mediated cardiovascular protection. However, the precise protein-protein interaction between adiponectin and T-cad remains poorly characterized. Using ELISA-based and surface plasmon analyses, we report here that T-cad fused with IgG Fc as a fusion tag by replacing its glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor specifically bound both hexameric and larger multimeric adiponectin with a dissociation constant of ˜1.0 nm and without any contribution from other cellular or serum factors. The extracellular T-cad repeats 1 and 2 were critical for the observed adiponectin binding, which is required for classical cadherin-mediated cell-to-cell adhesion. Moreover, the 130-kDa prodomain-bearing T-cad, uniquely expressed on the cell surface among members of the cadherin family and predominantly increased by adiponectin, contributed significantly to adiponectin binding. Inhibition of prodomain-processing by a prohormone convertase inhibitor increased 130-kDa T-cad levels and also enhanced adiponectin binding to endothelial cells both by more preferential cell-surface localization and by higher adiponectin-binding affinity of 130-kDa T-cad relative to 100-kDa T-cad. The preferential cell-surface localization of 130-kDa T-cad relative to 100-kDa T-cad was also observed in normal mice aorta in vivo. In conclusion, our study shows that a unique key feature of the T-cad prodomain is its involvement in binding of the T-cad repeats 1 and 2 to adiponectin and also demonstrates that adiponectin positively regulates T-cad abundance.

https://openalex.org/W2599608765,"In the setting of profound ocular blindness, numerous lines of evidence demonstrate the existence of dramatic anatomical and functional changes within the brain. However, previous studies based on a variety of distinct measures have often provided inconsistent findings. To help reconcile this issue, we used a multimodal magnetic resonance (MR)-based imaging approach to provide complementary structural and functional information regarding this neuroplastic reorganization. This included gray matter structural morphometry, high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) of white matter connectivity and integrity, and resting state functional connectivity MRI (rsfcMRI) analysis. When comparing the brains of early blind individuals to sighted controls, we found evidence of co-occurring decreases in cortical volume and cortical thickness within visual processing areas of the occipital and temporal cortices respectively. Increases in cortical volume in the early blind were evident within regions of parietal cortex. Investigating white matter connections using HARDI revealed patterns of increased and decreased connectivity when comparing both groups. In the blind, increased white matter connectivity (indexed by increased fiber number) was predominantly left-lateralized, including between frontal and temporal areas implicated with language processing. Decreases in structural connectivity were evident involving frontal and somatosensory regions as well as between occipital and cingulate cortices. Differences in white matter integrity (as indexed by quantitative anisotropy, or QA) were also in general agreement with observed pattern changes in the number of white matter fibers. Analysis of resting state sequences showed evidence of both increased and decreased functional connectivity in the blind compared to sighted controls. Specifically, increased connectivity was evident between temporal and inferior frontal areas. Decreases in functional connectivity were observed between occipital and frontal and somatosensory-motor areas and between temporal (mainly fusiform and parahippocampus) and parietal, frontal, and other temporal areas. Correlations in white matter connectivity and functional connectivity observed between early blind and sighted controls showed an overall high degree of association. However, comparing the relative changes in white matter and functional connectivity between early blind and sighted controls did not show a significant correlation. In summary, these findings provide complimentary evidence, as well as highlight potential contradictions, regarding the nature of regional and large scale neuroplastic reorganization resulting from early onset blindness."
https://openalex.org/W2599974228,"Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) has continuously improved over the last decade. However, disease monitoring remains underdeveloped and mostly dependent on imaging e.g. RECIST 1.1 criteria. The genetic landscape of individual cancers and subsequently occurring treatment-induced evolution remain neglected in current surveillance strategies. Novel biomarkers demand minimally invasive and repetitive tracking of the cancer mutagenome for therapy stratification and to make prognostic predictions. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a routinely used tumor marker for CRC, does not meet these goals and thus prevents its use as a reliable monitoring tool. A tumor-derived fraction of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), isolated from blood samples, may bypass the limitations of currently available biomarkers and could be a tool for noninvasive disease monitoring. Here, total cfDNA levels differentiated a cohort of metastatic CRC patients from healthy controls. Furthermore, we correlated cfDNA during chemotherapy of 27 stage IV patients with clinical parameters to establish its prognostic and predictive value. Indeed, cfDNA levels in chemotherapy naive patients correlate with the tumor burden and CEA values at diagnosis and increase upon disease progression during 1st and 2nd line treatment. Moreover, we confirm the possibility of cfDNA-based genotyping of KRAS to early detect the emergence of resistance during chemotherapy. These data indicate that repetitive quantitative and mutational analysis of cfDNA might complement current treatment standards but may have also limited value in some patients."
https://openalex.org/W2599426071,"Epidemiological studies found that hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV-3) infection was associated with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis in immunocompromised patients. Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between the host immunosuppressive status and the occurrence of HEV-related chronic hepatitis. Here we describe a successful experimental study, using cynomolgus monkeys previously treated with tacrolimus, a potent calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant, and infected with a Brazilian HEV-3 strain isolated from naturally infected pigs. HEV infected monkeys were followed up during 160 days post infection (dpi) by clinical signs; virological, biochemical and haematological parameters; and liver histopathology. The tacrolimus blood levels were monitored throughout the experiment. Immunosuppression was confirmed by clinical and laboratorial findings, such as: moderate weight loss, alopecia, and herpes virus opportunistic infection. In this study, chronic HEV infection was characterized by the mild increase of liver enzymes serum levels; persistent RNA viremia and viral faecal shedding; and liver histopathology. Three out of four immunosuppressed monkeys showed recurrent HEV RNA detection in liver samples, evident hepatocellular ballooning degeneration, mild to severe macro and microvesicular steatosis (zone 1), scattered hepatocellular apoptosis, and lobular focal inflammation. At 69 dpi, liver biopsies of all infected monkeys revealed evident ballooning degeneration (zone 3), discrete hepatocellular apoptosis, and at most mild portal and intra-acinar focal inflammation. At 160 dpi, the three chronically HEV infected monkeys showed microscopic features (piecemeal necrosis) corresponding to chronic hepatitis in absence of fibrosis and cirrhosis in liver parenchyma. Within 4-months follow up, the tacrolimus-immunosuppressed cynomolgus monkeys infected with a Brazilian swine HEV-3 strain exhibited more severe hepatic lesions progressing to chronic hepatitis without liver fibrosis, similarly as shown in tacrolimus-immunosuppressed solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. The cause-effect relationship between HEV infection and tacrolimus treatment was confirmed in this experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2602592835,"Fibronectin is a multidomain protein secreted by various cell types. It forms a network of fibers within the extracellular matrix and impacts intracellular processes by binding to various molecules, primarily integrin receptors on the cells. Both the presence of several isoforms and the ability of the various domains and isoforms to bind to a variety of integrins result in a wide range of effects. In vivo findings suggest that fibronectin isoforms produced by the osteoblasts enhance their differentiation. Here we report that the isoform characterized by the presence of extradomain A activates α4β1 integrin and augments osteoblast differentiation. In addition, the isoform containing extradomain B enhances the binding of fibronectin through the RGD sequence to β3-containing integrin, resulting in increased mineralization by and differentiation of osteoblasts. Our study thus reveals novel functions for two fibronectin isoforms and the mediating receptors in osteoblast differentiation."

We provide an illustrated worker-based species identification key for all species found on Madagascar, as well as detailed taxonomic descriptions, which include diagnoses, discussions, measurements, natural history data, high-quality montage images and distribution maps for both new species. In addition to conventional morphological examination, we have used virtual reconstructions based on volumetric μCT scanning data for the species descriptions. We also include 3D PDFs, still images of virtual reconstructions, and 3D rotation videos for both holotype workers and one paratype queen. The complete μCT datasets have been made available online (Dryad, https://datadryad.org) and represent the first cybertypes in ants (and insects). We discuss the potential of μCT scanning and critically assess the usefulness of cybertypes for ant taxonomy."

https://openalex.org/W2602105280,"Serum Cl (sCl) alterations in hospitalized patients have not been comprehensively studied in recent years. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and outcome significance of (1) sCl alterations on hospital admission, and (2) sCl evolution within the first 48 hr of hospital admission. We conducted a retrospective study of all hospital admissions in the years 2011–2013 at Mayo Clinic Rochester, a 2000-bed tertiary medical center. Outcome measures included hospital mortality, length of hospital stay and discharge disposition. 76,719 unique admissions (≥18 years old) were studied. Based on hospital mortality, sCl in the range of 105–108 mmol/L was found to be optimal. sCl <100 (n = 13,611) and >108 (n = 11,395) mmol/L independently predicted a higher risk of hospital mortality, longer hospital stay and being discharged to a care facility. 13,089 patients (17.1%) had serum anion gap >12 mmol/L; their hospital mortality, when compared to 63,630 patients (82.9%) with anion gap ≤12 mmol/L, was worse. Notably, patients with elevated anion gap displayed a progressively worsening mortality with rising sCl. sCl elevation within 48 hr of admission was associated with a higher proportion of 0.9% saline administration and was an independent predictor for hospital mortality. Moreover, the magnitude of sCl rise was inversely correlated to the days of patient survival. In conclusion, serum Cl alterations on admission predict poor clinical outcomes. Post-admission sCl increase, due to Cl-rich fluid infusion, independently predicts hospital mortality. These results raise a critical question of whether iatrogenic cause of hyperchloremia should be avoided, a question to be addressed by future prospective studies."
https://openalex.org/W2598419926,"Appropriate large-scale citizen-science data present important new opportunities for biodiversity modelling, due in part to the wide spatial coverage of information. Recently proposed occupancy modelling approaches naturally incorporate random effects in order to account for annual variation in the composition of sites surveyed. In turn this leads to Bayesian analysis and model fitting, which are typically extremely time consuming. Motivated by presence-only records of occurrence from the UK Butterflies for the New Millennium data base, we present an alternative approach, in which site variation is described in a standard way through logistic regression on relevant environmental covariates. This allows efficient occupancy model-fitting using classical inference, which is easily achieved using standard computers. This is especially important when models need to be fitted each year, typically for many different species, as with British butterflies for example. Using both real and simulated data we demonstrate that the two approaches, with and without random effects, can result in similar conclusions regarding trends. There are many advantages to classical model-fitting, including the ability to compare a range of alternative models, identify appropriate covariates and assess model fit, using standard tools of maximum likelihood. In addition, modelling in terms of covariates provides opportunities for understanding the ecological processes that are in operation. We show that there is even greater potential; the classical approach allows us to construct regional indices simply, which indicate how changes in occupancy typically vary over a species’ range. In addition we are also able to construct dynamic occupancy maps, which provide a novel, modern tool for examining temporal changes in species distribution. These new developments may be applied to a wide range of taxa, and are valuable at a time of climate change. They also have the potential to motivate citizen scientists."
https://openalex.org/W2598110060,"This study was designed to advance understanding of phosphorus regulation of Microcystis aeruginosa growth, phosphorus uptake and storage in changing phosphorus (P) conditions as would occur in lakes. We hypothesized that Microcystis growth and nutrient uptake would fit classic models by Monod, Droop, and Michaelis-Menten in these changing conditions. Microcystis grown in luxury nutrient concentrations was transferred to treatments with phosphorus concentrations ranging from 0-256 μg P∙L-1 and luxury nitrogen. Dissolved phosphorus concentration, cell phosphorus quota, P uptake rate and cell densities were measured at day 3 and 6. Results showed little relationship to predicted models. Microcystis growth was asymptotically related to P treatment from day 0-3, fitting Monod model well, but negatively related to P treatment and cell quota from day 3-6. From day 0-3, cell quota was negatively related to P treatments at <2 μg∙L-1, but increased slightly at higher P. Cell quota decreased greatly in low P treatments from day 3-6, which may have enabled high growths in low P treatments. P uptake was positively and linearly related to P treatment during both periods. Negative uptake rates and increases in measured culture phosphorus concentrations to 5 μg∙L-1 in the lowest P treatments indicated P leaked from cells into culture medium. This leakage during early stages of the experiment may have been sufficient to stimulate metabolism and use of intracellular P stores in low P treatments for rapid growth. Our study shows P regulation of Microcystis growth can be complex as a result of changing P concentrations, and this complexity may be important for modeling Microcystis for nutrient and ecosystem management."
https://openalex.org/W2602004583,"We conducted a multi-isotope study of five fifth-century AD cemeteries in modern-day Hungary to determine relationships between nomadic-pastoralist incomers—the historically documented Huns and other nomadic groups—and the sedentary agricultural population of the late Roman province of Pannonia. Contemporary historical sources describe this relationship as adversarial and destructive for the late Roman population, but archaeological evidence indicates high levels of hybridity between different groups. We undertook carbon, nitrogen, strontium and oxygen isotope analyses of bone collagen, dentine and tooth enamel at Keszthely-Fenékpuszta, Hács-Béndekpuszta, Győr-Széchenyi Square, Mözs and Szolnok-Szanda to examine these relationships through past subsistence practices. The patterns at all sites indicate medium to high animal protein consumption with little evidence for a significant contribution of aquatic resources. All populations relied to a great extent on C4 plants, most likely millet. Within each population, diet was heterogeneous, with significant variations in terms of animal protein and C3 and C4 plant consumption. High levels of intra-population and individual variability suggest that populations made use of a range of subsistence strategies, with many individuals exhibiting significant changes over their lifetimes. Rather than being characterised only by violence, the historically-documented influx of nomadic populations appears to have led to widespread changes in subsistence strategies of populations in the Carpathian basin. Nomadic-pastoralist groups may have switched to smaller herds and more farming, and, conversely, local populations may have integrated with a new economic system based on animal herding."

The mechanisms by which they perform this function have been hard to define due to limited structural information; currently, there is only one high-resolution structure of a plant sHsp published, that of the cytosolic Hsp16.9. We took interest in Hsp21, a chloroplast-localized sHsp crucial for plant stress resistance, which has even longer N-terminal arms than Hsp16.9, with a functionally important and conserved methionine-rich motif. To provide a framework for investigating structure-function relationships of Hsp21 and understanding these sequence variations, we developed a structural model of Hsp21 based on homology modeling, cryo-EM, cross-linking mass spectrometry, NMR, and small-angle X-ray scattering. Our data suggest a dodecameric arrangement of two trimer-of-dimer discs stabilized by the C-terminal tails, possibly through tail-to-tail interactions between the discs, mediated through extended IXVXI motifs. Our model further suggests that six N-terminal arms are located on the outside of the dodecamer, accessible for interaction with client proteins, and distinct from previous undefined or inwardly facing arms. To test the importance of the IXVXI motif, we created the point mutant V181A, which, as expected, disrupts the Hsp21 dodecamer and decreases chaperone activity. Finally, our data emphasize that sHsp chaperone efficiency depends on oligomerization and that client interactions can occur both with and without oligomer dissociation. These results provide a generalizable workflow to explore sHsps, expand our understanding of sHsp structural motifs, and provide a testable Hsp21 structure model to inform future investigations.

https://openalex.org/W2602048255,"Background The guidelines for colonoscopy present withdrawal time (WT) and adenoma detection rate (ADR) as the quality indicator. The purpose of this retrospective study is to analyze the predicting factors with polyp detection rate (PDR) as a surrogate for ADR by using comprehensive health checkup data, and assess the correlation between PDR per each colonic segment and WT, and factors influencing WT. Methods One thousand and thirty six consecutive health checkup cases from April 2015 to March 2016 were enrolled in this study, and 880 subjects who undertook colonoscopy without polyp removal or biopsy were divided into the two groups (polyp not detected group vs polyp detected group). The two groups were compared by subjects and clinical characteristics with univariate analysis followed by multivariate analysis. Colonoscopies with longer WT (≥ 6 min) and those with shorter WT (< 6 min) were compared by PDR per each colonic segment, and also by subjects and clinical characteristics. Results A total of 1009 subjects included two incomplete colonoscopies (CIR, 99.9%) and overall PDR was 35.8%. A multiple logistic regression model demonstrated that age, gender, and WT were significantly related factors for polyp detection (odds ratio, 1.036; 1.771; 1.217). PDR showed a linear increase as WT increased from 3 min to 9 min (r = 0.989, p = 0.000) and PDR with long WT group was higher than that with short WT group per each colonic segment, significantly in transverse (2.3 times, p = 0.004) and sigmoid colon (2.1 times, p = 0.001). Not only bowel preparation quality but also insertion difficulty evaluated by endoscopist were significant factors relating with WT (odds ratio, 3.811; 1.679). Conclusion This study suggests that endoscopists should be recommended to take more time up to 9 min of WT to observe transverse and sigmoid colon, especially when they feel no difficulty during scope insertion."
https://openalex.org/W2603110444,"Calcium polystyrene sulfonate (CPS) has long been used to treat hyperkalemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, its efficacy and safety profile have not been systematically explored. We investigated the long-term efficacy of oral CPS for treating mild hyperkalemia on an outpatient basis.We performed a retrospective analysis of ambulatory CKD patients who were prescribed CPS for > 1 week because of elevated serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L. Patients were divided into four groups according to the length of time that they took a fixed dosage of CPS (Group 1, < 3 months; Group 2, 3-6 months; Group 3, 6-12 months; and Group 4, > 1 year). Response was defined as a decrease in the serum potassium level (> 0.3 mmol/L) after treatment with CPS.We enrolled a total of 247 adult patients with a basal eGFR level of 30 ± 15 mL/min/1.73 m2. All patients took small doses of CPS (8.0 ± 3.6 g/d), and serum potassium decreased in a dose-dependent fashion. Serum potassium of all patients decreased significantly from 5.8 ± 0.3 mmol/L to 4.9 ± 0.7 mmol/L with CPS treatment (P < 0.001). The response rates were 79.9%, 71.4%, 66.7%, and 86.8% in Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. No serious adverse effects were reported during CPS administration, though constipation was noted in 19 patients (8%).Small doses of oral CPS are effective and safe for controlling mild hyperkalemia in CKD patients over a long period of time."
https://openalex.org/W2598454275,"The phagocytic elimination of cells undergoing apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved innate immune mechanism for eliminating unnecessary cells. Previous studies showed an increase in the level of engulfment receptors in phagocytes after the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, which leads to the enhancement of their phagocytic activity. However, precise mechanisms underlying this phenomenon require further clarification. We found that the pre-incubation of a Drosophila phagocyte cell line with the fragments of apoptotic cells enhanced the subsequent phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, accompanied by an augmented expression of the engulfment receptors Draper and integrin αPS3. The DNA-binding activity of the transcription repressor Tailless was transiently raised in those phagocytes, depending on two partially overlapping signal-transduction pathways for the induction of phagocytosis as well as the occurrence of engulfment. The RNAi knockdown of tailless in phagocytes abrogated the enhancement of both phagocytosis and engulfment receptor expression. Furthermore, the hemocyte-specific RNAi of tailless reduced apoptotic cell clearance in Drosophila embryos. Taken together, we propose the following mechanism for the activation of Drosophila phagocytes after an encounter with apoptotic cells: two partially overlapping signal-transduction pathways for phagocytosis are initiated; transcription repressor Tailless is activated; expression of engulfment receptors is stimulated; and phagocytic activity is enhanced.

This phenomenon most likely ensures the phagocytic elimination of apoptotic cells by stimulated phagocytes and is thus considered as a mechanism to prime phagocytes in innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2582613650,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) is a transcription factor controlling a broad range of genes essential for homeostasis, including genes related to immune functions, inflammation, metabolism and growth. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) also called as Regnase-1 is an RNase and has been shown to decrease the stability of short-lived transcripts coding for inflammation-related proteins, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12b, IER-3, c-Rel. We found previously that the half-life of the C/EBPβ transcript is regulated by MCPIP. To understand the mechanism driving down-regulation of C/EBPβ by MCPIP1, we applied an in vitro cleavage assay, followed by a luciferase-reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). We demonstrated that MCPIP1 recognizes regions of the 3'UTR of C/EBPβ mRNA and promotes its decay by introducing direct endonucleolytic cleavage."

Its localization at the high-curvature rim domains of outer segment disk membranes suggests that it may act to shape these structures; however, the molecular function of this protein is not yet resolved. Here, we apply biochemical, biophysical, and imaging techniques to elucidate the role(s) played by the protein's intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain and an incipient amphipathic α-helix contained within it. We investigated a deletion mutant lacking only this α-helix in stable cell lines and Xenopus laevis photoreceptors. We also studied a soluble form of the full-length ˜7-kDa cytoplasmic C terminus in cultured cells and purified from Escherichia coli. The α-helical motif was not required for protein biosynthesis, tetrameric subunit assembly, tetramer polymerization, localization at disk rims, interaction with GARP2, or the generation of membrane curvature. Interestingly, however, loss of the helical motif up-regulated membrane curvature generation in cellulo, introducing the possibility that it may regulate this activity in photoreceptors. Furthermore, the incipient α-helix (within the purified soluble C terminus) partitioned into membranes only when its acidic residues were neutralized by protonation. This suggests that within the context of full-length peripherin-2/rds, partitioning would most likely occur at a bilayer interfacial region, potentially adjacent to the protein's transmembrane domains. In sum, this study significantly strengthens the evidence that peripherin-2/rds functions directly to shape the high-curvature rim domains of the outer segment disk and suggests that the protein's C terminus may modulate membrane curvature-generating activity present in other protein domains.

The cellular basis for vertebrate vision rests upon many hundreds of precisely sculpted and stacked membranous disks that absorb visible light and scaffold a G-protein-mediated phototransduction cascade. The regularity and precision with which these membranes are organized have fascinated cell biologists for more than half a century, and their importance for photoreceptor electrophysiological function has been recognized for several decades (1Kennedy B.

Signal transducing membrane complexes of photoreceptor outer segments.Vision Res. 2008; 48: 2052-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In both rod and cone photoreceptors, stacked membranous disks constitute the outer segment (OS) 2The abbreviations used are: OSouter segmentP/rdsperipherin-2/rdsAHamphipathic helixEndo Hendoglycosidase HIHCimmunohistochemistryWGAwheat germ agglutininGARPglutamic acid-rich proteinITFintrinsic tryptophan fluorescenceLUVlarge unilamellar vesiclePOPG2-oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-glycerolPOPC2-oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineERendoplasmic reticulumERGICendosomal reticulum-Golgi intermediate complexERCendosomal recycling compartmentTEMtransmission electron microscopyDOPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineDOPE1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamineDOPS1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserineLSCMlaser-scanning confocal microscopyPNGasepeptide:N-glycosidasedpfdays post-fertilizationPCCPearson's correlation coefficient. organelles of these cells. Maintaining this complex architecture represents a constant challenge for retinal photoreceptors, because a significant amount of disk membrane in each OS is renewed on a daily basis (3Young R.W. Visual cells and the concept of renewal.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1976; 15: 700-725PubMed Google Scholar). The disruption of OS membrane structure or renewal by environmental and/or genetic causes compromises photoreceptor function and can lead to progressive and debilitating retinal diseases (4Wensel T.G.

The molecular basis for the formation and maintenance of photoreceptor OS membrane architecture has begun to come into focus but is not yet well resolved (4Wensel T.G. Zhang Z. Anastassov I.A.

Eye Res. 2016; 55: 52-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Advancing understanding in this area will require a molecular level knowledge of how individual OS disk structures are generated and maintained. Disks are defined by high-curvature rim domains at their peripheries, which are structurally and biochemically distinct (7Falk G. Fatt P. Changes in structure of the disks of retinal rods in hypotonic solutions.J. Cell Sci. 1973; 13: 787-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Falk G. Fatt P.

Photoreceptors at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 4039-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Both rod and cone disks require rim domains; mature rod disks are distinct intracellular compartments that are fully bounded by rim, whereas most (perhaps all) cone disks retain at least some measure of edge domain and therefore maintain continuity with the OS plasma membrane (10Steinberg R.H. Fisher S.K. Anderson D.H. Disc morphogenesis in vertebrate photoreceptors.J. Comp. Neurol. 1980; 190: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 11Anderson D.H. Fisher S.K. Steinberg R.H. Mammalian cones: disc shedding, phagocytosis, and renewal.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1978; 17: 117-133PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms that create/maintain the high-curvature rim domains are of key importance, because membrane structures with diameters of this scale (˜26 nm) require shaping by active mechanisms and specialized proteins (12Shibata Y. Hu J. Kozlov M.M. Rapoport T.A. Mechanisms shaping the membranes of cellular organelles.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 329-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The question of how disk rims are shaped is not yet answered; however, several reports indicate that peripherin-2/rds (P/rds), an integral membrane protein and member of the tetraspanin superfamily, can act to generate membrane curvature (13Kevany B.M. Tsybovsky Y. Campuzano I.D. Schnier P.D. Engel A. Palczewski K. Structural and functional analysis of the native peripherin-ROM1 complex isolated from photoreceptor cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 36272-36284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Khattree N. Ritter L.M. Goldberg A.F.

Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 4659-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A potential role for P/rds in curvature generation was suggested when the protein was originally localized to disk rims (15Molday R.S. Hicks D. Molday L. Peripherin. A rim-specific membrane protein of rod outer segment discs.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1987; 28: 50-61PubMed Google Scholar); however, direct evidence for this hypothesis had been lacking until recently. P/rds is essential for the elaboration of photoreceptor OS organelles (16Travis G.H. Groshan K.R. Lloyd M. Bok D. Complete rescue of photoreceptor dysplasia and degeneration in transgenic retinal degeneration slow (rds) mice.Neuron. 1992; 9: 113-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although generally believed to function as a structural element, its mechanism of action is not yet well resolved (6Goldberg A.F. Moritz O.L. Williams D.S. Molecular basis for photoreceptor outer segment architecture.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2016; 55: 52-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Stuck M.W. Conley S.M. Naash M.I. PRPH2/RDS and ROM-1: historical context, current views and future considerations.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2016; 52: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The role of its cytoplasmic C terminus is particularly puzzling, in part because this ˜7-kDa intrinsically disordered domain has virtually no measurable secondary or tertiary structure in aqueous solution (18Ritter L.M. Arakawa T. Goldberg A.F. Predicted and measured disorder in peripherin/rds, a retinal tetraspanin.Protein Pept. Lett. 2005; 12: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The P/rds C terminus is nonetheless critical for physiological function, as demonstrated by the variety of pathogenic mutations that affect it (supplemental Fig. 1). Intrinsically disordered domains can acquire structure as a function of target binding (19Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Intrinsically disordered proteins in cellular signalling and regulation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 18-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), and membrane mimetics can induce secondary structure in the P/rds C terminus (18Ritter L.M. Arakawa T. Goldberg A.F. Predicted and measured disorder in peripherin/rds, a retinal tetraspanin.Protein Pept. Lett. 2005; 12: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Boesze-Battaglia K. Goldberg A.F. Dispoto J. Katragadda M. Cesarone G. Albert A.D. A soluble peripherin/Rds C-terminal polypeptide promotes membrane fusion and changes conformation upon membrane association.Exp.

Peripherin-2: an intracellular analogy to viral fusion proteins.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3605-3613Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); however, it is not known whether this domain is membrane-associated in photoreceptors. Three possibilities have been suggested with respect to the molecular activities of this domain. First, it is documented to participate in the targeting of P/rds to the OS in vivo (22Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Papermaster D.S. The C terminus of peripherin/rds participates in rod outer segment targeting and alignment of disk incisures.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Salinas R.Y. Baker S.A. Gospe 3rd., S.M. Arshavsky V.Y. A single valine residue plays an essential role in peripherin/rds targeting to photoreceptor outer segments.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8e54292Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar24Tian G. Ropelewski P. Nemet I. Lee R. Lodowski K.H. Imanishi Y. An unconventional secretory pathway mediates the cilia targeting of peripherin/rds.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 992-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Importantly, the region essential for targeting may overlap with that which gains structure in the presence of membrane mimetics. Second, the C-terminal domain can promote membrane-membrane fusion in vitro, and this activity was suggested to support OS membrane structure (20Boesze-Battaglia K. Goldberg A.F. Dispoto J. Katragadda M. Cesarone G. Albert A.D. A soluble peripherin/Rds C-terminal polypeptide promotes membrane fusion and changes conformation upon membrane association.Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Edrington 5th., T.C. Lapointe R. Yeagle P.L. Gretzula C.L. Boesze-Battaglia K. Peripherin-2: an intracellular analogy to viral fusion proteins.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3605-3613Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Third, one recent study shows that the P/rds C terminus can generate membrane curvature in vitro, and it suggests that this activity may contribute to the formation and/or stability of OS disk rims (14Khattree N. Ritter L.M. Goldberg A.F. Membrane curvature generation by a C-terminal amphipathic helix in peripherin-2/rds, a tetraspanin required for photoreceptor sensory cilium morphogenesis.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 4659-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Given the plasticity inherent in intrinsically disordered protein regions, it is conceivable that this domain participates in several activities. Here, we demonstrate that bona fide phospholipid membranes can induce an amphipathic helix (AH) in the P/rds C-terminal domain in vitro and that this motif is distinct from determinants for protein biosynthesis, trafficking, and interaction with GARP2. We further demonstrate that the incipient C-terminal AH is not required for P/rds membrane curvature generation but instead acts to suppress this activity. A variety of P/rds structure/function analyses have focused on disease-linked mutations in the conserved extracellular-2 region of the protein; however, less attention has been focused on the protein's intrinsically disordered cytoplasmic C terminus, which nevertheless plays a critical role for human vision (25Boon C.J. den Hollander A.I. Hoyng C.B. Cremers F.P. Klevering B.J. Keunen J.E. The spectrum of retinal dystrophies caused by mutations in the peripherin/RDS gene.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2008; 27: 213-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Here, we generated a novel deletion mutant, P/rdsΔAH, that eliminates only the residues encoding the proposed C-terminal helical motif (amino acids 310–325; illustrated in Fig. 1) to investigate its mechanistic significance. HEK AD293 (and COS-1) cells have proven to be valuable expression systems for the analysis of P/rds (14Khattree N. Ritter L.M. Goldberg A.F. Membrane curvature generation by a C-terminal amphipathic helix in peripherin-2/rds, a tetraspanin required for photoreceptor sensory cilium morphogenesis.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 4659-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, previous studies only used transiently transfected cells, which can show large cell-to-cell variability in protein expression. For this investigation, we also created and utilized stably expressing clonal cell lines to control for potential variability of protein expression. Stable lines were generated for the P/rdsΔAH mutant and for a WT P/rds control (described under “Experimental procedures”). We first assayed whether loss of the inducible C-terminal AH would impede protein biosynthesis. Fig. 2 shows a Western blotting analysis using the anti-P/rds monoclonal antibody MabC6 to compare P/rds variants stably expressed in HEK AD293 cell lines with native P/rds from bovine rod OS membranes. MabC6 binds an epitope at the protein's extreme C terminus and is therefore specific for fully translated P/rds (18Ritter L.M. Arakawa T. Goldberg A.F. Predicted and measured disorder in peripherin/rds, a retinal tetraspanin.Protein Pept. Lett. 2005; 12: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Expression and characterization of peripherin/rds-Rom-1 complexes and mutants implicated in retinal degenerative diseases.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 671-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); importantly, this epitope remains intact in the P/rdsΔAH mutant. Expression of the P/rdsΔAH mutant was robust, and the protein showed a somewhat increased mobility relative to WT P/rds (Fig. 2A), consistent with its reduced molecular mass (˜2 kDa). The P/rdsΔAH mutant was detected as several closely spaced bands, a result also commonly observed for WT P/rds. Each recombinant protein migrated more slowly than P/rds extracted from bovine rod OSs, consistent with the more extensive (and heterogeneous) glycosylation commonly associated with heterologously expressed P/rds (24Tian G. Ropelewski P. Nemet I. Lee R. Lodowski K.H. Imanishi Y. An unconventional secretory pathway mediates the cilia targeting of peripherin/rds.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 992-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Goldberg A.F. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Heterologous expression of photoreceptor peripherin/rds and Rom-1 in COS-1 cells: assembly, interactions, and localization of multisubunit complexes.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the absence of added reducing agent, the P/rdsΔAH mutant was present in both monomeric and dimeric forms, akin to WT P/rds and P/rds from bovine rod OSs (Fig. 2B). The dimer/monomer ratios were similar in all three samples (˜1:1). These results demonstrate that the deletion of the inducible C-terminal AH had no significant effect on the disulfide-mediated dimerization of P/rds that occurs during tetramer polymerization. Because native P/rds is characterized by an N-linked carbohydrate modification that can affect its function (28Stuck M.W. Conley S.M. Naash M.I. Retinal degeneration slow (RDS) glycosylation plays a role in cone function and in the regulation of RDS.ROM-1 protein complex formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 27901-27913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we tested the effects of glycosidases on the stably expressed recombinant proteins (Fig. 2C). In response to PNGase F, a mobility increase was observed for the P/rdsΔAH mutant protein, as well as for the WT P/rds protein. This finding indicates that each protein is covalently modified by the addition of an N-linked carbohydrate moiety. Mobility increases were also observed for each protein in response to endoglycosidase H (Endo H), although slight differences were noted in the banding patterns. Although all carbohydrate on the WT protein was Endo H-sensitive, a fraction (˜30%) of the P/rdsΔAH protein appeared to be unaffected by Endo H treatment. Because Endo H resistance reflects glycan processing (and therefore protein processing by the trans-Golgi), this result suggests that deletion of the inducible C-terminal AH may alter secretory processing of the N-linked carbohydrate moiety. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that loss of the proposed C-terminal AH does not impair P/rds biosynthesis or its ability to be post-translationally modified in a manner largely similar to WT. The data also suggest that a fraction of the mutant protein may undergo differential post-translational processing. Previous investigations have demonstrated that P/rds in native ROS membranes is characterized by several steps of self-assembly. To examine whether the inducible C-terminal AH can also contribute to protein subunit assembly and/or disulfide-mediated tetramer polymerization, we conducted a hydrodynamic analysis using a sedimentation velocity approach developed previously (26Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Expression and characterization of peripherin/rds-Rom-1 complexes and mutants implicated in retinal degenerative diseases.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 671-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Non-denaturing detergent lysates were extracted from HEK AD293 cells stably expressing P/rdsΔAH or WT P/rds under reducing conditions, which were then layered onto sucrose gradients and centrifuged overnight. Fig. 3A shows representative data from reducing Western blotting analyses of the fractionated gradients run under reducing conditions and immunoblotted with anti-P/rds MabC6. The sedimentation profile for P/rdsΔAH (Fig. 3A, upper right) was essentially identical to that of WT P/rds (Fig. 3A, lower right). Each protein was observed as a single major species, with sedimentation coefficients (s20, w) of 5.0 ± 02 (mean ± S.D., n = 4) for the P/rdsΔAH mutant and 5.3 (mean, n = 2), for the WT; in each case these values reflect a tetrameric protein (29Goldberg A.F. Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. Cysteine residues of photoreceptor peripherin/rds: role in subunit assembly and autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). No protein was found in the pellet fraction (Fig. 3A, lane P) for either variant. These observations demonstrate that P/rdsΔAH subunit assembly is unaffected by loss of its C-terminal inducible AH and that the information required to specify a tetrameric stoichiometry lies outside of this region. When sedimentations were instead performed under non-reducing conditions, using HEK AD293 lysates extracted under disulfide-preserving conditions, P/rdsΔAH and WT P/rds each sedimented as multiple species. Fig. 3B shows the sedimentation profiles revealed by Western blotting analyses conducted under non-reducing conditions. In addition to a tetrameric form, each variant also showed the incorporation of tetramers into more massive forms, including significant accumulations in the pellet fraction. These larger species include octamers and higher order polymers of P/rds, formed by intermolecular disulfide bonds that link tetramers together (30Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. Disulfide-mediated oligomerization of Peripherin/Rds and Rom-1 in photoreceptor disk membranes. Implications for photoreceptor outer segment morphogenesis and degeneration.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5370-5378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because the sedimentation profiles of unreduced P/rdsΔAH and WT P/rds were essentially identical, it can be concluded that the C-terminal AH is not essential for the polymerization of P/rds tetramers into higher-order forms via intermolecular disulfide bonds. Altogether, the findings presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that loss of the inducible C-terminal AH does not impair any of the known assembly processes responsible for generating normal P/rds quaternary protein structure in cultured cells. Because numerous studies demonstrate that COS-1 and HEK 293 cells are excellent model systems for P/rds subunit assembly in vertebrate photoreceptors (26Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S.

Genet. 2004; 13: 2075-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it is likely that the P/rds quaternary structure likewise does not rely on the C-terminal inducible AH in vertebrate photoreceptors. A previous study has highlighted the importance of P/rds tetramerization for routing the protein to its site of function in the OS organelle (36Loewen C.J. Moritz O.L. Tam B.M. Papermaster D.S.

Cell. 2003; 14: 3400-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because subunit assembly and polymerization of the P/rdsΔAH mutant appeared normal, it was of interest to investigate its trafficking and localization in vertebrate photoreceptors. The P/rds C terminus has previously been implicated in the routing of P/rds to OSs (22Tam B.M. Moritz O.L. Papermaster D.S.

A single valine residue plays an essential role in peripherin/rds targeting to photoreceptor outer segments.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8e54292Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To test the importance of the AH region for P/rds targeting, we chose transgenic Xenopus laevis photoreceptors, a preferred system for this purpose, due to the large diameters of their OSs (37Tam B.M. Lai C.C. Zong Z. Moritz O.L. Generation of transgenic X. laevis models of retinal degeneration.Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 935: 113-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To allow for the unique identification of the mutant protein in the context of the endogenous frog P/rds, a P/rdsΔAH minigene was constructed, based on the bovine P/rds sequence. A previous study has demonstrated that the WT bovine P/rds ortholog is properly expressed and localized in this system (38Ritter L.M. Khattree N. Tam B. Moritz O.L. Schmitz F. Goldberg A.F.

Transgenesis was conducted by injecting IseI-digested DNA into fertilized X. laevis eggs, and ocular cryosections from positive Fo and F1 tadpoles were analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and laser-scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). Fig. 4A (upper panel) presents a double-labeling experiment, using anti-bovine P/rds polyclonal antibody PabBCT in conjunction with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a marker of photoreceptor OSs. The transgenic mutant protein (Fig. 4A, red) was present only in OSs, in a pattern consistent with labeling of disk rims. Similar results were obtained when double-labeling of the P/rdsΔAH mutant was performed with additional markers, including the Na+K+-ATPase (Fig. 4A, middle panel), which labels inner segment plasma membranes, and endogenous frog P/rds (Fig. 4A, lower panel), which resides solely in OS disk rim membranes. In each case, the P/rdsΔAH mutant localized solely to photoreceptor OSs in patterns expected for disk rim localization. Closer inspection of the mutant protein distribution revealed a high degree of overlap with endogenous frog P/rds. Fig. 4B shows representative fields from two different Fo animals; each illustrates similar labeling patterns for transgenic mutant and endogenous WT proteins. Distributions that include OS periphery labeling and longitudinal striations are characteristic of disk rim localized proteins, and they reflect the numerous incisures (infoldings) present in fr"
https://openalex.org/W2603153405,"While radiotherapy is a mainstay for cancer therapy, pneumonitis and fibrosis constitute dose-limiting side effects of thorax and whole body irradiation. So far, the contribution of immune cells to disease progression is largely unknown. Here we studied the role of ecto-5'-nucelotidase (CD73)/adenosine-induced changes in the myeloid compartment in radiation-induced lung fibrosis. C57BL/6 wild-type or CD73-/- mice received a single dose of whole thorax irradiation (WTI, 15 Gy). Myeloid cells were characterized in flow cytometric, histologic, and immunohistochemical analyses as well as RNA analyses. WTI induced a pronounced reduction of alveolar macrophages in both strains that recovered within 6 wk. Fibrosis development in wild-type mice was associated with a time-dependent deposition of hyaluronic acid (HA) and increased expression of markers for alternative activation on alveolar macrophages. These include the antiinflammatory macrophage mannose receptor and arginase-1. Further, macrophages accumulated in organized clusters and expressed profibrotic mediators at ‡25 wk after irradiation (fibrotic phase). Irradiated CD73-/- mice showed an altered regulation of components of the HA system and no clusters of alternatively activated macrophages. We speculate that accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages in organized clusters represents the origins of fibrotic foci after WTI and is promoted by a cross-talk between HA, CD73/adenosine signaling, and other profibrotic mediators.—De Leve, S., Wirsdörfer, F., Cappuccini, F., Schütze, A., Meyer, A.

https://openalex.org/W2602036000,"Members of the IL-12 family perform essential functions in immunoregulation by connecting innate and adaptive immunity and are emerging therapeutic targets. They are unique among other interleukins in forming heterodimers that arise from extensive subunit sharing within the family, leading to the production of at least four functionally distinct heterodimers from only five subunits. This raises important questions about how the assembly of IL-12 family members is regulated and controlled in the cell. Here, using cell-biological approaches, we have dissected basic principles that underlie the biogenesis of the founding member of the family, IL-12. Within the native IL-12 heterodimer, composed of IL-12α and IL-12β, IL-12α possesses three intramolecular and one intermolecular disulfide bridges. We show that, in isolation, IL-12α fails to form its native structure but, instead, misfolds, forming incorrect disulfide bonds. Co-expression of its β subunit inhibits misfolding and thus allows secretion of biologically active heterodimeric IL-12. On the basis of these findings, we identified the disulfide bonds in IL-12α that are critical for assembly-induced secretion and biological activity of IL-12 versus misfolding and degradation of IL-12α. Surprisingly, two of the three disulfide bridges in IL-12α are dispensable for IL-12 secretion, stability, and biological activity. Extending our findings, we show that misfolding also occurs for IL-23α, another IL-12 family protein. Our results indicate that assembly-induced folding is key in IL-12 family biogenesis and secretion. The identification of essential disulfide bonds that underlie this process lays the basis for a simplified yet functional IL-12 cytokine.

https://openalex.org/W2598880777,"Norms and stigma regarding pregnancy decisions (parenting, adoption, and abortion) are salient to maternal well-being, particularly for groups disproportionately affected by unintended pregnancy. However, there are few validated measures of individual-level perceptions of norms and stigma around pregnancy decisions. Additionally, little is known about variation in the content of norms regarding pregnancy decisions, and in stigma related to violations of these norms, across socio-demographic groups.To create measures of perceived norms and stigma around pregnancy decisions, we developed and pre-tested 97 survey items using a mixed methods approach. The resulting survey was administered to 642 young adult women recruited from health department clinics and a public university campus in Birmingham, Alabama. Principal components factor analyses, reliability analyses, independent t-tests, and correlation analyses were conducted to establish the reliability and validity of scales. Additionally, multiple linear regression was used to identify demographic predictors of higher scale scores.Factor analyses revealed four subscales for each pregnancy decision: conditional acceptability, anticipated reactions, stereotypes/misperceptions, and attitudes. The total scales and their subscales demonstrated good internal reliability (alpha coefficients 0.72-0.94). The mean scores for each scale were significantly associated with each other, with related measures, and differed by sociodemographic characteristics. Specifically, in adjusted analyses, women in the university setting and White women expressed more negative attitudes and stigma around parenting. Minority women endorsed more negative norms and stigma around adoption. Finally, women from the health department, White women, and religious women expressed more negative norms and stigma around abortion.Findings suggest that our multidimensional measures have good psychometric properties in our sample of young women in the U.S. South, and highlight the importance of conceptualizing and measuring norms and stigmas around all pregnancy decisions. These scales may be of use in research on pregnancy decision-making and evaluation of stigma-reduction interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2600112268,"Sepsis-typically caused by an uncontrolled and amplified host systemic inflammatory response to microbial infection-is a life-threatening complex clinical disorder and remains a major cause of infection-related deaths in the intensive care unit. Emerging evidence suggests that neuropilin 1 (Nrp1), an originally defined coreceptor for class 3 semaphorins and VEGF, plays important roles in the immune system; however, the function and regulation of macrophage Nrp1 in host immune defense against bacterial infection remain unknown. To address this problem, we generated myeloid cell-specific Nrp1-knockout (Nrp1myel-KO) mice and applied 2 stringent animal models of sepsis: cecal ligation and puncture as well as intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Here, we reported that myeloid cell-specific Nrp1-deficient mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility to cecal ligation and puncture- and LPS-induced sepsis, which correlated with significantly decreased survival rates and heightened levels of proinflammatory cytokines in both peritoneal lavage and serum. Mechanistically, LPS specifically attenuated the expression of Nrp1 in macrophages, which was mediated by TLR4-NF-κB p50 and -65 pathways. By using isolated primary macrophages, loss of Nrp1 consistently resulted in increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, including iNOS, TNF-α, and IL-6. Together, these findings demonstrate a novel role of macrophage Nrp1 in sepsis.-Dai, X. Okon, I., Liu, Z., Wu, Y., Zhu, H., Song, P., Zou, M.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2602967166,"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are highly contagious pathogens that are associated with a wide spectrum of human illnesses involving the respiratory tract. In the present study, we investigate the epidemiologic and viral molecular features of HAdVs circulating in Senegal after 4 consecutive years of sentinel surveillance of influenza-like Illness cases.From January 2012 to December 2015 swabs were collected from consenting ILI outpatients. Adenoviral detection is performed by rRT-PCR with the Anyplex™ II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene) and molecular characterization was performed using a partial hexon gene sequence. 6381 samples were collected. More than half of patients (51.7%; 3297/6381) were children of ≤ 5 years. 1967 (30.8%) were positive for HAdV with 1561 (79.4%) found in co-infection with at least one another respiratory virus. The most common co-detections were with influenza viruses (53.1%; 1045/1967), rhinoviruses (30%; 591/1967), enteroviruses (18.5%; 364/1967) and RSV (13.5%; 266/1967). Children under 5 were the most infected group (62.2%; 1224/1967; p <0.05). We noted that HAdV was detected throughout the year at a high level with detection peaks of different amplitudes without any clear seasonality. Phylogenetic analysis revealed species HAdV-C in majority, species HAdV-B and one HAdV- 4 genome type. The 9 HAdV-B species like strains from Senegal grouped with genome types HAdV-7, HAdV-55 and HAdV-11 as shown by a phylogenetic branch with a high bootstrap value of (88%).In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest strong year-round HAdV activity in Senegal, especially in children up to 5 years of age. Molecular studies revealed that the dominant species in circulation in patients with ILI appears to be HAdV-C and HAdV-B species. The circulation of though HAdV-7 and HAdV-55 genome types is of note as these serotypes are recognized causes of more severe and even fatal acute respiratory infections."
https://openalex.org/W2597443829,"Background 40–50% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) will develop liver metastases (CRLM) during the course of the disease. One third of these patients will additionally develop pulmonary metastases. Methods 137 consecutive patients with CRLM, were analyzed regarding survival data, clinical, histological data and treatment. Results were stratified according to the occurrence of pulmonary metastases and metastases resection. Results 39% of all patients with liver resection due to CRLM developed additional lung metastases. 44% of these patients underwent subsequent pulmonary resection. Patients undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy showed a significantly better five-year survival compared to patients not qualified for curative resection (5-year survival 71.2% vs. 28.0%; p = 0.001). Interestingly, the 5-year survival of these patients was even superior to all patients with CRLM, who did not develop pulmonary metastases (77.5% vs. 63.5%; p = 0.015). Patients, whose pulmonary metastases were not resected, were more likely to redevelop liver metastases (50.0% vs 78.6%; p = 0.034). However, the rate of distant metastases did not differ between both groups (54.5 vs.53.6; p = 0.945). Conclusion The occurrence of colorectal lung metastases after curative liver resection does not impact patient survival if pulmonary metastasectomy is feasible. Those patients clearly benefit from repeated resections of the liver and the lung metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2599078200,"Chemical micropollutants occur worldwide in the environment at low concentrations and in complex mixtures, and how they affect the ecology of natural systems is still uncertain. Dynamics of natural communities are driven by the interaction between individual organisms and their growth environment, which is mediated by the organisms' expressed phenotypic traits. We tested whether exposure to a mixture of 12 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) influences phenotypic trait diversity in lake phytoplankton communities and their ability to regulate biomass production to fit environmental changes (response capacity). We exposed natural phytoplankton assemblages to three mixture levels in permeable microcosms maintained at three depths in a eutrophic lake for one week, during which the environmental conditions were fluctuating. We studied individual-level traits, phenotypic diversity and community biomass. PPCP reduced individual-level trait variance and overall community phenotypic diversity, but maintained higher standing phytoplankton biomass compared to untreated controls. Estimated effect sizes of PPCP on traits and community properties were very large (partial Eta-squared > 0.15). The PPCP mixture antagonistically interacted with the natural environmental gradient in habitats offered by different depths and, at concentrations comparable to those in waste-water effluents, prevented communities from converging to the same phenotypic structure and total biomass of unexposed controls. We show that micropollutants can alter individual-level trait diversity of lake phytoplankton communities and therefore their capacity to respond to natural environmental gradients, potentially affecting aquatic ecosystem processes."
https://openalex.org/W2601563222,"Repeated anaesthesia may be required in experimental protocols and in daily veterinary practice, but anaesthesia is known to alter physiological parameters in GPs (Cavia porcellus, GPs). This study investigated the effects of repeated anaesthesia with either medetomidine-midazolam-fentanyl (MMF) or isoflurane (Iso) on physiological parameters in the GP. Twelve GPs were repeatedly administered with MMF or Iso in two anaesthesia sets. One set consisted of six 40-min anaesthesias, performed over 3 weeks (2 per week); the anaesthetic used first was randomized. Prior to Iso anaesthesia, atropine was injected. MMF anaesthesia was antagonized with AFN (atipamezole-flumazenil-naloxone). Abdominally implanted radio-telemetry devices recorded the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and core body temperature continuously. Additionally, respiratory rate, blood glucose and body weight were assessed. An operable state could be achieved and maintained for 40 min in all GPs. During the surgical tolerance with MMF, the GPs showed a large MAP range between the individuals. In the MMF wake- up phase, the time was shortened until the righting reflex (RR) returned and that occurred at lower MAP and HR values. Repeated Iso anaesthesia led to an increasing HR during induction (anaesthesias 2–6), non-surgical tolerance (anaesthesias 3–6) and surgical tolerance (anaesthesias 4, 6). Both anaesthetics may be used repeatedly, as repeating the anaesthesias resulted in only slightly different physiological parameters, compared to those seen with single anaesthesias. The regular atropine premedication induced HR increases and repeated MMF anaesthesia resulted in a metabolism increase which led to the faster return of RR. Nevertheless, Iso’s anaesthesia effects of strong respiratory depression and severe hypotension remained. Based on this increased anaesthesia risk with Iso, MMF anaesthesia is preferable for repeated use in GPs."

This study investigated the frequencies and roles of NK cells in CHB, with a focus on activating receptor NKp46 and inhibitory receptor NKG2A.Peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained from 71 CHB patients and 37 healthy subjects (HS). The expressions of NKp46 and NKG2A were analyzed using flow cytometry. The role of NKp46-ligand was assessed using an in vitro co-culture system. Cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production in NK cells were evaluated using RT-PCR and flow cytometry.CHB patients were classified into treatment-naïve patients with low HBV DNA titer (CHB-L; n = 28), high HBV DNA titer (CHB-H; n = 24) by the cut-off level of serum HBV DNA 4 log copies/ml, and patients receiving nucleos(t)ide analogue (CHB-NA; n = 19). The expressions of NKp46 and NKG2A were higher in CHB-H than in HS/CHB-L/CHB-NA. HepG2.2.15 had higher NKp46-ligand expression than HepG2. When NK cells from HS were co-cultured with HepG2.2.15, inhibition of the NKp46 and NKp46-ligand interaction by anti-NKp46 antibody significantly reduced cytolysis of HepG2.2.15 and IFN-γ production. However, those reductions were not observed in co-culture with HepG2. Additionally, NK cells that highly expressed NKp46 also highly expressed NKG2A (NKp46highNKG2Ahigh subset). The frequencies of NKp46highNKG2Ahigh subset in CHB-H were higher than those in HS/CHB-L/CHB-NA. Among treatment-naïve CHB patients, the frequencies of NKp46highNKG2Ahigh subset were positively correlated with serum ALT (P<0.01, r = 0.45) and HBV DNA (P<0.01, r = 0.59) levels. The expressions of Fas-L, STAT1, TRAIL and CD107a were higher and IFN-γ expression was lower in the NKp46highNKG2Ahigh subset than in the other subsets.The NKp46 and NKp46-ligand interaction contributes to NK cell activation. A novel NK cell subset, the NKp46highNKG2Ahigh subset, may be associated with liver injury and HBV replication."

Crucial point for its accurate normalization is the choice of appropriate internal control genes (ICGs). In the present work we determined and compare the expression of eight commonly used ICGs in lymphocytes from 26 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 30 control subjects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before and after immortalization by EBV transfection (lymphoblast cell lines-LCLs) were used for qPCR analysis. LCLs were studied before and after liquid nitrogen cryopreservation and culturing (groups LCL1 and LCL2, respectively). qPCR data of 8 ICGs expression was analyzed by BestKeeper, NormFinder and geNorm methods. All studied genes (18SRNA, ACTB, B2M, GUSB,GAPDH, HPRT1, MT-ATP6 and RPS17) were expressed in PBMCs, whereas only first four in LCLs. LCLs cryopreservation had no effect on ICGs expression. Comprehensive ranking indicated RPS17 with MT-ATP6 as the best ICGs for qPCR in PBMCs of control and ALS subjects, and RPS17 with 18RNA or MT-ATP6 in LCLs from ALS. In PBMCs 18RNA shouldn't be used as ICG."
https://openalex.org/W2599490025,"Francisella tularensis, a gram–negative facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen, is the causative agent of tularemia and able to infect many mammalian species, including humans. Because of its ability to cause a lethal infection, low infectious dose, and aerosolizable nature, F. tularensis subspecies tularensis is considered a potential biowarfare agent. Due to its in vitro efficacy, ciprofloxacin is one of the antibiotics recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis of tularemia. In order to identify therapeutics that will be efficacious against infections caused by drug resistant select-agents and to better understand the threat, we sought to characterize an existing ciprofloxacin resistant (CipR) mutant in the Schu S4 strain of F. tularensis by determining its phenotypic characteristics and sequencing the chromosome to identify additional genetic alterations that may have occurred during the selection process. In addition to the previously described genetic alterations, the sequence of the CipR mutant strain revealed several additional mutations. Of particular interest was a frameshift mutation within kdsD which encodes for an enzyme necessary for the production of 3-Deoxy-D-manno-Octulosonic Acid (KDO), an integral component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A kdsD mutant was constructed in the Schu S4 strain. Although it was not resistant to ciprofloxacin, the kdsD mutant shared many phenotypic characteristics with the CipR mutant, including growth defects under different conditions, sensitivity to hydrophobic agents, altered LPS profiles, and attenuation in multiple models of murine tularemia. This study demonstrates that the KdsD enzyme is essential for Francisella virulence and may be an attractive therapeutic target for developing novel medical countermeasures."
https://openalex.org/W2601664089,"Lichens form a critical portion of barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) diets, especially during winter months. Here, we assess lichen mat volume across five herd ranges in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada, using newly developed composite Landsat imagery. The lichen volume estimator (LVE) was adapted for use across 700 000 km2 of barren ground caribou habitat annually from 1984–2012. We subsequently assessed how LVE changed temporally throughout the time series for each pixel using Theil-Sen’s slopes, and spatially by assessing whether slope values were centered in local clusters of similar values. Additionally, we assessed how LVE estimates resulted in changes in barren ground caribou movement rates using an extensive telemetry data set from 2006–2011. The Ahiak/Beverly herd had the largest overall increase in LVE (median = 0.033), while the more western herds had the least (median slopes below zero in all cases). LVE slope pixels were arranged in significant clusters across the study area, with the Cape Bathurst, Bathurst, and Bluenose East herds having the most significant clusters of negative slopes (more than 20% of vegetated land in each case). The Ahiak/Beverly and Bluenose West had the most significant positive clusters (16.3% and 18.5% of vegetated land respectively). Barren ground caribou displayed complex reactions to changing lichen conditions depending on season; the majority of detected associations with movement data agreed with current understanding of barren ground caribou foraging behavior (the exception was an increase in movement velocity at high lichen volume estimates in Fall). The temporal assessment of LVE identified areas where shifts in ecological conditions may have resulted in changing lichen mat conditions, while assessing the slope estimates for clustering identified zones beyond the pixel scale where forage conditions may be changing. Lichen volume estimates associated with barren ground caribou movement metrics in an expected manner and, as such, show value for future habitat assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2601584937,"Arachidonic acid is metabolized to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by cytochrome (CYP) P450 epoxygenases, and to ω-terminal hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) by ω-hydroxylases. EETs and HETEs often have opposite biologic effects; EETs are vasodilatory and protect against ischemia/reperfusion injury, while ω-terminal HETEs are vasoconstrictive and cause vascular dysfunction. Other oxylipins, such as epoxyoctadecaenoic acids (EpOMEs), hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), and prostanoids also have varied vascular effects. Post-ischemic vasodilation in the heart, known as coronary reactive hyperemia (CRH), protects against potential damage to the heart muscle caused by ischemia. The relationship among CRH response to ischemia, in mice with altered levels of CYP2J epoxygenases has not yet been investigated. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of endothelial overexpression of the human cytochrome P450 epoxygenase CYP2J2 in mice (Tie2-CYP2J2 Tr) on oxylipin profiles and CRH. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of pharmacologic inhibition of CYP-epoxygenases and inhibition of ω-hydroxylases on CRH. We hypothesized that CRH would be enhanced in isolated mouse hearts with vascular endothelial overexpression of human CYP2J2 through modulation of oxylipin profiles. Similarly, we expected that inhibition of CYP-epoxygenases would reduce CRH, whereas inhibition of ω-hydroxylases would enhance CRH. Compared to WT mice, Tie2-CYP2J2 Tr mice had enhanced CRH, including repayment volume, repayment duration, and repayment/debt ratio (P < 0.05). Similarly, inhibition of ω-hydroxylases increased repayment volume and repayment duration, in Tie2-CYP2J2 Tr compared to WT mice (P < 0.05). Endothelial overexpression of CYP2J2 significantly changed oxylipin profiles, including increased EETs (P < 0.05), increased EpOMEs (P < 0.05), and decreased 8-iso-PGF2α (P < 0.05). Inhibition of CYP epoxygenases with MS-PPOH attenuated CRH (P < 0.05). Ischemia caused a decrease in mid-chain HETEs (5-, 11-, 12-, 15-HETEs P < 0.05) and HODEs (P < 0.05). These data demonstrate that vascular endothelial overexpression of CYP2J2, through changing the oxylipin profiles, enhances CRH. Inhibition of CYP epoxygenases decreases CRH, whereas inhibition of ω-hydroxylases enhances CRH."
https://openalex.org/W2602460352,"AMPA and kainate receptors, along with NMDA receptors, represent different subtypes of glutamate ion channels. AMPA and kainate receptors share a high degree of sequence and structural similarities, and excessive activity of these receptors has been implicated in neurological diseases such as epilepsy. Therefore, blocking detrimental activity of both receptor types could be therapeutically beneficial. Here, we report the use of an in vitro evolution approach involving systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment with a single AMPA receptor target (i.e. GluA1/2R) to isolate RNA aptamers that can potentially inhibit both AMPA and kainate receptors. A full-length or 101-nucleotide (nt) aptamer selectively inhibited GluA1/2R with a KI of ∼5 μm, along with GluA1 and GluA2 AMPA receptor subunits. Of note, its shorter version (55 nt) inhibited both AMPA and kainate receptors. In particular, this shorter aptamer blocked equally potently the activity of both the GluK1 and GluK2 kainate receptors. Using homologous binding and whole-cell recording assays, we found that an RNA aptamer most likely binds to the receptor's regulatory site and inhibits it noncompetitively. Our results suggest the potential of using a single receptor target to develop RNA aptamers with dual activity for effectively blocking both AMPA and kainate receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2599001644,"Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein (HP-NAP) is involved in H. pylori-associated gastric inflammation. HP-NAP is also a vaccine candidate, a possible drug target, and a potential diagnostic marker for H. pylori-associated diseases. Previously, we purified recombinant HP-NAP by one-step diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) negative mode chromatography by collecting the unbound fraction at pH 8.0 at 4°C. It remains unclear why HP-NAP does not bind to DEAE resins at the pH above its isoelectric point during the purification. To investigate how pH affects the surface net charge of HP-NAP and its binding to DEAE resins during the purification, recombinant HP-NAP expressed in Escherichia coli was subjected to DEAE negative mode chromatography at pH ranging from 7.0 to 9.0 at 25°C and the surface charge of purified HP-NAP was determined by capillary electrophoresis. A minimal amount of HP-NAP was detected in the elution fraction of DEAE Sepharose resin at pH 8.5, whereas recombinant HP-NAP was detected in the elution fraction of DEAE Sephadex resin only at pH 7.0 and 8.0. The purified recombinant HP-NAP obtained from the unbound fractions was not able to bind to DEAE resins at pH 7.0 to 9.0. In addition, the surface charge of the purified HP-NAP was neutral at pH 7.0 to 8.0 and was either neutral or slightly negative at pH 8.5 and 9.0. However, recombinant HP-NAP purified from gel-filtration chromatography was able to bind to DEAE Sepharose resin at pH 7.0 to 9.0 and DEAE Sephadex resin at pH 7.0. At pH 8.5 and 9.0, only the negatively charged species of HP-NAP were found. Thus, recombinant HP-NAP with different charge status can be differentially purified by DEAE negative mode chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography. Furthermore, the charge distribution on the surface of HP-NAP, the presence of impure proteins, and the overall net charge of the resins all affect the binding of HP-NAP to DEAE resins during the negative purification."

However, whether the organizational/activational paradigm applies more broadly to the sexual behavior of other animals such as insects is not well established. Here we describe the hormonal regulation of a sexual behavior in the seasonally polyphenic butterfly Bicyclus anynana is consistent with the characteristics of an organizational effect. By measuring hormone titer levels, quantifying hormone receptor gene expression in the brain, and performing hormone manipulations, we demonstrate steroid hormone signaling early in pupal development has a latent effect on adult male sexual behavior in B. anynana. These findings suggest the organizational/activational paradigm may be more highly conserved across animal taxa than previously thought."

Recent studies have shown that 3’-untranslated regions (UTR) polymorphisms are associated with the occurrence and prognosis of cancers. The aim of this study is to analyze the association between KRAS and VEGF gene 3’-UTR SNPs and genetic susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC). In this case-control study of 371 CRC cases and 246 healthy controls, we analyzed the association between one SNP (rs1137188G > A) in the KRAS gene and four SNPs (rs3025039C > T, rs3025040C > T, rs3025053G > A and rs10434A > G) in the VEGF gene and CRC susceptibility by the improved multiplex ligase detection reaction (iMLDR) method. We checked the selected SNPs’ minor allele frequency and its distribution in the frequency of Chinese people by Hap-map database and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and used multivariate logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We found that the rs3025039C variant genotype in the VEGF gene was associated with a significant protection for CRC (AOR = 0.693, 95% CI = 0.485–0.989; P = 0.043 for CC and CT+TT). Nevertheless, the difference was no longer significant after Bonferroni correction (Bonferroni-adjusted P = 0.172). In genetic polymorphisms analysis, we found that the KRAS rs1137188 variant AA genotype had higher portion of tumor size (≥ 5 cm) (P = 0.01; Bonferroni-adjusted P = 0.04), which suggested that the rs1137188 variant AA genotype may significantly be associated with increased progression of CRC. In conclusion, our study suggested that these five SNPs in the KRAS gene and the VEGF gene were not associated with CRC susceptibility in Han Chinese in Sichuan province."

https://openalex.org/W2599737767,"Objective Physician shift schedules are regularly created manually, using paper or a shared online spreadsheet. Mistakes are not unusual, leading to last minute scrambles to cover a shift. We developed a web-based shift scheduling system and a mobile application tool to facilitate both the monthly scheduling and shift exchanges between physicians. The primary objective was to compare physician satisfaction before and after the mobile application implementation. Methods Over a 9-month period, three surveys, using the 4-point Likert type scale were performed to assess the physician satisfaction. The first survey was conducted three months prior mobile application release, a second survey three months after implementation and the last survey six months after. Results 51 (77%) of the physicians answered the baseline survey. Of those, 32 (63%) were males with a mean age of 37.8 ± 5.5 years. Prior to the mobile application implementation, 36 (70%) of the responders were using more than one method to carry out shift exchanges and only 20 (40%) were using the official department report sheet to document shift exchanges. The second and third survey were answered by 48 (73%) physicians. Forty-eight (98%) of them found the mobile application easy or very easy to install and 47 (96%) did not want to go back to the previous method. Regarding physician satisfaction, at baseline 37% of the physicians were unsatisfied or very unsatisfied with shift scheduling. After the mobile application was implementation, only 4% reported being unsatisfied (OR = 0.11, p < 0.001). The satisfaction level improved from 63% to 96% between the first and the last survey. Satisfaction levels significantly increased between the three time points (OR = 13.33, p < 0.001). Conclusion Our web and mobile phone-based scheduling system resulted in better physician satisfaction."

https://openalex.org/W2598407146,"The construction of data center network by applying SDN technology has become a hot research topic. The SDN architecture has innovatively separated the control plane from the data plane which makes the network more software-oriented and agile. Moreover, it provides virtual multi-tenancy, effective scheduling resources and centralized control strategies to meet the demand for cloud computing data center. However, the explosion of network information is facing severe challenges for SDN controller. The flow storage and lookup mechanisms based on TCAM device have led to the restriction of scalability, high cost and energy consumption. In view of this, a source-controlled data center network (SCDCN) model is proposed herein. The SCDCN model applies a new type of source routing address named the vector address (VA) as the packet-switching label. The VA completely defines the communication path and the data forwarding process can be finished solely relying on VA. There are four advantages in the SCDCN architecture. 1) The model adopts hierarchical multi-controllers and abstracts large-scale data center network into some small network domains that has solved the restriction for the processing ability of single controller and reduced the computational complexity. 2) Vector switches (VS) developed in the core network no longer apply TCAM for table storage and lookup that has significantly cut down the cost and complexity for switches. Meanwhile, the problem of scalability can be solved effectively. 3) The SCDCN model simplifies the establishment process for new flows and there is no need to download flow tables to VS. The amount of control signaling consumed when establishing new flows can be significantly decreased. 4) We design the VS on the NetFPGA platform. The statistical results show that the hardware resource consumption in a VS is about 27% of that in an OFS."

Although these residues have a suspected role in protein cross-linking and aggregation, their direct implication has yet to be determined. Here, we have taken advantage of the ability of the enteropathogen Shigella to convert the phosphothreonine residue of the pT-X-pY consensus sequence of ERK and p38 into Dhb and followed the impact of dehydration on the fate of the two MAPKs. To that end, we have generated the first antibodies recognizing Dhb-modified proteins and allowing tracing them as they form. We showed that Dhb modifications accumulate in a long-lasting manner in Shigella-infected cells, causing subsequent formation of covalent cross-links of MAPKs. Moreover, the Dhb signal correlates precisely with the activation of the Shigella type III secretion apparatus, thus evidencing injectisome activity. This observation is the first to document a causal link between Dhb formation and protein cross-linking in live cells.

Detection of eliminylation is a new avenue to phosphoproteome regulation in eukaryotes that will be instrumental for the development of type III secretion inhibitors. Upon aging, serines and threonines are occasionally subject to dehydration, resulting in their conversion into dehydroalanine (Dha) 3The abbreviations used are: DhadehydroalanineDhbdehydrobutyrinePTMpost-translational modificationPMAphorbol myristate acetateMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastT3SStype III secretion systemMOImultiplicity of infectionTSARtranscription-based secretion activity reporterFDRfalse discovery rateNSnon-stimulated. and dehydrobutyrine (Dhb), respectively.

Such post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been reported on long-lived proteins such as crystallin proteins of the ocular lens, and they are suspected to contribute to the development of age-related lens opacity (1Linetsky M.

However, whether Dhb/Dha formation promotes covalent cross-links in a cellular context and thereby nurtures protein aggregation and insolubility remains to be demonstrated. The scarcity of the data is mainly due to the poor reliability of the detection of dehydrated and cross-linked residues, which principally relies on the analysis of acid hydrolyzed samples exposed to high temperature (1Linetsky M.

Age-related de-phosphorylation of proteins in dentin: a biological tool for assessment of protein age.Biogerontology. 2000; 1: 341-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such extensive heating can artifactually increase formation of Dha from phosphoserine residues, and nucleophilic addition can be catalyzed by acid, raising a concern of artifactual cross-link induced by acid hydrolysis (5Goswami S.

Soc. 1963; : 289-296Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, a clear demonstration of the in vivo implication of Dha/Dhb in protein cross-link is still missing. The potential instability and the slow emergence of these PTMs have been major obstacles for their detection and the characterization of their impact on protein fate. Interestingly, some bacteria such as Shigella flexneri catalyze the formation of Dhb (7Li H. Li H. Xu H. Xu H. Zhou Y. Zhou Y. Zhang J. Zhang J. Long C. Long C. Li S. Li S. Chen S. Chen S. Zhou J.-M. Zhou J.-M. Shao F. Shao F. The phosphothreonine lyase activity of a bacterial type III effector family.Science. 2007; 315: 1000-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). They use this strategy to irreversibly inhibit the MAP kinase and thereby repress inflammatory gene expression and host immune defense (8Arbibe L. Kim D.W. Batsche E. Pedron T. Mateescu B.

Immunol. 2007; 8: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The inactivation of the host MAPK occurs through β-elimination of the phosphate group at the threonine residue within the dually phosphorylated pT-X-pY motif. This reaction leads to the loss of phosphoric acid and H2O and converts the phosphothreonine residue required for MAPK activity into Dhb (see Fig. 1A). The newly formed amino acid lacks the OH group and is no longer phosphorylatable. This reaction, known as eliminylation, causes an irreversible inactivation of the MAPK. The phosphothreonine lyase activity catalyzing eliminylation has been described for a family of bacterial effectors including OspF from Shigella, SpvC from Salmonella, and HopAI1 from Pseudomonas syringae (7Li H. Li H. Xu H. Xu H. Zhou Y. Zhou Y. Zhang J. Zhang J. Long C. Long C. Li S. Li S. Chen S. Chen S. Zhou J.-M. Zhou J.-M. Shao F. Shao F.

The effect of these enzymes on MAPK offers a distinctive opportunity to study the impact of Dhb formation on the fate of a protein. Here, we are using infection by the enteropathogen S. flexneri to monitor Dhb formation in living cells. To trace MAPKs eliminylation in the infected cells, we have engineered the first anti-Dhb antibodies. We demonstrate that eliminylated ERK and p38 form very rapidly after infection and then accumulate. This accumulation can be strictly correlated with the appearance of cross-linked ERK, indicating that the presence of Dhb has a rapid and drastic effect on protein integrity. Our approach also provided valuable information on Shigella, showing that injection of the effector OspF neutralizes the MAPK pathway both by preventing its rephosphorylation and by inducing covalent modifications. In addition, formation of Dhb-modified MAPKs tightly correlated with the activation of the type III secretion apparatus, providing a system to assess Shigella injectisome activity in host cells. To date, detection of eliminylated residues has exclusively relied on mass spectrometry, a resource-demanding and time-consuming technique for which reproducibility and robustness are dependent on the abundance of the PTM. To facilitate the detection of eliminylated residues and also to allow detection in living cells of these inherently instable PTMs, we engineered anti-ERK and anti-p38 Dhb antibodies. The antigens were generated using two synthetic peptides encompassing the conserved Thr(P)-Xaa-Tyr(P) sequence of ERK and p38, respectively, phosphorylated at the threonine residue; within these peptides, the phosphothreonine residues were chemically converted into Dhb. Mass spectrometry confirmed a mass difference of 98 Da between the original phosphopeptide and the derived Dhb-containing peptide (Figs. 1, B and C). Immunization of rabbits with these Dhb-containing peptides generated anti-p38-Dhb and anti-ERK-Dhb polyclonal antibodies. Specificity of the anti-ERK-Dhb antibody toward the Dhb residue was first confirmed in vitro using a phosphorylated ERK2 protein treated with the Shigella phosphothreonine lyase OspF, or as control, with the λ phosphatase. As show in Fig. 1D, anti-ERK-Dhb antibody detected the product of the phosphotheonine lyase reaction, but not that of the phosphatase activity, which dephosphorylated the Thr(P)-Xaa-Tyr(P) sequence of ERK2 (Table 1). The detection was also abolished when WT OspF was substituted by a catalytically inactive OspF carrying a histidine 104 to leucine mutation (OspF H104L; Fig. 1E). Finally, we observed no cross-reaction of the anti-ERK-Dhb antibody with the p38 Dhb signal generated as above by incubating phosphorylated p38 with OspF (Fig. 1F, lane 5). Specificity of the anti-p38Dhb antibody was verified by a similar approach, confirming a strict dependence on OspF catalytic activity (Fig. 1F, lane 5) and with no cross-reactivity with ERK-Dhb (Fig. 1F, lane 2). We concluded from our in vitro analysis that the anti-ERK-Dhb and anti-p38-Dhb antibodies were suitable for detection of MAPK kinase products modified by a phosphothreonine lyase activity.Table 1Detection of modified and unmodified TEY-containing peptide Open table in a new tab To induce the formation of Dhb-modified MAPKs, we infected HeLa cells with the wild-type bacterium S. flexneri serotype 5a (WT); the ospF deficient strain (ΔospF) was used as an internal control. To facilitate detection of the modified proteins, the HeLa cells were expressing a Flag-tagged version of ERK2. We firstly used mass spectrometry to characterize the spectrum of Dhb-modified residues on MAPK in both basal conditions (non-infected) and upon Shigella infection. With the WT strain, the MS/MS spectrum of ERK2 peptide containing the 185TEY187 sequence showed an 18-Da mass decrease compared with an unmodified threonine residue. This mass shift was compatible with a β-elimination reaction of a phosphothreonine converted to Dhb (Fig. 2A). As expected, Dhb at position 185 (ERK2Dhb185) occurred in a strict OspF-dependent manner in the infected cells (Fig. 2B and Table 2). In basal conditions, we also detected a Dhb modification on residue ERK2T181 not modulated by Shigella infection, but the signal intensity of the peptide carrying this modification was low compared with that of ERK2Dhb185 upon Shigella infection (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table 2).Table 2Detection of modified and unmodified TEY-containing peptide Open table in a new tab We next used the anti-Dhb antibodies to trace MAP kinase Dhb modifications in live cells upon Shigella infection. ERK-Dhb signal appeared early (30 min) after WT Shigella infection of Hela cells expressing Flag-tagged ERK2, and the signal was not observed when infecting with the ΔospF strain (Fig. 2C; see also supplemental Fig. S8 for the visualization of the full blot). We also examined modification of endogenous ERK1/2 proteins in HeLa cells infected with WT or ΔospF strains or stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) as a positive control for MAPK activation. In these experiments and consistent with our earlier studies, only the ΔospF strain allowed for ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2D, lanes 7–10; see also supplemental Fig. S8 for the visualization of the full blot). Using the anti-ERK-Dhb antibody, we found again that the WT but not the ΔospF strain induced the formation of a 42-kDa species as early as 15 min post-infection (Fig. 2D, lanes 4–6). Similar results were obtained in other cell types, including the mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and the enterocytic TC7 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Finally, transcomplementation of the ΔospF mutant with a plasmid encoding OspF (ΔospF pOspF) restored Dhb signal, whereas complementation with catalytically inactive OspF (ΔospF pH104L) did not. This further documented the requirement for OspF catalytic activity to acquire Dhb signal (supplemental Fig. S3, compare lanes 5 and 6). To ascertain that the 42-kDa Dhb product was ERK2, we performed immunoprecipitation studies. Endogenous ERK or Flag-tagged ERK2 immunoprecipitates were probed with the Dhb-ERK antibody, thereby allowing the detection of a 42-kDa signal accumulating upon infection with the WT but not the ospF-deficient strain (Fig. 2E, lanes 9–11, and supplemental Fig. S4). We could achieve similar results by immunoprecipitating p38 MAPK using the Dhb p38 antibody (supplemental Fig. S5). We next investigate the ability of the Dhb-ERK antibody to immunoprecipitate the modified kinases upon infection. We firstly characterized the quality of the Dhb immunoprecipitate by mass spectrometry. The results confirmed that both ERK1 and ERK2 were specifically detected in the immunoprecipitates and only upon OspF bacterial injection (Fig. 2F, left and right panels). Remarkably, all the ERK peptides carrying the TEY sequences were Dhb-modified at Thr185 for ERK2 and Thr202 for ERK1, indicating that the antibody immunoprecipitated exclusively the modified ERK-Dhb MAPKs isoforms (Table 3; see also supplemental Table S1 for a complete set of data). Only few additional proteins were immunoprecipitated by the antibody in an OspF-independent manner and without any detectable Dhb residue (Table 4; see also supplemental Table S2 for a complete set of data). Finally, immunoblot analysis confirmed that both endogenous ERK1 and ERK2 were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Erk-Dhb antibody, showing that each of the two ERK isoforms are subject to Dhb modifications in a strict OspF-dependent manner (Fig. 2G).Table 3Detailed list of MAPK1 and MAPK3 peptides identified in the anti-Dhb-ERK immunoprecipitates Open table in a new tab Table 4Detailed list of proteins immunoprecipited by the anti-ERK-Dhb antibody Open table in a new tab Dhb intermediates are predicted to be unstable and subject to nucleophilic attack, which might promote cross-links. Therefore, we searched for the formation of ERK cross-links induced by the catalytic activity of OspF. As described above, ERK-Dhb accumulated early; later time points revealed that the species persisted at least 24 h post-infection and was detectable both in the nuclear and cytosolic extracts with the anti-ERKDhb185 antibody (Figs. 2E, lanes 9–11, and 3a and supplemental Fig. S6). Concomitantly with the formation of Dhb, a species of ˜170 kDa immunoreactive to the ERK antibody accumulated in a strict OspF-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Like ERKDhb185, this 170-kDa species was detected in both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear compartments (Fig. 3C). Harsh denaturing conditions such as boiling in 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 8 m urea, or diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid did not result in any decrease in the intensity of the slow-migrating species, suggesting that a highly stable molecular complex containing ERK forms in the presence of OspF (supplemental Fig. S7). We next sought to determine the molecular identity of the 170-kDa complex. ERK2 immunoprecipitates were separated in a SDS gel, and the 170-kDa band was excised and submitted to mass spectrometry analysis. The results confirmed the presence of ERK peptides in the complex upon infection with the WT strain, whereas no peptide from other proteins species was significantly detected (Table 5). Overall, our data are the first demonstration that emergence of Dhb residues rapidly results in covalent protein cross-linking in live cells.Table 5Detailed list of proteins detected at the 170-kDa Erk complex Open table in a new tab The phosphothreonine lyase OspF is injected upon activation of the Shigella type III secretion system (T3SS) (8Arbibe L. Kim D.W. Batsche E. Pedron T. Mateescu B. Muchardt C. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.J. An injected bacterial effector targets chromatin access for transcription factor NF-kappaB to alter transcription of host genes involved in immune responses.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Thus, OspF injection and consequently Dhb formation should be an indicator of T3SS activity. At bacterial entry, T3SS activation is triggered by its contact with the host cell membrane, leading to effector protein injection into host cytosol allowing bacterial internalization into a phagocytic vacuole (Fig. 4A). Following vacuole rupture, bacteria gain access to the host cytoplasm, and the T3SS activity is down. Reactivation of the T3SS is strictly dependent on actin-based motility and formation of plasma membrane protrusions during cell-to-cell spread (11Campbell-Valois F.-X. Schnupf P. Nigro G. Sachse M. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. A fluorescent reporter reveals on/off regulation of the Shigella type III secretion apparatus during entry and cell-to-cell spread.Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 15: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether accumulation of Erk-Dhb could be used as a marker of T3SS activity at both invasion and spreading steps. As shown in Fig. 4B, a Dhb signal was observed at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) as low as 10, and signal intensity correlated with the MOI, indicating that Dhb accumulation correlated with the size of the bacterial inoculum and thus with the initial T3SS activity. To determine whether Dhb formation also accounted for T3SS reactivation within the intracellular epithelial niche, we used HeLa cells stably expressing Connexin 26 (HeLa Cx26), a component of the gap junctions necessary for intercellular bacterial spreading. We firstly investigated the pattern of T3SS activity upon infection of HeLa Cx26 using a previously characterized transcription-based secretion activity reporter (TSAR) (11Campbell-Valois F.-X. Schnupf P. Nigro G. Sachse M. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. A fluorescent reporter reveals on/off regulation of the Shigella type III secretion apparatus during entry and cell-to-cell spread.Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 15: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This reporter expresses a fast-maturing GFP under the control of the promoter of one of the effectors injected by T3SS. Bacteria harboring this reporter fluoresce green when the T3SS is active. HeLa Cx26 cells were infected with WT, ΔospF, and ΔicsA strains. The latter remains invasive but is unable to spread because it does not produce the protein IcsA, an activator of the actin polymerization machinery that drives the bacterium within the host cytosol. As expected, intracellular bacteria with high TSAR activity were detected with both WT and ΔospF Shigella (green bacteria), whereas TSAR signal remained undetectable with the non-motile ΔicsA mutant, in agreement with its inability to spread (Fig. 4C). A Western blot with the anti-ERK-Dhb antibody allowed recapitulating the outcome of the TSAR assay. Indeed, a strong enrichment of the Dhb signal in the WT but not the ΔicsA mutant was detected in an OspF-dependent manner (Fig. 4D, compare lanes 2 and 3). Thus, the formation of an ERK-Dhb signal tightly correlated with the T3SS activity at both invasion and cell-to cell spreading steps. Our work provided the first evidence for the traceability of Dhb-modified kinases in living cells. Dhb modifications irreversibly affect the phospho-state of the molecule, and so far, the implication of this PTM in the regulation of the cellular phosphoproteome remains scarcely investigated. Eliminylated residues from phosphothreonine or phosphoserine (the latter leading to Dha) were predicted to be unstable and therefore unlikely to be immunogenic. Our work brings the proof of concept that this type of antibodies can be engineered to trace this modification in live cells. Our antibody-based approach will allow exploring tracks completely out of reach for mass spectrometry and opens the way to the making of an entirely new toolbox for the study of irreversible protein modifications, in the context of bacterial infections and also in the context of aging. Eliminylation is catalyzed by the virulence effector OspF that belongs to a small family of bacterial effectors with phospholyase activity (7Li H. Li H. Xu H. Xu H. Zhou Y. Zhou Y. Zhang J. Zhang J. Long C. Long C. Li S. Li S. Chen S. Chen S. Zhou J.-M. Zhou J.-M. Shao F. Shao F. The phosphothreonine lyase activity of a bacterial type III effector family.Science. 2007; 315: 1000-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In contrast, the molecular mechanisms causing eliminylation in the context of aging remain elusive. Dha and Dhb can be detected already at an early age in crystallin, a transparent structural protein of the lens. However, high levels of covalent cross-linking, aggregation, and insolubility of crystallin is seen only with age (2Srivastava K. Chaves J.M. Srivastava O.P. Kirk M. Multi-crystallin complexes exist in the water-soluble high molecular weight protein fractions of aging normal and cataractous human lenses.Exp. Eye Res. 2008; 87: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Wang Z. Lyons B. Truscott R.J. Schey K.L. Human protein aging: modification and crosslinking through dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine intermediates.Aging Cell. 2014; 13: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Proteins of tooth dentin also contain harboring Dha and Dhb residues (4Cloos P.A. Jensen A.L. Age-related de-phosphorylation of proteins in dentin: a biological tool for assessment of protein age.Biogerontology. 2000; 1: 341-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two proteins belong to the longest-lived protein in the body, which might facilitate the detection of age-related post-translational modifications. However, our report demonstrates that the phenomenon can be extended to the ERK MAPK that exhibits a protein half-life of about 24 h (13Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. Mitogen-activated protein kinases p42mapk and p44mapk are required for fibroblast proliferation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Importantly, OspF phospholyase activity specifically induced the accumulation of ERK-Dhb and ERK protein cross-links at both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, thereby establishing a causal relationship between Dhb formation and covalent modifications. Interestingly, also in basal conditions, we could detect a Dhb modification on residue ERK2T181, a phosphosite with unknown function. This observation suggests that, as in human lens, eliminylated residues form naturally in ERK and that physiological mechanism(s) preventing cross-links may exist to avoid protein aggregation. The current model established from the in vivo data obtained in human lens points out a protective function of the antioxidant system through the nucleophilic attack of the Dhb/Dha residues by glutathione, resulting in the formation of thiol metabolite adducts that may prevent protein cross-linking and aggregation (12Wang Z. Lyons B. Truscott R.J. Schey K.L. Human protein aging: modification and crosslinking through dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine intermediates.Aging Cell. 2014; 13: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Whether chronic inflammation and/or fall in anti-oxidant defense, as seen in aging, promotes these modifications in various tissues and especially in long-lived cells such as neurons remains to be investigated. Finally, we have showed that the anti-ERK-Dhb antibody can be used as a tool to assess Shigella injectisome activity. Monitoring T3SS activity has proved to be technically challenging because tracer dyes such as biarsenic in FlAsH or CCF4 in FRET are often toxic to eukaryotic cells (14Enninga J. Mounier J.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5486-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Anti-Dhb antibodies provide a simple tool to track activation of the injectisome without the need of artificial reporter systems. This will be useful to detect infected host cells in the absence of bacterial invasion, as shown for T lymphocytes (16Konradt C. Frigimelica E. Nothelfer K. Puhar A. Salgado-Pabon W. di Bartolo V. Scott-Algara D. Rodrigues C.D. Sansonetti P.J. Phalipon A.

T3SS has emerged as an attractive target for antimicrobial therapeutics by reducing selection pressures on pathogens to develop drug-resistant mutations, and our antibody-based approach can potentially provide a screening system for the identification of small molecules inhibiting the type III secretion activity. In conclusion, we document for the first time that Dhb modifications result in non-disulfide covalent protein cross-links in living cells. Thus, our work showed evidence that eliminylated residues, once formed, can rapidly change protein fate. Finally, we believe that the mere possibility of producing Dhb antibodies opens the way for thorough characterization of eliminylated residues in physiopathological situations, such as diseases involving protein aggregation.

Phosphate eliminylation was followed by LC-MS. After 1.5 h at 37 °C, the Thr(P) peptides were entirely converted to β-methyldehydroalanine peptides (Dhb). After treatment with pure acetic acid (1 ml), the compounds were isolated by C18 reverse-phase HPLC using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.08% (v/v) aqueous TFA (1%/min). Synthesis yields were 48% (Dhb-ERK) and 43% (Dhb-p38). A polyclonal antibody was generated by immunization of rabbits with this purified peptide (Eurogentec). The anti-ERK-Dhb antibody was affinity purified on Dhb-ERK peptide, as previously described (18LeGouy E. Thompson E.M. Muchardt C. Renard J.P.

HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection, CCL-2), HeLa cells stably expressing Connexin 26, MEF cells, and TC7/Caco-2 cells (derived from a human colon carcinoma) were used in this study.

Use of theory is recommended but is often absent in programmes conducted in 'real-world' rather than research settings.This mixed-methods study tested a retrospective theory-based approach to evaluate a 'real-world' programme in primary care to improve adherence to national guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Qualitative data, comprising analysis of documents generated throughout the programme (n>300), in-depth interviews with planners (clinicians, managers and improvement experts involved in devising, planning, and implementing the programme, n = 14) and providers (practice clinicians, n = 14) were used to construct programme theories, experiences of implementation and contextual factors influencing care. Quantitative analyses comprised controlled before-and-after analyses to test 'early' and evolved' programme theories with comparators grounded in each theory. 'Early' theory predicted the programme would reduce emergency hospital admissions (EHA). It was tested using national analysis of standardized borough-level EHA rates between programme and comparator boroughs. 'Evolved' theory predicted practices with higher programme participation would increase guideline adherence and reduce EHA and costs. It was tested using a difference-in-differences analysis with linked primary and secondary care data to compare changes in diagnosis, management, EHA and costs, over time and by programme participation.Contrary to programme planners' predictions in 'early' and 'evolved' programme theories, admissions did not change following the programme. However, consistent with 'evolved' theory, higher guideline adoption occurred in practices with greater programme participation.Retrospectively constructing theories based on the ideas of programme planners can enable evaluators to address some limitations encountered when evaluating programmes without a theoretical base. Prospectively articulating theory aided by existing models and mid-range implementation theories may strengthen guideline adoption efforts by prompting planners to scrutinise implementation methods. Benefits of deriving programme theory, with or without the aid of mid-range implementation theories, however, may be limited when the evidence underpinning guidelines is flawed."

Universities use it in their mission statements and funding agencies name programmes after it. The word has of course made its way into a numbing array of institution titles, such as Germany's Clusters of Excellence and the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centres of Excellence..."
