https://openalex.org/W2589417329,"Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that redirect and reprogram T cells to mediate tumour rejection. The most successful CARs used to date are those targeting CD19 (ref. 2), which offer the prospect of complete remission in patients with chemorefractory or relapsed B-cell malignancies. CARs are typically transduced into the T cells of a patient using γ-retroviral vectors or other randomly integrating vectors, which may result in clonal expansion, oncogenic transformation, variegated transgene expression and transcriptional silencing. Recent advances in genome editing enable efficient sequence-specific interventions in human cells, including targeted gene delivery to the CCR5 and AAVS1 loci. Here we show that directing a CD19-specific CAR to the T-cell receptor α constant (TRAC) locus not only results in uniform CAR expression in human peripheral blood T cells, but also enhances T-cell potency, with edited cells vastly outperforming conventionally generated CAR T cells in a mouse model of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We further demonstrate that targeting the CAR to the TRAC locus averts tonic CAR signalling and establishes effective internalization and re-expression of the CAR following single or repeated exposure to antigen, delaying effector T-cell differentiation and exhaustion. These findings uncover facets of CAR immunobiology and underscore the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to advance immunotherapies."

https://openalex.org/W2590164153,"The prefrontal cortex is a critical neuroanatomical hub for controlling motivated behaviours across mammalian species1,2,3. In addition to intra-cortical connectivity, prefrontal projection neurons innervate subcortical structures that contribute to reward-seeking behaviours, such as the ventral striatum and midline thalamus4. While connectivity among these structures contributes to appetitive behaviours5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13, how projection-specific prefrontal neurons encode reward-relevant information to guide reward seeking is unknown. Here we use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of dorsomedial prefrontal neurons in mice during an appetitive Pavlovian conditioning task. At the population level, these neurons display diverse activity patterns during the presentation of reward-predictive cues. However, recordings from prefrontal neurons with resolved projection targets reveal that individual corticostriatal neurons show response tuning to reward-predictive cues, such that excitatory cue responses are amplified across learning. By contrast, corticothalamic neurons gradually develop new, primarily inhibitory responses to reward-predictive cues across learning. Furthermore, bidirectional optogenetic manipulation of these neurons reveals that stimulation of corticostriatal neurons promotes conditioned reward-seeking behaviour after learning, while activity in corticothalamic neurons suppresses both the acquisition and expression of conditioned reward seeking. These data show how prefrontal circuitry can dynamically control reward-seeking behaviour through the opposing activities of projection-specific cell populations. Neurons that project from the prefrontal cortex to either the nucleus accumbens or paraventricular thalamus receive different inputs, differentially encode reward-predictive cues, and have opposing effects on reward seeking during cue presentation. Projections from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens and paraventricular thalamus contribute to reward-seeking behaviours, but the type of reward-relevant information that these prefrontal-cortex neurons encode is unknown. Garret Stuber and colleagues show that these two populations of projection neuron receive different inputs, differentially encode reward-predictive cues, and have opposing effects on reward seeking when cues are presented. These findings show how the prefrontal cortex can dynamically control reward-seeking behaviour through the opposing activities of anatomically segregated, projection-specific cell populations."

https://openalex.org/W2589803953,"Gold mining is a major source of metal and metalloid emissions into the environment. Studies were carried out in Krugersdorp, South Africa, to evaluate the ecological and human health risks associated with exposure to metals and metalloids in mine tailings contaminated soils. Concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) in soil samples from the area varied with the highest contamination factors (expressed as ratio of metal or metalloid concentration in the tailings contaminated soil to that of the control site) observed for As (3.5x102), Co (2.8x102) and Ni (1.1x102). Potential ecological risk index values for metals and metalloids determined from soil metal and metalloid concentrations and their respective risk factors were correspondingly highest for As (3.5x103) and Co (1.4x103), whereas Mn (0.6) presented the lowest ecological risk. Human health risk was assessed using Hazard Quotient (HQ), Chronic Hazard Index (CHI) and carcinogenic risk levels, where values of HQ > 1, CHI > 1 and carcinogenic risk values > 1×10-4 represent elevated risks. Values for HQ indicated high exposure-related risk for As (53.7), Cr (14.8), Ni (2.2), Zn (2.64) and Mn (1.67). Children were more at risk from heavy metal and metalloid exposure than adults. Cancer-related risks associated with metal and metalloid exposure among children were also higher than in adults with cancer risk values of 3×10-2 and 4×10-2 for As and Ni respectively among children, and 5×10-3 and 4×10-3 for As and Ni respectively among adults. There is significant potential ecological and human health risk associated with metal and metalloid exposure from contaminated soils around gold mine tailings dumps. This could be a potential contributing factor to a setback in the health of residents in informal settlements dominating this mining area as the immune systems of some of these residents are already compromised by high HIV prevalence."

https://openalex.org/W2589779285,"Methane biogenesis in methanogens is mediated by methyl-coenzyme M reductase, an enzyme that is also responsible for the utilization of methane through anaerobic methane oxidation. The enzyme uses an ancillary factor called coenzyme F430, a nickel-containing modified tetrapyrrole that promotes catalysis through a methyl radical/Ni(ii)-thiolate intermediate. However, it is unclear how coenzyme F430 is synthesized from the common primogenitor uroporphyrinogen iii, incorporating 11 steric centres into the macrocycle, although the pathway must involve chelation, amidation, macrocyclic ring reduction, lactamization and carbocyclic ring formation. Here we identify the proteins that catalyse the biosynthesis of coenzyme F430 from sirohydrochlorin, termed CfbA-CfbE, and demonstrate their activity. The research completes our understanding of how the repertoire of tetrapyrrole-based pigments are constructed, permitting the development of recombinant systems to use these metalloprosthetic groups more widely."

Phosphatidic acid (PA) interacts with the FK506-binding protein–12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain of mTOR, which stabilizes both mTOR complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. We report here that mTORC1 and mTORC2 are activated in response to exogenously supplied fatty acids via the de novo synthesis of PA, a central metabolite for membrane phospholipid biosynthesis. We examined the impact of exogenously supplied fatty acids on mTOR in KRas-driven cancer cells, which are programmed to utilize exogenous lipids. The induction of mTOR by oleic acid was dependent upon the enzymes responsible for de novo synthesis of PA. Suppression of the de novo synthesis of PA resulted in G1 cell cycle arrest. Although it has long been appreciated that mTOR is a sensor of amino acids and glucose, this study reveals that mTOR also senses the presence of lipids via production of PA. mTOR, the mammalian target of rapamycin, integrates growth factor and nutrient signals to promote a transformation from catabolic to anabolic metabolism, cell growth, and cell cycle progression.

https://openalex.org/W2590648968,"Organelles display characteristic morphologies that are intimately tied to their cellular function, but how organelles are shaped is poorly understood. The endoplasmic reticulum is particularly intriguing, as it comprises morphologically distinct domains, including a dynamic network of interconnected membrane tubules. Several membrane proteins have been implicated in network formation, but how exactly they mediate network formation and whether they are all required are unclear. Here we reconstitute a dynamic tubular membrane network with purified endoplasmic reticulum proteins. Proteoliposomes containing the membrane-fusing GTPase Sey1p (refs 6, 7) and the curvature-stabilizing protein Yop1p (refs 8, 9) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae form a tubular network upon addition of GTP. The tubules rapidly fragment when GTP hydrolysis of Sey1p is inhibited, indicating that network maintenance requires continuous membrane fusion and that Yop1p favours the generation of highly curved membrane structures. Sey1p also forms networks with other curvature-stabilizing proteins, including reticulon and receptor expression-enhancing proteins (REEPs) from different species. Atlastin, the vertebrate orthologue of Sey1p, forms a GTP-hydrolysis-dependent network on its own, serving as both a fusion and curvature-stabilizing protein. Our results show that organelle shape can be generated by a surprisingly small set of proteins and represents an energy-dependent steady state between formation and disassembly."
https://openalex.org/W2590747152,"Background Type 2 diabetes is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Modifiable risk factors have been found to contribute up to 60% of type 2 diabetes risk. However, type 2 diabetes continues to rise despite implementation of interventions based on traditional risk factors. There is a clear need to identify additional risk factors for chronic disease prevention. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived stress and type 2 diabetes onset, and partition the estimates into direct and indirect effects. Methods and findings Women born in 1946–1951 (n = 12,844) completed surveys for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health in 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2010. The total causal effect was estimated using logistic regression and marginal structural modelling. Controlled direct effects were estimated through conditioning in the regression model. A graded association was found between perceived stress and all mediators in the multivariate time lag analyses. A significant association was found between hypertension, as well as physical activity and body mass index, and diabetes, but not smoking or diet quality. Moderate/high stress levels were associated with a 2.3-fold increase in the odds of diabetes three years later, for the total estimated effect. Results were only slightly attenuated when the direct and indirect effects of perceived stress on diabetes were partitioned, with the mediators only explaining 10–20% of the excess variation in diabetes. Conclusions Perceived stress is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The majority of the effect estimate of stress on diabetes risk is not mediated by the traditional risk factors of hypertension, physical activity, smoking, diet quality, and body mass index. This gives a new pathway for diabetes prevention trials and clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2589302826,"Forest ecosystem management heads towards the use of partial cuttings. However, the wide variation in growth response of residual trees remains unexplained, preventing a suitable prediction of forest productivity. The aim of the study was to assess individual growth and identify the driving factors involved in the responses of residual trees. Six study blocks in even-aged black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] stands of the eastern Canadian boreal forest were submitted to experimental shelterwood and seed-tree treatments. Individual-tree models were applied to 1039 trees to analyze their patterns of radial growth during the 10 years after partial cutting by using the nonlinear Schnute function on tree-ring series. The trees exhibited different growth patterns. A sigmoid growth was detected in 32% of trees, mainly in control plots of older stands. Forty-seven percent of trees located in the interior of residual strips showed an S-shape, which was influenced by stand mortality, harvested intensity and dominant height. Individuals showing an exponential pattern produced the greatest radial growth after cutting and were edge trees of younger stands with higher dominant height. A steady growth decline was observed in 4% of trees, represented by the individuals suppressed and insensitive to the treatment. The analyses demonstrated that individual nonlinear models are able to assess the variability in growth within the stand and the factors involved in the occurrence of the different growth patterns, thus improving understanding of the tree responses to partial cutting. This new approach can sustain forest management strategies by defining the best conditions to optimize the growth yield of residual trees."
https://openalex.org/W2591002979,"In tissue engineering, an ideal scaffold attracts and supports cells thus providing them with the necessary mechanical support and architecture as they reconstruct new tissue in vitro and in vivo. This manuscript details a novel matrix derived from decellularized Wharton’s jelly (WJ) obtained from human umbilical cord for use as a scaffold for tissue engineering application. This decellularized Wharton’s jelly matrix (DWJM) contained 0.66 ± 0.12 μg/mg sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and was abundant in hyaluronic acid, and completely devoid of cells. Mass spectroscopy revealed the presence of collagen types II, VI and XII, fibronectin-I, and lumican I. When seeded onto DWJM, WJ mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSCs), successfully attached to, and penetrated the porous matrix resulting in a slower rate of cell proliferation. Gene expression analysis of WJ and bone marrow (BM) MSCs cultured on DWJM demonstrated decreased expression of proliferation genes with no clear pattern of differentiation. When this matrix was implanted into a murine calvarial defect model with, green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled osteocytes, the osteocytes were observed to migrate into the matrix as early as 24 hours. They were also identified in the matrix up to 14 days after transplantation. Together with these findings, we conclude that DWJM can be used as a 3D porous, bioactive and biocompatible scaffold for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications."
https://openalex.org/W2589477078,"Several recent studies have reported on the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK3) in plant immune responses. However, little is known about how MAPK3 functions in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) infected with tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV). There is also uncertainty about the connection between plant MAPK3 and the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) defense-signaling pathways. The results of this study indicated that SlMAPK3 participates in the antiviral response against TYLCV. Tomato seedlings were inoculated with TYLCV to investigate the possible roles of SlMAPK1, SlMAPK2, and SlMAPK3 against this virus. Inoculation with TYLCV strongly induced the expression and the activity of all three genes. Silencing of SlMAPK1, SlMAPK2, and SlMAPK3 reduced tolerance to TYLCV, increased leaf H2O2 concentrations, and attenuated expression of defense-related genes after TYLCV infection, especially in SlMAPK3-silenced plants. Exogenous SA and methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) both significantly induced SlMAPK3 expression in tomato leaves. Over-expression of SlMAPK3 increased the transcript levels of SA/JA-mediated defense-related genes (PR1, PR1b/SlLapA, SlPI-I, and SlPI-II) and enhanced tolerance to TYLCV. After TYLCV inoculation, the leaves of SlMAPK3 over-expressed plants compared with wild type plants showed less H2O2 accumulation and greater superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity. Overall, the results suggested that SlMAPK3 participates in the antiviral response of tomato to TYLCV, and that this process may be through either the SA or JA defense-signaling pathways."

In this study, samples of sediment, invertebrate and algae were collected from the Providencia and Santa Catalina coral reef (Colombian Caribbean Sea) with the aim of isolating Actinobateria-like strain able to produce antimicrobial and quorum quenching compounds against pathogens. Several approaches were used to select actinobacterial isolates, obtaining 203 strains from all samples. According to their 16S rRNA gene sequencing, a total of 24 strains was classified within Actinobacteria represented by three genera: Streptomyces, Micromonospora, and Gordonia. In order to assess their metabolic profiles, the actinobacterial strains were grown in liquid cultures, and LC-MS-based analyses from ethyl acetate fractions were performed. Based on taxonomical classification, screening information of activity against phytopathogenic strains and quorum quenching activity, as well as metabolic profiling, six out of the 24 isolates were selected for follow-up with chemical isolation and structure identification analyses of putative metabolites involved in antimicrobial activities."
https://openalex.org/W2590092651,"Our earlier work showed that Musashi (MSI)-2 promoted the development of pancreatic cancer (PC) by down-regulating Numb, which prevented murine double-minute (MDM)-2–mediated p53 ubiquitin degradation. Thus, we investigate the relationship among MSI2, Numb, MDM2, and p53 in PC in vitro and in vivo, an association that has not been reported to our knowledge. MSI2 had no relationship with mutant p53 (mtp53) and wild-type p53 (wtp53) in normal PC cells. However, in response to gemcitabine or cisplatin treatment, MSI2 silencing simultaneously down-regulated MDM2 and up-regulated Numb and wtp53 protein levels. Moreover, these 4 endogenous proteins can be coimmunoprecipitated as a quaternary complex. Numb small interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the MSI2 silencing–induced p53 increase. During treatment with chemical agents, MSI2 silencing decreased drug resistance and cell motility in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo, all of which were significantly reversed by p53 siRNA. MSI2 was also negatively associated with Numb and positively associated with MDM2 expression in tissue. Overexpression of MSI2, MDM2, and mtp53 and weak expression of Numb were closely associated with aggressive clinicopathologic characteristics and poor prognosis for patients with PC.

https://openalex.org/W2589255044,"Background After 15 years of absence, in 2013 bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by Mycobacterium (M.) bovis and M. caprae, reemerged in the Swiss dairy cattle population. In order to identify the sources of infection as well as the spread of the agents, molecular-epidemiologic tracing by MIRU-VNTR analysis in combination with spoligotyping was performed. A total of 17 M. bovis and 7 M. caprae isolates were cultured from tuberculous bovine lymph nodes and analyzed with a set of 49 genetic markers by using automated capillary electrophoresis. Results The outbreak in the western part of Switzerland was caused by M. bovis spoligotype SB0120. With the exception of four single-locus variations observed in MIRU 20, the MIRU-VNTR profiles of the 17 M. bovis isolates were identical, indicating a single source of infection. M. bovis detected in one archival bovine specimen from the outbreak region showed an identical MIRU-VNTR profile, suggesting persistence of the agent in a dairy herd for nearly fifteen years. The outbreak in the eastern part of Switzerland was caused by M. caprae spoligotype SB0418. All Swiss M. caprae isolates showed the Lechtal-type MIRU-VNTR profile, described as endemic in wild ruminants and in dairy cattle in Austrian bordering regions. This suggests the agent was most likely introduced by Swiss dairy cattle summering on Austrian pastures. Conclusions The present study is the first MIRU-VNTR analysis of Swiss bTB mycobacterial isolates. The genotyping assay was found to be highly discriminating and suitable for the epidemiological tracing of further outbreaks. These findings will contribute to the development of an international MIRU-VNTR database aiming to improve bTB surveillance."

It contains three highly conserved domains known as DIX, PDZ, and DEP, the functions of which have been well characterized in β-catenin-dependent canonical and β-catenin-independent noncanonical Wnt signaling. The C-terminal region is also highly conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates. However, its function in regulating the activation of different Wnt signals remains unclear. We reported previously that Dvl conformational change triggered by the highly conserved PDZ-binding C terminus is important for the pathway specificity.

Therefore, the forced binding of the C terminus to the PDZ domain reduces the activity of Dvl in noncanonical Wnt signaling, whereas obstruction of this interaction releases Dvl autoinhibition, impairs its functional interaction with LRP6 in canonical Wnt signaling, and increases its specificity in noncanonical Wnt signaling, which is closely correlated with an enhanced Dvl membrane localization. Our findings highlight the importance of the C terminus in keeping Dvl in an appropriate autoinhibited state, accessible for regulation by other partners to switch pathway specificity.

https://openalex.org/W2589200334,"The main purpose of the present study was to assess the depressive symptomatology and to gather new validity evidences of the Reynolds Depression Scale-Short form (RADS-SF) in a representative sample of youths. The sample consisted of 2914 adolescents with a mean age of 15.85 years (SD = 1.68). We calculated the descriptive statistics and internal consistency of the RADS-SF scores. Also, confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) at the item level and successive multigroup CFAs to test measurement invariance, were conducted. Latent mean differences across gender and educational level groups were estimated, and finally, we studied the sources of validity evidences with other external variables. The level of internal consistency of the RADS-SF Total score by means of Ordinal alpha was .89. Results from CFAs showed that the one-dimensional model displayed appropriate goodness of-fit indices with CFI value over .95, and RMSEA value under .08. In addition, the results support the strong measurement invariance of the RADS-SF scores across gender and age. When latent means were compared, statistically significant differences were found by gender and age. Females scored 0.347 over than males in Depression latent variable, whereas older adolescents scored 0.111 higher than the younger group. In addition, the RADS-SF score was associated with the RADS scores. The results suggest that the RADS-SF could be used as an efficient screening test to assess self-reported depressive symptoms in adolescents from the general population."

DYRK1A phosphorylates histone H3 to differentially regulate the binding of HP1 isoforms and antagonize HP1-mediated transcriptional repression.EMBO Rep. 2014; 15: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) discovered that phosphorylation of H3 threonine 45 prevents histone H3 binding to HP1α and HP1β, but not HP1γ. Considering that the three mammalian HP1s share ∼65% of amino acid types over the length of the proteins (24Vermaak D. Henikoff S. Malik H.S. Positive selection drives the evolution of rhino, a member of the heterochromatin protein 1 family in Drosophila.PLoS Genet. 2005; 10.1371/journal.pgen.0010009Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), how do their even more highly conserved CSDs bind to histone H3 in different manners? To address this question, we carried out quantitative binding assays and structural analyses of human HP1 homologs' CSDs with the histone H3 PXXVXL motif. Our isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) binding assays showed that all the three CSDs bind to the PXXVXL-containing fragment of histone H3 with comparable affinities, and the binding affinity is enhanced by both the C-terminal extension (CTE) of the HP1 homologs and the increasing length of the histone peptides. Our crystal structure of the HP1γ CSD (residues 110–176) in complex with an H3 peptide (residues 38–52) provides molecular insights into these observations, and the recognition of the PXXVXL motif by the CSD reveals the binding plasticity of the CSD and suggests an expanded ligand repertoire beyond the canonical PXVXL motif. Previous studies have shown that the CSDs of human HP1 homologs recognize a histone H3 region with a PXVXL-like motif around the DNA entry/exit sites of nucleosome but that different CSDs nevertheless behave differently (20Dawson M.A. Bannister A.J. Göttgens B. Foster S.D. Bartke T. Green A.R. Kouzarides T.

DYRK1A phosphorylates histone H3 to differentially regulate the binding of HP1 isoforms and antagonize HP1-mediated transcriptional repression.EMBO Rep. 2014; 15: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The human genome encodes three HP1 proteins (Fig. 1A), and the amino acid sequence alignment of their CSDs reveals strict conservation in 50 of 65 positions (Fig. 1B). To elucidate specific determinants of their reportedly varying interactions, we performed ITC assays with a histone H3-derived synthetic peptide containing residues 36–58 (H3(36–58)) and recombinant CSDs of HP1α, HP1β, or HP1γ (hereafter referred to as CSDα, CSDβ, and CSDγ, respectively). All of these CSDs bound to the tested H3 peptide with similar affinities (Fig. 1C), which is not surprising given their sequence conservation. A previous study showed that the CTE plays a role in CSD selectivity and affinity (25Mendez D.L. Kim D. Chruszcz M. Stephens G.E. Minor W. Khorasanizadeh S. Elgin S.C. The HP1a disordered C terminus and chromo shadow domain cooperate to select target peptide partners.Chembiochem. 2011; 12: 1084-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To explore the role of CTE in the interaction with H3 peptides, we performed a series of ITC binding assays using CSDα/β/γ of different C-terminal truncations against the histone H3 peptide H3(36–58). Our binding results support the following three conclusions. 1) The CSD without the CTE is sufficient for binding to the histone H3 fragment. CSDα (aa 107–179), CSDβ (aa 104–174), and CSDγ (aa 110–176), which miss most or all of the CTE, bound to the H3 peptide with comparable affinities (Fig. 1, B and C). H3 binding to these CSDs is reminiscent of PXVXL motif binding by CAF1 in that CAF1 also binds to C-terminally truncated HP1α (22Richart A.N. Brunner C.I. Stott K. Murzina N.V. Thomas J.O. Characterization of chromoshadow domain-mediated binding of heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α) to histone H3.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18730-18737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 2) Compared with the C-terminally truncated CSD constructs, constructs with the complete CTE bound to the histone H3 fragment 2–10-fold more tightly (Fig. 1D), which is consistent with the published pull-down results showing the contribution of the CTE of CSDα to histone binding (22Richart A.N. Brunner C.I. Stott K. Murzina N.V. Thomas J.O. Characterization of chromoshadow domain-mediated binding of heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α) to histone H3.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18730-18737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and also with the previously reported role of the CTE in the interaction between the CSD of DmHP1 and its partners (25Mendez D.L. Kim D. Chruszcz M. Stephens G.E. Minor W. Khorasanizadeh S. Elgin S.C. The HP1a disordered C terminus and chromo shadow domain cooperate to select target peptide partners.Chembiochem. 2011; 12: 1084-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 3) An intact CSD is essential for histone H3 binding. The CSD constructs, which lack the last three residues of the CSD (truncated at Thr-173 of CSDα or corresponding residues of CSDβ or CSDγ), showed no interaction in our assay (Fig. 1, B and D). Taken together, these data indicate that although the CSD without CTE is sufficient for the interaction with histone H3, the CTE strengthens this interaction significantly. To measure the effect of the length of histone H3 peptides on the interaction, we performed ITC assays with a shorter H3 peptide (residues 38–52, H3(38–52)) and different CSD constructs. The shorter peptide bound to CSDs less tightly (Fig. 1D), indicating that the residues flanking the PXVXL-like motif also contribute to CSD binding, consistent with the findings of Mendez et al. (25Mendez D.L. Kim D. Chruszcz M. Stephens G.E. Minor W. Khorasanizadeh S. Elgin S.C. The HP1a disordered C terminus and chromo shadow domain cooperate to select target peptide partners.Chembiochem. 2011; 12: 1084-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that the flanking residues of the PXVXL motif affected the binding affinity. Thus, CSDs interact with H3 in a manner preserving some aspects of the CSD interactions with PXVXL motif-containing proteins. Although the interaction between the CSD and histone H3 has been studied previously (20Dawson M.A. Bannister A.J. Göttgens B. Foster S.D. Bartke T. Green A.R. Kouzarides T.

We attempted to crystallize several CSD constructs of human HP1 proteins in complex with H3 peptides encompassing either residues 36–58 or 38–52 and succeeded in determining the crystal structure of CSDγ (residues 110–176) in complex with H3(38–52) (Fig. 2 and Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsParameterValueData collection Radiation wavelength (Å)0.9792 Space groupP21 Cell dimensions a, b, c (Å), β (°)40.74, 34.97, 45.83, 93.32 Resolution limits (Å)45.76–1.60 (1.63–1.60) Unique HKLs16,432 (549) Completeness (%)95.5 (65.8) Rsym0.052 (0.860) I/σ14.5 (1.0) Redundancy3.4 (2.3)Model refinement Refinement resolution (Å)27.79–1.60 Reflections used/free15,332/1,088 Number of atoms/average B-factor (Å2)1,246/25.6Protein1,053/25.4Peptide137/27.3Water44/25.4Others12/20.6 Rwork/Rfree0.194/0.239 RMSD, bonds (Å)/angles (°)0.016/1.8 Molprobity Ramachandran favored/outliers (%)100.00/0.00 Open table in a new tab The asymmetric unit of the CSDγ-H3 model comprises two CSDγ molecules (CSD-1 and CSD-2) that form a dimer hinged at their C-terminal α helices (Fig. 2, A–C).

We were able to model all residues of the H3(38–52) peptide, although some residues at the N terminus of the peptide have weak density (Fig. 2D). Residues 44–46 (G-T-V) of histone H3 pair with the β strand formed by CSD-2 residues 172–174 (Leu-Thr-Trp; hereafter we refer to H3 residues with single letters and to CSD residues with three-letter abbreviations) antiparallelly, and the H3 residues 46–49 (V-A-L) pack against the corresponding β strand from CSD-1 in parallel (Fig. 2C). To facilitate the comparison, we adopt notation previously introduced for the CSD-CAF1 complex (27Thiru A. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Okuwaki M. Lyon D. Nielsen P.R. Hirshberg M. Verreault A.

Thus, H3V46 is located near the pseudosymmetry axis of the CSD dimer and its side chain is accommodated by a hydrophobic pocket formed by both CSD monomers' Tyr-168 and Leu-172 residues (Fig. 2, C and E). The V46A mutant would interact less effectively with the hydrophobic pocket, consistent with published work (Fig. 2B) (21Lavigne M. Eskeland R. Azebi S. Saint-André V. Jang S.M. Batsché E. Fan H.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2590890529,"The dopaminergic system plays an essential role in various functions of the brain, including locomotion, memory, and reward, and the deregulation of dopaminergic signaling as a result of altered functionality of dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) is implicated in multiple neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Tetraspanin-7 (TSPAN7) is expressed to variable degrees in different tissues, with the highest level in the brain, and multiple mutations in TSPAN7 have been implicated in intellectual disability. Here, we tested the hypothesis that TSPAN7 may be a binding partner of DRD2 that is involved in the regulation of its functional activity. Our results showed that TSPAN7 was associated with DRD2 and reduced its surface expression by enhancing DRD2 internalization. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that TSPAN7 that resides in the plasma membrane and early and late endosomes promoted internalization of DRD2 and its localization to endosomal compartments of the endocytic pathway. Furthermore, we observed that TSPAN7 deficiency increased surface localization of DRD2 concurrent with the decrease of its endocytosis, regardless of dopamine treatment. Finally, TSPAN7 negatively affects DRD2-mediated signaling. These results disclosed a previously uncharacterized role of TSPAN7 in the regulation of the expression and functional activity of DRD2 by postendocytic trafficking.-Lee, S.-A., Suh, Y., Lee, S., Jeong, J., Kim, S.

https://openalex.org/W2591478245,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a deadly neglected tropical disease that poses a serious problem in various countries all over the world. Implementation of various intervention strategies fail in controlling the spread of this disease due to issues of parasite drug resistance and resistance of sandfly vectors to insecticide sprays. Due to this, policy makers need to develop novel strategies or resort to a combination of multiple intervention strategies to control the spread of the disease. To address this issue, we propose an extensive SIR-type model for anthroponotic visceral leishmaniasis transmission with seasonal fluctuations modeled in the form of periodic sandfly biting rate. Fitting the model for real data reported in South Sudan, we estimate the model parameters and compare the model predictions with known VL cases. Using optimal control theory, we study the effects of popular control strategies namely, drug-based treatment of symptomatic and PKDL-infected individuals, insecticide treated bednets and spray of insecticides on the dynamics of infected human and vector populations. We propose that the strategies remain ineffective in curbing the disease individually, as opposed to the use of optimal combinations of the mentioned strategies. Testing the model for different optimal combinations while considering periodic seasonal fluctuations, we find that the optimal combination of treatment of individuals and insecticide sprays perform well in controlling the disease for the time period of intervention introduced. Performing a cost-effective analysis we identify that the same strategy also proves to be efficacious and cost-effective. Finally, we suggest that our model would be helpful for policy makers to predict the best intervention strategies for specific time periods and their appropriate implementation for elimination of visceral leishmaniasis."

Essential roles in many different cellular processes have been suggested for the Obg protein from Escherichia coli (ObgE), and we recently showed that it is a central regulator of bacterial persistence. Here, we report the first crystal structure of ObgE at 1.85-Å resolution in the GDP-bound state, showing the characteristic N-terminal domain and a central G domain that are common to all Obg proteins. ObgE also contains an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain, and we show here that this domain specifically contributed to GTP binding, whereas it did not influence GDP binding or GTP hydrolysis. Biophysical analysis, using small angle X-ray scattering and multi-angle light scattering experiments, revealed that ObgE is a monomer in solution, regardless of the bound nucleotide. In contrast to recent suggestions, our biochemical analyses further indicate that ObgE is neither activated by K+ ions nor by homodimerization. However, the ObgE GTPase activity was stimulated upon binding to the ribosome, confirming the ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of the Obg family. Combined, our data represent an important step toward further unraveling the detailed molecular mechanism of ObgE, which might pave the way to further studies into how this GTPase regulates bacterial physiology, including persistence.

https://openalex.org/W2591431124,"Placental functioning relies on the appropriate differentiation of progenitor villous cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) into extravillous cytotrophoblasts (EVCTs), including invasive EVCTs, and the multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (ST) layer. This is accompanied by a general move away from a proliferative, immature phenotype. Genome-scale expression studies have provided valuable insight into genes that are associated with the shift to both an invasive EVCT and ST phenotype, whereas genome-scale DNA methylation analysis has shown that differentiation to ST involves widespread methylation shifts, which are counteracted by low oxygen. In the current study, we sought to identify DNA methylation variation that is associated with transition from CTB to ST in vitro and from a noninvasive to invasive EVCT phenotype after culture on Matrigel. Of the several hundred differentially methylated regions that were identified in each comparison, the majority showed a loss of methylation with differentiation. This included a large differentially methylated region (DMR) in the gene body of death domain-associated protein 6 (DAXX ), which lost methylation during both CTB syncytialization to ST and EVCT differentiation to invasive EVCT. Comparison to publicly available methylation array data identified the same DMR as among the most consistently differentially methylated genes in placental samples from preeclampsia pregnancies. Of interest, in vitro culture of CTB or ST in low oxygen increases methylation in the same region, which correlates with delayed differentiation. Analysis of combined epigenomics signatures confirmed DAXX DMR as a likely regulatory element, and direct gene expression analysis identified a positive association between methylation at this site and DAXX expression levels. The widespread dynamic nature of DAXX methylation in association with trophoblast differentiation and placenta-associated pathologies is consistent with an important role for this gene in proper placental development and function.-Novakovic, B., Evain-Brion, D., Murthi, P., Fournier, T., Saffery, R.

In this study, a hybrid method based on empirical mode decomposition and back-propagation artificial neural networks optimized by particle swarm optimization is developed to forecast outpatient visits on the basis of monthly numbers. The data outpatient visits are retrieved from January 2005 to December 2013 and first obtained as the original time series. Second, the original time series is decomposed into a finite and often small number of intrinsic mode functions by the empirical mode decomposition technique. Third, a three-layer back-propagation artificial neural network is constructed to forecast each intrinsic mode functions. To improve network performance and avoid falling into a local minimum, particle swarm optimization is employed to optimize the weights and thresholds of back-propagation artificial neural networks. Finally, the superposition of forecasting results of the intrinsic mode functions is regarded as the ultimate forecasting value. Simulation indicates that the proposed method attains a better performance index than the other four methods."

Eight years after the realization of initial prospective population-based molecular epidemiology investigations in this Region, a similar study over the period 2010–2013 was conducted. TB strains isolated from 945 patients were submitted to genotyping by standardized 24-locus-MIRU-VNTR typing and spoligotyping. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the LAM (16.7%) and Haarlem (15.7%) branches are the two most prevalent TB lineages circulating in Brussels. Analysis of the MDR subgroup showed an association with Beijing strains (39.9%) and patients native of Eastern Europe (40.7%). Genotyping detected 113 clusters involving 321 patients, giving a recent transmission index of 22.9%. Molecular-guided epidemiological investigations and routine surveillance activities revealed family transmission or social contact for patients distributed over 34 clusters. Most of the patients were foreign-born (75.7%). However, cluster analysis revealed only limited trans-national transmission. Comparison with the previous study shows a stable epidemiological situation except for the mean age difference between Belgian-born and foreign-born patients which has disappeared. This study confirms that molecular epidemiology has become an important determinant for TB control programs. However, sufficient financial means need to be available to perform all required epidemiological investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2589644544,"Glucocorticoids are primary stress hormones that regulate many physiological processes, and synthetic derivatives of these molecules are widely used in the clinic. The molecular factors that govern tissue specificity of glucocorticoids, however, are poorly understood. The actions of glucocorticoids are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). To discover new proteins that interact with GR and modulate its function, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay. The MyoD family inhibitor domain-containing protein (MDFIC) was identified as a binding partner for GR. MDFIC associated with GR in the cytoplasm of cells, and treatment with glucocorticoids resulted in the dissociation of the GR-MDFIC complex. To investigate the function of the GR-MDFIC interaction, we performed a genome-wide microarray in intact and MDFIC-deficient A549 cells that were treated with glucocorticoids. A large cohort of genes was differentially regulated by GR depending on the presence or absence of MDFIC. These gene changes were strongly associated with inflammation, and glucocorticoid regulation of the inflammatory response was altered in MDFIC-deficient cells. At a molecular level, the interaction of MDFIC with GR altered the phosphorylation status of the receptor. We demonstrate in COS-1 cells that changes in receptor phosphorylation underlie the ability of MDFIC to regulate the transcriptional activity of GR. Finally, we show that GR directly represses the MDFIC gene, revealing a negative feedback loop by which glucocorticoids limit MDFIC activity. These findings identify a new binding partner for cytoplasmic GR that modulates the receptor transcriptome and contributes to the tissue-specific actions of glucocorticoids."

Here, we show that metalloregulator MntR (So-MntR) functions dually as Mn2+ and H2O2 sensors in mediating H2O2 resistance by an oral streptococcus. H2O2 disrupted So-MntR binding to Mn2+ transporter mntABC promoter and induced disulfide-linked dimerization of the protein. Mass spectrometry identified Cys-11/Cys-156 and Cys-11/Cys-11 disulfide-linked peptides in H2O2-treated So-MntR. Site mutagenesis of Cys-11 and Cys-156 and particularly Cys-11 abolished H2O2-induced disulfide-linked dimers and weakened H2O2 damage on So-MntR binding, indicating that H2O2 inactivates So-MntR via disulfide-linked dimerization. So-MntR C123S mutant was extremely sensitive to H2O2 oxidization in dimerization/oligomerization, probably because the mutagenesis caused a conformational change that facilitates Cys-11/Cys-156 disulfide linkage. Intermolecular Cys-11/Cys-11 disulfide was detected in C123S/C156S double mutant. Redox Western blot detected So-MntR oligomers in air-exposed cells but remarkably decreased upon H2O2 pulsing, suggesting a proteolysis of the disulfide-linked So-MntR oligomers. Remarkably, elevated C11S and C156S but much lower C123S proteins were detected in H2O2-pulsed cells, confirming Cys-11 and Cys-156 contributed to H2O2-induced oligomerization and degradation. Accordingly, in the C11S and C156S mutants, expression of mntABC and cellular Mn2+ decreased, but H2O2 susceptibility increased. In the C123S mutant, increased mntABC expression, cellular Mn2+ content, and manganese-mediated H2O2 survival were determined. Given the wide distribution of Cys-11 in streptococcal DtxR-like metalloregulators, the disclosed redox regulatory function and mechanism of So-MntR can be employed by the DtxR family proteins in bacterial resistance to oxidative stress.

Different groups were treated with doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg and the inflammatory parameters were evaluated in carrageenan induced paw oedema and leukocyte migration in pleurisy model, while antinociceptive activity was evaluated using formalin method in rodents. The major constituent of EOP and EOS was limonene with 13.07% and 20.89%, respectively. No clinical signs of toxicity have been observed in animals. It was observed a significant decreased (P<0.01) in leukocyte migration at the dose of 300 mg/kg of EOP and EOS, with maximal inhibition of 89±3% for EOP and 80±6% for EOS. Paw oedema was inhibited at all times, and maximal inhibition was at the dose of 100 mg/kg at 2 h after carrageenan injection with 72±2% for EOP and 74±2% for EOS. EOS and EOP also reduced the first and second phases of formalin-induced nociception test. In the first formalin-phase, maximal inhibitions were at 48±5% for EOP and 66±4% for EOS (300 mg/kg). At the inflammatory phase induced by formalin, maximal inhibitions were 72±2% for EOP and 80±2% for EOS at the dose of 100 mg/kg.

Many aspects of the regulatory relevance of this pathway have been investigated in immune cells in the context of inflammation. However, very little is known about concentration-dependent activation kinetics and signal propagation in hepatocytes and the role of MK2. We established a mathematical model for IL-1β-induced activation of the p38MAPK/MK2 pathway in hepatocytes that was calibrated to quantitative data on time- and IL-1β concentration-dependent phosphorylation of p38MAPK and MK2 in primary mouse hepatocytes. This analysis showed that, in hepatocytes, signal transduction from IL-1β via p38MAPK to MK2 is characterized by strong signal amplification. Quantification of p38MAPK and MK2 revealed that, in hepatocytes, at maximum, 11.3% of p38MAPK molecules and 36.5% of MK2 molecules are activated in response to IL-1β. The mathematical model was experimentally validated by employing phosphatase inhibitors and the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Model simulations predicted an IC50 of 1–1.2 μm for SB203580 in hepatocytes. In silico analyses and experimental validation demonstrated that the kinase activity of p38MAPK determines signal amplitude, whereas phosphatase activity affects both signal amplitude and duration. p38MAPK and MK2 concentrations and responsiveness toward IL-1β were quantitatively compared between hepatocytes and macrophages.

Freitas C.A. Schaper F. Ruhl M. Melmed S. Heinrich P.C. Häussinger D.

In particular, activation of MK2 mediates the inhibitory effects of IL-1β on surface expression of the signal-transducing subunit of the IL-6 receptor complex gp130 (18.Radtke S. Wüller S. Yang X.P.

Apart from this, it was reported recently that oncostatin M (OSM) activates MK2 in hepatocytes and that MK2 is involved in regulation of the expression of the oncostatin M receptor transcript in hepatocytes (19.Ehlting C.

Based on a systems biology approach, this work provides an extensive quantitative analysis of the IL-1β-dependent activation kinetics of the p38MAPK/MK2 pathway in hepatocytes and reports the establishment of a mathematical model of the p38MAPK/MK2 pathway in hepatocytes for in silico analysis. The mathematical model is validated by time-resolved quantitative data on concentration-dependent activation of the p38MAPK/MK2 signaling module by IL-1β in primary mouse hepatocytes. Of note, comparative analysis of the cellular concentrations of p38MAPK and MK2 between hepatocytes and macrophages suggests that there are substantial differences between these two cell types with respect to the concentrations of p38MAPK and MK2 and the cell type-specific responsiveness toward IL-1β. To establish a procedure to estimate the intracellular concentration of p38MAPK and MK2 molecules in hepatocytes, first the cellular volume of primary mouse hepatocytes was determined. Live-cell fluorescence microscopy was used to obtain optical slices that were analyzed in 40 independent measurements (supplemental Fig. S1A). Based on this, 15.475 ± 4.044 pl (S.D.) was determined as the total volume of primary mouse hepatocytes. The applied approach was validated by measurements on fluorescent microspheres (FocalCheck, Molecular Probes). The measured diameter of the microspheres was 15.25 ± 0.36 μm (S.D.), which closely agrees with the specifications of the manufacturer (15.4 μm). Accordingly, the calculated volume of the microspheres (V = 16 πd3 = 1.912 pl) was in agreement with the measured volume of the microspheres of 1.903 ± 0.0554 pl (S.D.), thereby validating our approach to determine the volume of hepatocytes. The intracellular concentrations of total p38MAPK, total MK2, and the phosphorylated variants, respectively, were assessed for wild-type hepatocytes as well as for MK2-deficient hepatocytes by quantitative immunoblotting using a co-separated internal standard with known quantities of MK2 and p38MAPK and a known total degree of phosphorylation of the activation motif of these molecules (supplemental Fig. 1, B–F). The internal standard was calibrated based on recombinantly expressed and in vitro phosphorylated GST-tagged p38MAPK and MK2, respectively. The global phosphorylation degree of the activation motif in both GST fusion proteins was determined by mass spectrometry. Fig. 1 exemplarily represents the procedure we applied to quantify phosphorylated p38MAPK molecules. In total, 18 independent experiments (biological replicates) in multiple technical replicates were performed, and 1676 data points on the time-resolved and concentration-dependent activation of the p38MAPK/MK2 signaling module in primary mouse hepatocytes in response to IL-1β were generated to calibrate and validate our mathematical model for the p38MAPK/MK2 pathway in hepatocytes. Based on the law of mass action and custom kinetic rate laws, a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODE) was formulated, describing the IL-1β-dependent p38MAPK and MK2 phosphorylation and its negative feedback in mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 2 and supplemental Information S2), consisting of six reaction rates that constitute an ODE system with five equations. The complexity of the model was chosen so that only the essential features of the pathway that are important for this study are included while maintaining an adequate description of the experimental data. Some simplifications were possible to make the system computationally more tractable and to increase the number of identifiable parameters. On that account, the IL1R complex comprising TAK1, Myd88, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), TAB1 and 2, and MKK6 were summarized as IL-1β-mediated p38MAPK activation (phosphorylation) (Fig. 2, R1). To describe basal activation, we introduced the parameter p38_act_basal (R1), which is linked to the basal activation (phosphorylation) of p38MAPK independent of IL-1β. Furthermore, because of the lack of specificity of phosphatases, the contributing phosphatases in the model were summarized. The system is down-regulated by MAPK phosphatases (MKP) whose transcription is activated by phosphorylated p38MAPK (R5). MKP deactivates (dephosphorylates) the activated p38MAPK (R2). This leads to a negative feedback. MKP is degraded with a linear rate (R6). The MAPKAP kinase MK2 is activated (phosphorylated) by activated p38MAPK (R3). Because of basal phosphatase activity, p38MAPK and MK2 are dephosphorylated with a linear rate (R4 and R2). To calculate the absolute concentration of the key systems components, the unknown calibration parameter values of the internal standard were simultaneously estimated with the mathematical model. Using this approach, the total intracellular concentration of p38MAPK (359 nm, i.e. 3.35 × 106 molecules/cell) and MK2 (4637 nm, i.e. 4.32 × 107 molecules/cell) in primary mouse hepatocytes was determined. Under basal conditions (0 ng·ml−1 IL-1β), only 0.36% (1.3 nm) of all p38MAPK molecules was activated, as indicated by the determination of the activating phosphorylation of p38MAPK at Thr-180/Tyr-182, and 1.9% (85.6 nm) of the MK2 molecules was phosphorylated on Thr-222 under the respective control conditions. Treatment of mouse hepatocytes with IL-1β resulted in a dose-dependent transient activation of p38MAPK and MK2 with a peak at 12–20 min, and saturation of the activation was achieved at IL-1β concentrations above 20 ng·ml−1 (Figure 3, Figure 4). IL-1β induced activation of p38MAPK, and MK2-mediated signal transduction was accompanied by significant signal amplification because 57 fm IL-1β results in an increase in p38MAPK phosphorylation at Thr-180/Tyr-182 of 20,960 fm, and this subsequently leads to an increase in MK2 phosphorylation at Thr-222 of 1,063,000 fm (Fig. 4).Figure 4Simulation of the p38MAPK and MK2 phosphorylation kinetics as a function of IL-1β concentration and time. A and B, simulations based on the fitted model illustrate the time- and dose-dependent kinetics of IL-1β-dependent p38MAPK (A) and MK2 (B) activation, where the intrinsic signal amplification is reflected. Signal amplification is roughly IL-1β concentration (conc)-independent, and signal transduction occurs under minimal deformation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In total, 169 parameter values were estimated from 1676 data points (see supplemental Information S2 for details regarding parameter estimation, the estimated parameter values, and the data used for the parameter estimation). To prevent convergence to possible local optima, 1000 parameter estimation runs with different initial parameter guesses were performed (20.Raue A. Schilling M. Bachmann J. Matteson A. Schelker M. Schelke M. Kaschek D. Hug S. Kreutz C. Harms B.D. Theis F.J. Klingmüller U. Timmer J. Lessons learned from quantitative dynamical modeling in systems biology.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e74335Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). More than 650 runs directed to the same optimum, which is a strong indication that the global optimum was identified. In the remaining 350 runs, several local minima were identified at likelihood values that are significantly worse than the global optimum. Therefore, they were neglected for further investigations. To reliably study the systems behavior in silico, it is important to establish a structurally and practically identifiable set of parameter values (21.Raue A. Kreutz C. Maiwald T. Bachmann J. Schilling M. Klingmüller U. Timmer J. Structural and practical identifiability analysis of partially observed dynamical models by exploiting the profile likelihood.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). To investigate the identifiability and confidence intervals of the parameters, the likelihood profile was calculated (Fig. 5). The analysis revealed that, except for the parameter p38_dea_const, all parameters are identifiable. The parameter profile of the parameter p38_dea_const suggests that the constant dephosphorylation rate of p38MAPK is negligible compared with the MKP-induced dephosphorylation. For model simulations predicting the differential contributions of signal-inducing kinases and signal-terminating phosphatases (Fig. 6, A and C), a parameter set was used that was obtained by excluding experiments in which inhibitors were applied.Figure 6In silico analysis (predictions) and experimental validation. A and C, contribution of kinases and phosphatases to signal amplitude and duration. Simulations of parameter perturbations that are reflecting changes in kinase and phosphatase activity are showing different effects on MK2 phosphorylation. The perturbation of the kinases was simulated by changing the parameter mk2_act_p38 by a factor indicated in the figure. This has mainly an effect on the signal amplitude of MK2 phosphorylation. The perturbation of the phosphatases was modeled by changing the parameter p38_dea_MKP. This affects both signal amplitude and duration of MK2 phosphorylation. B, SB203580 inhibited IL-1β induced MK2 phosphorylation. Primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 for 30 min prior to treatment with 1 ng·ml−1 IL-1β. Whole cell lysates were applied to Western blotting analysis with a serial dilution of an internal phosphostandard, and phosphorylation of MK2 at Thr-222 was detected by specific antibodies. Signal intensities were determined and converted to intracellular concentrations. The data were fitted to the mathematical model (solid lines). D, inhibition of p38MAPK and MK2 dephosphorylation. Primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with 200 μm sodium orthovanadate and 200 μm β-glycerophosphate for inhibition of phosphatases prior to treatment with 1 ng·ml−1 IL-1β.

The data were fitted to the mathematical model (solid lines).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In silico simulations based on the complete dataset revealed the time- and dose-dependent kinetics of IL-1β-dependent p38MAPK and MK2 phosphorylation. This analysis showed that an intrinsic signal amplification of up to 60-fold occurs (Fig. 4, compare A and B). Signal amplification is to a large extent IL-1β concentration-independent, and signal transduction occurs under minimal deformation from p38MAPK to MK2 in terms of time and concentration dependence. Transient p38MAPK and MK2 signal activation are overall effects of both kinase and phosphatase activity. To characterize their distinct contribution to signal propagation, model simulations for different perturbation conditions were performed using the parameter set obtained by excluding perturbation experiments from the complete dataset as described above. Specifically, the parameter mk2_act_p38 was varied to characterize the contribution of kinases to signal progression. This analysis suggested that kinases mainly affect signal amplitude and only to a lesser extent the signal duration of IL-1β-induced activation of p38MAPK and MK2 (Fig. 6A), respectively. On the other hand, modulation of the parameter p38_dea_mkp was used to assess the contribution of phosphatases to signal progression. The resulting model simulations revealed that phosphatases modulate the activation kinetics. The maxima are reached with a significant delay upon both signal amplitude and duration of IL-1β-induced p38MAPK activation and MK2 activation (Fig. 6C), respectively. To validate the in silico analyses, primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with the p38MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580 prior to IL-1β treatment. Perturbation of signal transduction through inhibition of p38MAPK activity by SB203580 resulted in a concentration-dependent down-regulation of IL-1β-induced MK2 phosphorylation. Therefore, the signal duration remained unaffected (Fig. 6B). For primary mouse hepatocytes, the model predicted an IC50 of 1.127 μm for SB203580 (Fig. 7). Treatment of primary mouse hepatocytes with a combination of the phosphatase inhibitors sodium orthovanadate and β-glycerophosphate prior to IL-1β treatment particularly resulted in sustained phosphorylation of p38MAPK and MK2, which was enhanced and prolonged (Fig. 6D). These results confirm the predictions from the in silico analyses, indicating that kinase activity has an impact on signal amplitude rather than signal duration and that the phosphatase activity controls signal duration and amplitude. As mentioned above, the regulatory relevance of the p38MAPK/MK2 pathway, and in particular of MK2, has been investigated mainly in immune cells. Likewise, systems biology-based analyses of this pathway only exist for immune cells such as macrophages but not for hepatocytes. To elucidate potential differences between macrophages and hepatocytes, comparative analyses of the concentration of p38MAPK and MK2 were performed in primary mouse hepatocytes and bone marrow-derived macrophages. As depicted in Fig. 9A, the p38MAPK concentration in macrophages (1.4 μm) is significantly higher compared with hepatocytes (0.36 μm). The concentration of MK2 in macrophages (13.2 μm) is around three times higher than in hepatocytes (4.6 μm). Although, in hepatocytes, a stimulus with 1 ng·ml−1 IL-1β resulted in more than 5-fold increased activation of the p38MAPK/MK2 pathway compared with the basal phosphorylation level (Fig. 9A, right panels), the analysis of the phosphorylated p38MAPK and MK2 in macrophages showed that a strong pathway induction only occurs in response to higher doses of IL-1β. To delineate potential cell type-specific differences in the kinetics of signal transmission via the p38MAPK/MK2 pathway, time course experiments for both cell types with different IL-1β inputs were performed (Fig. 9B). The quantitative data obtained for hepatocyte could be described by the mathematical model established for activation of the p38MAPK/MK2 pathway in hepatocytes and thereby further validated the model. On the other hand, the determinations in macrophages were used to recalibrate the mathematical model for quantitative characterization of the activation kinetics of the pathway observed in macrophages. With the two calibrated models, it was possible to calculate the cell type-specific responsiveness of p38MAPK and MK2 to different IL-1β doses (Fig. 9C). For macrophages, the half-maximal effective concentration of IL-1β for p38MAPK and MK2 phosphorylation, respectively, is significantly higher than in hepatocytes, indicating that there are substantial cell type-specific differences in the responsiveness of hepatocytes and macrophages toward IL-1β. The p38MAPK pathway is considered to be important for the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. Therefore, it plays a role as a potential therapeutic target, with implications in inflammation, acute phase response, liver regeneration, cell differentiation, cell growth, cell death, senescence, and tumorigenesis. In the context of liver regeneration, the p38MAPK pathway contributes to coordination of the termination of liver regeneration. Over 20 different p38MAPK inhibitors have entered clinical trials (22.Goldstein D.M. Gabriel T.

However, little is known about the intracellular abundance and activation kinetics of p38MAPK and its downstream target MK2 in hepatocytes.

Here, we explore the effects of RhoA on ESC proliferation and the possible underlying mechanism. Methods Human ESCs were enriched by rapid adhesion to collagen IV. RhoA(+/+)(G14V), RhoA(-/-)(T19N) and pGFP control plasmids were transfected into human ESCs. The effect of RhoA on cell proliferation was detected by cell proliferation and DNA synthesis assays. Induction of PKN1 activity by RhoA was determined by immunoblot analysis, and the effects of PKN1 on RhoA in terms of inducing cell proliferation and cyclin D1 expression were detected using specific siRNA targeting PKN1. The effects of U-46619 (a RhoA agonist) and C3 transferase (a RhoA antagonist) on ESC proliferation were observed in vivo. Results RhoA had a positive effect on ESC proliferation, and PKN1 activity was up-regulated by the active RhoA mutant (G14V) and suppressed by RhoA T19N. Moreover, the ability of RhoA to promote ESC proliferation and DNA synthesis was interrupted by PKN1 siRNA. Additionally, cyclin D1 protein and mRNA expression levels were up-regulated by RhoA G14V, and these effects were inhibited by siRNA-mediated knock-down of PKN1. RhoA also promoted ESC proliferation via PKN in vivo. Conclusion This study shows that the effect of RhoA on ESC proliferation is mediated by activation of the PKN1-cyclin D1 pathway in vitro, suggesting that RhoA may serve as a new therapeutic target for wound healing."

https://openalex.org/W2590392077,"A change to an object in natural scenes attracts attention when it occurs during a fixation. However, when a change occurs during a saccade, and is masked by saccadic suppression, it typically does not capture the gaze in a bottom-up manner. In the present work, we investigated how the type and direction of salient changes to objects affect the prioritization and targeting of objects in natural scenes. We asked observers to look around a scene in preparation for a later memory test. After a period of time, an object in the scene was increased or decreased in salience either during a fixation (with a transient signal) or during a saccade (without transient signal), or it was not changed at all. Changes that were made during a fixation attracted the eyes both when the change involved an increase and a decrease in salience. However, changes that were made during a saccade only captured the eyes when the change was an increase in salience, relative to the baseline no-change condition. These results suggest that the prioritization of object changes can be influenced by the underlying salience of the changed object. In addition, object changes that occurred with a transient signal (which is itself a salient signal) resulted in more central object targeting. Taken together, our results suggest that salient signals in a natural scene are an important component in both object prioritization and targeting in natural scene viewing, insofar as they align with object locations."

In the last 40 years, significant progress has been achieved in understanding the molecular mechanism of pre-RC assembly, and the progress is mainly reflected in the identification of four pre-RC components, Cdc6/Cdc18, minichromosome maintenance protein complex (MCM), origin recognition complex (ORC), and Cdt1, and delineation of the order of these proteins loaded onto DNA origins (1.Hartwell L.H.

However, some basic questions regarding pre-RC assembly still remain. For example, the molecular mechanism of pre-RC assembly in fission yeast and metazoans remains to be elucidated; the structures of DNA origins in fission yeast and metazoans remains to be determined; we do not know how cells in fission yeast to metazoans select replication-initiation sites and why DNA origins in these species are significantly larger than the budding yeast DNA origins; and the regulation of pre-RC assembly requires further study so that we have a better understanding of how cells avoid DNA re-replication within one cell cycle. All of these questions are long-standing ones in the field of eukaryotic DNA replication. pre-replicative complex minichromosome maintenance protein complex origin recognition complex Edinburgh minimal medium thiabendazole hydroxyurea heteronuclear single quantum coherence immunoprecipitation DNA-chromatin immunoprecipitation for deep sequencing. Pre-RC assembles at specific sites/DNA origins on chromosomal DNA, and these pre-RC sites act as DNA origins to initiate DNA synthesis with a different extent during S phase. The structures of DNA origins, as we have known, are not conserved from budding yeast to fission yeast and human cells. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, origins have an average length of 100–150 bp, which includes an essential consensus sequence called the A element and the non-conserved B region that is also important for origin activity (8.Marahrens Y.

A yeast replication origin consists of multiple copies of a small conserved sequence.Cell. 1988; 53: 441-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The A element is recognized and bound by ORC (3.Bell S.P. Stillman B.

Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Two steps in the assembly of complexes at yeast replication origins in vivo.Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Together with the A element, a part of the B region (close to the A element) is also used for assembly of pre-RC. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, origin sizes range from ∼500 to 1500 bp. Unlike in S. cerevisiae, a conserved sequence like the A element is not yet identified in S. pombe origins, but they do contain two or more elements that are highly important or essential for origin activity. These elements often have highly asymmetric AT-rich sequences, with A in one strand and T in the other. In vitro and in vivo footprinting assays indicate that some of these elements are bound by S. pombe ORC and are sites for pre-RC formation (11.Kong D. DePamphilis M.L.

Multiple ORC-binding sites are required for efficient MCM loading and origin firing in fission yeast.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 964-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and that other elements are associated with a non-ORC protein (12.Kong D. DePamphilis M.L. Site-specific ORC binding, pre-replication complex assembly and DNA synthesis at Schizosaccharomyces pombe replication origins.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5567-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Replication origins in metazoans are still not defined but appear similar to S. pombe origins in certain ways. First, they also lack an apparent consensus sequence. Second, their sizes are also large (16.Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. The Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase origin consists of multiple potential nascent-strand start sites.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Third, some studies have shown that AT-rich sequences, as they are in S. pombe origins, are also important for metazoan origin activity (17.Austin R.J. Orr-Weaver T.L. Bell S.P. Drosophila ORC specifically binds to ACE3, an origin of DNA replication control element.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2639-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 18.Kong D. Coleman T.R.

Xenopus origin recognition complex (ORC) initiates DNA replication preferentially at sequences targeted by Schizosaccharomyces pombe ORC.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3441-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The nature of metazoan origins, the reason for their similarity to S. pombe origins, and the reason why they are 5–10 times larger than S. cerevisiae origins all remain elusive. Because pre-RC assembles on DNA origins, the origin structure must be directly related to the mechanism of how pre-RC is assembled. DNA origins in fission yeast and metazoans are significantly larger and remarkably different from budding yeast origins. Thus, the mechanism for pre-RC assembly must be different in some aspects among these organisms. The autonomously replicating sequence ARS3001, an S. pombe DNA-replication origin, contains two essential elements, Δ3 and Δ9 (19.Kim S.M. Huberman J.A. Multiple orientation-dependent, synergistically interacting, similar domains in the ribosomal DNA replication origin of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our previous studies of replication initiation at the S. pombe origin, ARS3001, indicated that ORC binds mainly to the Δ3 element, one of the two essential elements in this origin, and assembles a pre-RC at the Δ2 and Δ3 sites. However, ARS3001 has an additional essential element, Δ9, that is bound by a non-ORC protein (12.Kong D. DePamphilis M.L. Site-specific ORC binding, pre-replication complex assembly and DNA synthesis at Schizosaccharomyces pombe replication origins.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5567-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Deleting the Δ9 element or increasing the distance between the Δ3 and Δ9 elements from the initial ∼300 bp to 1.8 kb abolishes ARS3001 origin activity, indicating that the Δ9 region is an integral element of ARS3001 (12.Kong D. DePamphilis M.L. Site-specific ORC binding, pre-replication complex assembly and DNA synthesis at Schizosaccharomyces pombe replication origins.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5567-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To examine the function of the Δ9 element as well as the protein binding to Δ9 element, we isolated the Δ9 element-binding protein and identified it as S. pombe Sap1 protein. Sap1 was initially identified as a protein bound to a sequence involved in mating-type switching (20.Arcangioli B. Klar A.J. A novel switch-activating site (SAS1) and its cognate binding factor (SAP1) required for efficient mat1 switching in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3025-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, it has also been found to be essential for cell viability; thus, it must perform other function(s) essential for cell growth because mating-type switching is not an essential process for cell growth (21.Arcangioli B. Copeland T.D. Klar A.J. Sap1, a protein that binds to sequences required for mating-type switching, is essential for viability in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2058-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that Sap1 binds to DNA origins and interacts with ORC. It was also found that Sap1 is essential for the transition from G1 to S phase during cell-division cycles. We demonstrated that Sap1 directly participates in the assembly of pre-RC by its essential function in recruiting Cdc18 (the homologue of Cdc6 in S. pombe) to DNA origins. A genome-wide pre-RC and replication-initiation sites were determined at high resolution by a DNA-chromatin immunoprecipitation for deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) assay targeting ORC, Sap1, Cdc18, Cdt1, MCM, and RPA. Through comparison of DNA sequences in these pre-RC and replication-initiation sites, a relatively conserved sequence of 5′-(A/T)n(C/G)(A/T)9–10(G/C)(A/T)n-3′ (n ≧ 1) exists in S. pombe DNA origins. This sequence is basically very similar to the Sap1-binding sequence of 5′-AAAACAATATTTATTGAAAA-3′ in the origin ARS3001 (12.Kong D. DePamphilis M.L. Site-specific ORC binding, pre-replication complex assembly and DNA synthesis at Schizosaccharomyces pombe replication origins.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5567-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A remarkable feature of this sequence is that there are two G:C pairs that bracket 9–10 A:T pairs. At the 5′- or 3′-flanking side of the two G:C pairs are one or more A:T pairs. We obtained the crystal structure of Sap1-DBD (DNA-binding domain) at a resolution of 1.04 Å. Further, we determined the biochemical interaction between Sap1 and DNA by resolving the structure of Sap1-DBD and DNA sequence of 5′-AAAACAATATTTATTGAAAA-3′ (the Sap1-bound sequence on origin ARS3001) by NMR. Thus, we conclude that Sap1 is a replication initiation protein and directly participates in the assembly of pre-RCs. The nature of DNA origins in fission yeast S. pombe is defined by possessing two essential origin elements, one bound by ORC and the other by Sap1. We previously found that a non-ORC protein binds to an essential sequence Δ9 in the origin ARS3001, because two DNase I-hypersensitive sites were detected in the Δ9 sequence (12.Kong D. DePamphilis M.L. Site-specific ORC binding, pre-replication complex assembly and DNA synthesis at Schizosaccharomyces pombe replication origins.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5567-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To identify the Δ9-binding protein, an EMSA was performed. As shown in Fig. 1A, a protein present in the chromatin extract of the wild-type S. pombe, Sp-dk1, bound to the Δ9 sequence but not to an unrelated DNA fragment obtained from pBluescript plasmid. The Δ9-binding protein was subsequently isolated by cation and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by selective Δ9-DNA affinity (Fig. 1B) and glycerol-gradient sedimentation (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1C (top), the Δ9-binding protein (indicated by the asterisk) was purified to apparent homogeneity (fractions 3–8). The distribution of the purified protein (top) and Δ9 DNA-binding activity (bottom) were coincident across the glycerol gradient. This protein has a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa and was identified as Sap1 by mass spectrometry. Sap1 is localized selectively in the nucleus, and the majority of Sap1 is bound to chromatin based on analyses using GFP-tagged Sap1 and Western blotting (data not shown). The level of Sap1 on chromatin, similar to that of ORC, was constant throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 1D). To determine the function of Sap1, we selected a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of Sap1, Sp-dk1-sap1ts5. Sp-dk1-sap1ts5 cells were able to grow at 26 °C but not at 36 °C (Fig. 1E). The length of the cell cycle in the mutant cells was ∼30 min longer than Sp-dk1 at 26 °C, and some cells were elongated (Fig. 1F). At 36 °C, the sap1ts5 cells could grow for approximately two cell cycles (∼6 h); subsequently, they stopped dividing and became elongated (Fig. 1F). DNA sequencing revealed that the sap1ts5 gene contained two point mutations that resulted in two amino acid changes (E178K and K187N) located in the coiled-coil region of Sap1 (22.Bada M. Walther D. Arcangioli B. Doniach S. Delarue M. Solution structural studies and low-resolution model of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe sap1 protein.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of these two point mutations on Sap1 function, we first assessed whether the association of Sap1ts5 with chromatin was altered. Western blotting indicated that the total amounts of Sap1 in wild-type and mutant cells were equivalent at 26 and 36 °C but that the level of Sap1 associated with chromatin in mutant cells was reduced by ∼30% at 26 °C and 10-fold at 36 °C (Fig. 1G). These results suggest that the association of Sap1 with chromatin may be required for its essential function in the cell growth cycle. Using the sap1ts5 strain, we were able to confirm the in vivo binding of Sap1 to the Δ9 element, because Sap1ts5 dissociates from chromatin at the restrictive temperature. Two hypersensitive DNase I sites were previously mapped to the Δ9 sequence (12.Kong D. DePamphilis M.L. Site-specific ORC binding, pre-replication complex assembly and DNA synthesis at Schizosaccharomyces pombe replication origins.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5567-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, an in vivo footprinting assay was performed to determine the binding of Sap1 to the Δ9. As shown in Fig. 1H, the two hypersensitive DNase I sites disappeared in Sp-dk1-sap1ts5 cells at 36 °C (lane 5), whereas they were readily detectable in Sp-dk1 cells at 26 and 36 °C and in Sp-dk1-sap1ts5 cells at 26 °C (lanes 2–4). This result confirms that Sap1 binds to the Δ9 element in vivo. To determine whether Sap1 binds to all DNA origins, ChIP-seq analysis was performed. As a positive control, genome-wide ORC binding sites were also examined with the same method. The results presented in Fig. 2A give two conclusions: 1) Sap1 binds to DNA sequences that ORC associates with, indicating that Sap1 binds to DNA origins, and 2) Sap1 and ORC binding sites are overlapped across the entire genomic DNA, which suggests that Sap1 and ORC interact with one another after they bind to DNA origins. The interaction of Sap1 and ORC is further confirmed with reciprocal IPs and protein affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2B, IP against Sap1 or the Orc1 subunit of ORC in chromatin extracts brought down Orc1 and Sap1, respectively. This indicates that Sap1 interacts with ORC in vivo. To examine Sap1 interacting with ORC directly, protein affinity chromatography was conducted with purified Sap1 and ORC. The result in Fig. 2C shows that the peak of ORC (Orc1) eluted from Sap1-conjugated agarose beads occurred at 0.3–0.4 m KCl, whereas ORC (Orc1) was eluted from the agarose beads at 0.1–0.15 m salt. This result indicates that Sap1 interacts with ORC directly. We examined all of the ORC- and Sap1-binding sites and calculated that there were ∼600 strong ORC/Sap1-binding sites (the height of binding peaks is ≥250; the size of the binding region is ∼1 kb or more) and ∼2000 medium-strength ORC/Sap1 binding sites (the peak height is 150–250; the size of the binding region is ∼0.5 kb). These numbers are fairly close to the ∼400 strong and ∼500 weak origins previously identified in S. pombe (23.Heichinger C. Penkett C.J. Bähler J. Nurse P. Genome-wide characterization of fission yeast DNA replication origins.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5171-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). ∼50% of the 637 ORC binding sites determined with the ChIP-microarray assay by Hayashi et al. (24.Hayashi M. Katou Y. Itoh T. Tazumi M. Yamada Y. Takahashi T. Nakagawa T. Shirahige K. Masukata H. Genome-wide localization of pre-RC sites and identification of replication origins in fission yeast.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1327-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) are overlapped with the medium to strong ORC binding sites identified in this study; within the 0.5–2 kb range, the ORC binding sites identified by Hayashi et al. (24.Hayashi M. Katou Y. Itoh T. Tazumi M. Yamada Y. Takahashi T. Nakagawa T. Shirahige K. Masukata H. Genome-wide localization of pre-RC sites and identification of replication origins in fission yeast.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1327-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and by us are overlapped. Some differences in identifying ORC binding sites are probably due to the different experimental approaches, ChIP-seq versus ChIP-microarray. The cell cycle of Sp-dk1-sap1ts5 cells is ∼30 min longer than that of Sp-dk1 cells even at the permissive temperature of 26 °C. If Sap1 functions in DNA replication, a functionally defective Sap1 would extend the length of S phase and increase the percentage of cells in this phase. Thus, the percentage of cells undergoing S phase was measured in an asynchronous population using BrdU incorporation and immunofluorescence at the permissive growth temperature of 26 °C. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), there were ∼50, 42, and 46% more cells in S phase in the Sp-dk1-sap1ts5 cells compared with the Sp-dk1 cells after BrdU labeling for 5, 10, and 20 min, respectively. This result indicates that S-phase progression was affected by the Sap1 mutation in Sp-dk1-sap1ts5 cells. Next, the stage at which cells arrest occurs was determined in the absence of Sap1. Two diploid strains with sap1+/+ura4−/− and sap1+/−ura4−/+ genotypes were constructed. In S. pombe, both the sap1 and ura4 genes are located in chromosome III. For the diploid strain of sap1+/+ura4−/−, the sap1 gene is present in both copies of chromosome III, but the ura4 gene is deleted. In the diploid strain of sap1+/−ura4−/+, one copy of chromosome III harbors a normal sap1 gene, but the ura4 is gene absent; another copy of chromosome III has a normal ura4 gene, but the sap1 gene is deleted. Spores obtained from the two diploid strains were germinated in the appropriate medium with or without uracil and then examined by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 3C, the spores from the sap1+/+ strain germinated, replicated their DNA from 1C to 2C, and then went on to generate a population with normal cell growth cycles. In contrast, the spores with the sap1− genotype germinated, but the germinated spores could not initiate DNA synthesis, and the cells thus maintained a DNA content of 1C. The bottom panel in Fig. 3C shows the morphology of the germinated spores with or without the sap1 gene. Approximately 80% of the spores from the sap1+/+ ura4−/− strain germinated at 6–9 h after incubation and matured into healthy cells at ∼20 h. Fifty percent of the spores from the sap1+/− ura4−/+ strain had a genotype of sap1+ ura4− and could not germinate in medium lacking uracil. Approximately 80% of the remaining spores (sap1− ura4+) also began to germinate after 6–9 h of incubation and grew into cells, some of which grew to longer than the normal size. This result confirms that Sap1 is required for the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. The genome of YMF234 cells harbors several copies of the Cdc18 gene (the Cdc6 homologue in fission yeast) under the control of the nmt1 promoter (25.Nishitani H. Nurse P. p65cdc18 plays a major role controlling the initiation of DNA replication in fission yeast.Cell. 1995; 83: 397-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). When Cdc18 is overexpressed in Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM) lacking thiamine, it causes cells to constantly reinitiate DNA replication within a cell cycle, which results in DNA re-replication and nuclear enlargement (25.Nishitani H. Nurse P. p65cdc18 plays a major role controlling the initiation of DNA replication in fission yeast.Cell. 1995; 83: 397-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Thus, YMF234 cells provide a convenient experimental system to examine whether a protein functions in replication. It is expected that a functionally defective replication protein will affect the extent of re-replication and nuclear enlargement in YMF234 cells. To examine the function of Sap1 in replication, we constructed a YMF234-sap1ts5 strain in which the wild type sap1 gene is replaced by the sap1ts5 gene. The level of overexpressed Cdc18 was approximately the same in YMF234 and YMF234-sap1ts5 cells in EMM at 26 °C (Fig. 5B), but the extent of DNA re-replication was significantly inhibited in YMF234-sap1ts5 cells compared with YMF234 cells even at the permissive temperature of 26 °C, based on nuclear enlargement and DNA content measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 4, A and B). To examine whether DNA replication was further inhibited in YMF234-sap1ts5 cells at 36 °C, the cells were grown at 26 °C for 12 h in EMM to allow the overexpression of Cdc18 (Cdc18 overexpression was maximal at 10–12 h after the cells were inoculated into EMM). At this point, the cells had not commenced DNA re-replication and had not elongated. The culture was then quickly shifted to 36 °C and incubated further. We found that almost all of the YMF234-sap1ts5 cells were slightly elongated and able to grow in EMM for about 2 days (Fig. 4C). Subsequently, some of the elongated cells began to die, and the cells with a normal length began to accumulate (data not shown). In contrast, YMF234 cells were able to grow in EMM for only 12–15 h and then elongated and died. Flow cytometry indicated that DNA content in YMF234 cells was ∼4- and 7-fold greater than that in YMF234-sap1ts5 cells at 26 and 36 °C, respectively (Fig. 4, A–C, right panels). These 4- and 7-fold differences appear to underestimate the actual difference in DNA content between YMF234 and YMF234-sap1ts5 cells at 26 and 36 °C because we found that DNA was significantly degraded particularly in YMF234 cells possessing very enlarged nuclei. These results indicate the following: 1) Cdc18 is a multicopy suppressor of the sap1ts5 mutant, and 2) Sap1 functions in replication, because the partial loss of Sap1ts5 function at 26 and 36 °C (the dissociation of Sap1ts5 from chromatin) diminished Cdc18 overexpression-induced DNA re-replication.Figure 5Sap1 is required to load Cdc18 onto DNA for pre-RC assembly. For the experiments shown in A and B, YMF234 and YMF234-sap1ts5 cells were grown in YE to log phase. The cells were then transferred to EMM and incubated at 26 °C for 14.5 h (for YMF234) or 17 h (for YMF234-sap1ts5). At this stage, each cell of both YMF234 and YMF234-sap1ts5 began to lengthen, indicating that DNA re-replication had occurred. YMF234-sap1ts5 cells grew more slowly than YMF234 cells and required a 2.5-h-longer incubation to begin DNA re-replication. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that all of the YMF234 and YMF234-sap1ts5 cells were in S phase for DNA re-replication with more than 2C DNA. Each of the two cultures was then split into three fractions, which were incubated at 26, 32, or 36 °C for an additional 5 h. At this stage, all of the YMF234 and YMF234-sap1ts5 cells in the three cultures had reached their maximal length. The cells were collected, and the levels of Sap1, Orc6, and Cdc18 were examined by Western blotting of whole cells, a combined cytoplasm and nucleoplasm fraction (CP&NP), and chromatin (Chro). A, the extent of dissociation of Sap1ts5 from chromatin in YMF234-sap1ts5 cells at 26, 32, and 36 °C. The top panel shows the total amounts of Sap1 and Orc6 in cells, whereas the bottom panel shows the levels bound to chromatin. B and C, the recruitment of Cdc18 and MCM to chromatin was inhibited during DNA re-replication in YMF234-sap1ts5 cells at 26, 32, and 36 °C. Western-blotting results are shown. The amount of MCM associated with chromatin was examined by digesting chromatin with DNase I to release MCM-bound chromatin fragments into the supernatant. The supernatant fraction was then subjected to Western blotting. D, Sap1 is required to recruit Cdc18 and subsequently MCM but not Cdt1 to chromatin at G1 phase of the cell cycle. Sp-dk1 and Sp-dk1-sap1ts5 were grown in YE to A590 of ∼0.2 at 26 °C. In the right panel, cultures were then shifted to 36 °C for an additional 3-h incubation with the addition of TBZ (100 μg/ml) to arrest cells at G2/M phase and inactivate Sap1ts5 (causing dissociation of Sap1 from chromatin). The cultures were then released from TBZ arrest and incubated in fresh YE medium for 1 h to allow them to enter into late M and G1 phases. The ce"

Previously we showed that the epithelium of healthy mouse corneas becomes vulnerable to Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhesion if it lacks the innate defense protein MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88), or after superficial injury by blotting with tissue paper. Here we explored their effect on corneal surface glycosylation using a metabolic label, tetra-acetylated N-azidoacetylgalactosamine (Ac4GalNAz). Ac4GalNAz treatment labeled the surface of healthy mouse corneas, leaving most cells viable, and bacteria preferentially associated with GalNAz-labeled regions. Surprisingly, corneas from MyD88-/- mice displayed similar GalNAz labeling to wild-type corneas, but labeling was reduced and patchy on IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)-knockout mouse corneas (P < 0.05, ANOVA). Tissue paper blotting removed GalNAz-labeled surface cells, causing DAPI labeling (permeabilization) of underlying cells. MS of material collected on the tissue paper blots revealed 67 GalNAz-labeled proteins, including intracellular proteins. These data show that the normal distribution of surface glycosylation requires IL-1R, but not MyD88, and is not sufficient to prevent bacterial binding. They also suggest increased P. aeruginosa adhesion to MyD88-/- and blotted corneas is not due to reduction in total surface glycosylation, and for tissue paper blotting is likely due to cell permeabilization.-Jolly, A. L., Agarwal, P., Metruccio, M. M. E., Spiciarich, D. R., Evans, D. J., Bertozzi, C. R., Fleiszig, S. M. J. Corneal surface glycosylation is modulated by IL-1R and Pseudomonas aeruginosa challenge but is insufficient for inhibiting bacterial binding."
https://openalex.org/W2589593511,"Atherosclerosis is widely accepted to be a chronic inflammatory disease, and the immunological response to the accumulation of LDL is believed to play a critical role in the development of this disease. 1,4-Dihydropyridine-type MAA-adducted LDL has been implicated in atherosclerosis. Here, we have demonstrated that pure MAA-modified residues can be chemically conjugated to large proteins without by-product contamination. Using this pure antigen, we established a purified MAA-ELISA, with which a marked increase in anti-MAA antibody titer was determined at a very early stage of atherosclerosis in 3-month ApoE-/- mice fed with a normal diet. Our methods of Ne-MAA-L-lysine purification and purified antigen-based ELISA will be easily applicable for biomarker-based detection of early stage atherosclerosis in patients, as well as for the development of an adduct-specific Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry-based quantification of physiological and pathological levels of MAA."
https://openalex.org/W2590194521,"Objectives To analyze the factors associated with the occurrence of pregnancies after the diagnosis of infection by HIV. Methods Cross-sectional study with women of a reproductive age living with HIV/AIDS cared for in the public services of the city of Porto Alegre, in southern Brazil. The data was analyzed from a comparison between two groups: women with and women without pregnancies after the diagnosis of HIV. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the reasons of prevalence (RP). Results The occurrence of pregnancies after the diagnosis of HIV is associated with a lower level of education (RP adjusted = 1.31; IC95%: 1.03–1.66), non-use of condoms in the first sexual intercourse (RP = 1.32; IC95%: 1.02–1.70), being 20 years old or less when diagnosed with HIV (RP = 3.48; IC95%: 2.02–6.01), and experience of violence related to the diagnosis of HIV (RP = 1.28; IC95%: 1.06–1.56). Conclusions The occurrence of pregnancies after the diagnosis of infection by HIV does not indicate the exercise of the reproductive rights of the women living with HIV/AIDS because these pregnancies occurred in contexts of great vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W2591198616,"Attention capture by potentially relevant environmental stimuli is critical for human survival, yet it varies considerably among individuals. A large series of studies has suggested that attention capture may depend on the cognitive balance between maintenance and manipulation of mental representations and the flexible switch between goal-directed representations and potentially relevant stimuli outside the focus of attention; a balance that seems modulated by a prefrontostriatal dopamine pathway. Here, we examined inter-individual differences in the cognitive control of attention through studying the effects of two single nucleotide polymorphisms regulating dopamine at the prefrontal cortex and the striatum (i.e., COMTMet108/158Val and ANKK1/DRD2TaqIA) on stimulus-driven attention capture. Healthy adult participants (N = 40) were assigned to different groups according to the combination of the polymorphisms COMTMet108/158Val and ANKK1/DRD2TaqIA, and were instructed to perform on a well-established distraction protocol. Performance in individuals with a balance between prefrontal dopamine display and striatal receptor density was slowed down by the occurrence of unexpected distracting events, while those with a rather unbalanced dopamine activity were able maintain task performance with no time delay, yet at the expense of a slightly lower accuracy. This advantage, associated to their distinct genetic profiles, was paralleled by an electrophysiological mechanism of phase-resetting of gamma neural oscillation to the novel, distracting events. Taken together, the current results suggest that the epistatic interaction between COMTVal108/158Met and ANKK1/DRD2 TaqIa genetic polymorphisms lies at the basis of stimulus-driven attention capture."
https://openalex.org/W2589659229,"Advances in the field of closed-loop neuromodulation call for analysis and modeling approaches capable of confronting challenges related to the complex neuronal response to stimulation and the presence of strong internal and measurement noise in neural recordings. Here we elaborate on the algorithmic aspects of a noise-resistant closed-loop subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation system for advanced Parkinson's disease and treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, ensuring remarkable performance in terms of both efficiency and selectivity of stimulation, as well as in terms of computational speed. First, we propose an efficient method drawn from dynamical systems theory, for the reliable assessment of significant nonlinear coupling between beta and high-frequency subthalamic neuronal activity, as a biomarker for feedback control. Further, we present a model-based strategy through which optimal parameters of stimulation for minimum energy desynchronizing control of neuronal activity are being identified. The strategy integrates stochastic modeling and derivative-free optimization of neural dynamics based on quadratic modeling. On the basis of numerical simulations, we demonstrate the potential of the presented modeling approach to identify, at a relatively low computational cost, stimulation settings potentially associated with a significantly higher degree of efficiency and selectivity compared with stimulation settings determined post-operatively. Our data reinforce the hypothesis that model-based control strategies are crucial for the design of novel stimulation protocols at the backstage of clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2591558403,"Background It is unclear how high-protein (HP) and high-monounsaturated fat (HMF) meals affect postprandial blood lipids and lipoprotein particle numbers (LPN). Purpose To compare a HP versus a HMF meal on postprandial lipid and LPN responses. Methods Twenty-four participants (age: 36.3±15.0 years; body mass index: 23.6±2.0 kg/m2; 45.8% female) were fed a HP (31.9% energy from protein) and a HMF (35.2% fat and 20.7% monounsaturated fat) meal in a randomized cross-over trial design. Energy and carbohydrate content were the same across meals. Blood samples were drawn in the fasting state and 3 hour postprandial state, and assessed for lipids and LPN. Results Repeated measures analysis showed a significant (p<0.05) treatment by time interaction effect for triglycerides (TG), the primary variable, total high-density lipoprotein particles (T-HDLP) and T-HDLP minus large-buoyant high-density lipoprotein 2b (T-HDLP—LB-HDL2b). HP versus HMF condition led to significantly lower TG at 120 (geometric mean: 90.1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 76.4–106.3) vs. 146.5 (124.2–172.9) mg/dL) and 180 (101.4 (83.1–123.8) vs. 148.7 (121.9–181.4) mg/dL) min and higher T-HDLP at 120 (mean difference: 297.3 (95% CI: 48.6–545.9) nmol/L) and 180 (291.6 (15.8–567.5) nmol/L) min. The difference in T-HDLP by condition was due to the significantly higher small-dense HDLP (T-HDLP—LB-HDL2b) during HP versus HMF condition at 120 (mean difference: 452.6 (95% CI: 177.4–727.9) nmol/L) and 180 (496.8 (263.1–730.6) nmol/L) min. Area under the curve analysis showed that HP versus HMF condition led to significantly lower TG, non-HDLP, and very-low-density lipoprotein particles (VLDLP) responses but significantly less favorable responses in LB-HDL2b particles, T-HDLP—LB-HDL2b, and LB-HDL2b/T-HDLP ratio. Conclusion The HP meal led to lower TG, non-HDLP, and VLDLP but less favorable LB-HDL2b, small-dense HDLP, and LB-HDL2b/T-HDLP ratio responses versus a HMF meal. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings over multiple meals."
https://openalex.org/W2590365771,"Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) present with comorbid complications with implications for healthcare utilization. To date, little is known about the effects of GERD treatment with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) on patients’ subsequent healthcare utilization for acute respiratory infections (ARIs). This population-based study compared ARI episodes captured through outpatient visits, one year before and one year after GERD patients received PPI treatment. We used retrospective data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 in Taiwan, comparing 21,486 patients diagnosed with GERD from 2010 to 2012 with 21,486 age-sex matched comparison patients without GERD. Annual ARI episodes represented by ambulatory care visits for ARI (visits during a 7-day period bundled into one episode), were compared between the patient groups during the 1-year period before and after the index date (date of GERD diagnosis for study patients, first ambulatory visit in the same year for their matched comparison counterpart). Multiple regression analysis using a difference-in-difference approach was performed to estimate the adjusted association between GERD treatment and the subsequent annual ARI rate. We found that the mean annual ARI episode rate among GERD patients reduced by 11.4%, from 4.39 before PPI treatment, to 3.89 following treatment (mean change = -0.5 visit, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (-0.64, -0.36)). In Poisson regression analysis, GERD treatment showed an independent association with the annual ARI rate, showing a negative estimate (with p<0.001). The study suggests that GERD treatment with PPIs may help reduce healthcare visits for ARIs, highlighting the importance of treatment-seeking by GERD patients and compliance with treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2591311401,"Focal adhesion kinase is an essential nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that plays an important role in development, in homeostasis and in the progression of human disease. Multiple stimuli activate FAK, which requires a change in structure from an autoinhibited to activated conformation. In the autoinhibited conformation the FERM domain associates with the catalytic domain of FAK and PI(4,5)P2 binding to the FERM domain plays a role in the release of autoinhibition, activating the enzyme. An in silico model of FAK/PI(4,5)P2 interaction suggests that residues on the catalytic domain interact with PI(4,5)P2, in addition to the known FERM domain PI(4,5)P2 binding site. This study was undertaken to test the significance of this in silico observation. Mutations designed to disrupt the putative PI(4,5)P2 binding site were engineered into FAK. These mutants exhibited defects in phosphorylation and failed to completely rescue the phenotype associated with fak -/- phenotype fibroblasts demonstrating the importance of these residues in FAK function. The catalytic domain of FAK exhibited PI(4,5)P2 binding in vitro and binding activity was lost upon mutation of putative PI(4,5)P2 binding site basic residues. However, binding was not selective for PI(4,5)P2, and the catalytic domain bound to several phosphatidylinositol phosphorylation variants. The mutant exhibiting the most severe biological defect was defective for phosphatidylinositol phosphate binding, supporting the model that catalytic domain phospholipid binding is important for biochemical and biological function."
https://openalex.org/W2590701925,"Our central hypothesis is that protection against HIV infection will be powerfully influenced by the magnitude and quality of the B cell response. Although sterilizing immunity, mediated by pre-formed abundant and potent antibodies is the ultimate goal for B cell-targeted HIV vaccine strategies, scenarios that fall short of this may still confer beneficial defenses against viremia and disease progression. We evaluated the impact of sub-sterilizing pre-existing neutralizing antibody on the B cell response to SHIV infection. Adult male rhesus macaques received passive transfer of a sub-sterilizing amount of polyclonal neutralizing immunoglobulin (Ig) purified from previously infected animals (SHIVIG) or control Ig prior to intra-rectal challenge with SHIVSF162P4 and extensive longitudinal sampling was performed. SHIVIG treated animals exhibited significantly reduced viral load and increased de novo Env-specific plasma antibody. Dysregulation of the B cell profile was grossly apparent soon after infection in untreated animals; exemplified by a ≈50% decrease in total B cells in the blood evident 2-3 weeks post-infection which was not apparent in SHIVIG treated animals. IgD+CD5+CD21+ B cells phenotypically similar to marginal zone-like B cells were highly sensitive to SHIV infection, becoming significantly decreased as early as 3 days post-infection in control animals, while being maintained in SHIVIG treated animals, and were highly correlated with the induction of Env-specific plasma antibody. These results suggest that B cell dysregulation during the early stages of infection likely contributes to suboptimal Env-specific B cell and antibody responses, and strategies that limit this dysregulation may enhance the host's ability to eliminate HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2589612637,"This paper proposes a new design strategy for optimizing MRI pulse sequences for T1 relaxometry. The design strategy optimizes the pulse sequence parameters to minimize the maximum variance of unbiased T1 estimates over a range of T1 values using the Cramér-Rao bound. In contrast to prior sequences optimized for a single nominal T1 value, the optimized sequence using our bound-based strategy achieves improved precision and accuracy for a broad range of T1 estimates within a clinically feasible scan time. The optimization combines the downhill simplex method with a simulated annealing process. To show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we optimize the tissue specific imaging (TSI) sequence. Preliminary Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the optimized TSI sequence yields improved precision and accuracy over the popular driven-equilibrium single-pulse observation of T1 (DESPOT1) approach for normal brain tissues (estimated T1 700-2000 ms at 3.0T). The relative mean estimation error (MSE) for T1 estimation is less than 1.7% using the optimized TSI sequence, as opposed to less than 7.0% using DESPOT1 for normal brain tissues. The optimized TSI sequence achieves good stability by keeping the MSE under 7.0% over larger T1 values corresponding to different lesion tissues and the cerebrospinal fluid (up to 5000 ms). The T1 estimation accuracy using the new pulse sequence also shows improvement, which is more pronounced in low SNR scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2591160292,"Autoantibodies can be either harmful or beneficial to the body. The beneficial autoantibodies play important roles in immunosurveillance, clearance of body waste and maintenance of immune homeostasis. Despite their importance, however, people's knowledge on the protective autoantibodies is still very limited. In the current study, we examined two autoantibodies that recognized epitopes with only one amino acid. One was against mono-methylated lysine (Kme) and the other was against tri-methylated lysine (Kme3). We found that the antibodies were highly specific and not polyreactive. They did not cross-react each other. Although anti-Kme antibodies were IgM only, a large proportion of the anti-Kme3 antibodies were switched to the IgG isotype. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that both of the antibodies were mainly derived from IGHV 3-7 and/or IGHV3-74 germ line genes with conserved CDR2. De novo sequencing showed that there was a mutation at either of the SS positions on the CDR1 region, which changed one of the serine residues to a basic amino acid, i.e., arginine or lysine. We also found that neither of the antibodies was expressed at birth, and their earliest appearance was approximately 5 months after birth. All healthy human beings expressed the antibodies when they reached age two and maintained the expression thereafter throughout their life. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus had lower levels of the IgM isotype antibodies. Serum levels of the two IgM antibodies were closely correlated, implying that they were produced by cells from the same B cell subset. We also found that both anti-Kme and anti-Kme3 antibodies could bind and might take part in the clearance of neutrophil extracellular traps released from activated cells. In conclusion, although anti-Kme and anti-Kme3 antibodies share many similarities in their origins, they are different antibodies and have different characteristics."
