https://openalex.org/W2244390199,"We have employed cesium sulfate density gradient analysis to monitor the incorporation of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) into L1210 cellular nucleic acid. This methodology permits a distinct separation of RNA and DNA under nondegrading conditions. The results demonstrate specific incorporation of ara-C into DNA with less than 1% of total incorporation into nucleic acid being detectable in RNA. Moreover, we have found a highly significant relationship (p < 0.0001) between the incorporation of ara-C into DNA with the loss of clonogenic survival. This relationship had not been established due to the previous use of alkaline conditions that degrade (ara-C) DNA. Our results suggest that the incorporation of ara-C into DNA is one mechanism responsible for producing lethal cellular events."

https://openalex.org/W1566063705,"Electrode measurements were made of the free Ca2+ concentration maintained by suspensions of isolated rat liver mitochondria and microsomes, as well as by hepatocytes whose plasma membranes had been made permeable by treatment with digitonin. When the KCl, ATP, Mg2+, and phosphate concentrations were made similar to that of cytosol, the steady state free Ca2+ concentration in the presence of respiring mitochondria alone was about 0.5 microM. The additional presence of rat liver microsomes resulted in a steady state level of close to 0.2 microM, which was maintaied for greater than 1 h at 25 degrees C. This concentration of Ca2+ was also maintained by suspensions of hepatocytes permeabilized by digitonin and thus may approximate the actual cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in vivo. The set point for free Ca2+ homeostasis in these systems is determined by mitochondrial Ca2+ influx-efflux cycling, which is dependent on the level of intramitochondrial Ca2+ and can be adjusted by sequestration of Ca2+ in microsomes."

https://openalex.org/W1563919959,"Freshly prepared rat testicular membranes bind iodinated rat high density lipoprotein (HDL) with high affinity (Kd = 32 microgram of HDL protein/ml). This high density lipoprotein binding differs from low density lipoprotein binding by cultured human fibroblast cells in two ways; it is not affected by Ca2+ or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and it is not sensitive to pronase and trypsin. Testicular binding activity is primarily found in interstitial tissue containing Leydig cells and can be modulated by human chorionic gonadotropin administration in vivo (2-fold increase of binding capacity, with no affinity change) with 250 units/kg of human chorionic gonadotropin injection daily for 4 days. The interstitial high density lipoprotein binding site also recognizes rat very low density lipoprotein, but not rat low density lipoprotein, as shown by displacement experiments. When membrane preparations of various other tissues were assessed for their high density lipoprotein binding, we found that the adrenal density lipoprotein binding, we found that the adrenal gland binds rat high density lipoprotein with similar affinity and capacity, while spleen, kidney, and heart showed no high affinity binding. In addition, when iodinated rat low density lipoprotein was tested for its ability to bind to testicular membranes, no high affinity saturable binding was observed. We conclude that there are specific high density lipoprotein-binding sites present in steroidogenic tissues; these binding sites are not found in the nonsteroidogenic tissues tested. Furthermore, no high affinity low density lipoprotein-binding sites can be demonstrated in the testis; thus it appears that high density lipoprotein, rather than low density lipoprotein, is the major cholesterol-carrying lipoprotein recognized by the rat testis."

https://openalex.org/W2097093641,"Adult rat parenchymal liver cells were isolated and cultured in monolayers. Cholesterol esterification in the intact cultured cells was determined by measuring incorporation of tritiated oleic acid into cell cholesterol ester. Addition of 10 microgram/ml of 25-hydroxycholesterol to the medium gave a 3- to 6-fold increase in cholesterol esterification, while the incorporation of oleic acid into phospholipids and triglycerides remained unaltered. Similar stimulation of cholesterol esterification by 25-hydroxycholesterol was also found if [14C]mevalonolactone or [3H]cholesterol (the latter presented to the cells in high density lipoproteins) were used as precursors. The stimulatory effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol was maximal after only 15-min incubation and was independent of protein synthesis. After 4 to 6 h of incubation with 25-hydroxycholesterol, its stimulatory effect was reduced significantly, and after 18 h of incubation no stimulation was observed. Thus, the liver cells in some fashion adapt to the continuing presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol. Isolated microsomes prepared from cells previously incubated with 25-hydroxycholesterol showed acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity 3 times that of microsomes from control cells. Incubation of isolated microsomes with 25-hydroxycholesterol increased acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity 2-fold. The net cellular content of ester cholesterol increased after 2 to 6 h incubation of hepatocytes with 25-hydroxycholesterol; there was a net decrease in cellular free cholesterol. Mevalonolactone (10 mM) also stimulated cholesterol esterification and inreased the cellular content of ester cholesterol (3- to 4-fold). The effectiveness of mevalonolactone did not diminish with longer periods of preincubation. Furthermore, the stimulatory effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonolactone added together were at least 50 to 100% greater than the effects of either agent alone, suggesting that the mechanisms by which they increase cellular cholesterol esterification are different. Both 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonolactone rapidly inhibited microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity. Pure cholesterol had no effect on cellular cholesterol esterification or on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity at concentrations up to 10 microgram/ml."
https://openalex.org/W1589190814,"We have utilized sodium butyrate to inhibit histone deacetylases in order to study the rates of histone acetylation in hepatoma tissue culture cells. In this manner, we have been able to observe two rates of hypermodification of acetylated core histone. By selectively radolabeling acetylated histone fractions based upon differences in their acetate exchange rates, we have identified the rate of histone acetate hydrolysis and the rate of hyperacetylation in 50 mM sodium butyrate for two distinct populations of acetylated histone. One population, comprising no more than 15% of each of the non-H1 histones, is characterized by rapid hyperacetylation (t 1/2 congruent to 7 min for monoacetylated H4) and the rapid (t 1/2 congruent to 3 to 7 min) removal of this modification. A second population is deacetylated with t 1/2 congruent to 30 min and is hypermodified much less vigorously in 50 mM sodium butyrate (t 1/2 congruent 200 to 300 min for monoacetylated H4). Unlike the rapidly metabolized group, the fraction of total histone in this slow population varies between the four core histones. In addition, there appears to be no interconversion of histone between these populations."
https://openalex.org/W1605363717,"Rat hepatocytes were isolated by perfusion with a Ca2+ free solution, followed by a buffer containing Ca2+ and collagenase. They specifically and avidly bind 125I-asialo-orosomucoid. At 4 degrees C, cells in minimal essential medium, incubated in the presence of saturating concentrations of 125I-asialo-orosomucoid, bound 500,000 molecules/cell. Addition of 10% horse serum to the binding reaction reduced the number bound to 200,000. Prewashing of the cells in 1% bovine serum albumin reduced the number of bound molecules by 60%. In all cases, the Kd value was approximately 7 x 10(-9) M. At 37 degrees C, the rate of uptake of 125I-asialo-orosomucoid (approximately 0.1 pmol/min/10(6) cells) is proportionately reduced by the presence of serum or albumin preparatons. Thus, it appears that the absolute number of asialoglycoprotein receptors on the surface of rat hepatocytes is not readily determined in the presence of serum or albumin and is about 500,000/cell."
https://openalex.org/W1523351973,"We have measured the diffusion coefficient and weight average molecular weight of type I collagen fibril fragments obtained by acid extraction of rat tail tendons and neutral extraction of lathyritic chick skin, using laser light scatttering techniques. The molecular weight and translational diffusion coefficient were found to be 8.05 +/- 0.40 x 10(5) and 0.450 +/- 0.04 x 10 (-7) cm2/s, respectively, for preparations which contain aggregates in 0.01 M HCl, and 2.82 +/- 0.20 x 10 (5) and 0.780 +/- 0.04 x 10 (-7) cm(2)/s for collagen single molecules. Using these data, as well as the theoretical diffusion coefficient for a single collagen molecule, models for various staggering modes and aggregate mixtures were developed in an attempt to understand the structure of the fibril components present in solution. It was found that several models with 1 to 4 D (D = 67 nm) staggers fit the experimental data for the aggregated preparations. Analysis of the end-to-end distance of negatively stained segment long spacing crystallites prepared from solutions containing fibril fragments and the banding pattern of positively stained segment long spacing crystallites suggest that collagen solutions contain linear aggregates with 4 D and possibly 4.4 D staggers in agreement with light scattering data. Thermal denaturation studies demonstrate that the apparent melting point of cross-linked linear aggregates, 33.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C, is identical with that of single molecules at pH 2.0. We conclude that a linear filament with predominant 4 D stagger is a basic unit of type I collagen fibrillar structure."

https://openalex.org/W1496082885,"Three membrane properties were strikingly affected when the cholesterol of human erythrocytes, normally approximately 0.8 mol/mol of phospholipid (i.e. C/P approximately 0.8), was altered by equilibration with phospholipid dispersions of an appropriate cholesterol content. 1) While the sterol in intact red cell membranes of C/P less than or equal to 0.8 was resistant to cholesterol oxidase digestion, enrichment to C/P greater than or equal to 0.9 rendered the entire cholesterol pool sensitive to enzyme attack. Susceptibility to oxidation was reversed by removal of the excess cholesterol. Treatment of cells with 1 X 10(-4) M chlorpromazine also rendered the entire cholesterol pool susceptible to cholesterol oxidase. 2) Whereas ghosts with C/P less than or equal to 0.8 underwent invagination in low ionic strength, alkaline buffers to form inside-out vesicles, enrichment to C/P greater than or equal to 1.0 promoted right-side-out vesicle formation instead. This effect was mimicked by treatment with 2,4-dinitrophenol, an amphipath known to cause eversion of the membrane of red cells. In contrast, the presence of chlorpromazine, which promotes invagination of the intact red cell membrane, favored the formation of inside-out vesicles in ghosts. 3) The breakdown of ghosts into endocytic vesicles in dilute, alkaline media and the concomitant release and dissolution of the submembrane reticulum of spectrin and actin were retarded by excess cholesterol and promoted by its removal. This cholesterol effect was mimicked by exposing ghosts to chlorpromazine, but not dinitrophenol. Our data suggest that cholesterol may act physiologically both to stabilize the red cell membrane and to constrain its contour against invagination, and that red cell membrane cholesterol is maintained in vivo just below a critical level at which important organizational changes can occur."
https://openalex.org/W1516829464,"Pig heart DPN-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is heterogeneous on isoelectric focusing in 6 M urea. Under these conditions, three types of subunits (termed alpha, beta, and gamma), which have isoelectric points of about 5.7, 6.6, and 7.2, respectively, can be separated. On the basis of densitometric scans of analytical isoelectric focused gels stained with Coomassie blue, it is estiated that the subunits are present in the whole enzyme in the approximate ratio of 2 alpha:1 beta: 1 gamma. The three isolated subunits have distinct amino acid compositions and the amino acid composition of the total enzyme, when expressed as residues per average polypeptide chain of 40,000 daltons, is consistent with contributions of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits in the ratio of 2:1:1. Each isolated subunit yields a readly distinguishable tryptic peptide map which is much simpler than that of the total enzyme, and is consistent with the number of peptides expected from the lysyl plus arginyl residues for the subunit. The alpha and beta chains both have alanine as the NH2-terminal amino acid, whereas phenylalanine is the NH2-terminal residue of the gamma subunit. Since the alpha subunit exhibits a molecular weight of 39,000 and the beta and gamma subunits have indistinguishable molecular weights of 41,000, the two-band pattern observed on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate is understandable. These results suggest that a complete DPN-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase would have a minimum molecular weight of 160,000."
https://openalex.org/W1522065257,"There is in normal plasma an enzyme activity which converts labeled lysolecithin to lecithin by an energy-independent low density lipoprotein-activated pathway. Studies were undertaken to compare the identity of this enzyme with lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. During purification of the enzyme by ultracentrifugation and by chromatography on high density lipoprotein affinity column, DEAE-Sepharose column, and hydroxylapatite column, both the lysolecithin acyltransferase activity and the lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase activity were found in the same fractions and were enriched to the same extent at each step. The final purified preparation which had 16,000- to 24,000-fold higher specific activities than starting plasma gave a single protein band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and this single band contained both the activities. Also, the effects of pH, heat, and chemical inhibitors on the enzyme activities were similar. Plasma from patients with familial lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency also lacked lysolecithin acyltransferase activity. These results indicate that a single enzyme carries out both lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase and lysolecithin acyltransferase activities. The purified enzyme required apolipoprotein A-I for lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity, but required low density lipoprotein for lysolecithin acyltransferase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1519710405,"The (+)- and (-)-enantiomers of benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-oxide are hydrated stereospecifically at C-8 to (-)- and (+)-trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene, respectively, by rat hepatic epoxide hydrolase. The (-)-enantiomer of benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-oxide is metabolized by microsomal epoxide hydrolase at a rate 3- to 4-fold greater than the (+)-enantiomer. At low conversion of racemic substrate, however, benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-oxide is metabolized to the dihydrodiol at a rate equal to that of the (+)-enantiomer. An analysis of the enantiomeric composition of the dihydrodiol formed from the racemic substrate revealed preferential formation of (-)-trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo-[a]pyrene. At low substrate conversion ( 50% metabolism). Similar results were obtained with microsomes from hamster, rabbit, guinea pig, mouse, and human liver. These results indicate that epoxide hydrolase has a higher affinity for (+)-benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-oxide than for the (-)-enantiomer. The kinetics of hydration of (+)- and (-)-benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-oxide by purified epoxide hydrolase in detergent solution showed the (+)- and (-)-enantiomers to have apparent Km values of 1.7 and greater than or equal to 20 microM, respectively. Tumorigenicity studies with benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-oxide on mouse skin and in newborn mice revealed that (+)-benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-oxide, the metabolic precursor of the more tumorigenic (-)-7,8-dihydrodiol, is significantly more tumorigenic than the (-)-enantiomer. However, racemic benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-oxide was more tumorigenic than either enantiomer alone, indicating an enantiomeric synergism in the carcinogenicity of benzo[a]pyrene 7,8-oxide. The data are discussed in relation to the complete sequence of metabolic pathways leading to an ultimate carcinogen from benzo[a]pyrene."
https://openalex.org/W1502032886,"The anti-T lectin from peanuts was purified on a new affinity matrix, and the number of carbohydrate binding sites was determined by equilibrium dialysis with [14C]lactose to be four per tetramer. Methyl-alpha- and methyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside and lactose were found to perturb the UV spectrum of the lectin in the aromatic region and their association constants were determined by UV difference spectroscopy to be 1.8, 1.0, and 1.3 X 10(3) M-1, respectively, at 25 degrees C. Thermodynamic parameters were also obtained for the two galactosides from measurements at several temperatures. For the alpha anomer, delta H degrees = -42 kJ mol-1 and delta S degrees = -78 J K-1 mol-1; for the beta anomer, delta H degrees = -43 kJ mol-1, and delta S degrees = -86 J K-1 mol-1. Analysis of the lectin for metal atoms disclosed 0.98 mol of Ca2+ and 0.78 mol of Mg2+ subunit, while manganese was present in trace amounts only. The results of the present study indicate that recent improvements in instrumentation should make UV difference spectroscopy more widely applicable to studies of protein-ligand interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1504875254,"Calcium ions are postulated to be involved in the process of meiotic maturation of amphibian oocytes. Since several of the calcium effects in eukaryotic cells are mediated by calmodulin, the present study was undertaken to assess the presence and level of calmodulin in Xenopus laevis oocytes before and after progesterone treatment. Calmodulin was shown to be present at a concentration of approximately microM in control oocytes cytosol. This level remained stable for 2 h when the maturation promoting factor appeared, and increased to approximately 44 to 59 microM at the time of the germinal vesicle breakdown. Maturation is therefore associated with calmodulin synthesis. Xenopus calmodulin was isolated from oocyte cytosol after heat treatment, anion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration, with a yield of approximately 23%. When compared to mammalian calmodulins, the amphibian protein exhibited the same ultraviolet absorption spectrum, a similar amino acid composition with 1 residue of trimethyllsine, and the same shape conformers in the absence or presence of divalent metals, as shown by different mobilities upon dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein migrated faster in the presence than in the absence of Ca2+ ions, Mn2+ and Mg2+ being less effective. It was able to activate calmodulin-deficient myosin light chain kinase. Its high serine content and the tryptic peptide maps obtained after high performance liquid chromatography point, however, to minor differences in the primary structures of mammalian and amphibian calmodulins."

https://openalex.org/W1483628018,"In the presence of iodide and hydrogen peroxide, lactoperoxidase, an enzyme model for thyroid peroxidase, catalyzed the conversion of arachidonic acid into several iodinated products. The major product was identified as 6-iodo-5-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid, delta-lactone (iodolactone), on the basis of 125I incorporation, mass spectrometry, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and chemical modifications. Using this compound as a standard, two methods were developed to establish and quantitate the production of iodolactone by the rat thyroid in vitro: 125I labeling followed by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Addition of iodide and arachidonic acid to rat thyroid lobes resulted in the formation and release of the iodolactone, which was inhibited by methimazole. These data suggest that peroxidases capable of oxidizing halides could provide a new pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, besides cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases."
https://openalex.org/W1493376038,"To examine whether hepatic plasma membrane receptors for asialoglycoproteins are replaced or reutilized during endocytosis, receptors on the surface of isolated hepatocytes were uniquely labeled by neuraminidase treatment. This enzyme abolishes binding of asialo-orosomucoid, a galactose-terminated glycoprotein, and restricts the ligand specificity of the cell surface receptor protein to N-acetylgalactosamine-terminated glycoproteins such as desialylated ovine submaxillary mucin. Although a much larger intracellular pool of apparently identical receptor protein is unaffected by neuraminidase, endocytosis of asialo-orosomucoid does not occur in neuraminidase-treated cells, while endocytosis of desialylated ovine submaxillary mucin is unaffected. Endocytosis of desialylated ovine submaxillary mucin, in amounts far exceeding cell surface binding capacity, is not a consequence of replacement of neuraminidase-treated surface receptor by intracellular receptor. Binding and endocytosis of asialoglycoproteins appear, therefore, to be maintained through a continuous reutilization of plasma membrane receptors rather than through their replacement from an intracellular receptor pool."

https://openalex.org/W1585392764,"The nucleotide sequence of a spinach chloroplast threonine tRNA has been determined. This chloroplast threonine tRNA has been determined. This chloroplast threonine tRNA has 75 nucleotides, which is the same chain length as the recently determined threonine tRNA from yeast mitochondria. This contrasts with the 6 non-organelle threonine tRNAs sequenced to date, which are 76 nucleotides in length. However, other than this similarity in size, the chloropast tRNAThr has little similarlity to the yeast mitochondrial threonine tRNA, and shows essentially equal homology to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic feature of sequence homology to other threonine tRNAs, there is a 19-nucleotide segment encompassing the entire T psi C stem and loop region, that, except for post-transcriptional modifications, is identical in this spinach chloroplast tRNAThr and in yeast cytoplasmic tRNAThr1A. A most unusual feature of this spinach chloroplast tRNAThr is that it has an A residue at the 5'-end of the anticodon loop, a site that is occupied by a pyrimidine in all other tRNAs sequenced to date. Other than this feature, the tRNAThr contains all of the invariant and semi-invariant residues normally found in tRNAs. This tRNA hybridizes to spinach chloroplast DNA, but does not hybridize to the same region of the spinach chloroplast genome that contains the genes for spinach chloroplast tRNA1Thr or tRNA2Thr. This tRNA therefore appears to be a third isoaccepting species of threonine tRNA encoded by spinach chloroplast DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1592984100,"Reduction of the oxidized FAD at the active site of porcine liver fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase by butyryl-CoA results in bleaching of 30 to 60% of the 450 nm absorbance of flavin and in the production of a new absorbance band at 565 nm. The wavelength of the maximum absorbance of this new band (lambda max) is dependent on the chemical nature of the substrate, e.g. this band occurs at 645 nm when beta-2-furylpropionyl-CoA (a pseudosubstrate) reacts with enzyme. Since lambda max for this band is substrate-dependent, the band is most likely the result of charge transfer complex formation between oxidized fatty acyl-CoA, and the reduced flavin of the enzyme. The rate profile for the reaction of butyryl-CoA and enzyme is biphasic at 450 nm but consists of a single exponential process at 565 nm. The rate constant for reaction at 565 nm is approximately 12 s-1 ((butyryl-CoA) = 2.5 x 10(-5) M, pH 8.6), and the 450 nm rate profile can be fit to a rate equation for two sequential reactions of rate constant 12 s-1 and 3.4 s-1, the amount of flavin reduction in each kinetic step being approximately 50%. The deuterium isotope effect measured on each step of the biphasic time course of the 450 nm reaction is very large, in the range kH/kD = 30 to 50. The rate profile at 565 nm for perdeuterobutyryl-CoA is markedly different than that for the protiobutyryl-CoA in that it is biphasic. It appears that two rate processes have been separated by virtue of different isotope effects; the first process shows kH/kD = 2 while the second shows kH/kD = 50. The data are interpreted in terms of a mechanism involving an obligatory charge transfer complex."
https://openalex.org/W1603867769,"Ellman's reagent was used to investigate the status and exposure of the cysteinyl residues in lipophilin, a proteolipid apoprotein from human myelin. The hydrolyzed protein contained 3.5 to 4.5 cysteines per molecule, which increased to 11 after complete reduction. The native protein was thought to contain three disulfide bonds and five free sulfhydryl groups, which undergo partial oxidation during purification. Exposure of -SH groups in the aqueous protein was minimal, even in the presence of 6 M guanidinium chloride, suggesting a location in hydrophobic domains not disrupted by this reagent. In the helicogenic solvent 2-chloroethanol, the full complement of -SH groups could not be revealed, even with the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate; a difference of two sulfhydryls between intact and hydrolyzed protein was consistently observed. Similar sulfhydryl reactivity toward iodoacetamide was also established in this solvent. Sulfhydryl assays on whole myelin in 2-chloroethanol indicated that the occurrence of -SH groups in the proteolipid component was at least as high as in the purified apoprotein. Lipophilin was reduced and alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine at 10 of its cysteinyl residues. The modified protein adopted a beta structure under conditions where lipophilin is normally highly alpha-helical, and was also less helical than usual in 2-chloroethanol; however, it was still abnormally resistant to denaturation by guanidinium chloride. Modified lipophilin contained as many ester groups as the intact protein; thus, it appeared unlikely that the long chain fatty acids associated with the protein were attached to cysteine residues."

The reaction was shown to be a direct hydride transfer process. Using stereospecifically 3H-labeled substrates, the steric course of this process was established to be S-specific with respect to the nicotinamide nucleotide. The 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin-dependent NADP+ reductase from M. vannielii and the hydrogenase system in the cell-free extracts of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum recognize the same side, designated as A side, with respect to the prochiral center at C-5 of the dihydro-8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin cofactor."

https://openalex.org/W1511010929,"Allophycocyanin from Nostoc sp. phycobilisomes was separated into four spectrally distinct components designated allophycocyanin I, B, II, and III by adsorption chromatography on brushite columns. Allophycocyanins I and B had red-shifted fluorescence emission maxima, and on this basis, may function in transfer of excitation energy from phycobilisomes to chlorophyll a. Allophycyanins II and III, which together comprise 70% of the total allophycocyanin, have absorption maxima at 648 nm and 650 nm, respectively, and probably transfer excitation energy from phycocyanin to allophycocyanins I and B, in addition to serving a structural function. Allophycocyanin I was resolved into alpha, beta, and gamma subunits with apparent molecular weights of 18,000, 17,000, and 35,000, respectively, whereas allophycocyanin B was resolved into two subunits with apparent molecular weights of 16,100 and 15,300, using a modified Weber and Osborn gel electrophoresis system (Brown, A. S., and Troxler, R. F. (1977) Biochem. J. 163, 571-581). In the same gel system, allophycocyanins II and III were each resolved into alpha and beta subunits with apparent molecular weights of 18,000 and 17,000, respectively. The subunits of allophycocyanins I, II, and III were isolated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography and the amino acid compositions determined. Automated sequence analysis demonstrated that the first 30 amino acids at the NH2 terminus of alpha subunits, and the beta subunits, of allophycocyanins I to III were identical. alpha Subunits: Ser-Ile-Val-Thr-Lys-Ser-Ile-Val-Asn-Ala-Asp-Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Leu-Ser-Pro-Gly -Glu-Leu-Asp-Arg-Ile-Lys-Ser-Phe-Val-Thr- beta Subunits: Ala-Gln-Asp-Ala-Ile-Thr-Ala-Val-Ile-Asn-Ala-Ala-Asp-Val-Gln-Gly-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ala-Thr-Ala-Leu-Ser-Lys-Leu-Lys-Ala-Tyr- The gamma subunit of allophycocyanin I and both subunits of allophycocyanin B appeared to be blocked at the NH2 terminus, suggesting that the allophycocyanin B subunits may be different gene products than those of allophycocyanins I to III, or if the same, the subunits of allophycocyanin B undergo proteolytic modification after initial synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1505351188,"Hb Suresnes is a human hemoglobin variant in which histidine replaces arginine at the COOH terminus of the alpha chains. The COOH-terminal arginines of the alpha chains play a major role in normal human hemoglobin (HbA), both by electrostatic interactions which constrain deoxygenated hemoglobin in a low affinity quaternary conformation and by involvement in oxygen-linked anion binding knoiwn to give rise to a large part of the alkaline Bohr effect. An x-ray crystallographic analysis of deoxyHb Suresnes reveals the loss of the normal intersubunit salt bridge to lysine 127 alpha and a decrease in the occupancy of inorganic anions at the alpha chain aniom-binding site. Relative to normal HbA, Hb Suresnes has a high affinity for oxygen, a reduced cooperativity in oxygen biding, and greatly reduced pH and chloride sensitivity. similar changes are found in carboxypeptidase B-digested hemoglobin Ao where the COOH-terminal arginine is removed by enzymatic digestion. Both equilibrium and kinetic manifestations of the destabilization of the normal low affinity configuration are observed. Inositol hexaphosphate restores cooperativity and pH sensitivity but, even in the presence of this strong allosteric effector, the low and high affinity conformations of Hb Suresnes appear to differ from those of HbA. In both the unliganded and liganded states, apreciable subunit dissociation of Hb Suresnes is apparent, which suggests that the substitution disrupts bonds which normally stabilize the tetramer. Structural changes at both the quaternary and tertiary level appear to contribute to alterations in the high and low affinity conformations of ths abnormal hemoglobin. Hb Suresnes thus illustrtaes the consequences of the loss of an important oxygen-linked anion-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1540480338,"Formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase, an octameric protein of identical, bifunctional polypeptides of Mr = 62,000, yields a transferase-active fragment of Mr = 80,000 upon proteolysis with chymotrypsin in the presence of the inhibitor folic acid. The purified fragment contains one size of polypeptide, Mr = 39,000, on dodecyl sulfate gels. Cross-linking with the bifunctional reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) confirmed the dimeric structure of the purified fragment. Reaction of the native octamer with the very short bifunctional reagent difluorodinitrobenzene yields dimer and tetramer in excess of trimer, thereby indicating two types of subunit interaction in the protein. The isolation of a dimeric fragment after proteolysis and the results of cross-linking support a tetramer of dimers structure for the native enzyme. The purified transferase fragment has approximately 68% of the activity of the native enzyme, but has lost specificity for the naturally occurring polyglutamate derivatives of tetrahydrofolate. This is illustrated by an increase in Km for tetrahydropteroylpentaglutamate from 3.4 microM with the native transferase to 89 microM with the fragment transferase. It is suggested that the bifunctional enzyme may have only one polyglutamate binding site/pair of transferase-deaminase sites."
https://openalex.org/W1582605532,"Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.17.1) is inactivated by p-hydroxybenzylcyanide (PHBC) in a manner characteristic of a suicide substrate. The inactivation 1) is first order in inhibitor (Kd = 1.9 mM, k2 = 0.05 min-1, pH 5.0), 2) exhibits saturation kinetics, and 3) is dependent on O2 and ascorbate. Restoration of activity could not be achieved by dialysis. The substrate, p-tyramine, protects the enzyme from inactivation, while in initial velocity kinetic experiments, PHBC is a linear competitive inhibitor (Kis = 2.6 mM) versus p-tyramine. The Kis value for PHBC is in good agreement with the Kd value obtained from analysis of the inactivation reaction. PHBC (in the presence of O2 and ascorbate) is also a substrate for the enzyme, being converted to p-hydroxymandelonitrile (PHMN) at a relative Vmax 13% that of p-tyramine. Under these conditions, the ratio of product formation to inactivation is 8000:1, suggesting that PHMN (or a tautomer of PHMN) is the species responsible for inactivation. Indeed, incubation of the enzyme with PHMN in the absence of ascorbate leads to irreversible inactivation. Since PHMN breaks down to p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and cyanide, experiments were conducted to determine whether these compounds may have been responsible for the inactivation. Incubation of the enzyme with p-hydroxybenzaldehyde did not lead to inactivation, whereas the inactivation produced with cyanide could be reversed by dialysis. Thus, the data point to PHMN as the molecule responsible for time-dependent loss of activity of the enzyme. Together, these experiments demonstrate that the newly discovered inhibitor, PHBC, meets the critieria for a suicide substrate for dopamine beta-hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1590096305,"N-Bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate was found to act as a specific affinity label for the active center of glucosephosphate isomerase. The inactivation process followed pseudo-first order kinetics, was irreversible and exhibited rate saturation kinetics with minimal half-lives of inactivation of 4.5 and 6.3 min for the enzyme isolated from human placenta and rabbit muscle, respectively. The pH dependence of the inactivation process closely paralleled the pH dependence of the overall catalytic process with pKa values at pH 6.4 and 9.0. The stoichiometry of labeling of either enzyme, as determined with N-bromo[14C2]acetylethanolamine phosphate, was 1 eq of the affinity label/subunit of enzyme. After acid hydrolysis and amino acid analysis of the radioactive affinity-labeled human enzyme, only radioactive 3-carboxymethyl histidine was found. In the case of the rabbit enzyme, the only radioactive derivative obtained was 1-carboxymethyl histidine. Active site tryptic peptides were isolated by solvent extraction, thin layer peptide fingerprinting, and ion exchange chromatography before and after removal of the phosphate from the active site peptide. Amino acid analysis of the labeled peptides from the two species were very similar. Using high sensitivty methods for sequence analysis, the primary structure of the active site was established as Val-Leu-His-Ala-Glu-Asn-Val-Asp (Gly,Thr,Ser) Glu-Ile (Thr-Gly-His-Lys-Glx)-Tyr-Phe. Apparent sequence homology between the catalytic center of glucosephosphate isomerase and triosephosphate isomerase suggest that the two enzymes may have evolved from a common ancestral gene."
https://openalex.org/W1520923182,"Tubulin x colchicine complex (TC) is a potent inhibitor of microtubule assembly whereas microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) facilitate assembly. Previous studies done under MAP-depleted conditions (Sternlicht, H., and Ringel, I. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 10540) suggested that tubulin binds to the ends of the microtubule with an apparent dissociation constant (affinity T-1) which increases as the TC/tubulin ratio in the microtubule increases. Affinity T-1 was identified with the critical, i.e. minimum tubulin concentrations required for assembly. In this study, we examined the TC-tubulin co-polymerization reaction as a function of MAP availability. Critical tubulin concentrations, which increases in the presence of TC and decreases in the presence of MAP, could be approximated as a sum of contributions from MAPs and TC. An expression was derived which successfully predicted the per cent inhibition observed for a variety of TC, tubulin, and MAP concentrations. In all cases, increases in critical tubulin concentrations correlated with increases in the TC/tubulin ratio in the microtubules. Our data suggest that substoichiometric inhibition by TC is not a consequence of impaired MAP function, nor is it a consequence of a marked increase in the apparent free energy of assembly in the presence of TC. Rather, the large per cent inhibition values observed at low TC concentrations (TC less than or equal to 5 microM) appear to be a consequence of the small concentrations of tubulin typically used in assembly studies (less than or equal to 2 to 4 mg/ml active tubulin) and the constraint that assembly in the presence of TC requires a minimum concentration of tubulin equal to affinity T-1. The molecular processes by means of which TC and MAPs affect affinity T-1 remain to be established."

https://openalex.org/W1559893101,"The inhibition of homogeneous 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase by MgATP-dependent inactivators isolated from rat liver cytosol and microsomes was examined. The inhibition was independent of incubation time. The inhibition was readily reversed by dilution or dialysis, by the addition of EDTA, and by incubating the inhibited enzyme with glycerol and glycerol kinase to convert the ATP to ADP. The inactivated enzyme was not reactivated by various phosphatases. When inactivated in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP, no radioactivity was incorporated into the reductase. These observations indicate that the inactivators do not exert their effects through covalent modification of the reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1509873986,"p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2) was rapidly inactivated by treatment with phenylglyoxal, by a process obeying pseudo-first order kinetics. The reaction with the reagent was also examined by amino acid analyses, radioactivity measurements, and spectrophotometric analyses. Results of these analyses were consistent with each other, which shows that the inactivation was due to modification of argiine residue(s). Addition of saturating amounts of p-hydroxybenzoate (or benzoate) during the treatment resulted in marked protection of the enzyme from the inactivation as well as a significant decrease in modification of arginine residues, while phenol showed no effect. Modification in the absence of p-hydroxybenzoate caused a spectral change in the flavin moiety of the enzyme similar to that due to the enzyme.substrate complex formation, and losses in both the overall activity and the substrate-binding ability accompanied the spectral change. On the other hand, such spectral change was not observed and the substrate-binding ability was retained even after the overall activity had decreased to a great extent when p-hydroxybenzoate as added during the modification treatment. These results suggest that phenylglyoxal (an analogue of the substrate) was incorporatd into the substrate-binding site and that an arginine residue is involved in the site, having an interaction with the carboxylate anion of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1586495246,"Human blood plasma coagulation factor XIII is a zymogen of subnit structure a2b2. Several modified forms of the isolated noncatalytic b chains from this zymogen have been prepared and tested for their ability to complex noncovalently with preparations of factor XIII that contain only catalytic a subunits. A single CNBr fragment of b chain and a reduced and alkylated form of b chain display this capacity to complex with a subunit-containing zymogens. The molecular weight of the CNBr fragment, b', was estimated as 48,000 to 50,000, i.e. about one-half that of the monomeric form of unmodified b chain. Close agreement of values obtained by exclusion chromatography and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis suggests a monomeric structure for b'; native b chain appears to exist as a dimer. Evidence that b' is composed of more than a single polypeptide chain and that these chains are linked by disulfide bonds was obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis after reduction and by NH2-terminal analysis. whereas native b chain when complexed with human placental factor XIII, an a2 zymogen, protects a chains against a specific reaction with iodoacetamide, b' does not. Uncertainties concerning the subunit stoichiometry of a2 zymogen . b' complexes arise as a result of the anomalous chromatographic behavior of the a2 zymogens. The b chain in which one disulfide bond is reduced and in which the two sulfhydryl groups formed are alkylated with iodoacetamide binds with a2 zymogen to give a complex that is indistinguishable by exclusion chromatography from plasma zymogen. Guanidine-denatured b chain and denatured, reduced, and alkylated b chain fail to bind to a2 zymogen, although they appear to retain a dimeric structure."
https://openalex.org/W1564141469,"Abstract In a prior report (Pike, L.M., Khym, J.X., Jones, M.H., Lee, W.H., and Volkin, E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3340-3347), it was observed that CTP synthesis and concomitant incorporation of CMP into RNA and dCMP into DNA were markedly reduced in cells cultured in the presence of cycloheximide and puromycin. Experiments described here with Novikoff hepatoma cells reveal that the purine biosynthetic pathway is similarly affected. When the cells are subjected to cycloheximide (30 or 60 microgram/ml) or puromycin (100 microgram/ml), there is a substantial reduction in the bioconversion of hypoxanthine, adenosine, and deoxyadenosine into guanylate compared to untreated cultures. Whereas synthesis (counts per min/nmol) of pool ATP was 70 to 100% of controls, that of pool GTP was 20 to 35% of controls. Incorporation of AMP into RNA was 40 to 60% of controls, but that of GMP was only 10 to 25% of controls. Incorporation of dAMP into DNA averaged 10% of controls, but that of dGMP was only 4% of controls. Synthesis of guanylates from formate by the de novo pathway was similarly reduced, but incorporation of guanosine, which enters via kinase action alone, was not disproportionately lowered. These results suggest that protein synthesis inhibitors cause a severely reduced availability of newly synthesized GTP and CTP as well as their deoxy counterparts, dGTP and dCTP, the proximal precursors for the synthesis of RNA and DNA. However, the nanomolar levels of all nucleoside triphosphates remain high, probably as a result of recycling of nucleic acid breakdown products. Thus, reduced synthesis of these compounds may restrict nucleic acid synthesis only if some sort of compartmentation leads to a limitation of these precursors at the site(s) of nucleic acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1548590025,"Dilute hemoglobin A, hemoglobin S, and horse hemoglobins can be made to precipitate by addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG itself has no effect on the oxygen affinity of the soluble hemoglobin. In the resulting two-phase system the amount of precipitation is dependent on the oxygen saturation and, conversely, thw two-phase mixtures exhibit altered oxygen affinity such as is seen with gelled hemoglobin S. A decreased oxygen affinity results when the deoxy form is the less soluble as in the case of hemoglobin A or S. When the oxy form is the less soluble, as in the case of horse hemoglobin, an affinity increase results. These reciprocal shifts in solubility and oxygen affinity are seen as thermodynamically linked processes, independent of solid phase structure. However, the structure, as seen by electron microscopy, reveals that deoxyhemoglobin S gelled in the absence of PEG is identical with deoxyhemoglobin S solid phase formed in the presence of PEG."

https://openalex.org/W1525338507,"Antibodies prepared against biotin linked to serum albumin have been purified by affinity chromatography using lipoyl-Sepharose (Harmon, F. (1980) Anal. Biochem. 103, 58-63). These antibodies have been used to study the structure of the biotin-containing enzyme, transcarboxylase, by examination of complexes with the enzyme using electron microscopy. The antibodies are observed complexed with the outer subunit of transcarboxylase, which contains the biotin, but they also combine with the central subunit which does not contain biotin. Addition of excess biotin does not prevent combination of the antibodies with the central subunit. Such nonspecific combination does not occur with the outer subunit which has been treated with avidin-Sepharose to remove the biotinyl subunit. Large insoluble intermolecular enzyme complexes are not observed, apparently because the divalent antibodies react with the multiple sites on a single transcarboxylase molecule or because the larger complexes are unstable. Combination of the antibodies with the enzyme weakens the intersubunit linkages, thus, when grids are prepared for electron microscopy, there frequently is much greater dissociation of the enzyme which is complexed than there is with the noncomplexed enzyme. The results have confirmed that the biotinyl subunits remain complexed with the outer subunits when transcarboxylase dissociates."
https://openalex.org/W43729232,"Five fragments of collagen have been purified from human urine. The fragments cross-reacted with basement membrane collagen from pig kidney cortices when tested against antiserum to basement membrane collagen, type IV, from murine tumor. The concentrations of these fragments were sufficient for amino acid analysis, immunological analysis, and in one case, preliminary analytical amino acid sequencing. Compositional analysis of the fragments indicated concentrations of hydroxylysine, hydroxyproline, and glycine that are typical of collagen. High values of hexosamines and neutral sugars were also found. An NH2-terminal sequence of 18 residues was obtained for one fragment of Mr approximately 6,500. This sequence was unique among proteins reported to date, but was obviously collagen-like. A urinary source of basement membrane collagen fragments will permit molecular characterization of basement membrane in inherited or acquired diseases affecting this structure."
https://openalex.org/W1582940673,"The two isoenzymes of aspartate aminotransferase from pig heart have been reacted with a derivative of the coenzyme, 4'-N-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorophenyl) pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate, which is a potential affinity labeling reagent. The derivative has a great affinity for both isoapoenzymes. In the cytosolic isoenzyme, the reversible binding is followed by a covalent labeling of the epsilon amino group of lysine 258, which usually forms an aldimine bond with pyridoxal-5'-phosphate. In the mitochondrial isoenzyme, no labeling occurs at the active site. The different reactivity indicates that a small but definite difference exists in the geometry of the two active sites. In the cytosolic isoenzyme also a sulfhydryl group outside the active site region, namely cysteine 45, reacts, but not by an affinity labeling mechanism. In both isoenzymes, the reversibly bound reagent slowly undergoes a splitting reaction by which pyridoxal-5'-phosphate is regenerated and activity re-established; the rate of this reaction is not fast enough to impaire the labeling potential of the reagent."
https://openalex.org/W1528239470,"In addition to the known 3% of G + C residues, samples of purified crab d(A-T) polymer from Cancer borealis contained small amounts (< 3%) of RNA. Aliquots of d(A-T)n were digested with crude venom, and the resultant nucleosides were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC); up to one-half of all guanosine was rG. Other aliquots were exhaustively digested with purified pancreatic DNase I to produce 88% dinucleotides. HPLC fractionation of this dinucleotide mixture into individual components revealed the presence of three mixed dinucleotides: -dC-rG, -dT-rA, and -dT-rG. A third aliquot of d(A-T)n was hydrolyzed overnight with 0.3 M KOH at 37 degrees C; approximately equal amounts of ribomononucleotides (predominantly containing purines) and deoxyribomononucleotides (predominantely containg thymine) were produced. KOH-hydrolyzable ribonucleotides accounted for one-third to one-half of the total RNA. The rest of the ribonucleotides remained with longer d-fragments, presumably as 3'(2')-terminal nucleotides (. . .d-d-d-rp). It was concluded that crab d(A-T) polymer from C. borealis contains 1 to 3% of dispersed, covalently bound ribonucleotides. The results also suggest that the sugar specificity of DNase I may be limited to a nucleotide following the cleavage."
