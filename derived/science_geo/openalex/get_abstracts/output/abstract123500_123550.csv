https://openalex.org/W2056602792,"α-Dystroglycan is a heavily glycosylated protein, which is localized on the Schwann cell membrane as well as the sarcolemma, and links the transmembrane protein β-dystroglycan to laminin in the extracellular matrix. We have shown previously that sialidase treatment, but not N-glycanase treatment, of bovine peripheral nerve α-dystroglycan greatly reduces its binding activity to laminin, suggesting that the sialic acid of O-glycosidically-linked oligosaccharides may be essential for this binding. In this report, we analyzed the structures of the sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides of bovine peripheral nerve α-dystroglycan by two methods. O-Glycosidically-linked oligosaccharides were liberated by alkaline-borotritide treatment or by mild hydrazinolysis followed by 2-aminobenzamide-derivatization. Acidic fractions obtained by anion exchange column chromatography that eluted at a position corresponding to monosialylated oligosaccharides were converted to neutral oligosaccharides by exhaustive sialidase digestion. The sialidases from Arthrobacter ureafaciens and from Newcastle disease virus resulted in the same degree of hydrolysis. The neutral oligosaccharide fraction, thus obtained, gave a major peak with a mobility of 3.8-3.9 glucose units upon gel filtration, and its reducing terminus was identified as a mannose derivative. Based on the results of sequential exoglycosidase digestion, lectin column chromatography, and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, we concluded that the major sialylated O-glycosidically-linked oligosaccharide of the α-dystroglycan was a novel O-mannosyl-type oligosaccharide, the structure of which was Siaα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-2Man-Ser/Thr (where Sia is sialic acid). This oligosaccharide constituted at least 66% of the sialylated O-linked sugar chains. Furthermore, a laminin binding inhibition study suggested that the sialyl N-acetyllactosamine moiety of this sugar chain was involved in the interaction of the α-dystroglycan with laminin."
https://openalex.org/W1664335312,"Editing of the non-protein amino acid homocysteine, a frequent type of error-correcting process in amino acid selection for protein synthesis by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, results in formation of a cyclic thioester, homocysteine thiolactone. Here it is shown that human cells in which homocysteine metabolism is deregulated by a mutation in the cystathionine β-synthase gene and/or by an antifolate drug, aminopterin (which prevents remethylation of homocysteine to methionine by methionine synthase), produce more homocysteine thiolactone, in addition to homocysteine, than unaffected cells. The thiolactone is incorporated into cellular and extracellular proteins, in addition to being secreted and hydrolyzed to homocysteine. Experiments with model proteins and amino acids suggest that the mechanism of incorporation involves acylation of side chain amino groups of lysine residues by the activated carboxyl group of the thiolactone. The metabolic conversion of homocysteine to homocysteine thiolactone and the reactivity of the thiolactone toward proteins may explain pathological consequences of elevated levels of homocysteine such as observed in vascular disease."

The two conserved subdomains, D1 and D2, in the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of CD30 were tested for interaction with two tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins with NFκB activating capacity, TRAF2 and TRAF5. TRAF5 is the newest member of the TRAF family that binds to lymphotoxin β receptor and CD40. TRAF5, as well as TRAF2, interacted with the D2 subdomain of CD30 in vitro and in vivo. Deletion analysis by the yeast two-hybrid system revealed that the C-terminal 22 and 30 amino acid residues are dispensable for interaction of TRAF5 and TRAF2 with CD30, respectively. Substitution of alanine for threonine at 463 abolished the interaction with TRAF2. Overexpression of the TRAF domain of TRAF2 or TRAF5 showed a dominant negative effect on CD30-mediated NFκB activation. Simultaneous expression of these TRAF domains further suppressed the NFκB activation, suggesting an interplay of these TRAF proteins. Expression of TRAF2 and TRAF5 mRNA was demonstrated in T- and B-cell lines that express CD30. Taken together, our results indicate that TRAF2 and TRAF5 directly interact with CD30 and are involved in NFκB activation by CD30 signaling.

Because the cytoplasmic tail of receptors of the TNF receptor family does not have intrinsic catalytic activity such as kinase activity, it was considered that molecules that associate with these receptors mediate signal transduction. Putative signal transducing proteins that associate with TNF receptor type II were cloned and named TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 1 and 2 (13Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V.

We have recently cloned TRAF5 that associates with lymphotoxin β receptor and CD40 and mediates NFκB activating signals (19Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H.

We have found that an approximately 100-amino acid sequence of the C-terminal region of the CD30 cytoplasmic region was highly conserved among human, rat, and mouse CD30 protein, and in this region there are two subdomains with a higher conservation (D1 and D2) (21Aizawa S. Satoh H. Horie R. Ito K. Choi S.H. Takeuchi H. Watanabe T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the association of TRAF1, 2, and 3 with the cytoplasmic tail of CD30 has been reported, and the binding sites were characterized (22Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Ducket C.S. Van Dongen J.L. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12852-12858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, it has remained to be determined whether and how these TRAF proteins are involved in NFκB activation by CD30. To better understand the CD30 signal transduction pathway that leads to NFκB activation, we asked whether TRAF5, as well as TRAF2 are involved in CD30 signaling. We found that TRAF5, as was shown for TRAF2, directly associates with the D2 subdomain of the CD30 cytoplasmic tail, and both TRAF2 and TRAF5 are involved in the signal transduction leading to NFκB activation. GST fusion protein was prepared using the pGEX series of GST fusion protein vectors (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The cDNA fragments encoding regions covering both or either of the two conserved subdomains (D1 and D2) of the CD30 cytoplasmic tail of human (2Dürkop H. Latza U. Hummel M. Eitelbach F. Seed B. Stein H. Cell. 1992; 68: 421-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), mouse (23Bowen M.A. Lee R.K. Miragliotta G. Nam S.Y. Podack E.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 442-449PubMed Google Scholar), and rat (21Aizawa S. Satoh H. Horie R. Ito K. Choi S.H. Takeuchi H. Watanabe T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared by PCR using primers with extra sequences for restriction enzyme digestion. These were named GST-hCD30 (D1+D2) (amino acids 459-595), GST-mCD30 (D1+D2) (amino acids 388-498), GST-rCD30 (D1+D2) (amino acids 383-493), GST-rCD30D2 (amino acids 426-493), and GST-rCD30D1 (amino acids 383-445). GST and GST fusion proteins were prepared by standard methods (24Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and translation was performed using the TNT in vitro translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. In vitro binding analysis was done as described previously (19Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The gels were dried and analyzed on a BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film). Transient cotransfection and coprecipitation analyses were done using 293T cells. For these experiments, an expression vector for human CD30 (pME-hCD30) was prepared using an SRα-driven pME18S plasmid (a gift from Dr. K Maruyama). Expression vectors for human CD30 with C-terminal deletions of 47, 95, and 132 amino acids were also prepared using PCR and pCR3/ eukaryotic TA cloning vector (In vitrogen), and named pCR-hCD30(δD2), pCR-hCD30(δD1+D2), and phCD(δ132), respectively. These deletion mutants lack the D2 subdomain or both D1 and D2 subdomains at the C terminus (21Aizawa S. Satoh H. Horie R. Ito K. Choi S.H. Takeuchi H. Watanabe T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Those for mouse TRAF2 and TRAF5 tagged with FLAG were prepared using pME18S and PCR-amplified cDNA fragments encompassing the protein coding region. The resultant plasmids were named pMEFLAG-TRAF2 and pMEFLAG-TRAF5, respectively. The 293T cells were cotransfected with 1 μg each of expression vectors of these human CD30 and FLAG-tagged TRAF5 or TRAF2, using Lipofectin/ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody BerH2 (DAKO), and the immnunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak) or immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody and detected by BerH2 using an ECL/ chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Corp.). For cotransformation assays in a yeast two-hybrid system, DNA encoding the rat CD30 intracellular domain (amino acids 308-493) (21Aizawa S. Satoh H. Horie R. Ito K. Choi S.H. Takeuchi H. Watanabe T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into the yeast Gal4-DNA binding domain vector pAS1-CYH2 (a gift from Dr. J. W. Harper) (25Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar) (pAS-rCD30IC) and used to test interaction with the TRAF family proteins. Bait plasmids with a series of C-terminal deletion of the CD30 cytoplasmic region were prepared to map the binding regions. These plasmids were named pAS-rCD30δ22, pAS-rCD30δ30, pAS-rCD30δ36, pAS-rCD30δ51, pAS-rCD30δ67, pAS-rCD30δ81, and pAS-rCD30δ97, where the numbers following δ indicate the number of deleted amino acids. Gal4 activation domain plasmids having TRAF domains of TRAF2 or TRAF5 were pACT-TRAF2D (amino acids 274-501) and pACT-TRAF5D (amino acids 223-558). Expression plasmids of mouse TRAF2 and TRAF5 were prepared using the pCR/3 eukaryotic TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and PCR-amplified cDNA fragments encompassing the protein coding region. The resultant plasmids were named pCR-TRAF2 and pCR-TRAF5, respectively. Using the same method, those for truncated TRAF proteins retaining only the TRAF domain were prepared. The resultant plasmids (pCR-TRAF2D and pCR-TRAF5D) encode amino acids 269-501 and 233-558, respectively. For CAT assays, 1 μg of the reporter plasmid, [κB]6TK-CAT or [κBm]6TK-CAT (20Ishida T. Tojo T. Aoki T Kobayashi N. Oishi T Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9437-9442Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), 1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector driven by the β-actin promoter (β-actin-β-gal), and 1 μg of pME-hCD30, pCR-TRAF2, pCR-TRAF2D, pCR-TRAF5, or pCR-TRAF5D were cotransfected with Lipofectin/ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The total amount of DNA transfected was always adjusted to 5 μg with control expression vectors, pME18S, or pCR/3. 40 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing followed by centrifugation. β-Galactosidase activity was used to standardize transfection efficiency. CAT assays were performed using a fluor diffusion method (26Purschke W.G. Müller P.K. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 264-269PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling from CD30 was shown to activate NFκB; however, transducers of this signal have not been well characterized. On the other hand, two TRAF proteins, TRAF2 and TRAF5, were proven to have NFκB activating capacity. Therefore, study of the involvement of TRAF2 and TRAF5 in NFκB activation by CD30 is needed to better understand the biological functions of CD30. We reported that an approximately 100-amino acid sequence is highly conserved between rat and human CD30, and we have tentatively divided this region into two subdomains, D1 and D2 (21Aizawa S. Satoh H. Horie R. Ito K. Choi S.H. Takeuchi H. Watanabe T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). These observations also held true for the mouse CD30 (23Bowen M.A. Lee R.K. Miragliotta G. Nam S.Y. Podack E.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 442-449PubMed Google Scholar), thereby suggesting the functional importance of these subdomains (Fig. 1A). Moreover, it was shown that TRAF1, 2, and 3 interact with CD30 through binding sites in C-terminal 36 amino acids (22Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Ducket C.S. Van Dongen J.L. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12852-12858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), which signifies that these TRAF proteins bind to the region containing the C-terminally located D2 subdomain. To determine if TRAF5 binds to CD30 and if so which of the subdomains are involved in the binding, we examined interactions of TRAF5, along with TRAF2, with CD30 in vitro and in vivo. First we examined in vitro binding using the CD30 cytoplasmic region fused to glutathione S-transferase and in vitro translated TRAF proteins. We constructed GST fusion proteins of CD30 having both or either one of them (Fig. 1A). GST fusion proteins with two subdomains were GST-hCD30(D1+D2) that has the C-terminal 136 amino acids of human CD30, and GST-mCD30(D1+D2) and GST-rCD30(D1+D2) that have C-terminal 110 amino acids of mouse and rat CD30, respectively. GST-rCD30 (D2) and GST-rCD30 (D1) have either of the subdomains of the rat CD30. Affinity purified GST fusion proteins were tested for their potential to precipitate 35S-labeled in vitro translated full-length mouse TRAF2 and TRAF5. As shown in Fig. 1B, both TRAF2 and TRAF5 were precipitated by GST-CD30 proteins having both D1 and D2 subdomains of human, mouse, or rat origin, they interacted with the CD30 GST fusion protein possessing the D2 subdomain but not with that having the D1 subdomain. Thus, it was suggested that TRAF5, as well as TRAF2, interacts with CD30 through the binding site(s) in the D2 subdomain. To confirm this proposal, we next examined the interaction of CD30 with TRAF5 and TRAF2 by cotransfection and coprecipitation analysis. Human CD30 and deletion mutants were coexpressed with FLAG-tagged TRAF5 or TRAF2 in 293T cells. CD30 proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using the BerH2 anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody (DAKO), and the immune complexes were analyzed for the presence of FLAG-TRAF5 or FLAG-TRAF2 by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak). The BerH2 anti-CD30 antibody co-immunoprecipitated TRAF2 and TRAF5 from the cells transfected with wild type CD30 cDNA. However, deletion of the D2 subdomain or both D1 and D2 subdomains abrogated the precipitation of either TRAF2 or TRAF5 (Fig. 2, upper panel). Conversely, the anti-FLAG M2 antibody co-immunoprecipitated only the wild type CD30 but not the deletion mutants with co-expressed TRAF2 or TRAF5 (Fig. 2, lower panel). Expression of the transfected CD30 proteins, as well as FLAG-tagged TRAF 2 and TRAF5, was confirmed by immunoblotting with BerH2 or anti-FLAG M2 antibody (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that TRAF5 can interact with the CD30 cytoplasmic tail through the C-terminal region containing the D2 subdomain in vivo. To further map the binding sites of CD30, deletion studies were done using the yeast two-hybrid system. The yeasts were cotransformed with plasmids that express wild type and various C-terminal deletion mutants of rat CD30 along with TRAF2 or TRAF5 expression vector and then assayed for their potential to grow on medium lacking leucine and tryptophan and for β-galactosidase activity. The TRAF domain of TRAF5 as well as that of TRAF2 interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of CD30 (Fig. 3A). However, deletion of the C-terminal 30 amino acids that removes one-third of the D2 subdomain abolished the binding to TRAF5 protein, whereas this construct retained the potential to interact with TRAF2 protein. Deletion of 36 amino acids that removes half of the D2 subdomain, as well as deletion of the whole D2 subdomain, abolished the interaction with both the TRAF proteins. Gedrich et al. identified two binding sites of the human CD30 for TRAF1, 2, and 3, the PEQET and EEEGKE sequences, that are located at 462-466 and 480-485, respectively (22Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Ducket C.S. Van Dongen J.L. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12852-12858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, the above results indicated that the PEQET sequence alone is sufficient for interaction with TRAF2 but not with TRAF5 and suggested that the EPPLGSC sequence (464-470) is required for TRAF5 binding. A similar sequence PXQXT is also present in the binding domain of CD40 to TRAF3. The threonine residue at position 254 of CD40 was shown to be important for binding to TRAF3 (14Hu H.M. O'Rourke K. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30069-30072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for biological functions. We next examined the effect of amino acid substitution at 463 for interaction with TRAF2. Substitution of alanine for threonine deprived the mutant protein CD30δ30A of the potential to interact with TRAF2 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the threonine residue in the PEQET binding sequence is essential for biological activity of CD30 and that this threonine residue may have functional similarities with threonine 254 in CD40 (27Inui S. Kaisho T. Kikutani H. Stamenkovic I. Seed B. Clark E.A. Kishimoto T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because we have previously demonstrated that TRAF5 can activate NFκB (19Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 20Ishida T. Tojo T. Aoki T Kobayashi N. Oishi T Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9437-9442Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), the results in the present study indicated that both the two TRAF proteins with NFκB activating capacity, TRAF2 and TRAF5, interact with CD30. Because signals from CD30 have been shown to activate NFκB and induce gene expression (11Biswas P. Smith C.A. Goletti D. Hardy E.C. Jackson R.W. Fauci A.S. Immunity. 1995; 2: 587-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Maggi E. Annunziato F. Manetti R. Biagiotti R. Giudizi M.G. Ravina A. Almerigogna F. Boiani N. Alderson M. Romagniani S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 251-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we asked if TRAF2 and TRAF5 are involved in NFκB activation. We performed a reporter gene assay using [κB]6TK-CAT and [κBm]6TK-CAT plasmids and expression vectors for CD30 and full size or N-terminally truncated TRAF2 or TRAF5 that lacks ring finger and zinc finger domains. We first confirmed that overexpression of TRAF2 or TRAF5 alone resulted in a 4.1- or 4.8-fold induction of CAT activity, in a κB site-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the overexpression of CD30 alone showed about a 9-fold induction of CAT activity, also in a κB site-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Cotransfection of CD30 and the TRAF domain of TRAF2 or TRAF5 suppressed CD30-mediated NFκB activation by 66 or 39%, respectively (Fig. 4B), indicating the dominant negative effect of TRAF domain overexpression. Simultaneous expression of TRAF domains of TRAF2 and TRAF5 further suppressed CD30-mediated NFκB activation by 80%, thereby suggesting that both of these proteins are involved in signal transduction of CD30. CD30 is expressed in activated T-cells as well as lymphocytes infected with human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 or EBV; therefore, we examined the expression of TRAF2 and TRAF5 in lymphocytes by Northern blot analysis. A panel of B- and T-lymphocyte cell lines, some of which are infected with human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 or EBV, were included in the study. We found that TRAF2 and TRAF5 transcripts were expressed in all the cell lines tested. CD30 mRNA was also expressed in these cell lines, except for EBV noninfected BJAB and Ramos cells (data not shown). Colocalization of expression provided further supportive evidence for the involvement of TRAF5 and TRAF2 in CD30 signal transduction. These results demonstrate for the first time the involvement of TRAF2 and TRAF5 in NFκB activation by CD30. Direct interaction of TRAF5 with the C-terminal end of the CD30 protein and involvement of TRAF2 and TRAF5 in CD30-mediated NFκB activation underline the complexity of interplay between the TRAF family proteins in the signal transduction of CD30 and may explain the pleiotropic biological activity mediated by CD30-CD30L interaction. Stoichiometric studies of the interaction will be needed to analyze the interplay of TRAF proteins and determine the roles played by individual TRAF proteins during CD30 signal transduction.

However, to date, direct isolation from CEs of involucrin cross-linked by way of the transglutaminase-induced isopeptide bond has not been reported. We have treated human foreskin CEs with methanol/KOH (saponification) to hydrolyze off much of the lipids. By immunogold electron microscopy, this exposed large amounts of involucrin epitopes as well as of desmoplakin, a desmosomal structural protein. About 20% of the total CE protein could be solubilized by proteolytic digestion after saponification, of which involucrin was the most abundant. Subsequent amino acid sequencing revealed many peptides involving involucrin cross-linked either to itself or to a variety of other known CE protein components, including cystatin α, desmoplakin, elafin, keratins, members of the small proline-rich superfamily, loricrin, and unknown proteins related to the desmoplakin family. Specific glutamines or lysines of involucrin were used to cross-link the different proteins, such as glutamines 495 and 496 to desmoplakin, glutamine 288 to keratins, and lysines 468, 485, and 508 and glutamines 465 and 489 for interchain involucrin cross-links. Many identical peptides were obtained from immature CEs isolated from the inner living cell layers of foreskin epidermis. The multiple cross-linked partners of involucrin provide experimental confirmation that involucrin is an important early scaffold protein in the CE. Further, these data suggest that there is significant redundancy in the structural organization of the CE.

The cornified cell envelope (CE) 1The abbreviations used are: CEcornified cell envelopePTHphenylthiohydantoinHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographySprsmall proline-rich family of proteins, consisting of several members such as Spr1, etc. is a specialized structure formed during terminal differentiation of stratified squamous epithelia and serves as a vital barrier for the tissue. Foreskin epidermal CEs, for example, consist of an ∼15-nm-thick layer of insoluble protein (about 90% of CE mass) on the intracellular or cytoplasmic surface, overlaid by ∼5 nm of lipid envelope (10% of mass) located on the extracellular or outer surface (1Hohl D.

Indeed, recent amino acid sequencing of peptides has demonstrated for the first time that the proteins elafin, filaggrin, keratin intermediate filaments, loricrin, and Sprs are in fact isopeptide cross-linked components of human foreskin epidermal CEs (26Hohl D.

However, detailed information on the relative abundances, temporal orders of deposition, or the assembly mechanisms of these proteins onto the CE structure is incomplete. Nevertheless, two points are becoming more clear. First, the CEs of different epithelia are not the same. For example, loricrin seems to be unique to the CE of “dry” or orthokeratinizing epithelia such as the epidermis (as well as the forestomach of rodents) (25Mehrel T. Hohl D. Rothnagel J.A. Longley M.A. Bundman D. Cheng C. Lichti U. Bisher M.E. Steven A.C. Steinert P.M. Yuspa S.H. Roop D.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1103-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 26Hohl D.

Genomics. 1994; 23: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Spr amounts in CEs vary widely in epithelia, from very abundant in the periderm layer of the fetus (36Kartasova T. Darwiche N.

Therefore the composition of the constituent proteins and thus the structure of the CE seems to vary in parallel with the function of different epithelia (36Kartasova T. Darwiche N. Kohno Y.

Second, a variety of data in toto suggest that involucrin may be a ubiquitous component of the CEs of most if not all epithelial tissues (reviewed in 3Reichert U. Michel S. Schmidt R. Darmon M. Blumenberg M. Molecular Biology of the Skin. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 107-150Google Scholar, 4Eckert R.L. Yaffe M.B. Crish J.F. Murthy S. Rorke E.A. Welter J.F. J. Invest.

Interestingly, involucrin also has been shown to be a component of the primitive CE entity formed in liver apoptotic bodies (47Tarcsa E. Kedei N. Thomazy V. Fesus L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25648-25651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have utilized CEs isolated from human foreskin epidermis as a model system to study these structural and functional issues. Our recent work using limited proteolysis and sequencing of the released peptides has provided information on not only which proteins are cross-linked, but also which glutamines and lysines are used for cross-linking by the transglutaminases in vivo (42Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The strategy was successful because, as suggested by immunogold decoration studies (44Steinert P.M. Cell Death & Differ. 1995; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar), the enzyme proteinase K could penetrate the cytoplasmic face but not the lipid face of this CE. We showed that the outer one-third of this CE structure consists almost entirely (>90%) of loricrin (i.e. intra- and interchain cross-linked loricrin molecules) and was admixed with smaller amounts of Spr1 and Spr2 which seem to function as cross-bridging molecules among the loricrin. A middle third of the CE structure was also ∼85% loricrin, admixed with Sprs, and the elastase inhibitor elafin. Trace amounts of keratins and filaggrin were also cross-linked. However, a similar analysis of the innermost protein portion of this CE, which was enriched in involucrin and which is perhaps common to the CEs of many other types of stratified squamous epithelia, was not possible. Thus, no data exist yet as to how involucrin is cross-linked with other proteins and to the loricrin-rich phase in the epidermal CE or in any other CE structure. In this study, we have developed methods to circumvent these technical problems. We have characterized peptides from two sources: (i) mature stratum corneum CEs from which much of the covalently attached lipids have been removed by alkaline hydrolysis (saponification) and (ii) less mature CEs from the inner living cell layers of the epidermis. Our new data identify the many proteins to which involucrin is cross-linked in vivo and confirm that it is indeed a major early cross-linked component of the CE. The epidermis of human foreskins was extracted in a buffer of 8 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mM EDTA. In the absence of a reducing reagent, only the inner living cell layers are dissociated (48Steinert P.M. Idler W.W. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 49Dale B.A. Holbrook K.A. Kimball J.R. Hoff M. Sun T.-T. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 101: 1257-1269Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This extract was then filtered through nylon gauze (mesh, 0.1 mm). The retentate of stratum corneum sheets and a filtrate of living cell material were separately pelleted, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and then used to prepare mature and immature CEs, respectively, by exhaustive boiling in SDS buffer (38Steven A.C. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 693-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol.

The resultant CE fragments were pelleted through 20% Ficoll in phosphate-buffered saline to remove most adherent (i.e. not cross-linked) solubilized keratins (38Steven A.C. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 693-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Steinert P.M. Cell Death & Differ. 1995; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar). Mature CEs were extracted in 1 M KOH, 95% methanol at 45° for 1 h (saponification). This reaction hydrolyzes the ester linkages by which the ceramide-rich lipid envelope is attached to the protein envelope (6Downing D.T. J.

Amino acid analysis of hydrolyzed samples (5.7 N HCl at 110° for 22 h in vacuo) was used routinely to measure protein amounts. The isodipeptide cross-link was measured by amino acid analyses of complete enzymatic digestions of CE samples (26Hohl D. Mehrel T. Lichti U. Turner M.L. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. J. Biol.

To generate peptides suitable for microsequencing, aliquots of CEs (1-3 mg of CE protein) before or after saponification were resuspended in 0.1 M N-ethylmorpholine acetate, pH 8.3. They were digested at 37°C with either trypsin (Sigma; sequencing grade, 1% by weight) for 1-6 h or with proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.; 3% by weight) for up to 36 h (42Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 44Steinert P.M. Cell Death & Differ. 1995; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar). The solubilized peptide material was collected by pelleting the CE remnants at 14,000 x g and dried. Peptides were fractionated by HPLC and characterized as described before (42Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Initial experiments showed empirically that cross-linked peptides were 20-50 residues long and eluted >50 min from the HPLC column, whereas peptides derived from non-cross-linked portions of constituent CE proteins generally were ≤15 residues long and eluted <40 min. In the case of peptides from saponified CEs, since the initial tryptic peptides were >50 residues long and poorly resolved, they were subjected to a second digestion with proteinase K (0.5% by weight for 30 min) before fractionation. Selected peptides were sequenced as before (42Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Several affinity-purified antibodies were used to decorate isolated CE fragments: (i) a polyclonal antibody generated in rabbits using as immunogen a synthetic peptide of the sequence PVCSPGGIQEVTINQSLLQPLNVEIDPEIQKVKSRE corresponding to the H1 region of the human keratin 1 chain (52Chipev C.C.

Our earlier attempt to resolve the structure of the foreskin epidermal stratum corneum (“mature”) CE by controlled proteolysis was complicated by the presence on one side of the lipid envelope, which precluded direct access by proteases to the inner layers, and by the dense layer of cross-linked loricrin on the cytoplasmic side (42Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, we have utilized mature CEs in which the ceramide-rich lipid envelope layer has been removed by alkaline hydrolysis (saponification) or CEs that contain much less loricrin and that have not yet assembled the lipid envelope (from “immature” epidermal cells). We probed mature foreskin epidermal CEs for the presence of epitopes of several proteins that are known to be present, including involucrin and loricrin (42Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol.

The linear distributions of gold particles over >50 μm of CE fragments were summed to obtain more quantitative information (Table I). The distributions were reproducible between multiple experiments with each antibody, but there was wide variation between antibodies probably due to differences in epitope accessibility or abundance. Of three available keratin 1 antibodies, only the new one elicited against the H1 subdomain labeled fragments reliably (Fig. 1C). We also tested for other keratinocyte cell peripheral antigens including α3 integrin (a marker for cell junctions in terminally differentiating keratinocytes (55Watt F. Hertle M.D. Leigh I.M.

Both genomes encode ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) that are distinct from the nuclear-encoded rRNAs. Secondary structure analysis of all the P. falciparum rRNAs indicates that only the large subunit (LSU) rRNA encoded by the plastid-like genome is the target for thiostrepton. Indeed we find that thiostrepton inhibits growth of the parasite in the micromolar range which is 10-fold below concentrations with observable effects on total protein synthesis. We have further examined selective effects of thiostrepton on the plastid function by comparing differential effects of the drug on cytoplasmic and organellar encoded transcripts. Treatment with either thiostrepton or rifampin, an inhibitor of organellar and eubacterial RNA polymerase, both showed disappearance of organellar-encoded RNA transcripts within 6 h of treatment while transcripts of a nuclear-encoded mRNA remained constant for at least 8 h of treatment. Hence, we show a selective effect on organelle function that is suggestive of interference in the protein synthesis apparatus of the plastid. Sensitivity of P. falciparum to thiostrepton confirms that the plastid-like genome is essential for the erythrocytic cycle and presents a novel therapeutic site for this class of antibiotics.

Plasmodium, the agent responsible for malaria, is an obligate intracellular parasite that contains three genomes, all of which encode rRNAs. Aside from the nuclear genome, these parasites have two extrachromosomal DNAs, a 6-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)LSUlarge subunitPCRpolymerase chain reactionRTreverse transcriptase. linear genome and a 35-kb circular genome. The smaller extrachromosomal genome is believed to be mitochondrial and encodes fragmented rRNAs and mitochondrial proteins (cytochrome oxidase I and cytochrome b) (1Feagin J.E. Werner E. Gardner M.J. Williamson D.H. Wilson R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The larger extrachromosomal genome encodes a complete set of rRNAs as a palindromic repeat, tRNAs, ribosomal proteins, and proteins including homologs of subunits of eubacterial RNA polymerase (2Gardner M.J.

This extrachromosomal element is believed to be of plastid origin, based on sequence comparison and the arrangement of the rRNA genes. The mitochondrion has been visualized (4Divo A.A. Geary T.G. Jensen J.B. Ginsburg H. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the plastid-like organelle has been localized in Plasmodium falciparum (5Wilson R.J.M.

Both organelles have also been localized and are distinct in the related Apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii (6McFadden G.I. Reith M.E. Munholland J. Lang-Unnasch N. Nature. 1996; 381: 482Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).

Selective inhibition of the organelle would lead to an understanding of its function, as the organellar transcripts vary in abundance during the erythrocytic cycle (7Feagin J.E. Drew M.E. Exp.

The availability of sequences of the complete set of the stage-specific, developmentally regulated rRNA genes of Plasmodium allows an investigation of predicted sites for interaction of drugs between the organellar- and nuclear-encoded rRNAs (1Feagin J.E.

The thiazole-containing peptide antibiotics, of which thiostrepton is an example, inhibit translation and ribosomal GTPase activity by binding to a limited and conserved region in the large subunit (LSU) rRNA found in eubacteria and organelles and not the corresponding region in eucarya (12Lu M. Draper D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3426-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Ryan P.C. Draper D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This region is referred to as the GTPase domain and also binds ribosomal protein L11 (L12 in eucarya) (12Lu M. Draper D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3426-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Thompson J. Musters W. Cundliffe E. Dahlberg A.E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The structure of the GTPase domain is conserved between eucarya and eubacteria, with characteristic variation at limited positions for each kingdom (16Gutell R.R. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3055-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Thiostrepton directly interacts with two nucleotides in the GTPase domain of Escherichia coli. Base substitution or methylation at one of these positions (nucleotide A1067) causes thiostrepton resistance (17Rosendahl G. Douthwaite S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast, universal protein synthesis inhibitors, such as anisomycin, bind to sites conserved in all rRNAs (8Cundliffe E. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome, Structure, Function and Evolution. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1990: 479-490Google Scholar). In this study, we test the ability of thiostrepton to specifically inhibit the plastid-like organellar protein synthesis, as compared with a universal protein synthesis inhibitor, and investigate the effect of the inhibition of this organelle on growth of the parasite. Thiostrepton (1525 units/mg; Calbiochem) and anisomycin (Sigma) were dissolved at 100 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (Pierce). P. falciparum (strain 3D7) was maintained in culture with human erythrocytes (5% hematocrit) in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with HEPES and sodium bicarbonate and human sera (10%) under standard conditions (18Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (5954) Google Scholar, 19Trager W. Methods Cell. Biol. 1994; 45: 7-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The growth inhibition assay was conducted as described (20McConkey G.A. Ittarat I. Meshnick S.R. McCutchan T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4244-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the parasitemia was adjusted to 0.1% parasitemia, 2.5% hematocrit, and 200-μl aliquots were placed in wells of a microtiter dish. Serial dilutions of drugs were made in RPMI. Thiostrepton was diluted to 10 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide before the serial dilutions in RPMI. Aliquots (20 μl) were added in triplicate to the cultures in the microtiter plate, mixing well. At the highest concentrations (final 0.2 mM), thiostrepton precipitates. After incubation for 48 h under standard conditions, [2,8-3H]hypoxanthine (Moravek Biochemicals, 12.5 Ci/mmol) in RPMI (20 μl, 0.05 mCi/ml) was added to each well. After incubation for an additional 24 h, the cultures were lysed, and incorporated radioactivity was measured with an automated counter. Each point is an average of three determinations. Assay for inhibition of protein synthesis was similar to above except the culture and drug dilutions were in RPMI 1640 without leucine (SelectAmine, Life Technologies, Inc.), and the sera were dialyzed extensively as described (21Milhous W.K. Weatherly N.F. Bowdre J.H. Desjardins R.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Also, the cultures were adjusted to 1% parasitemia prior to the experiment. Microtiter plates were set up with drug dilutions as described above except cultures were incubated with drugs for only 4 h. [3,4,5-3H]Leucine (Moravek Biochemicals, 122 Ci/mmol, 0.5 mCi/ml, 100 μCi) was diluted to 4 ml in RPMI without leucine. The radiolabeled leucine (20 μl, 1 mCi) was added to each well and incubated for another 4 h. The microtiter plates were processed as above to quantitate the incorporated radiolabel. RNA polymerase transcript levels were assessed by comparing the amounts of RNA synthesized at time points following drug treatment. Cultures of P. falciparum (3.2% parasitemia, 5% hematocrit) were treated with thiostrepton at 8 μM and rifampin (Sigma) at 80 μM, near the IC99 values (this study and Ref. 22Geary T.G. Jensen J.B. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1983; 32: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Aliquots (5 ml) of treated and control cultures were removed and immediately processed for RNA with a guanidinium thiocyanate solution, according to the manufacturer's directions (RNAgents, Promega). All RNA samples were dissolved in 50 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, DNase I-treated as described previously (23Li J. Wirtz R.A. McConkey G.A. Sattabongkot J. Waters A.P. Rogers M.J. McCutchan T.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and an aliquot (1 μl) was removed for reverse transcriptase-PCR. First strand synthesis of cDNA was completed with a random hexamer (SuperScript Preamplification System, Life Technologies, Inc.). One-tenth of the cDNA product was utilized for PCR of rpoB/C, MSA1, and rRNA. Primers corresponding to the 3ʹ region of rpoB, 5ʹ-GGGCTTTAGAAGCTTTTGG-3ʹ, and the 5ʹ region of rpoC, 5ʹ-CCATTTAAAATTGGTAATCCTG-3ʹ were applied as described (2Gardner M.J. Feagin J.E. Moore D.J.

Reactions were cycled with the following parameters: 94°C/30 s, 42°C/30 s, 72°C/60 s, 35 cycles. Primers for amplification of nucleotides 64 to 614 of MSA1 with 5ʹ-GTGTGATAATATTCATGG-3ʹ and 5ʹ-GGAGAGCATTTGGTG-3ʹ (24Ranford-Cartwright L.C. Balfe P. Carter R. Walliker D. Mol. Biochem.

Rogers M.J. McCutchan T.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were used for amplification reactions following the parameters in the respective references except with 35 cycles. Samples were also analyzed after 25 cycles of amplification to ensure detection in the linear range of the amplification reaction, with similar results (data not shown). Following electrophoresis of aliquots from the amplification reactions on 1% agarose:TBE gels, samples were transferred to nylon membranes (GeneScreen Plus, DuPont NEN) and hybridized as described (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The amplification products were probed with 5ʹ-32P-labeled oligonucleotides. The rpoB/C products were probed with 5ʹ-GTTTAGCTATTAATATAGAAGC-3ʹ (nucleotides 2009-2030 of rpoB) and 5ʹ-CGGAGAGGTATTAATACC-3ʹ (nucleotides 108-125 of rpoC), in 5 × SSC, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 42°C, and washed in the hybridization solution lacking Denhardt's and tRNA at 37°C, three times. The final wash was 1 × SSC, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 42°C followed by autoradiography. The same results were obtained with either probe. The MSA1 amplification products were similarly probed with 5ʹ-AAACTTGTGTTCGGATATAG-3ʹ and the rRNA products with oligonucleotide 842 (23Li J. Wirtz R.A. McConkey G.A. Sattabongkot J. Waters A.P. Rogers M.J. McCutchan T.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment and analysis of the corresponding secondary structures of the P. falciparum nuclear-encoded A- and S-type LSU rRNAs enable comparison with the GTPase domain of these LSU rRNAs with LSU rRNAs encoded on the 35-kb circle and as fragments on the 6-kb linear genome (Fig. 1). The GTPase domain of the nuclear-encoded LSU rRNAs are conserved at most positions shared by other eucaryotes, although the S-type, which is not expressed in blood stages (11Rogers M.J. Gutell R.R. Damberger S.H. Li J. McConkey G.A. Waters A.P. McCutchan T.F. RNA. 1996; 2: 134-145PubMed Google Scholar), has three differences from the A-type and all other eucaryotes (Fig. 1A). The GTPase domain of the 35-kb encoded LSU rRNAs is extremely A + T-rich, although the overall secondary structure resembles typical eubacterial LSU rRNAs (Fig. 1B). The previously proposed GTPase domain encoded by the 6-kb linear genome was assembled from two non-contiguous expressed fragments (6B and 6C) (1Feagin J.E. Werner E. Gardner M.J. Williamson D.H. Wilson R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which when combined do not complete the secondary structure of a typical GTPase domain (16Gutell R.R. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3055-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Although RNA editing may alter the final transcript, RNA editing has only been observed to date in the trypanosomatid lineage, not in Apicomplexa (the Plasmodium lineage). In P. falciparum, binding of the ribosomal protein may compensate for the rRNAs encoded as fragments, as the ribosomal protein L11 also binds to this region in E. coli (12Lu M. Draper D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3426-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thiostrepton interacts with both A1067 and A1095 in E. coli LSU rRNA (17Rosendahl G. Douthwaite S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As would be expected for a plastid-like organellar genome of eubacterial origin, the 35-kb circle of P. falciparum has A at both of the corresponding positions in the GTPase domain of the LSU rRNA (see Fig. 1). In contrast, the nuclear-encoded and 6-kb fragments encode LSU rRNAs altered at one or both of these positions. Since the primary site of resistance to thiostrepton is either methylation or mutation at the site corresponding to A1067 (8Cundliffe E. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome, Structure, Function and Evolution. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1990: 479-490Google Scholar), P. falciparum should be sensitive to thiostrepton with the target of the 35-kb encoded LSU rRNA. Eucarya are not, in general, sensitive to thiostrepton as they do not contain both of the nucleotides required for interaction. Indeed, base substitution in a synthetic fragment of the mammalian rRNA introducing both sites allows a high affinity binding of thiostrepton (26Uchiumi T. Wada A. Kominami R. J. Biol.

In contrast, a universal inhibitor of the peptidyltransferase reaction such as anisomycin interacts with conserved sites in the 3ʹ-half (domain V) of the LSU rRNAs (27Noller H.F. Moazad D. Stern S. Powers T. Allen P.N. Robertson J.M. Weiser B. Triman K. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome, Structure, Function and Evolution. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1990: 73-92Google Scholar). Since the peptidyltransferase site is encoded, as expected, by the nuclear LSU rRNA genes, the 35-kb genome and the linear 6-kb genome (as contiguous fragments 6F and 6G), sensitivity of P. falciparum to anisomycin should be predicated by both the organellar- and nuclear-encoded genes (28Divo A.A. Geary T.G. Jensen J.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The effect of thiostrepton on growth and protein synthesis of P. falciparum was compared with anisomycin, since the effect of both of these drugs is on protein synthesis. To assay the effect of thiostrepton and anisomycin on the growth of P. falciparum, inhibition of the uptake and incorporation of [3H]hypoxanthine was quantitated at serial dilutions of the drugs on an in vitro culture of P. falciparum (Fig. 2). Both compounds inhibited growth in the micromolar range (IC50, 1.8 μM for thiostrepton and 0.5 μM for anisomycin). These values are comparable with previously published data for anisomycin (28Divo A.A. Geary T.G. Jensen J.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the incorporation of [3H]leucine was also tested at the same dilutions of the drugs. For anisomycin, total protein synthesis was inhibited 50% at the IC50 (0.5 μM) for inhibition of growth, with the concentration-response almost superimposable on that of protein synthesis (Fig. 2B). However, for thiostrepton, only a negligible amount of inhibition of total protein synthesis was observed at the IC50 for growth. More than 10-fold higher concentrations than the IC50 of thiostrepton were required for almost complete inhibition of total protein synthesis. The lack of inhibition of protein synthesis with thiostrepton at the IC50 for inhibition of growth suggested that the principal target for the drug is different from cytoplasmic protein synthesis. This would occur if organellar protein synthesis was the target of inhibition (29Montandon P.E. Nicolas P. Schurmann P. Stutz E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4299-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Fromm H. Edelman M. Aviv D. Galun E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3233-3237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of a direct measure of plastid-like organellar protein synthesis, assay of mRNA levels by RT-PCR provides a sensitive assay for the selective effect of thiostrepton on the plastid-like organelle. We sought to assay the presence of a protein encoded by the organelle during treatment and would also be targeted by a known inhibitor. One protein that has been identified in the 35-kb genome is a homolog of eubacterial RNA polymerase encoded by the rpoB and rpoC genes (5Wilson R.J.M. Denny P.W. Preiser P.R. Rangachari K. Roberts K. Roy A. Whyte A. Strath M. Moore D.J. Moore P.W. Williamson D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Selective inhibition of the plastid-like RNA polymerase with rifampin provides a comparison with the effect of thiostrepton, since procaryotic RNA polymerases are sensitive to rifampin. The synthesis of the rpoB/C mRNA encoded by the 35-kb genome was then compared to a nuclear-encoded mRNA. We took advantage of the fact that the 35-kb encoded rpoB and rpoC are transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA (3Gardner M.J. Goldman N. Barnett P. Moore P.W. Rangachari K. Strath M. Whyte A. Williamson D.H. Wilson R.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and assayed nascent transcripts at time points during drug treatment by RT-PCR of the mRNA including the intergenic spacer between rpoB/C. Also, the sensitivity of RT-PCR provides a relative estimate of the mRNAs corresponding to those encoded on the 35-kb genome versus those of nuclear-encoded mRNAs. Amplification of part of the mRNA corresponding to the merozoite surface antigen (MSA1) gene was chosen as a nuclear-encoded mRNA, as this is abundant in erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum (24Ranford-Cartwright L.C. Balfe P. Carter R. Walliker D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As a control, a section of nuclear-encoded small subunit rRNA was also amplified as this is unaffected by antibiotics. The results (Fig. 3) show that thiostrepton and rifampin have similar effects on the decay of mRNA corresponding to rpoB/C, occurring within 6 h of drug treatment. A time course with thiostrepton shows a decline of the rpoB/C product with time, with a notable effect after only 1 h of treatment (data not shown). Within the duration of the experiment (8 h), the level of rpoB/C in untreated controls is consistent (data not shown). Although thiostrepton may be inhibiting a specific subset of nuclear-encoded mRNAs, as the plastid RNA polymerase is composed of subunits of both nuclear and organellar origin, there is no effect on the levels of nuclear-encoded MSA mRNA nor total rRNA. Since completion of the erythrocytic cycle for P. falciparum takes about 48 h, it would be expected that the effect on nuclear-encoded mRNAs would be observed only with longer time points and would reflect cell death rather than specific targeting of the plastid-like organelle. These data also support the suggestion that rifampin is a specific inhibitor of the RNA polymerase encoded by the plastid-like organelle (31Gardner M.J. Feagin J.E. Moore D.J. Spencer D.F. Gray M.W. Williamson D.H. Wilson R.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 48: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32Strath M. Scott-Finnigan T. Gardner M. Williamson D. Wilson I. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1993; 87: 211-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have tested the protein synthesis inhibitors thiostrepton and anisomycin and found that they affect in vitro growth and protein synthesis of P. falciparum in different ways. For anisomycin, the inhibition curves for growth and of protein synthesis are almost superimposable over the range of concentrations, showing a direct correlation between inhibiting cytoplasmic protein synthesis and growth of the parasite, as predicted. With thiostrepton, no such correlation exists. At doses of thiostrepton that inhibit growth (IC50, 1.8 μM), there is only a negligible effect on cytoplasmic protein synthesis, and thiostrepton is apparently inhibiting organellar protein synthesis. Both drugs, however, show characteristic dose-response curves for growth inhibition with a specific effect in the micromolar range. Based on considerable evidence from other systems, and the data presented here, the target for thiostrepton is probably the LSU encoded by the 35-kb organelle, while the target for anisomycin is the nuclear-encoded LSU rRNA and perhaps organelle-encoded LSU rRNAs. Although the function of the 35-kb plastid-like organelle is not known (5Wilson R.J.M. Denny P.W. Preiser P.R. Rangachari K. Roberts K. Roy A. Whyte A. Strath M. Moore D.J. Moore P.W. Williamson D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), inhibition of growth by thiostrepton indicates that protein synthesis from this organelle is essential for growth of the blood stages of the parasite. More than 10 years ago, an urgent need for drugs against malaria was identified (33Payne D. Parasitol. Today. 1987; 3: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We have investigated the potential of the protein synthesis machinery as a target for drugs. Our approach has been through understanding the primary and secondary structures of the rRNA and testing predictions of defined antibiotics. The antibiotics currently in use, including the tetracyclines and clindamycin, for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria have little action on pre-erythrocytic stages and slow action on blood stages, but are used for treatment of drug-resistant strains because of their safety rather than their efficacy (34Clyde D.F.

Bruce-Chwatt's Essential Malariology. 3rd Ed., pp. Edward Arnold, London, UK1993: 176-177Google Scholar). The target of these drugs has been suggested to be mitochondrial-encoded protein synthesis (28Divo A.A. Geary T.G. Jensen J.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The IC50 of thiostrepton (1.8 μM) and anisomycin (0.5 μM) compare with antimalarial drugs such as pyrimethamine (IC50 8.0-0.08 μM; Ref. 23Li J. Wirtz R.A. McConkey G.A. Sattabongkot J. Waters A.P.

Hyg. 1987; 81: 499-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, thiostrepton is sparingly soluble in the in vitro culture media for P. falciparum, so this may be an overestimate of the IC50. The toxicity of anisomycin precludes the use of this inhibitor in vivo, but this study demonstrates the accessibility of the cytoplasmic ribosome and opens the door for searching for more specific analogs. Thiostrepton effectively treats systemic bacterial infections in mice (38Steinberg B.A. Jambor W.P. Suydam L.O. Soriano A. Antibiot. Annu. 1955-1956; : 562-565PubMed Google Scholar) and is also used commercially as a topical treatment of a mixture of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections in animals. Inhibition of Plasmodium in vivo by thiostrepton, and other thiazolyl antibiotics, is worthy of investigation in animal model systems. The interaction of thiostrepton with the plastid-like organelle also provides a probe for the function of this organelle, with possible stage-specific effects on erythrocytic stages. Other Apicomplexa may also contain a target for thiostrepton, as the plastid-like organelle from the parasite T. gondii encodes rRNAs (39Beckers C.J. Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Luft B.J. Schwab J.C. Cao Y. Joiner K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and the important animal parasite Babesia bovis also encodes rRNAs that are probably organellar-encoded (40Gozar M.M. Bagnara A.S. Int. J. Parasitol. 1995; 25: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, protein synthesis derived from the plastid-like genome may be a general target for antibiotics in these human and animal parasites, as shown by the selective effect of antibiotics on T. gondii (41Pfefferkorn E.R.

We are grateful to Andrew P. Waters for his initial suggestion to test the effect of thiostrepton on P. falciparum."

In addition, catecholamine storage vesicle lysates isolated from human pheochromocytoma tumors were enriched approximately 30-fold in t-PA antigen, compared with tumor homogenate. Furthermore, exposure of PC-12 cells or primary bovine adrenal chromaffin cells to chromaffin cell secretagogues (60 μM nicotine, 55 mM KCl, or 2 mM BaCl2) resulted in co-release of t-PA in parallel with catecholamines. These data demonstrate that t-PA is expressed in chromaffin cells, is sorted into the regulated pathway of secretion, and is co-released with catecholamines by chromaffin cell stimulation. Catecholamine storage vesicles may be an important reservoir and sympathoadrenal activation an important physiologic mechanism for the rapid release of t-PA.

Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The activity of each G protein is tightly linked to the binding and hydrolysis of GTP (3Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Agonists working through 7-transmembrane domain receptors promote the release of GDP from the α subunit and thus an exchange for GTP present in the cytoplasm. Correlates of the exchange are an altered conformation of the α subunit and dissociation of the subunit from βγ. The α subunit as a monomer and βγ as a heterodimer, or both operating conjointly, are responsible for the regulation of effectors. G proteins can also be activated by nonhydrolyzable analogues of GTP, for example GTPγS, a process similarly promoted by agonists.

Considerable effort has been expended on identifying the G proteins activated by various receptors. Notwithstanding work with purified proteins, interactions have been defined mostly through inferences drawn from effectors regulated. The stimulation of adenylyl cyclase is almost always achieved through activation of Gs, for example, while the inhibition is linked to members of the Gi family (4Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-β can be accomplished through Gi (pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive) or through members of the Gq family (PTX-insensitive) (5Exton J.H.

There is often no resolution among individual members of a particular G protein family, and the nature of effector regulation itself has become increasingly complicated with the appreciation that subunits released from many G proteins can modulate the activation achieved by one (4Taussig R.

Receptors endogenous to Sf9 cells have yet to be characterized, but so far have not interfered with the analysis of numerous mammalian receptors introduced through recombinant baculoviruses. The levels of G proteins endogenous to Sf9 cells, moreover, are quite low relative to those of mammalian G proteins that can be similarly introduced. Sf9 cells also carry out processing events that support the normal targeting of receptors and G protein subunits to the cell membrane, thus providing a relatively normal phospholipid milieu for interaction. In the previous study (19Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the 5-HT1A receptor was demonstrated to couple to various members of the Gi family, i.e. Gi, Go, and Gz, as assessed by Gpp(NH)p-sensitive increases in affinity for radiolabeled agonists. A valuable index of coupling is the process of G protein activation itself. An assay of activation permits an evaluation of coupling without resort to radiolabeled agonists and circumvents presumptions regarding changes in agonist affinity. More importantly with respect to many other assays, the requirement for effector activity as a means of monitoring coupling is eliminated. In the present study, we have investigated the selectivity of receptor·;G protein coupling by measuring directly the activation of G proteins introduced into Sf9 cells. The measurement is based on agonist-promoted binding of [35S]GTPγS to G protein α subunits isolated subsequently by immunoprecipitation. We have used this methodology to study the coupling of four different receptors (the 5-HT1A, β1-adrenergic, neurokinin-1 (NK1), and thrombin receptors) to members of each class of G protein. The expected selectivity in coupling, whereas only intimated previously, was confirmed, and novel interactions between receptors and G proteins were identified.

Sf9 cells were cultured as described previously (19Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

For infection with recombinant baculoviruses, the cells were subcultured in monolayer and infected with one or more viruses at a multiplicity of infection of at least one for each virus. The medium was replaced 16 h following infection with Sf900II optimized serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were harvested at 48 h and homogenized in ice-cold 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin by repeated passage through a 26-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min to pellet the membranes. The membranes were washed and resuspended at ∼3 mg/ml protein in homogenization buffer for storage at −70°C. In experiments where the thrombin receptor was expressed, the thrombin protease inhibitor D-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (1 μM) and Nα-tosyl-Lys chloromethyl ketone (100 μM) were included throughout the period of infection and subsequent expression of receptor. Membranes (20 μg of protein) from Sf9 cells expressing receptors and/or G protein subunits were resuspended in 55 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1 μM GDP, and a concentration of MgCl2 calculated to give the desired concentration of free Mg2+. [35S]GTPγS (1300 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) was added to a final concentration of 30 nM, and the incubation was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 30°C in the absence or presence of a selected agonist. The incubation was terminated by adding 600 μl of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem), 1% aprotinin, 100 μM GDP, and 100 μM GTP. After 30 min, the extract was transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 2 μl of non-immune serum pre-incubated with 150 μl of a 10% suspension of Pansorbin® cells (Calbiochem). Nonspecifically bound proteins were removed after 20 min by centrifugation. The extract was then incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 10 μl of a G protein α subunit-directed antiserum, pre-immune serum, or non-immune serum, all of which had been pre-incubated with 100 μl of a 5% suspension of protein A-Sepharose. With the exception of the α12-directed antiserum, generated toward the peptide QENLKDIMLQ, the antisera have been described previously (19Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A.

Immunoprecipitates were collected and washed three times in the extraction buffer, once in the buffer without detergent, and then boiled in 0.5 ml of 0.5% SDS followed by addition of 4 ml of Ecolite+™ (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). The samples were analyzed directly by scintillation spectrometry. Immunotransfer blotting and quantitation of αz was accomplished as before (19Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A.

Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins was also accomplished as before (19Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) but under the conditions of extraction and immunoprecipiation used for the nucleotide-binding assays above. Efficiency of immunoprecipitation for antiserum 6354 under these conditions was calculated by comparison to the amount of [35S]methionine-labeled αz immunoprecipitated by antiserum 8645 following denaturation (presumed to be 20% (25Carlson K.E. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13298-13305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Activation of G proteins in membranes prepared from Sf9 cells was examined first for the combination of Gz and the human 5-HT1A receptor. Gz is a member of the Gi family and was chosen based on experiments indicating that the binding of [35S]GTPγS to αz is strictly dependent on co-expression of receptor (see below). Gz also exhibits the capacity to couple to the 5-HT1A receptor, as do other members of the Gi family (19Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 represents a set of experiments in which Sf9 cell membranes containing Gz (i.e. αz, β1, and γ2) and the 5-HT1A receptor were incubated with [35S]GTPγS ± serotonin (5-HT) over a range of Mg2+ concentrations. αz was subsequently immunoprecipitated with antiserum 6354 (generated toward residues 24-33), and bound [35S]GTPγS was counted directly. As shown in the figure, the binding of [35S]GTPγS to αz was dependent on Mg2+ and was optimum in the range of 0.5-10 mM of the divalent cation. Binding was enhanced by serotonin but also occurred in the apparent absence of agonist. The use of non-immune serum instead of antiserum 6354 confirmed specificity of binding for αz, as did pretreatment of antiserum 6354 with the peptide used for immunization (not shown). Similar results were achieved with antiserum 2921, directed toward the C terminus of αz (residues 346-355). Having established that Gz communicates with the 5-HT1A receptor as monitored by [35S]GTPγS binding, we examined further the requirements of the binding assay for receptor and G protein subunits (Fig. 2). As above, a significant degree of binding of [35S]GTPγS to αz was evident when the 5-HT1A receptor, αz, and β1γ2 were co-expressed, and inclusion of serotonin in the assay increased binding further. Identical results were obtained when the 5-HT1A receptor and αz were expressed together but without addition of β1γ2. Co-expression of the receptor and β1γ2 without αz confirmed that the binding was specific for αz. Omission of the receptor demonstrated that Gz alone did not bind [35S]GTPγS. The amount of αz following infection of Sf9 cells with recombinant viruses encoding the 5-HT1A receptor, αz, β1, and γ2 was 15-30 pmol of subunit per mg of membrane protein, and the efficiencies of extraction and immunoprecipitation were 90 and 60%, respectively. We calculated that 0.5 pmol of [35S]GTPγS was immunoprecipitated with αz per mg of membrane protein (following treatment of membranes with agonist). Thus, the amount of bound [35S]GTPγS was 5-10% of immunoprecipitated αz. Binding was not enhanced by increasing the concentration of [35S]GTPγS nor by omitting GDP from the assay (GDP was used to suppress agonist-independent binding). Binding of [35S]GTPγS could be increased 2-3-fold by increasing the time of incubation to 60 min. The assay was next extended to G proteins from other families and to other receptors. Fig. 3 illustrates the ability of the chosen antisera to immunoprecipitate the respective α subunits. The antisera were generated with peptides corresponding the C-terminal 10 amino acid residues of αs (1191), αq (0945), α12 (121), and α13 (120). Results obtained with the two antibodies specific for αz are shown for comparison. No subunit was evident when non-immune serum was substituted or when the Sf9 cells were not infected. The appearance of αq as two bands has been reported previously (21Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots using the “consensus” antisera 8645 and 1398 reveal that expression levels of the different subunits were within severalfold of each other (α12 could not be analyzed by this means). Binding of [35S]GTPγS to each of the α subunits co-expressed with β1γ2 but not receptors is shown as a function of Mg2+ in Fig. 4. No binding occurred for αz, α12, or α13 at any concentration of Mg2+. αs and αq, in contrast, bound [35S]GTPγS in a Mg2+-dependent fashion, as did αi1 (not shown). Subsequent experiments were carried out at 3 mM free Mg2+.Fig. 4Binding of GTPγ[35S] to G protein α subunits in the absence of receptors. Membranes from Sf9 cells expressing the indicated recombinant α subunits plus β1 and γ2 were incubated with [35S]GTPγS at various concentrations of free Mg2+. The amount of [35S]GTPγS bound to each subunit was quantified following immunoprecipitation with the relevant antiserum. The data for each α subunit represents a single experiment and are consistent with the data from two other experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The potential for coupling of Gz to β1-adrenergic, thrombin, and NK1 (substance P) receptors was next assessed (Fig. 5). The 5-HT1A receptor, as noted previously, caused an increase in [35S]GTPγS binding in the absence of added agonist and promoted a further increase when agonist (serotonin) was added. Binding was also promoted by the thrombin and NK1 receptors, though to a lesser extent. In the latter instances, agonists were required. The β1-adrenergic receptor failed to activate Gz. A completely different order of selectivities was evident for Gs (Fig. 6). As noted above, αs binds some [35S]GTPγS regardless of receptor. Omission of αs revealed that the binding was relatively specific for the introduced subunit. Activation of the β1-adrenergic receptor with isoproterenol caused a 3-4-fold increase in binding. No increase was evident without agonist. Co-expressed 5-HT1A, thrombin, and NK1 receptors, with or without agonists, had no effect. The level of binding for the Gs/β1-adrenergic receptor combination (∼90,000 cpm) was considerably higher than that achieved for Gz with any receptor, despite equivalent expression of the two G proteins. As with Gs, a significant level of receptor-independent binding was observed for Gq (Fig. 7). Omission of the recombinant αq indicated that some of the binding could be accounted for by αq (or a cross-reactive subunit) endogenous to Sf9 cells. Binding to the endogenous subunit was enhanced by activation of the NK1 receptor. However, the signal provided by endogenous subunit was well below that achieved with the mammalian subunit. A modest degree of [35S]GTPγS binding was elicited by the activated 5-HT1A receptor and was dependent on the mammalian subunit (not shown). A much higher level of binding was attained with activated thrombin and NK1 receptors. The receptor-enhanced binding in all three instances was agonist-dependent. The β1-adrenergic receptor, regardless of agonist, did not promote binding. Communication of the receptors with G13 is shown in Fig. 8. The data for G12 were identical (not shown). In the case of these two G proteins, only two of the receptors (the thrombin and NK1 receptors) promoted binding of [35S]GTPγS. No binding was observed without agonists. The -fold enhancement in binding achieved by agonists, in fact, was the highest for any of the receptor/G protein combinations (greater than 6-fold). As noted previously, GDP was included in all binding assays to suppress receptor-independent binding, an action we had confirmed for Gz and Gs. However, GDP suppresses [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide incorporation into α12 and α13 in platelet membranes (16Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Consistent with this report, we found that removal of GDP, while having no effect on the negligible receptor-independent binding of [35S]GTPγS by α12 and α13, increased binding promoted by agonists by about 50%. We have examined the potential of various receptors to couple to members of each of the four families of G proteins. The method used, receptor-promoted binding of [35S]GTPγS to G protein α subunits expressed in Sf9 cells, is powerful. Purification of receptors and G protein subunits is not required for reconstitution, nor is the assay compromised by the heterogeneity in both types of proteins inherent to mammalian expression systems. Importantly, receptor·;G protein coupling can be analyzed without resort to effector activity. This latter property allows the modeling of receptor·;G protein interactions directly (but nevertheless in a native milieu) and a definition of coupling for those G proteins whose effectors are not yet known. We have demonstrated here that the β1-adrenergic receptor couples selectively to Gs and not to other G proteins, that the 5-HT1A receptor is selectively coupled to Gz (of the G proteins tested) but shows some activity toward Gq, and that the thrombin and NK1 receptors couple to G12 and G13, as they do to Gq and Gz, but not Gs. Selectivities in interactions previously intimated are now demonstrated directly, and novel interactions are identified. Gz was used as a representative of the Gi family and as a prototype in the design of the assay. Among the most important traits exhibited by Gz was an inability to bind [35S]GTPγS without co-expression of receptor. This property was evident at all concentrations of Mg2+ and was subsequently found to be shared with G12 and G13. The inability to bind [35S]GTPγS under the constraints of the assay was consistent with the low rates of exchange of GDP for GTPγS established previously for purified αz, α12, and α13 (26Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar–28Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Gs and Gq both displayed significant levels of receptor-independent binding at millimolar concentrations of Mg2+. Although GDP/GTPγS exchange has not been fully analyzed for Gq (21Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), purified Gs exchanges GDP for GTPγS quite rapidly at high concentrations of Mg2+ (29Graziano M.P. Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gz is activated to the greatest extent by the serotonin-activated 5-HT1A receptor. The activation by this receptor was predicted based on the communication between the two proteins implied previously (19Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the fact that the 5-HT1A receptor is coupled to members of the Gi family in mammalian neurons (30Zgombick J.M. Beck S.G. Mahle C.D. Craddock-Royal B. Maayani S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 484-494PubMed Google Scholar, 31Innis R.B. Aghajanian G.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 143: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We found no evidence for activation of Gs through the 5-HT1A receptor, as once implied (32Shenker A. Maayani S. Weinstein H. Green J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 357-367PubMed Google Scholar, 33Markstein R. Hoyer D. Engel G. Arch. Pharmacol. 1986; 333: 335-341Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar), but did document a modest activation of Gq. The latter finding is consistent with activation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in several types of cells expressing the 5-HT1A receptor at high concentrations of agonist (34Raymond J.R. Albers F.J. Middleton J.P. Arch. Pharmacol. 1992; 346: 127-137Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and is also reminiscent of a somewhat paradoxical affect of αq on ligand affinity previously noted in Sf9 cells (19Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Activation of Gz by the agonist-activated 5-HT1A receptor was clearly greater than the activation achieved by the thrombin and NK1 receptors, while the converse was true for activation of Gq. Only a small proportion of immunoprecipitated αz from Sf9 membranes containing the 5-HT1A receptor and exposed to serotonin was complexed with [35S]GTPγS. The low level of binding may simply be related to a normal low rate of GDP/GTPγS exchange. Alternatively, it may reflect some instability of the [35S]GTPγS·;subunit complex through extraction and immunoprecipitation. We were somewhat surprised that introduction of βγ had no influence on [35S]GTPγS binding to αz. We had determined previously that αz alone could increase the affinity of the 5-HT1A receptor for agonist but that a greater degree of coupling was achieved upon co-expression with β1γ2 (19Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To some extent, the apparent inactivity of βγ might be explained by the fact that expression of the two additional subunits causes an approximately 2-fold suppression in levels of αz (not shown). However, we also suspect that βγ endogenous to Sf9 cells may act catalytically with respect to the activation process. A significant activation of Gz occurred in the presence of the 5-HT1A receptor but without serotonin. On the one hand, serotonin may have been carried over from the serum in which the cells were initially cultured. However, we employed serum-free medium during the time at which 5-HT1A receptors were expressed and washed the cells and membranes extensively. The receptor, instead, may exhibit constitutive activity. G protein-coupled receptors can convert between active and inactive conformations, a process especially evident in overexpression systems (35Costa T. Oginao Y. Munson P.J. Onaran H.O. Rodbard D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar). Of the four types of receptors studied here, however, only the 5-HT1A receptor exhibits a readily identified activity. The greatest degree of selectivity in the interaction of a receptor with a G protein was encountered at the level of the β1-adrenergic receptor and Gs. Gs was activated only by the β1-adrenergic receptor, and the receptor had no action on any G protein but Gs. The pairing of the β1-adrenergic receptor and Gs was obviously expected (36Asano T. Pedersen S.E. Scott C.W. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5460-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Another possible interaction with Gs, involving the NK1 receptor, was also sought, since an earlier report had linked this receptor not only to the activation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis but, at very high concentrations of agonist, to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (37Nakajima Y. Tsuchida K. Negishi M. Ito S. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2437-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we were unable to observe any interaction between the NK1 receptor and Gs. We suspect that the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase observed previously was indirect. With respect to Gq, the activation by thrombin and NK1 receptors was anticipated, though, as for all other pairings but that of the β1-adrenergic receptor and Gs, had not been measured directly in previous work. The stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by thrombin in most types of cells is largely insensitive to PTX, implying the use of a Gq-like protein (38Coughlin S.R. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 270-277PubMed Google Scholar). Sensitivity to PTX, though partial, is common, however, suggesting at least some contribution by Gi. That thrombin can communicate with Gi is quite clear from its ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase through a PTX-sensitive element in a large number of cells. Conjoint utilization by thrombin of Gq and Gi is consistent with our data, wherein Gz is used as a representative of the Gi family. Substance P also stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis in a PTX-insensitive fashion (39Laniyonu A. Sliwinski-Lis E. Fleming N. FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the addition of Gq/11 to phospholipid vesicles containing NK1 receptors results in conversion of the receptors to a high affinity state (40Kwatra M.M. Schwinn D.A. Schreurs J. Blank J.L. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Krause J.E. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9161-9164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Utilization of Gi (and hence Gz in our experiments here) by NK1 receptors is less well documented. However, the NK1 receptor appears to regulate a large conductance Cl− channel through a member of the Gi family (41Sun X.P. Supplisson S. Mayer E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G774-G785PubMed Google Scholar). The list of receptors that activate Gz can now be extended to those for thrombin and substance P. We were most interested in the potential of the different receptors to activate G12 and G13. Receptors normally linked to these G proteins are poorly characterized, and effectors have not yet been identified. Our results clearly demonstrate that thrombin and NK1 receptors link to the activation of G12 and G13, while β1-adrenergic and 5-HT1A receptors do not. That thrombin should utilize these G proteins is consistent with its ability to support incorporation of [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide into α12 and α13 in platelet membranes (16Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and with the block of thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis with an antibody directed toward α12 (42Aragay A.M. Collins L.R. Post G.R. Watson A.J. Feramisco J.R. Brown J.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20073-20077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our results substantiate the capacity of the cloned receptor for thrombin (43Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2640) Google Scholar), as distinct from a recently deduced second receptor (44Connolly A.J. Ishihara H. Kahn M.L. Farese R.V. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), to achieve the activation. It is intriguing that the two receptors that activate G12 and G13 here, the cloned thrombin and NK1 receptors, also activate Gq and Gz. Whether activation of the latter two G proteins conjointly is predictive of coupling to G12 and G13 is worth pursuit. We were also interested to note that the β1-adrenergic receptor does not couple to G12 or G13, as several reports had indicated that β-adrenergic receptors activate Na+/H+ exchange, a correlate of G12 or G13 activation (6Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), independently of Gs (45Barber D.L. McGuire M.E. Ganz M.B. J. Biol.

The fact that the 5-HT1A receptor does not couple to G12 and G13 is also notable. Serotonin operating through 5-HT1A receptors is not viewed to be a complete mitogen, but thrombin is (47Pouysségur J. Seuwen K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the mitogenic properties of thrombin are linked to the activation of G12 and G13. Overexpression of α12 or α13, or expression of GTPase-deficient mutants, is linked to unregulated cell growth (6Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells constitute a well defined, intact cell setting upon which the expression of mammalian receptors and G proteins can be superimposed. Our data support the conclusion that GTPγS binding is an effective means of monitoring activation of G proteins by receptors. Our data also define the interactions of several receptors with representatives of each family of G protein. Novel interactions have been identified, and their authenticity is supported by the selectivity in interactions otherwise predicted from measurements of second messenger regulation. We anticipate that the Sf9 reconstitution system will lend itself to the analysis of inverse agonism and the coupling achieved by orphan receptors. We also propose the use of the Sf9 reconstitution system for developing or otherwise optimizing techniques to map receptor·;G protein communication in mammalian cells."

Considerable effort has been devoted to studying how soluble proteins are selectively targeted and translocated across biological membranes. In contradistinction, similar questions dealing with the biogenesis of complex membrane proteins in Escherichia coli remained poorly understood. The involvement of cell factors in the biosynthetic pathway of membrane proteins, unlike translocated proteins, is also unknown, and recent studies on the role of the Sec machinery in this process are contradicting (1Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12392-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2Bassilana M. Gwizdek C. EMBO J. 1966; 15: 5202-5208Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Another unresolved question is how prokaryotic membrane proteins are targeted to the cytoplasmic membrane, and what are the cellular mediators of this process. In mammalian cells, targeting of many membrane and secretory proteins is mediated by the signal recognition particle (SRP) 1The abbreviation used is: SRPsignal recognition peptide. machinery (3Nunnari J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that E. coli contains essential genes encoding Ffh and FtsY with a significant similarity to proteins of the eukaryotic SRP machinery (7Römisch K. Webb J. Herz J. Prehn S.

Nature. 1989; 340: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The function of these proteins in translocation has remained controversial, since their depletion induces only relatively small translocation defects for some secretory proteins (9Phillips G.J. Silhavy T.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 10Luirink J. Hagen-Jongman C.M. der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, their role in biogenesis of membrane proteins is not yet clear. In this study we present evidence obtained in vivo that FtsY, the E. coli SRP-receptor homologue, is essential for expression of membrane proteins. signal recognition peptide. To study the possibility that the E. coli SRP-receptor homologue, FtsY, is required for biosynthesis of polytopic membrane proteins, we used the E. coli strain N4156::pAra14-FtsYʹ (10Luirink J. Hagen-Jongman C.M. der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) which contains a chromosomal copy of the essential ftsY gene under the control of the tight araB promoter (instead of the native ftsY) and therefore requires arabinose for growth (10Luirink J. Hagen-Jongman C.M. der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The effect of arabinose depletion on cell growth was analyzed at various times after the cultures were transferred to arabinose-free medium. Arabinose-depleted cells begin to show a growth defect relative to wild-type cells after 4 h (Fig. 1A). The expression of FtsY in cells grown in the absence of arabinose is markedly reduced after 2 h and essentially ceases after 4 h (Fig. 1B). The level of the cytoplasmic protein β-galactosidase is similar in induced or uninduced cells (Fig. 1, C and G), while the amount of the membrane protein lac permease is dramatically decreased in the absence of arabinose, both in membrane preparations and in whole cell extracts (Fig. 1, D and G). Since β-galactosidase and lac permease are expressed from the same operon, the difference in their expression pattern must reflect post-transcriptional, FtsY-related events. The pattern of β-lactamase expression is similar to that of β-galactosidase (Fig. 1, E and G), being only slightly affected in FtsY-depleted cells, while the accumulation of the chromosomally encoded protein, SecY, is markedly inhibited (Fig. 1, F and G). SecY is a multispanning membrane protein that functions as a component of the translocation machinery (reviewed in Ref. 11Arkowitz R.A. Bassilana M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 311-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, E and H, and in agreement with previous studies (10Luirink J. Hagen-Jongman C.M. der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), the efficiency of the translocation of β-lactamase decreases during FtsY depletion, as judged by the accumulation of pre-β-lactamase. These results show that the synthesis of the two membrane proteins tested (SecY and lac permease) is greatly reduced in FtsY-depleted cells, whereas that of a secretory protein (β-lactamase) is only slightly affected and that of a cytoplasmic protein (β-galactosidase) not at all. A possible explanation for the results is that the translation of membrane proteins is arrested in the absence of FtsY, mimicking the translation arrest observed in the mammalian targeting system (12Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 13Meyer D.I. Krause E. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1982; 297: 503-508Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 14Weidmann M. Kurzchalia T.V. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Such an arrest would lead to a deficient number of functional translocation complexes in the membrane and, consequently, to the accumulation of pre-proteins, especially those with lower affinities to the translocation site. Provided that FtsY depletion causes a translational arrest in the case of membrane proteins, then reinduction of FtsY is expected to release this arrest. To test this suggestion, we performed an experiment in which arabinose was added to FtsY-depleted cells. As shown in Fig. 2, addition of arabinose restores both the cell growth (Fig. 2A) and the expression of FtsY (Fig. 2, B and C) after 1 h. Similarly, rapid restoration of expression of the membrane proteins lac permease (Fig. 2, D and E) and SecY (Fig. 2, F and G) is apparent. However, the resumption of β-lactamase processing occurs only 2 h later (Fig. 2, H and I). Interestingly, during the 2-h lag after addition of arabinose, the processing of pre-β-lactamase is significantly inhibited compared to uninduced cells, in a highly reproducible manner (Fig. 2I). A speculative explanation is that immediately after induction of FtsY, many newly synthesized membrane proteins in addition to pre-proteins which have been accumulated during the FtsY depletion period, would compete, some of them with better affinities than β-lactamase, for the limited number of translocation sites. In any case, the translocation defect seen for β-lactamase may be caused indirectly via the depletion of SecY and other components of the translocation complex. Our results reveal that the biogenesis of membrane proteins such as lac permease and SecY is strongly dependent on FtsY. Although the mechanism of targeting of membrane proteins in bacteria is still an open question, the involvement of FtsY supports a co-translational pathway, analogous to the mammalian SRP-mediated pathway. Previous observations that FtsY is located both in the cytoplasm and in association with the inner membrane (10Luirink J. Hagen-Jongman C.M. der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 15Gill F. Salmond G.P.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 210: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) indicate that it may function not only in the last stage of membrane protein targeting, but also in directing the translation complex to the membrane, possibly via an interaction with the prokaryotic SRP-like complex (16Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The present assignment of FtsY as an important participant in the biosynthetic pathway of membrane proteins provides a reasonable explanation for the observations that FtsY is essential for growth (10Luirink J. Hagen-Jongman C.M. der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 17Gill D.R. Salmond G.P. Mol.

In situ hybridization analysis showed that IGIF is synthesized in the adrenal cortex, specifically in the zona reticularis and fasciculata that produce glucocorticoids. The presence of IGIF mRNA was also detected in the neurohypophysis although induction by stress was not significant. Our results call for more attention to the role of the adrenal gland as a potential effector of immunomodulation and suggest that IGIF itself might be a secreted neuroimmunomodulator and play an important role in orchestrating the immune system following a stressful experience.

We demonstrate that a similar enhancer, which contains a DR5 RARE, is located at a DNase I-hypersensitive site 3ʹ of the murine Hoxb-1 gene.

Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-350Google Scholar). Animals that lack more than one normal RAR show developmental abnormalities that correspond to those seen in vitamin A deficiencies, definitely demonstrating the importance of signal transduction by the retinoic acid receptors in vertebrate development (40Lohnes D. Mark M. Mendelsohn C. Doll' P. Dierich A. Gorry P. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Development. 1994; 120: 2723-2748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Mendelsohn C. Lohnes D.D.D. Lufkin T. Le Meur M. Chambon P. Mark M. Development. 1994; 120: 2749-2771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence that retinoids were involved in the regulation of homeobox genes initially came from cell culture studies (42Breier G.M.B. Francke U. Colberg-Poley A.M. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2209-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 43Colberg-Poley A.M. Voss S.D. Chowdhury K. Gruss P.

In both human and murine teratocarcinoma cells, retinoic acid can induce the expression of many homeobox genes. This retinoic acid inducibility, like the expression pattern of genes in the embryo, corresponds to the order of the genes in the cluster (46Simeone A. Acampora D. Arcioni L. Andrews P.W. Boncinelli E. Mavilio F. Nature. 1990; 346: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 47Simeone A. Acampora D. Nigro V. Faiella A. D'Esposito M. Stornaiuolo A. Mavilio F. Boncinelli E. Mech. Dev. 1991; 33: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, the 3ʹ most genes in each chromosomal cluster, e.g. HOXA1 and HOXB1, are the first to be induced by RA. This induction is transient in that it is observed over a 12-24-h period, which is followed by a decline in expression (44LaRosa G.J. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 45LaRosa G.J. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 46Simeone A. Acampora D.

Mavilio F. Boncinelli E. Mech. Dev. 1991; 33: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Co-linear RA responsiveness has also been demonstrated in mouse and Xenopus embryos (17Papalopulu N. Clarke J.D. Bradley L. Wilkinson D. Krumlauf R. Holder N. Development. 1991; 113: 1145-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Cho K.W. De Robertis E.M.

Durston A. Mech. Dev. 1993; 40: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the expression of Hox genes is controlled in part by retinoic acid or by other retinoids that activate the retinoic acid receptors. The murine Hoxa-1 gene is the 3ʹ most homeobox gene in the “Hox a” chromosomal cluster on mouse chromosome 6 (51Hunt P. Krumlauf R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 227-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Previously, we described the identification of a retinoic acid-responsive enhancer located approximately 4.5 kilobases 3ʹ of the murine Hoxa-1 gene (formerly Hox 1.6; see Scott (52Scott M.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 551-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) for nomenclature). This enhancer, called the Hoxa-1 RAIDR5, was shown to be required for retinoic acid inducibility of Hoxa-1 in cultured F9 and P19 teratocarcinoma cells, and the ~300-bp enhancer functioned in either orientation when placed upstream of the basal TK promoter (53Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this enhancer function was shown to require a DR5 RARE since point mutations within the RARE abolished RA inducibility (53Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We now report the identification of very similar enhancers located 3ʹ of the murine and chicken Hoxb-1 (formerly called Hox 2.9) genes. The murine Hoxb-1 gene is the 3ʹ most homeobox gene in the “Hox b” chromosome cluster on mouse chromosome 11 (51Hunt P. Krumlauf R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 227-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We also report the identification of a highly conserved 3ʹ enhancer in the human HOXA1 gene. We demonstrate that these related RAIDR5 enhancers all mediate retinoic acid responsiveness in cultured cells and share common sequence elements, including a DR5 RARE. The human HOXA1 clones were isolated from a genomic library from human lymphocyte DNA in λEMBL3 obtained from Dr. Winnie Wong. Standard hybridization conditions were modified by reduction of formamide concentration to 25%, and the probe used was the PstI-EcoRI fragment containing the 3ʹ RA-responsive enhancer from the murine Hoxa-1 gene (53Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Hoxb-1 and Hoxd-1 genomic clones were isolated from λFIX (Stratagene) and λEMBL (constructed by Anton Berns) libraries containing 129SV genomic DNA. The Hoxb-1 cDNA probe was provided by Dr. Joseph Grippo. The chicken Hoxb-1 phage (54Sundin O.H. Busse H.G. Rogers M.B. Gudas L.J. Eichele G. Development. 1990; 108: 47-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Gregor Eichele. Library screening, phage purification, and DNA isolation were by standard methods (55Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Standard methods were used to subclone DNA fragments from genomic phage into Bluescript, pBLCAT2 (56Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6490Google Scholar), or pGOTKCAT. The latter is a derivative of pGL2 (Promega) in which the luciferase gene is replaced by the TK minimal promoter and the CAT reporter from pBLCAT2 and includes a transcriptional terminator upstream of the polylinker to reduce background. Transient transfections, CAT assays, and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (53Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Quantitation of CAT assays was carried out using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). β-Galactosidase units were calculated by the formula: β-gal units = (A420) (100)/(volume of lysate per reaction) (time). Conserved elements 1 and 2 were mutated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of subcloned enhancer fragments with the following oligonucleotides, paired with primers to flanking plasmid sequences: CE1, top strand: 5ʹ-CTGAGGATCCCGGAGGCTATTCAGATGC-3ʹ; CE1, bottom strand: 5ʹ-GGGATCCTCAGCTCAAAGGTGAACCCAAAGC-3ʹ; CE2, top strand: 5ʹ-CGCTCTGCAGAACAGTCTGAAAGGGTTG3-ʹ; and CE2, bottom strand: 5ʹ-TGTTCTGCAGTTGATCGGTTTGAAT-3ʹ. These oligomers are complementary to sequences adjacent to conserved elements 1 and 2, but their 3ʹ tails are noncomplementary and contain unique restriction sites. Following polymerase chain reaction, products were cut with appropriate enzymes, purified, and ligated. Plasmid primers were then used to amplify the fragments containing disrupted CE1 or CE2. To generate an enhancer with mutations in both CE1 and CE2, the process was repeated with a fragment containing mutations in CE1, using the oligonucleotides to CE2. Products were sequenced to confirm that the mutations in the conserved elements were the only changes introduced. Mutated DNA fragments were then cloned into the Hoxa-1 (1.6) lacZ minigenes (see Fig. 5). These minigenes differ from the previously described constructs (53Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) in that the 3ʹ end of the lacZ gene is joined to the PvuII site at bp 203 of the Hoxa-1 (1.6) cDNA. The resulting constructs include the constitutive intron of Hoxa-1, unlike the minigenes used in previous work (53Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and lack only 44 base pairs of exon 1. Approximately 1 × 107 F9 or P19 teratocarcinoma cells, either stem (control, undifferentiated, untreated) or retinoic acid treated for 48 h, were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in two packed cell volumes of cell lysis buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0; 3 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, 8 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.2% Nonidet P-40). Cells were lysed for 5 min at 4°C and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Nuclei were resuspended in two packed nuclear volumes of extraction buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.42 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 25% glycerol) and incubated for 45 min at 4°C with gentle shaking. Samples were centrifuged at high speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. Supernatants were removed and dialyzed for 5 h at 4°C against 50 volumes of dialysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9; 0.1 M KCl; 0.2 mM EDTA; 0.5 mM DTT; 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 20% glycerol). Dialyzed samples were aliquoted and stored at -70°C. The sequences of complementary CE2 oligonucleotides used as probe in the binding assays are: sense CE2, GGCAAACCGATCAATATTTACTCAGTCTGA; and antisense CE2, GGTCAGACTGAGTAAATATTGATCGGTTTG. The mutated CE2 oligonucleotides are identical to those above except they contain the dinucleotide substitutions as indicated in Fig. 6. The sequence of the AP-1 consensus oligonucleotides are: sense AP-1, AACTTTGACTCAG; and antisense AP-1, CTGAGTCAAAGTT. Complementary nucleotides were annealed by heating at 85°C for 2 min, followed by successive 15 min incubations at 65, 37, 22, and 4°C. The double-stranded oligonucleotide to be used as probe was end-labeled by filling in 5ʹ overhangs with an [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme. Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing: 0.5 ng (50,000 cpm) of probe, 5 μg of nuclear extract, 1 × binding buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol), and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). Samples were incubated for 20 min at 22°C and separated on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was dried and visualized by autoradiography. Supershift experiments were performed similarly to the standard binding assay with the following modifications. Following the 20-min 22°C incubation, 2 μl of either anti-Fos or anti-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the binding reaction and incubated another 2 h at 4°C. Samples were separated on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 4°C. Binding reactions were carried out in a 20-μl volume as described in the previous section. Following a 20-min incubation, the reactions were exposed to 254-nm wavelength ultraviolet light from a hand-held luminometer for 10 min at a distance of 5 cm. 20 μl of 2 × SDS-sample buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mM DTT, 4% (w/v) SDS, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 20% (w/v) glycerol) were added to each reaction, and the samples were boiled for 5 min to denature proteins. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis utilizing a 5% stacking gel and an 8% separating gel. A 10-kDa protein ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) was run as a size standard. To visualize the protein standards, the gel was stained overnight in Coomassie Blue staining solution (50% (v/v), methanol 0.05% (v/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and 40% H2O) and destained for several hours in 5% (v/v) methanol, 7% (v/v) acetic acid, and 88% H2O. The gel was then dried and visualized by autoradiography. Since we had previously identified a retinoic acid-responsive enhancer located about 4.5 kb 3ʹ of the start site of transcription of the murine Hoxa-1 gene (53Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether or not this enhancer sequence was conserved in other Hox genes located in the most 3ʹ position of Hox chromosomal clusters such as the murine Hoxb-1 gene, the chicken Hoxb-1 gene, and the human HOXA1 gene. Genomic clones for the murine Hoxa-1 and Hoxb-1 genes, the human HOXA1 gene, and the chicken Hoxb-1 gene were isolated or obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” (Murine Hox genes are labeled using small letters, human Hox genes with capital letters (52Scott M.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 551-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar).) DNA hybridization experiments demonstrated that the human and murine Hoxa-1 genes were homologous not only in their transcribed regions, but also in portions of their 3ʹ-flanking DNA. DNA fragments containing the ~300-bp murine Hoxa-1 retinoic acid-responsive enhancer, called RAIDR5 (53Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), were used to identify homologous sequences in the human HOXA1 gene. This fragment of human DNA was tested for the presence of a retinoic acid-responsive enhancer by subcloning cross-hybridizing DNA fragments into a minimal promoter-CAT vector and transfecting these constructs into F9 or P19 teratocarcinoma cells. The structure of the human HOXA1 gene, and the location of the 3ʹ RA-responsive enhancer are shown in Fig. 1. One NsiI-SacI restriction fragment mediates retinoic acid responsiveness in transient transfection assays (Fig. 1). Thus, a retinoic acid-responsive enhancer is present about 4.5 kb 3ʹ of the human HOXA1 gene, in a location very similar to that which we previously described for the murine Hoxa-1 gene (53Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). DNase I hypersensitivity assays were used to map a putative retinoic acid-responsive enhancer near the murine Hoxb-1 gene using the same strategy employed to identify the RA-responsive enhancer 3ʹ of the Hoxa-1 gene (53Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Following RA treatment of F9 murine teratocarcinoma cells, a DNase I hypersensitive site was detected approximately 6.5 kb 3ʹ of the Hoxb-1 gene (data not shown; position of the hypersensitive site is indicated by the open arrow in Fig. 2). Minimal promoter-CAT vectors containing a series of DNA fragments including and surrounding the location of the RA-inducible hypersensitive site were shown to mediate responsiveness to retinoic acid, as shown in Fig. 2. More specifically, an NsiI-SacI fragment which includes the region of the hypersensitive site was shown to be sufficient for RA inducibility in the transient transfection assays in either F9 (Fig. 2) or P19 cells (data not shown). The chicken Hoxb-1 (2.9) genomic phage DNA was analyzed for 3ʹ enhancer activity by subcloning restriction fragments of the 3ʹ-flanking DNA and testing various fragments for RA inducibility. In transient transfection experiments, an approximately 2-kb BamHI-EcoRI DNA fragment located 3ʹ of the chicken Hoxb-1 gene was shown to confer RA responsiveness on a minimal promoter (Fig. 3). Other 3ʹ chicken DNA fragments lacked the ability to confer RA responsiveness (Fig. 3, and data not shown). The aligned sequences of the RA-responsive enhancers from the murine Hoxa-1, the human HOXA1, and the murine and chicken Hoxb-1 genes are presented in Fig. 4. First, it is striking that two different homeobox genes, Hoxa-1 and Hoxb-1, located on different chromosomes, have such similar sequences in their RA-inducible enhancers. Second, with respect to the mouse Hoxa-1 and human HOXA1 3ʹ retinoid-responsive enhancers, the region of near identity shown in Fig. 4 is part of a large block of conserved sequence. Furthermore, homology of the Hoxa-1 and b-1 enhancers among different species is particularly noteworthy, given that these DNA sequences come from species separated by an estimated 300 million years of evolution (57Gilbert W. Marchionni M. McKnight G. Cell. 1986; 46: 151-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As expected from the ability of these enhancers to mediate RA responsiveness, all four enhancers include a DR5 (direct repeat 5) RARE. The half sites of these RAREs are precisely conserved, as is their separation by 5 base pairs. Thus, these ~300-bp enhancers are called the Hoxa-1 RAIDR5 and Hoxb-1 RAIDR5. Two other conserved elements (CE1 and CE2; boxed in Fig. 4) are also present in all four enhancers. The conservation of these sequences is equivalent to that of the RARE, suggesting that CE1 and CE2 play equally important roles in controlling the expression of the vertebrate homeobox genes. Therefore, we examined the functions of the CE1 and CE2 elements in more detail using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transient transfection experiments. To examine the functional importance of CE1 and CE2, mutations were introduced that altered each nucleotide of CE1 and CE2, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In addition, a double mutation in which both CE1 and CE2 elements were disrupted and another mutation in which the conserved RARE was specifically mutated were also characterized. These mutations were made in the context of a Hoxa-1 minigene/lacZ reporter construct that contains the lacZ gene inserted into the coding sequence of Hoxa-1 as well as 6.5 kb of 5ʹ-flanking region and about 3 kb of 3ʹ-flanking DNA (53Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). P19 teratocarcinoma cells were first transiently transfected with these constructs, and cells were either untreated (stem) or treated for 24 h with RA. The results from the untreated P19 stem cells showed that mutation of the CE1 element did not significantly change β-galactosidase activity as com"

Non-aged Aβ1-42 impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity by activating mitochondrial τ protein kinase I/glycogen synthase kinase-3β, as we have already shown in hippocampal neurons (Hoshi, M., Takashima, A., Noguchi, K., Murayama, M., Sato, M., Kondo, S., Saitoh, Y., Ishiguro, K., Hoshino, T., and Imahori, K.

In our previous work, aggregated Aβ25-35, an active portion of Aβ, was shown to suppress pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity in hippocampal neuronal cultures and to result in energy failure, which probably contributes to neuronal death, together with abnormal phosphorylation of τ (1Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Since PDH provides acetyl-CoA for acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis in cholinergic neurons, the above finding suggests the direct involvement of Aβ in the cholinergic abnormality in AD by inhibiting PDH activity. Among Aβ species generated in vivo from amyloid precursor protein (APP), Aβ1-40 is a major product of soluble Aβs and is constitutively secreted in culture medium and cerebrospinal fluid, while Aβ1-42 is produced in a lesser amount (18Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Esch F. Lee M. Dovey H. Davis D. Sinha S. Schlossmacher M. Whaley J. Swindlehurst C. McCormack R. Wolfert R. Selkoe D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D.

Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that increased production of Aβ1-42 is the primary event that leads to the formation of amyloid plaques in AD. Therefore, we focused on the effect of Aβ1-42 on cholinergic function using a primary neuronal culture as an in vitro model system. We report here that Aβ1-42 freshly solubilized in water impairs ACh synthesis in cholinergic neurons without affecting neuronal survival. Recently, the pool of oligomeric water-soluble Aβ1-42 was found to be uniquely elevated in AD compared with normal brain (2Kuo Y.-M. Emmerling M.R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Kasunic T.C. Kirkpatrick J.B. Murdoch G.H. Ball M.J. Roher A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4077-4081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Taken together, the findings suggest a possible role of soluble Aβ1-42 in AD pathogenesis in addition to its contribution to amyloid plaque formation. Synthetic Aβ1-40 peptide was synthesized and purified as described previously (20Takashima A. Noguchi K. Sato K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7789-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Synthetic Aβ1-42 peptide was obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Lyophilized peptides were stored at -20°C. Non-aged Aβs were prepared by freshly dissolving the lyophilized peptides in autoclaved MilliQ water to 200 μM just before use. Aged Aβ1-42 was produced by dissolving the peptide in autoclaved MilliQ water to 350 μM and incubating at 37°C for 7 days as previously reported (21Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Primary cultures from rat septum regions, which include septal and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, were prepared and plated (1Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). After 3 days, the medium was changed to serum-free neurobasal medium with B27 and L-glutamate supplements (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two days later, non-aged Aβ was added to the medium. Intracellular ACh was determined using an HPLC-electrochemical detector system (1Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 22Potter P.E. Meek J.L. Neff N.H. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Rate of ACh synthesis from [2-14C]pyruvate was measured by the modified method of Gibson et al. (23Gibson G.E. Jope R. Blass J.P. Biochem. J. 1975; 148: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated with various concentrations of non-aged Aβ1-42 for 12 h, and [2-14C]pyruvate (1 μCi/ml) was added to the medium. After a 40-min incubation, cultures were washed with PBS, extracted with 5 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, and scraped off. Supernatants were recovered by centrifugation, and ACh was extracted by adding 14 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing sodium tetraphenylborate and acetonitrile, followed by toluene-based scintillant. Incorporation of radioactivity from [2-14C]pyruvate into ACh was proportional to time, and the rate of ACh synthesis was calculated as cpm/min. ChAT activity was assayed as described (1Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). ATP content in the culture was measured by Luciferase reaction using a Promega kit (FF2000 and FF2040) with a luminometer, Lumat LB9501/16 (Berthold Japan, Tokyo). AChE activity was determined in terms of production of [3H]acetate from [acetyl-3H]choline iodide as described (24Johnson C.D. Russell R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Choline uptake by the culture was measured as described (25Marchbanks R.M. Wonnacott S. Rubio M.A. J. Neurochem. 1981; 36: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated with various concentrations of non-aged Aβ1-42 for 12 h, and [methyl-3H]choline chloride (3 μCi/ml) was added to the medium. Forty min later, cultures were washed four times with PBS, treated with trichloroacetic acid (5% w/v), and scraped off. Supernatants were obtained by centrifugation, neutralized with 1 M Tris buffer (pH 7.8), and counted for radioactivity in toluene-based scintillant. PDH activity was measured as production of [14C]acetyl-CoA from [2-14C]pyruvate with an excess amount of ChAT, which converted the produced [14C]acetyl-CoA into [14C]ACh. After non-aged Aβ1-42 treatment, cultures were washed with PBS, scraped off in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100, frozen, and thawed. This homogenate was incubated at 37°C for 40 min in the standard reaction buffer for PDH activity (1Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The reaction was terminated by adding 14 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing sodium tetraphenylborate and acetonitrile, followed by toluene-based scintillant. AChE staining was performed as described (26Hefti F. Hartikka J. Eckenstein F. Gnahn H. Heumann R. Schwab M. Neuroscience. 1985; 14: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Briefly, after aged Aβ1-42 or non-aged Aβ1-42 treatments at 10 μM for 24 h, cultures were washed with PBS, fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, washed with PBS, and then incubated for 3 days at 4°C in 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 4 mM acetylthiocholine iodide, 2 mM copper sulfate, 10 mM glycine, and 10 mg/ml gelatin. Nonspecific cholinesterases were inhibited by addition of 0.2 mM ethopropagine in the above medium. Then, the gelatin was dissolved by incubation at 37°C. Cultures were washed with water, exposed for 1 min to 1.25% Na2S, washed with water, and exposed for 1 min to 1% AgNO3. After non-aged Aβ1-42 treatment, mitochondrial pellets were prepared from the culture (1Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TPKI/GSK-3β activity was determined by an immunoprecipitation assay using modified phosphoglycogen synthase peptide as a substrate (1Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Primary septal cultures have been established from rat septum regions that include septal and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (1Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Aβ is normally secreted in vivo as a soluble form, which aggregates into insoluble amyloid fibrils to form amyloid plaques (21Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 27Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic Aβ required preincubation for 2-7 days at 37°C to produce insoluble amyloid fibrils, which were cytotoxic to septal cultures (Fig. 1, B and F), as is consistent with the previous report (21Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Here, we use synthetic Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 peptides solubilized freshly in distilled water, which we designate as non-aged Aβ1-40 and non-aged Aβ1-42, respectively. Non-aged Aβ1-40 did not present any toxicity to septal cultures. Since soluble Aβ1-42 is known to aggregate into insoluble, toxic amyloid fibrils more rapidly than Aβ1-40 (28Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), we have examined the cytotoxicity of non-aged Aβ1-42 at concentrations up to 10 μM. Septal cultures treated with non-aged Aβ1-42 at 10 μM for 24 h (Fig. 1C) were morphologically indistinguishable from the control (Fig. 1A). No difference was observed between the control culture and the culture treated with non-aged Aβ1-42 for 48 h (data not shown). The cellular ATP level was stable after non-aged Aβ1-42 treatment for 12 h (Fig. 1D), indicating that non-aged Aβ1-42 at concentrations up to 10 μM did not disturb the energy metabolism in the culture. Histochemical staining for AChE, a marker enzyme of cholinergic neurons, revealed that cholinergic neurons were not affected by non-aged Aβ1-42 treatment at 10 μM for 24 h (Fig. 1, E and G). ChAT activity, another marker of cholinergic neurons, was not decreased by exposure of the neurons to non-aged Aβ1-42 for 12 h (Fig. 1H). Thus, non-aged Aβ1-42 was not cytotoxic to cholinergic neurons in culture. These results suggest that neither non-aged Aβ1-42 nor non-aged Aβ1-40 used in our experiments formed toxic amyloid fibrils. Primary septal cultures were treated with either non-aged Aβ1-40 or non-aged Aβ1-42 for 12 h, and the intracellular ACh level was determined by means of HPLC with an electrochemical detector system (1Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 22Potter P.E. Meek J.L. Neff N.H. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Non-aged Aβ1-42 at a saturating concentration of 100 nM reduced the intracellular ACh level to ~40% of the control after a 12-h treatment, whereas non-aged Aβ1-40 was ineffective (Fig. 2A). Since neither non-aged Aβ1-40 nor non-aged Aβ1-42 was neurotoxic, cholinergic neuronal loss cannot be the cause of the reduced ACh level. Therefore, the decline in the intracellular ACh level results either from reduced ACh synthesis or from accelerated ACh release. Non-aged Aβ1-42 at 10 nM caused a significant reduction in the intracellular ACh level (Fig. 2A). A corresponding reduction was induced in the synthesis rate of ACh from pyruvate by treatment with non-aged Aβ1-42 at 10 nM for 12 h (Fig. 2B). Thus, reduced ACh synthesis is primarily responsible for the decline in the intracellular ACh level after non-aged Aβ1-42 treatment. Treatment of non-aged Aβ1-42 at zero time affected neither the intracellular ACh level nor the ACh synthesis rate. The results suggest Aβ1-42 remaining in the cell lysate has no direct effect on the assay procedures, but non-aged Aβ1-42 works on the living neurons to disturb the ACh synthesis. ACh is synthesized from choline and acetyl-CoA by ChAT, which is not rate-limiting under normal conditions (29Marchbanks R.M. Cottrell G.A. Usherwood P.N.R. Synapses. Blackie, Glasgow1977: 81-101Google Scholar). Treatment with non-aged Aβ1-42 for 12 h did not change ChAT activity (Figs. 1H and 3A). Therefore, a reduced supply of either choline or acetyl-CoA accounts for the decline in ACh synthesis. Neurons obtain choline mainly from the diet using a specialized transporter system that also salvages free choline generated from ACh released intrasynaptically by AChE (30Wurtman R.J. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Treatment with non-aged Aβ1-42 did not interfere with this choline uptake system, since we found no statistically significant change in the choline uptake in the case of non-aged Aβ1-42 treatment (Fig. 3A). In accordance with AChE cytochemistry (Fig. 1, E and G), AChE activity was stable after non-aged Aβ1-42 treatment for 12 h (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that non-aged Aβ1-42 did not influence choline turnover in cholinergic neurons. This implies that a reduced supply of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate must be critical (Fig. 2B). In adult mammalian brain, acetyl-CoA is mainly produced by oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by mitochondrial PDH complex. Non-aged Aβ1-42 at a saturating concentration of 100 nM reduced PDH activity to ~30% of the control (Fig. 3B), which corresponds well with the dose-dependent reductions of the intracellular ACh level (Fig. 2A) and ACh synthesis rate (Fig. 2B). Non-aged Aβ1-42 treatment for 3 h was enough to cause maximal inhibition of PDH activity in the culture. Correspondingly, the intracellular ACh reached the lowest level after non-aged Aβ1-42 exposure for 3 h. Thus, it appears that non-aged Aβ1-42 suppressed ACh synthesis mainly by inhibiting PDH activity and so reducing the availability of acetyl-CoA. PDH activity is regulated by phosphorylation (31Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 32Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26602-26606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously found that PDH is phosphorylated and inactivated by TPKI/GSK-3β in vitro as well as in Aβ25-35-treated hippocampal neurons (1Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In septal cultures, 10 nM Aβ1-42 was enough to activate mitochondrial TPKI/GSK-3β by 2-fold (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that TPKI/GSK-3β is the main mediator of the inactivation of PDH by non-aged Aβ1-42 in cholinergic neurons, as previously found in hippocampal neurons. Aβ1-42, a minor species in normal APP metabolism, is highly aggregable (28Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), acts as a seed for amyloid fibrils (33Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury J.P.T.

APP mutation linked to familial AD (FAD) or an increased APP gene dosage in DS brain leads to a specific increase in Aβ1-42 production (19Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.-D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L.

Younkin S. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). These studies indicate a critical and central role for Aβ1-42 in amyloid plaque formation in AD. The findings presented here reveal a new aspect of Aβ1-42 function, implying a role in inducing cholinergic dysfunction, besides amyloid plaque formation. In the present work, we used Aβ1-42 freshly dissolved in water (non-aged Aβ1-42), which exhibited no neurotoxicity and was confirmed to be in an oligomeric state by laser light-scattering analysis (data not shown). Therefore, the non-aged Aβ1-42 used in our experiments probably does not form toxic amyloid fibrils, but does impair ACh synthesis in cholinergic neurons at very low concentrations (10-100 nM). Soluble Aβ1-42 production is uniquely elevated in brains of AD (2Kuo Y.-M. Emmerling M.R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Kasunic T.C. Kirkpatrick J.B. Murdoch G.H. Ball M.J. Roher A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4077-4081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) and DS patients before amyloid plaque formation (36Teller J.K. Russo C. DeBusk L.M. Angelini G. Zaccheo D. Dagna-Bricarelli F. Scartessini P. Bertolini S. Mann D.M.A. Tabaton M. Gambetti P. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of soluble Aβ1-42 in the pathogenesis. We hypothesize that soluble Aβ1-42 produced at an early stage of AD starts affecting cholinergic neurons by suppressing ACh synthesis, causes a reduction in ACh release, modulates synaptic connections, and finally results in cholinergic deficits, which may induce progressive loss of memory and cognitive function in AD patients. Thus, nontoxic, soluble Aβ1-42 may play a primary role in the cholinergic dysfunction of AD patients by suppressing ACh synthesis, besides contributing to amyloid plaque formation. TPKI/GSK-3β is present both in cytoplasm and in mitochondria in neurons (40Hoshi M. Sato M. Kondo S. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Takahashi M. Ishiguro K. Imahori K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 683-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We found that in cholinergic neurons non-aged Aβ1-42 at 10 nM activates mitochondrial TPKI/GSK-3β, which mediates the reduction in ACh synthesis via PDH inactivation, as we had previously shown in hippocampal neurons (1Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). One critical difference between the cholinergic and hippocampal systems lies in the energy metabolism. In the case of hippocampal neurons, activation of mitochondrial TPKI/GSK-3β by aggregated Aβ25-35 inactivates PDH, which causes the energy depletion (1Hoshi M. Takashima A. Noguchi K. Murayama M. Sato M. Kondo S. Saitoh Y. Ishiguro K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Hippocampal neurons may die as a result of insufficient energy supply, as well as abnormally phosphorylated τ that impairs axonal transport (41Takashima A. Yamaguchi H. Noguchi K. Michel G. Ishiguro K. Sato K. Hoshino T. Hoshi M. Imahori K. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 198: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, in the case of cholinergic neurons, inactivation of PDH activity by non-aged Aβ1-42 does not interfere with the energy metabolism and the neurons survive. We speculate that the anaplerotic pathway between glycolytic breakdown and the tricarboxylic acid cycle functions in cholinergic neurons, but aggregated Aβ inhibits this pathway in hippocampal neurons. Whether the difference in the energy metabolism depends on the Aβ species or on the neuronal species needs to be clarified. Based on the present study, we suggest that Aβ1-42 participates directly in the induction of cholinergic deficiency, as well as amyloid plaque formation in AD. Application of the findings presented here as a hypothetical in vitro model for AD pathogenesis should open up many possibilities for further research. We thank Dr. Y. Kasai and R.

In the current study we purified serine-phospholipid-selective phospholipase A and cloned its cDNA. The final preparation, purified from extracellular medium of activated rat platelets, gave a 55-kDa protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. [3H]Diisopropyl fluorophosphate, an inhibitor of the enzyme, labeled the 55-kDa protein, suggesting that this polypeptide possesses active serine residues. The cDNA for the enzyme was cloned from a rat megakaryocyte cDNA library. The predicted 456-amino acid sequence contains a putative short N-terminal signal sequence and a GXSXG sequence, which is a motif of an active serine residue of serine esterase. Amino acid sequence homology analysis revealed that the enzyme shares about 30% homology with mammalian lipases (lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase, and pancreatic lipase). Regions surrounding the putative active serine, histidine, and aspartic acid, which may form a “lipase triad,” were highly conserved among these enzymes. The recombinant protein, which we expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus system, hydrolyzed a fatty acyl residue at the sn-1 position of lysophosphatidylserine and phosphatidylserine, but did not appreciably hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, and triglyceride. The present enzyme, named phosphatidylserine-phospholipase A1, is the first phospholipase that exclusively hydrolyses the sn-1 position and has a strict head group specificity for the substrate.

Amino acid sequence homology analysis revealed that the enzyme shares about 30% homology with mammalian lipases (lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase, and pancreatic lipase). Regions surrounding the putative active serine, histidine, and aspartic acid, which may form a “lipase triad,” were highly conserved among these enzymes. The recombinant protein, which we expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus system, hydrolyzed a fatty acyl residue at the sn-1 position of lysophosphatidylserine and phosphatidylserine, but did not appreciably hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, and triglyceride. The present enzyme, named phosphatidylserine-phospholipase A1, is the first phospholipase that exclusively hydrolyses the sn-1 position and has a strict head group specificity for the substrate. INTRODUCTIONMembrane phospholipids of activated platelets serve as precursors for second messengers, such as eicosanoids, and also as footholds for blood coagulation. Platelets contain at least three types of phospholipase A; cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2phospholipase A2cPLA2cytosolic phospholipase A2sPLA2secretory phospholipase A2PLA1phospholipase A1DFPdiisopropyl fluorophosphatePSphosphatidylserinelyso-PSlysophosphatidylserineTGtriglycerideLPLlipoprotein lipaseHLhepatic lipasePLpancreatic lipasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionRACErapid amplification of cDNA ends.

Hayakawa M. Inoue K. Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); partially purified preparations specifically act on phosphatidylserine (PS) (6Yokoyama K. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1280-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) (4Horigome K. Hayakawa M. Inoue K. Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 5Higashi S. Kobayashi T. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This activity is inhibited both by diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and dithiothreitol to release a fatty acid of PS and lyso-PS, respectively (5Higashi S. Kobayashi T. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6Yokoyama K. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1280-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On several chromatography columns, PS-hydrolyzing activity co-migrates with lysophospholipase activity detected using lyso-PS as the substrate, suggesting that a single polypeptide may possess both PS-phospholipase A and lyso-PS-lysophospholipase activities. Therefore, throughout the present study we call this enzyme “PS-PLA1.”In this study, we report the purification and cDNA cloning of PS-PLA1. The predicted amino acid sequence did not show any homology to those of phospholipases that have been reported previously, but surprisingly it showed some homology to mammalian lipases such as hepatic lipase (HL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and pancreatic lipase (PL). Unlike these “conventional” lipases, the present platelet-derived enzyme did not exhibit appreciable activity to triacylglyceride (TG). Platelets release a novel phospholipase A, upon cell stimulation, that specifically acts on serine-phospholipids and not on any other lipids.DISCUSSIONIn this study we purified PS-PLA1 that was secreted from activated platelets and established its primary structure by cDNA cloning. The primary structure of the enzyme did not exhibit homology to any phospholipase A2 or lysophospholipase that has been reported previously (type I PLA2 (29Verheij H.M. de H.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), type II PLA2 (14Komada M. Kudo I. Mizushima H. Kitamura N. Inoue K. J. Biochem.

J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), human eosinophil lysophospholipase (32Ackerman S.J. Corrette S.E. Rosenberg H.F. Bennett J.C. Mastrianni D.M. Nicholson W.A. Weller P.F. Chin D.T. Tenen D.G. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 456-468PubMed Google Scholar), and rat pancreas lysophospholipase (33Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar)). Unexpectedly PS-PLA1 resembles some mammalian lipases (LPL, HL, and PL) although it did not show any detectable lipase activity.Substrate Specificity of PS-PLA1The recombinant form of PS-PLA1 hydrolyzed PS and lyso-PS at the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone to release a fatty acid (Fig. 7), but did not hydrolyze other phospholipids (Table III). A previous study using partially purified enzyme showed that the enzyme hydrolyzed lysophosphatidylserine but did not hydrolyze other lysophospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and lysophosphatidic acid (5Higashi S. Kobayashi T. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The enzyme did not hydrolyze TG, even though it did hydrolyze PS under the same conditions (Fig. 6), and porcine pancreatic lipase hydrolyzed TG (data not shown). Thus PS-PLA1 cannot hydrolyze TG, even though it shares some sequence homology with mammalian lipases. HL is known to possess both lipase and phospholipase activities. In addition, a phospholipase A1 from hornets, which has a sequence similarity of about 40% with mammalian lipases, has phospholipase A1 activity (using phosphatidylcholine as the substrate) and weak lipase activity (34Soldatova L. Kochoumian L. King T.P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of PS-PLA1 is different from that of lipases because it cannot react with TG, but does recognize the glycerophosphoserine structure and hydrolyzes a fatty acyl residue bound at the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone.Which part of the molecular structure of PS-PLA1 determines its substrate specificity? Under aqueous conditions, lipases are inactive, as the “catalytic triad” is buried beneath a short amphipathic α-helix (the “lid”) (23Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Compared with the lid amino acid sequences of other lipases, the putative lid of PS-PLA1 is extremely short (Fig. 5A). Rat LPL and HL have lids composed of 22 amino acids between two conserved cysteine residues, whereas the corresponding region in PS-PLA1 is composed of only 12 amino acid residues. It has been reported that the substrate specificities of LPL and HL are determined by the lids of the molecules (28Dugi K.A. Dichek H.L. Santamarina F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25396-25401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Guinea pig PL has a short lid and exhibits both phospholipase A1 and lipase activities (35Hjorth A. Carriere F. Cudrey C. Woldike H. Boel E. Lawson D.M. Ferrato F. Cambillau C. Dodson G.G. Thim L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4702-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and hornet phospholipase A1, which has only 7 amino acids in the corresponding region, has weak lipase activity (34Soldatova L. Kochoumian L. King T.P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus the “phospholipase A1 activity” of lipase family molecules may depend on the length and amino acid sequence of the lid.The mechanism by which PS-PLA1 specifically recognizes serine-phospholipids is not known at present. A cluster of positively charged amino acids (Lys and Arg) is present in the sequence of PS-PLA1 (348-353). It is interesting that the amino acid sequences around this cluster (VEFNLKEKRKKDT) resemble the PS-binding motif found in protein kinase C and PS decarboxylase (FXFXLKXXXXKXR) (36Igarashi K. Kaneda M. Yamaji A. Saido T.C. Kikkawa U. Ono Y. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29075-29078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of lipases around these regions are full of variety. This region may be responsible for determining the substrate specificity of PS-PLA1. Mutation studies will test this hypothesis.Glycoprotein Nature of PS-PLA1Of the known mammalian phospholipase As, rat platelet PS-PLA1 is the only one that is a glycoprotein. Three potential N-glycosylation sites are present in the deduced amino acid sequence of PS-PLA1. The idea that PS-PLA1 is a glycoprotein was confirmed by two additional observations: 1) in our preliminary experiments, PS-PLA1 and lyso-PS lysophospholipase activities were retained on concanavalin A-, WGA-, and RCA-Sepharose columns and were eluted by the hapten sugars of each lectin; and 2) the calculated molecular mass of PS-PLA1 is 47 kDa, whereas the purified protein had a molecular mass of 55 kDa by SDS-PAGE analysis. This difference may be due to the addition of an asparagine-linked sugar moiety because treatment of the purified protein with N-glycosidase F, which removes N-linked sugar moieties, reduced the molecular mass of platelet PS-PLA1 to 48 kDa (data not shown). The molecular mass of the recombinant protein, produced in a baculovirus system, was 50 kDa. The difference in molecular mass observed between rat platelet and recombinant PS-PLA1 may be due to differences in the sugar structure because the molecular mass of recombinant PS-PLA1 after N-glycosidase F treatment was also 48 kDa. A strict carbohydrate structure seems not to be required for PS-PLA1 activity. This fact is in contrast with LPL and HL, since it has been reported that an N-linked sugar on LPL and HL at the N-terminal (amino acid 75) is necessary for enzyme activity (26Ben Z.O. Stahnke G. Liu G. Davis R.C. Doolittle M.H. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1511-1523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Busca R. Pujana M.A. Pognonec P. Auwerx J. Deeb S.S. Reina M. Vilaro S. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 939-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PS-PLA1 has no homology with phospholipase B of Penicillium notatum (37Masuda N. Kitamura N. Saito K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or Saccharomyces cerevisiae (38Lee K.S. Patton J.L. Fido M. Hines L.K. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Henry S.A. Levin D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19725-19730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are glycoproteins.Secretion of PS-PLA1 from Activated PlateletsPS-PLA1 was released from rat platelets when the cells were stimulated with thrombin. The enzyme is also released in response to other stimuli such as ADP and A23187 (5Higashi S. Kobayashi T. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In unstimulated platelets PS-PLA1 may be stored in α-granules, since type II PLA2, which is known to be present in α-granules, is released from rat platelets in a similar manner to PS-PLA1 upon stimulation with thrombin (5Higashi S. Kobayashi T. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mechanism of PS-PLA1 sorting to secretory granules is not known at present. The N-terminal hydrophobic sequence of PS-PLA1, which consisted of 24 amino acids, may be a signal sequence because Gly25 is an N-terminal amino acid of the purified enzyme (Table II). According to the PSORT program, which predicts protein sorting from the primary amino acid sequence (39Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), the 24 hydrophobic amino acid sequence of PS-PLA1 does not show features typical of the signal sequences of “secretory” proteins. The enzyme was secreted from infected Sf9 cells, supporting the fact that the signal observed in the present enzyme functions as a signal sequence.The biological function of PS-PLA1 is unknown at present. It is well known that membrane phospholipids of activated platelets serve as precursors for second messengers such as eicosanoids and also as footholds for blood coagulation. PS-PLA1 is released from activated platelets. Under the conditions, 2-acyl lyso-PS may accumulate on the membrane, since PS-PLA1 attacks only the fatty acyl residue at the sn-1 position of serine-phospholipids. PS and lyso-PS may play important roles in either intracellular signal transduction or intercellular blood coagulation processes. PS-PLA1 may be involved in the regulation of these processes through control of the concentration of PS or lyso-PS.

The predicted amino acid sequence did not show any homology to those of phospholipases that have been reported previously, but surprisingly it showed some homology to mammalian lipases such as hepatic lipase (HL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and pancreatic lipase (PL). Unlike these “conventional” lipases, the present platelet-derived enzyme did not exhibit appreciable activity to triacylglyceride (TG).

When expressed in mammalian cells, this novel ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme also localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. UBC6 lacks a lumenal domain and contains no known endoplasmic reticulum retention signals. Analysis of chimeric proteins in which the cytosolic domain of UBC is linked to a heterologous transmembrane domain, or in which the UBC6 transmembrane domain is appended to an unrelated soluble protein, led to the determination that the transmembrane domain of UBC6 plays a dominant role in its compartmental localization. The basis for the transmembrane domain-mediated subcellular targeting of UBC6 was evaluated by lengthening the wild type UBC6 hydrophobic segment from 17 to 21 amino acids, which resulted in re-targeting to the Golgi complex. A further increase in length to 26 amino acids allowed this modified protein to traverse the secretory pathway and gain expression at the plasma membrane. These findings are consistent with models in which, in the absence of dominant cytosolic or lumenal targeting determinants, proteins may be sorted within the secretory pathway based on interactions between their transmembrane domains and the surrounding lipid bilayer.

Calpain I was incubated with increasing concentrations of free calcium in the presence or absence of oxidant, and autolytic conversion of both the 80- and 30-kDa subunits was measured by immunoblotting utilizing monoclonal antibodies which recognize both autolyzed and non-autolyzed forms of each subunit, respectively. Autolytic conversion of the 80-kDa subunit of calpain I was not detected until free calcium concentration was greater than 40 μM, whereas autolysis of the 30-kDa subunit did not occur until the free calcium concentration was greater than 100 μM. In addition, autolytic conversion of either the 80- or 30-kDa subunit was not inhibited by the presence of oxidant. Calpain I activity was measured using the fluorescent peptide N-succinyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-valyl-L-tyrosine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin or the microtubule-associated protein tau as substrate. Calpain I was found to have proteolytic activity at free calcium concentrations below that required for autolysis. Calpain I activity was strongly inhibited by oxidant at all calcium concentrations studied, suggesting that proteolytic activity of both the non-autolyzed 80-kDa and autolyzed 76-kDa forms was susceptible to oxidation. Interestingly, whereas oxidation did not inhibit autolytic conversion, the presence of high substrate concentrations did result in a significant reduction of autolysis without altering calpain proteolytic activity. Calpain I activity that had been inhibited by the presence of oxidant was recovered immediately by addition of the reducing agent dithiothreitol.

The clathrin-associated protein AP-2 has been proposed to interact directly with the cytoplasmic domain of many receptors, yet no changes in the amount or distribution of AP-2 were detected in induced cells. The internalization rate for the epidermal growth factor receptor was also measured, with or without induction of TfR expression. Even though endocytosis of the TfR is saturated in induced cells, 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor continues to be internalized at a rate identical to that seen in uninduced cells.

The results further demonstrate that the IR-induced proteolytic activity is directly inhibited by the addition of purified recombinant p35, but not by CrmA. We show that the CPP32 protease is sensitive to p35 and not CrmA. We also show that IR induces activation of CPP32 and that this event, like induction of apoptosis, is sensitive to overexpression of p35 and not CrmA.

Proteins were subjected to electrophoresis in an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% dried milk, 0.1% Tween 20, and phosphate-buffered saline and were incubated with anti-CrmA polyclonal antibody (raised against full-length CrmA protein), anti-PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-CPP32 polyclonal antibody (raised against the large subunit of CPP32; amino acids 1-175), or anti-Ich-1L (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Preparation of lysates and immunoblotting for PARP were carried out as described using the C-2-10 anti-PARP monoclonal antibody (44Desnoyers S. Shah G.M. Brochu G. Poirier G.G. Anal.

After washing with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham) for anti-PARP and anti-Ich-1L or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham) for anti-CrmA, anti-PKCδ, and anti-CPP32. CrmA contained an N-terminal polyhistidine linker and was expressed in Escherichia coli MM294 cells under the control of a λpL promoter as described (25Kamens J. Paskind M. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V.

Cell lysate supernatant was diluted 1:1 with buffer A (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.2 M NaCl) and applied to a 5-ml NiSO4-charged Hi-Trap column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was washed with 2% buffer B (buffer A plus 200 mM imidazole), and the protein was eluted with buffer B.

ICE, Ich-1, Ich-2, and CPP32 contained N-terminal polyhistidine linkers and were expressed and purified as described (25Kamens J. Paskind M. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Allen H. Banach D. Bump N.

Cell lysates were centrifuged at 900 x g for 10 min at 4°C. Protease assays included 178 μl of reaction buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% v/v glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM EDTA), 2 μl of 10 mM acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide (Ac-DEVD-pNA) in Me2SO (100 μM final concentration; California Peptide Research, Inc., Napa, CA), and 20 μl of cell lysate. Samples were incubated at 30°C, and enzyme-catalyzed release of p-nitroanilide was monitored at 405 nm for 30 min in a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). In certain experiments, the cell lysate diluted into assay buffer was first incubated with varying amounts of inhibitors at room temperature for 30 min. Inhibition of purified ICE homologs by CrmA was performed as described (33Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P. Ferenz C. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Li P. Licari P. Mankovich J.

Values for nanomoles of pNA released were calculated from those observed in A405 values using a standard curve. Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment of U-937 cells with IR is associated with the induction of apoptosis (6Manome Y. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Fine H.A. Oncol. Res. 1993; 5: 139-144PubMed Google Scholar, 7Datta R. Manome Y. Taneja N. Boise L.H. Weichselbaum R.R. Thompson C.B. Slapak C.A. Kufe D.W. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 363-370PubMed Google Scholar, 45Manome Y. Datta R. Taneja N. Shafman T. Bump E. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10607-10613Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine whether this event is sensitive to inhibitors of ICE-like proteases, we prepared U-937 cell clones that overexpress CrmA and p35 (Fig. 1A). IR treatment of both U-937 and U-937/CrmA cells resulted in a pattern of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 1B). By contrast, there was little if any DNA fragmentation in irradiated U-937/p35 cells (Fig. 1B). Immunoblot analysis of CrmA in U-937/CrmA cell lysates and comparison of signals that were obtained with recombinant CrmA indicated a concentration of approximately 1 ng/20 μg of lysates (data not shown). Since CrmA blocks TNF-induced apoptosis in other cell types (34Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), we asked whether the U-937/CrmA cells were sensitive to this agent. The results demonstrate that both CrmA and p35 block apoptosis induced by TNF treatment (Fig. 1C). These findings indicated that IR induces apoptosis by a distinct CrmA-insensitive mechanism. To determine the involvement of CrmA-insensitive proteases in IR-induced apoptosis, we assessed cleavage of the 116-kDa PARP protein to an 85-kDa fragment (8Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, IR treatment of U-937 cells resulted in PARP cleavage (Fig. 2). Similar findings were obtained in irradiated U-937/CrmA cells, but there was no detectable cleavage of PARP in IR-treated U-937/p35 cells (Fig. 2). IR also induces cleavage of PKCδ (13Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). PKCδ cleavage to a 40-kDa fragment was unaffected in IR-treated U-937/CrmA cells, and this event was sensitive to overexpression of p35 (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results demonstrate that IR induces cleavage of PARP and PKCδ by one or more p35-sensitive, CrmA-insensitive protease(s). To assay for protease activity directly, we incubated cell lysates with Ac-DEVD-pNA and monitored release of p-nitroanilide. Lysates from U-937 cells exhibited an increase in peptide cleavage activity that was detectable at 4 h and maximal at 6 h after IR exposure (Fig. 3A). The kinetics of Ac-DEVD-pNA cleavage corresponded temporally with IR-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in U-937 cells (13Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Lysates from irradiated U-937/CrmA cells exhibited a kinetically similar but less pronounced induction of Ac-DEVD-pNA cleavage activity (Fig. 3A). By contrast, there was little if any induction of such activity in lysates from irradiated U-937/p35 cells (Fig. 3A). To further define the effects of CrmA and p35 on Ac-DEVD-pNA cleavage, we incubated lysates from irradiated U-937 cells with the purified recombinant anti-apoptotic proteins. While CrmA had little apparent effect, addition of p35 was associated with complete inhibition (Fig. 3B). CPP32 has been shown to be responsible for proteolytic cleavage of Ac-DEVD-pNA (23Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar). To address the potential role of a CPP32-like activity in IR-induced apoptosis, we compared the effects of the peptidic CPP32 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-cho (23Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar) on IR-induced Ac-DEVD-pNA cleaving activity with those observed after adding purified CPP32 to lysates of unirradiated cells (Fig. 3C). The finding that the IR-induced protease activity in cell lysates is approximately 3-fold more sensitive to Ac-DEVD-cho inhibition than CPP32 suggests that the induced activity is due to CPP32-like enzymes, perhaps including CPP32 itself. ICE, Ich-1, Ich-2, and CPP32 are all potently inhibited by p35 (33Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P. Ferenz C. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Li P. Licari P. Mankovich J. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Miller L.K. Wong W.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1885-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). CrmA, in contrast, displays about 104-fold selectivity for ICE compared with CPP32 (23Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar), although inhibition of CPP32 by CrmA has also been reported (22Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2273) Google Scholar). To resolve this discrepancy and to address the differential effects of CrmA and p35 observed on IR-induced apoptosis, we measured CrmA inhibition of purified ICE, Ich-1, Ich-2, and CPP32 (Fig. 4A). CrmA inhibited ICE and Ich-2 approximately 50% at a 1:1 molar ratio (approximately 1 μM each) but was without effect on Ich-1 and CPP32 at up to a 10:1 molar ratio (Fig. 4A). Since the IR-induced Ac-DEVD-pNA cleaving activity is p35-sensitive and CrmA-insensitive, these results further support involvement of a CPP32-like protease in IR-induced apoptosis. To directly assess activation of CPP32, we assayed lysates from irradiated cells for cleavage of the proenzyme to its active subunits (21Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M.

A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). IR-treated U-937 and U-937/CrmA cells exhibited CPP32 activation, while there was little if any cleavage of the proenzyme in irradiated U-937/p35 cells (Fig. 4B). By contrast, there was no detectable effect of IR treatment on Ich-1L levels (Fig. 4B). Taken together, the findings indicate that IR-induced apoptosis is associated with activation of CPP32. Eukaryotic cells respond to lethal doses of IR with induction of apoptosis (8Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 45Manome Y. Datta R. Taneja N. Shafman T. Bump E. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D.

Res. 1993; 5: 139-144PubMed Google Scholar). Similar findings have been obtained in cells that overexpress Bcl-xL (7Datta R. Manome Y. Taneja N. Boise L.H. Weichselbaum R.R. Thompson C.B. Slapak C.A. Kufe D.W. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 363-370PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibit IR-induced proteolytic cleavage of PKCδ (13Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). These results have suggested that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL function upstream to IR-induced activation of certain members of the ICE/Ced-3 family of cysteine proteases. More recent work has shown that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL block staurosporine-induced, but not Fas-induced PARP cleavage and CPP32 activation (14Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). By contrast, the finding that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL block Fas-induced cleavage of PKCδ (13Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) suggests that these anti-apoptotic proteins may function upstream only to certain cysteine proteases. The present studies were performed to further define the apoptotic pathway in irradiated cells. The CrmA and p35 proteins were overexpressed in U-937 cells because of their reported functions in inhibiting members of the ICE/Ced-3 family. The results suggest that IR activates a CrmA-insensitive, p35-sensitive pathway. CrmA is a member of the serpin family that inhibits ICE by forming an active site-directed complex (32Ray C.A. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A. Sleath P.R. Salvesen G.S. Pickup D.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 47Komiyama T. Ray C.A. Pickup D.J.

CrmA expression blocks apoptosis induced by: (i) nerve growth factor withdrawal of chicken neurons (48Gagliardini V. Fernandez P.-A. Lee R.K.K. Drexler H.C.A. Rotello R. Fishman M. Yuan J. Science. 1994; 263: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar); (ii) cytotoxic T cell-mediated cytolysis (49Tewari M. Telford W.G. Miller R.A. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Bissell M.J. Science. 1995; 267: 891-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar); (iv) serum withdrawal of Rat1 fibroblasts (20Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar); and (v) activation of Fas or TNF receptors (34Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). However, the present studies demonstrate that IR-induced apoptosis is not blocked by overexpression of CrmA. This finding is not explainable by insufficient CrmA expression since the U-937/CrmA cells were insensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis. Moreover, a recent report has shown that CrmA has no effect on IR-induced apoptosis of mouse lymphoma cells (51Strasser A. Harris A.W. Huang D.C.S. Krammer P.H. Cory S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6136-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). We also demonstrate that IR-induced PARP and PKCδ cleavage is not affected by CrmA. Further, IR-induced Ac-DEVD-pNA cleaving activity was detectable in U-937/CrmA cells and was not inhibited by >10 μM CrmA in the assay mixture (Fig. 3C) CPP32 was also not inhibited by CrmA at concentrations of up to 10 μM (Fig. 4). Collectively, these data suggest that, in contrast to TNF, IR induces apoptosis via one or more cysteine proteases (such as CPP32) that are CrmA-insensitive. The baculovirus p35 protein inhibits apoptosis in cells from insects, nematodes, and mammals (33Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P. Ferenz C. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Li P.

Other studies have shown that p35 inhibits the proteolytic activity of Ced-3, ICE, CPP32, Ich-1, and Ich-2, but not granzyme B (33Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P. Ferenz C. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Li P. Licari P. Mankovich J. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Miller L.K. Wong W.W.

The present studies demonstrate that p35 blocks IR-induced Ac-DEVD-pNA cleaving activity. We also found that p35 blocks IR-induced apoptosis and cleavage of PARP and PKCδ. These findings support a role for ICE/Ced-3-like proteases in IR-induced apoptosis. However, the sensitivity of TNF-induced, but not IR-induced, apoptosis to CrmA supports the involvement of distinct proteases in the two processes. Sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide production have been identified in TNF-treated cells (55Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). This pathway is also activated in cells exposed to IR (57Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kan C.-C. Ehleiter D. Persaud R.S. McLouglin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Since ceramide has been shown to mediate apoptosis (58Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar), sphingomyelin hydrolysis may contribute to induction of apoptosis by both IR and TNF. While there may be central signals for inducing apoptosis by diverse agents, the insensitivity of IR-induced apoptosis to CrmA distinguishes the protease(s) activated in irradiated cells from those involved in TNF-treated cells. Recent work has demonstrated that Fas-mediated apoptosis is associated with sequential activation of ICE and then CPP32-like activity (59Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). In the present studies, there was little if any effect of IR treatment on YVAD-cleaving activity (data not shown). These findings and the demonstration that IR-induced apoptosis is insensitive to overexpression of CrmA support the lack of ICE involvement. Thus, ICE-like proteases may be involved in Fas- (59Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) and TNF-induced apoptosis but not in IR-treated cells. Collectively, the present results indicate that IR induces activation of CPP32. While PARP cleavage can be mediated by CPP32 and/or Mch3 (23Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K.

Earnshaw W.C. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6045-6052PubMed Google Scholar), PKCδ is cleaved by CPP32 and not ICE, Ich-1, Ich-2, Mch2, Mch3, or ICErel-III (60Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Thus, IR-induced cleavage of PARP and PKCδ is consistent with activation of CPP32. Studies of IR-induced Ac-DEVD-pNA cleavage and sensitivity of this activity to Ac-DEVD-cho and p35, but not CrmA, also support involvement of CPP32. Moreover, IR-induced cleavage of the CPP32 proenzyme to its subunits is in concert with activation of this protease. Thus, our findings indicate that IR-induced apoptosis is associated with CPP32 activation and that the apoptotic signals induced by irradiation differ from those associated with TNF- or Fas-mediated cell death."

Saturable binding of FX to heterodimeric FVIII, the FVIII heavy chain (contiguous A1-A2 domains), the FVIIIa-derived A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer, and the isolated A1 subunit was observed with estimated Kd values ranging from approximately 1 to 3 μM. The interaction of FX with FVIII was inhibited by moderate ionic strength and was Ca2+-dependent, consistent with the salt sensitivity observed in a phospholipid-independent FXa generation assay. Negligible binding to FX was observed for the isolated A2 and A3-C1-C2 subunits of FVIIIa, suggesting that the A1 subunit of FVIII contains a primary binding site for FX. A synthetic peptide to the COOH-terminal acidic region of the A1 subunit, designated FVIII337-372, bound FX and effectively competed with A1 for FX binding (Ki = ~16 μM). Cross-linking between the FVIII337-372 peptide and the FX heavy chain was observed following reaction with 1-ethyl-3-[(diethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide. The presence of FX reduced the rate of activated protein C-catalyzed cleavage at Arg336 by ~5-fold. These results identify a primary FX interactive site on the cofactor of the intrinsic FXase. The protein cofactor, factor (F) VIIIa, is required for the efficient conversion of the substrate FX to FXa by the serine protease FIXa.

To facilitate detection of the interaction repertoire and the phosphorylation repertoire of the PRLR, we have modified the rat PRLR cDNA to encode an additional N-terminal epitope specifically designed to allow the rapid purification of the PRLR and associated proteins from transfected cells. Our results clearly show that PRLR associates with insulin receptor substrate 1 and PI-3ʹ kinase. Upon PRL stimulation, both association with PRLR and tyrosyl phosphorylation of these two proteins are activated. Ovine PRL was a gift from the National Hormone and Pituitary/NIDDK program (Baltimore, MD). The antiphosphotyrosine antibody (αPY), monoclonal IgG2 bk antiserum to the 85-kDa subunit of PI-3ʹ kinase, and rabbit polyclonal antibody to IRS-1 (anti-rat C-terminal) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

Several hours before transfection, cells were plated in a rich medium (two-thirds DMEM nut F12, one-third DMEM, 4.5 g/liter glucose) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated in the absence of serum overnight prior to hormone stimulation using serum-free DMEM/F12 (12Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol.

The rat PRLR cDNA in the expression vector pcDNA3 was modified to encode an additional Flag epitope, Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys- between the signal peptide and the N terminus of the receptor via a recombinant polymerase chain reaction strategy (13Zhang W.

G-418 resistant cell lines overexpressing the FPRLR were selected for PRL binding. For purification studies, a clonal 293 FPRLR cell line was used. Confluent 293 cells, stably transfected with the Flag-tagged PRLR, were incubated in serum-free medium overnight. The cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were stimulated or not with oPRL (400 ng/ml) for 15 min. After stimulation, cells were rapidly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in lysis buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A (10 μg/ml) on ice. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a Sorvall centrifuge at 4°C for 15 min. Lysates from control or stimulated cells were pooled, and 1.5 ml of supernatants were used for each immunoprecipitation. Immunocomplexes were collected using Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech. Inc.) and using the appropriate antibody. Incubation was carried out overnight at 4°C. Samples were centrifuged and washed 3 times with lysis buffer, boiled 5 min in a mixture of 20% glycerol, 10%β-mercaptoethanol, 4.6% SDS, and 125 mM Tris, pH 6.8. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5% gradient polyacrylamide. Proteins were transferred on a polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Polyscreen/, DuPont NEN) using a semidry transfer cell (Trans-Blot SD, Bio-Rad). Blots were incubated with the appropriate antibody and visualized by ECL detection (Amersham). To reprobe the blot with another antibody, the blot was rinsed and incubated with stripping buffer (65 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mMβ-mercaptoethanol). Confluent 293 cells, stably transfected with the Flag-tagged PRLR, were incubated overnight in serum-free conditions and stimulated or not with oPRL (400 ng/ml). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in lysis buffer (described above). After 30 min on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged at 42,000 rpm for 1 h at 4°C. Supernatants were collected and diluted 1:5 with buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM CaCl2) and loaded on an Anti-Flag M1 affinity column (IBI-Kodak), washed with 30 ml of buffer B, and eluted with 6 ml of buffer C (Buffer B containing 2 mM EDTA without CaCl2). Eluted samples were concentrated until an appropriate volume was obtained using Centriprep and Microcon tubes (Amicon) and boiled for 5 min in loading buffer (composition described above). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (2Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Sofer L. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14021-14026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes from 293-FPRLR cells immobilized on protein A-Sepharose were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, once with 0.5 M LiCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and once with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. The PI-3ʹ kinase activity was assayed according to the method described by Auger et al. (14Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) in a final volume of a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 μM ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 mg/ml phosphoinositides. The reaction was initiated by adding a MgCl2-ATP mixture and was stopped after 20 min at 25°C, by the addition of 100 μl of 1 M HCl. The lipids were extracted with 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1), and they were resolved on thin layer chromatography TLC60 (Merck). The lipid phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. Understanding the PRL signaling pathway requires identification of the interaction repertoire and the phosphorylation repertoire of the PRLR. A recent report has suggested that GH, interferon-γ, and leukemia inhibitory factor stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its association with PI-3ʹ kinase (15Argetsinger L.S. Hsu G.W.

PRL receptor belongs to the cytokine superfamily of receptors and activates JAK2 in response to ligand binding; however, only limited numbers of reports are concerned with insulin-related effects of PRL. For example, the association between PRL and insulin-like growth factor has been described in several targets tissues (5Nicoll C.S. Anderson T.R. Hebert N.J. Russell S.M. MacLeod R.M. Thorner M.O. Scapagnini U. Prolactin Basic and Clinical Correlates. Liviana Press, Padua1985: 393-413Google Scholar, 6Jahn G.A. Diolez-Bojda F. Belair L. Kerdelhu' B. Kelly P.A. Djiane J. Edery M. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1991; 45: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To identify the PRLR interaction repertoire, we have designed a method using an epitope-modified PRLR and Ca2+-dependent immunoaffinity chromatography to purify the PRLR and associated proteins. Analysis of the FPRLR proteins product in a transfected 293 cell line expressing the FPRL receptor was carried out. Binding experiments with 125I-labeled PRL demonstrated 1 × 105 binding sites per 293 cell; the association constant (Ka = 3 nM-1) was similar to the wild type PRLR. The FPRLR was purified by an anti-Flag (M1) Sepharose chromatography column. Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblot of purified FPRLR treated without (-) or with (+) 18 nM oPRL (Fig. 1) revealed that tyrosyl phosphoproteins of 185 and 85 kDa specifically co-purified with PRL-treated FPRLR. The 95-kDa band representing the PRLR showed low basal levels of tyrosyl phosphorylation in the absence of PRL. A time course of stimulation by PRL (Fig. 2A) indicated that PRLRs are phosphorylated from 10 to 30 min after PRL stimulation, and no tyrosyl phosphorylation is observed at 60 min. In addition to the 95-kDa FPRLR, the immunoblot (Fig. 2B) with anti-Flag antibody revealed an 82-kDa product of C-terminal cleavage from PRLR which is present even in the absence of PRL. Interestingly, this product is not tyrosyl-phosphorylated (Fig. 2A). At 60 min, the PRLR is found in degradation product as a result of lysosomal degradation following internalization. In addition to the PRLR, a 185-kDa protein is tyrosyl-phosphorylated 20 min after stimulation, while the 85-kDa protein is activated 10 and 20 min after PRL stimulation. The identification of p85 as PI-3ʹ kinase was obtained after immunoprecipitation with anti PI-3ʹ kinase and immunoblot with antiphosphotyrosine (Fig. 2C); the same pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation upon PRL stimulation was obtained. Immunoblot analysis of purified FPRLR using immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody revealed that p85 corresponds to the p85 subunit of PI-3ʹ kinase and that it displays a PRL-dependent association with FPRLR (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, p185 was shown to correspond to IRS-1 and was also associated with FPRLR in a PRL-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). The PRL-dependent association of both PI-3ʹ kinase and IRS-1 with FPRLR was obtained (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 3 and 4) after immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag. PRL also induced the association of IRS-1 with PI-3ʹ kinase as shown by immunoprecipitation with anti-IRS-1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2) or anti-PI-3ʹ kinase (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). Both of them were tyrosine-phosphorylated upon PRL stimulation (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 7 and 8) following immunoblotting with anti-PI-3ʹ kinase (Fig. 3A) and anti-IRS-1 (Fig. 3B).Fig. 2Time course of stimulation by PRL of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins associated with FPRLR. Confluent 293 FPRLR cells were incubated with 400 ng/ml (18 nM) oPRL at 37°C for the times indicated prior to lysis and purification with anti-Flag column (A and B) or immunoprecipitation with αPI-3ʹ kinase (C).

Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αIRS-1 (lanes 1 and 2), α-Flag (lanes 3 and 4), αPI-3ʹ kinase (lanes 5 and 6), and αPY (lanes 7 and 8). Immunoprecipitated proteins (IP) were immunoblotted with αPI-3ʹ kinase (A) or αIRS-1 (B).

The immunocomplexes were assayed for in vitro PI-3ʹ kinase activity. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 4, where the presence of PI-3ʹ kinase activity in the immunocomplexes of FPRLR and IRS-1 was evidenced by the presence of PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2 labeled with radioactive phosphate. The PI-3ʹ kinase activity was significantly increased when cells were stimulated with PRL compared with nonstimulated. This increase in PI-3ʹ kinase activity seems to be due to a higher amount of PI-3ʹ kinase associated to PRLR induced by PRL, since the total PI-3ʹ kinase immunoprecipitated activity was not modified. These data fit well with Western blot results (Fig. 3A), where PRL stimulation results in PI-3ʹ kinase association to PRL receptor. A major pathway for signal transduction has been described for the PRLR, implicating the JAK2 protein kinase. Ligand binding to PRLR activates this tyrosine kinase (2Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Sofer L.

For example, GHR and IL9-R associated JAK2 are able to tyrosine-phosphorylate IRS-1 upon ligand binding (15Argetsinger L.S. Hsu G.W. Myers M.G. Billestrup N. White M.F. Carter-Su C. J. Biol.

In this report, we describe a PRL-dependent association with FPRLR and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, albeit the type of interaction between JAK2 and IRS-1 after PRL induction is unknown. A possible direct association would make JAK2 an obvious candidate for the tyrosine kinase responsible for the PRL-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. The possibility of an auxiliary molecule common to the cytokine receptor family that could bind JAK2 and induce phosphorylation of IRS-1 cannot be excluded. IRS-1 may interact directly or indirectly with the PRLR; cytoplasmic regions involved in this association have to be determined. In the case of GHR (15Argetsinger L.S. Hsu G.W. Myers M.G. Billestrup N. White M.F. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14685-14692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), none of the tyrosines of the cytoplasmic domain appear to be necessary for IRS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation indicating that IRS-1 interacts with other as yet unidentified proteins. In conclusion, it appears that signaling through IRS-1 may be common to multiple members of this family that activate JAK2. IRS-1 has been implicated as intermediate between insulin receptor and several signal molecules. It provides binding sites for SH2 domains of PI-3ʹ kinase subunit p85. In our study, we detected an association of these two molecules together and with the Flag PRLR. Activation of this enzyme can lead to proliferation and regulation of the cell cycle, glucose uptake, and vesicular trafficking of proteins (18Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fay M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). The signaling pathway involving PI-3ʹ kinase could explain the insulin-related effects of PRL. Further experiments are necessary to determine tyrosine-phosphorylated regions implicated in the interaction of the SH2 domains of p85 and either the activated PRLR or a phosphorylated protein intermediate after stimulation by PRL. The membrane proximal domain of PRLR contains a YSMM sequence which is a putative binding site for the SH2 domain of p85 (19Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). These experiments revealed a new repertoire of signaling molecules of the PRLR, involving different pathways. Interconnection between these pathways has to be defined more precisely. We thank J. P.

Carboxyl-terminal truncation mutagenesis of mPPARα differentially affected the ability of these ligands to induce conformational changes suggesting that PPAR ligands may make distinct contacts with the receptor. Direct interaction of peroxisome proliferators and related compounds with, and the resulting conformational alteration(s) in, mPPARα may facilitate interaction of the receptor with transcriptional intermediary factors and/or the general transcription machinery and, thus, may underlie the molecular basis of ligand-dependent transcriptional activation mediated by mPPARα.

The mammalian PPAR family is composed of at least three genetically and pharmacologically distinct subtypes, PPARα, -γ, and -δ (reviewed in 6Green S. Mutat.

Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that the receptor was activated in transfection experiments by a group of compounds known to induce peroxisome proliferation in rodents. A number of structurally diverse compounds have subsequently been demonstrated to activate PPARα in transient transfection experiments. Particularly noteworthy among these compounds are: 1) lipids such as arachidonic acid (8Gottlicher M. Widmark E. Li Q. Gustafsson J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Many of these compounds, together with phthalate ester plasticizers (di(-2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate) and herbicides (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid), are known collectively as peroxisome proliferators (reviewed in 20Lake B.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 483-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While chemically distinct, most of these compounds have been demonstrated to induce proliferation of peroxisomes leading to hepatic hyperplasia and hepatocarcinogenesis in many species (20Lake B.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 483-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-induced alteration of hepatocyte phenotype is believed to result from activation of PPARα and subsequent modulation of gene expression downstream of this nuclear receptor (reviewed in 6Green S. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 20Lake B.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 483-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see below). The central role of PPARα in xenobiotic-induced peroxisomal proliferation was recently demonstrated by the absence of hepatomegaly and peroxisome proliferation in mice null for expression of this gene (21Lee S.S.-T.

In addition, overexpression of PPARα and -γ in cultured fibroblasts and subsequent exposure to PPAR ligands has been shown to confer adipogenicity (30Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3092) Google Scholar, 31Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), further illustrating the central regulatory role of PPAR family members in lipid homeostasis.In contrast to many other receptors in the retinoid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, functional domains of PPARs and critical amino acid residues within such putative domains have not been extensively characterized. Two previous studies with PPARα have identified: 1) a Glu282→ Gly point mutation in mPPARα that ameliorates transcriptional responses to WY-14,643 and ETYA (13Hsu M.-H. Palmer C.N. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 559-567PubMed Google Scholar), and 2) a Leu433→ Arg point mutation in human PPARα (hPPARα) that abolishes heterodimerization with RXR (32Juge-Aubry C.E.

The present studies were undertaken to identify mPPARα carboxyl-terminal receptor regions that are important for both ligand responsiveness and heterodimerization with mRXRα and to determine if structurally diverse PPAR ligands induce similar conformational changes within mPPARα. To our knowledge, these studies provide the first direct biochemical evidence demonstrating that peroxisome proliferators induce conformational changes within mPPARα. Ligand-induced stabilization of particular mPPARα conformational states likely underlies the molecular basis for the ability of these compounds to activate the receptor and to modulate expression of mPPARα target genes including those implicated in peroxisome proliferation.RESULTSCarboxyl-terminal truncation mutants of PPARΔAB were constructed to define regions of the receptor required for interaction with RXR and to determine if diverse ligands require distinct mPPARα structural features. Based on the crystal structures of RXRα (37Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 38Renaud J.-P. Rochel N.

Because both carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants lack the core of the putative ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function (AF-2, 39Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct.

Chen J.-Y. Chen Z. White J. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5029-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and a peroxisome proliferator-activated response element (PPRE) identified in the promoter region of the rat acyl-CoA oxidase gene (ACO-PPRE) that confers peroxisome proliferator inducibility on this gene (25Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R. McPheat W.L. Green S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). While none of the PPAR receptors bound either probe alone (Fig. 2, lanes 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 15), addition of in vitro translated mRXRα resulted in mRXRα·PPARΔAB (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 12) and mRXRα·PPARΔAB/Δ448 (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 14) heterodimeric complex formation on both probes. PPARΔAB/Δ425 did not interact with mRXRα on either probe (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 16). RXR homodimeric complexes have previously been demonstrated to bind DR1 response elements (36Leid M. J. Biol.

The efficiency of mRXRα·PPARΔAB/Δ448 complex formation on both probes was reduced approximately 2-fold relative to that of mRXRα·PPARΔAB, suggesting that mPPARα residues 448-468 contribute to the stability of the heterodimeric complex but are not absolutely required for complex formation and DNA binding. However, truncation of an additional 23 mPPARα carboxyl-terminal residues (amino acids 425-468; PPARΔAB/Δ425) abolished the ability of the receptor to interact with mRXRα on either probe (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 16).Protein-protein interaction experiments were carried out to investigate the ability of PPARα carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants to interact with RXR independently of DNA binding. GST-mRXRα fusion protein, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose, was used in standard GST pull-down experiments for this purpose. In vitro translated 35S-PPARΔAB and 35S-PPARΔAB/Δ448 both interacted with GST-mRXRα (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5) while an interaction between 35S-PPARΔAB/Δ425 and GST-mRXRα was not detected (Fig. 3, lane 6). The efficiency of 35S-PPARΔAB/Δ448 interaction with GST-mRXRα was reduced approximately 2-fold relative to that of 35S-PPARΔAB with GST-mRXRα in agreement with DNA binding experiments described above. No interactions between any of the PPAR receptor proteins and an immobilized GST protein (Fig. 3, lanes 7-9) or glutathione-Sepharose alone were observed (data not shown). Additionally, results from experiments conducted in the presence of unlabeled response elements, identical to those used in DNA binding assays (see above), were indistinguishable from those described above (data not shown).Fig. 3PPAR interactions with an immobilized GST-mRXRα fusion protein. GST-mRXRα (lanes 4-6) or GST (lanes 7-9) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with 35S-PPARΔAB, 35S-PPARΔAB/Δ448, and 35S-PPARΔAB/Δ425 (∼100 fmol) and extensively washed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of 2 x SDS sample buffer and boiled, and 15 μl were loaded on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Input lanes represent ∼10 fmol of 35S-PPARΔAB, 35S-PPARΔAB/Δ448, and 35S-PPARΔAB/Δ425 (lanes 1-3, respectively).

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14175-14181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for use with 35S-PPARΔAB to address the possibility that peroxisome proliferators and related compounds (see Fig. 1B) interact directly with and alter the protease sensitivity of the receptor. Digestion of 35S-PPARΔAB with increasing concentrations of chymotrypsin in the presence of 100 μM LY-171883, ETYA, or WY-14,643 (Fig. 4A, lanes 11-13, 14-16, and 17-19, respectively) resulted in the appearance of protease-resistant fragments of approximately 33, 31, and 27 kDa, referred to hereafter as PF33, PF31, and PF27, respectively. Clofibric acid and clofibrate, when examined at concentrations of 100 μM, resulted in very weak signals (data not shown); therefore, these PPAR ligands were examined at concentrations of 1 mM. While clofibric acid clearly induced formation of PF33, PF31, and PF27 (Fig. 4A, lanes 5-7), clofibrate only weakly induced formation of these proteolytic fragments (Fig. 4A, lanes 8-10). The glucocorticoid receptor ligand, dexamethasone, had no effect on the proteolytic sensitivity of 35S-PPARΔAB at concentrations up to 1 mM (data not shown). Moreover, none of the mPPARα activators examined affected the protease sensitivity of other nuclear receptors such as mRXRα (data not shown), indicative of the specificity of these observations. These results suggest that mPPARα undergoes a ligand-induced conformational change upon interaction with compounds previously demonstrated to activate the receptor in transient transfection experiments (7Issemann I.

Chymotrypsin-resistant fragments induced by clofibric acid, clofibrate, LY-171883, ETYA, and WY-14,643 appear to be indistinguishable suggesting that a similar change within mPPARα may be induced by all five PPAR activators. The following rank order of efficacy of the five PPAR activators for induction of PFs within PPARΔAB, at concentrations of 100 μM, was determined using quantitative densitometric scanning of autoradiographs from DPSAs (as described previously in 36Leid M.

A clear differential proteolytic pattern was observed with 35S-PPARΔAB/Δ448 in the presence of 1 mM clofibric acid, 100 μM LY-171883, and 100 μM WY-14,643 (Fig. 4B, lanes 5-7, 11-13, and 17-19, respectively) and a weaker but detectable differential proteolytic pattern was observed with 1 mM clofibrate (Fig. 4B, lanes 8-10). Ligand-induced alterations in the protease sensitivity of 35S-PPARΔAB and 35S-PPARΔAB/Δ448 appeared to be qualitatively indistinguishable for all ligands examined except that the proteolytic fragments derived from 35S-PPARΔAB/Δ448 were of smaller mass reflecting the truncation of 21 carboxyl-terminal amino acids (see arrows in Fig. 4B; termed PF33Δ448, PF31Δ448, and PF27Δ448). However, in contrast to 35S-PPARΔAB, the protease sensitivity of 35S-PPARΔAB/Δ448 was only weakly affected by ETYA (Fig. 4B, lanes 14-16). The following rank order of the five PPAR activators for induction of PFs within PPARΔAB/Δ448, at concentrations of 100 μM, was determined using quantitative densitometric scanning (data not shown): WY-14,643 ≫ LY-171883 ≫ clofibric acid > ETYA = clofibrate.These results suggest that the most carboxyl-terminal 21 mPPARα residues (448-468 corresponding to all of putative helix 12 and a portion of helix 11; see Fig. 1A) are important for mPPARα responsiveness to ETYA. With the possible exception of WY-14,643, 35S-PPARΔAB/Δ425 did not exhibit a differential proteolytic pattern in the presence of any PPAR ligands examined (Fig. 4C) suggesting that the extreme carboxyl-terminal mPPARα amino acids may be required for responsiveness to many PPAR ligands (see below).Induction of Proteolytic Fragments Is Dependent on Ligand ConcentrationDPSAs were conducted using 35S-PPARΔAB at a constant chymotrypsin concentration and increasing concentrations of PPAR ligands (WY-14, 643, ETYA, LY-171883, CFA; see Fig. 1B) to determine the dependence of PF33, PF31, and PF27 on ligand concentration. Induction of all proteolytic fragments from 35S-PPARΔAB was clearly ligand-dependent in all cases (Fig. 5A-D), and the relative potencies with which these compounds induced 35S-PPARΔAB conformational change in vitro was generally consistent with previously reported transcriptional activation studies (7Issemann I.

Cation selectivity of the rabbit isoform of the Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) was examined using the twoelectrode voltage clamp and the Xenopus oocyte expression system. The effect of H+, Li+, and Na+ on kinetics of SGLT1 was compared to the effects of these cations on the bacterial melibiose. In SGLT1, substitution of H+ or Li+ for Na+ caused a kinetic penalty in that the apparent affinity for sugar (K0.5sugar) decreased by an order of magnitude or more (from 0.2 to 30 mM) depending on the membrane potential and cation. The effect of the cation on the K0.5sugar/V profiles was independent of the sugar for glucose and α-methyl-β-D-glucose; this profile was maintained for galactose in Li+ and Na+, but was 2 orders of magnitude higher in H+, but the Imax for glucose, galactose, and α-methyl-β-D-glucose in a given cation were identical. Li+ supported a lower maximal rate of transport (Imax) than Na+ (~80% of ImaxNa), while the Imax in H+ was higher than Na+ (≥180% of ImaxNa). Our interpretation of these results and simulations using a six-state mathematical model, are as follows. 1) Binding of the cation causes a conformational change in the sugar binding pocket, the exact conformation being determined by the specific cation. 2) Once the sugar is bound, it is transported at a characteristic rate determined by the cation. 3) Mathematical simulations suggest that the largest contribution to the kinetic variability of both cation and sugar transport is associated with cation binding.

This CSR-dependent uPA gene activation is mediated by an AP-1-recognizing element located 2 kilobases upstream of the transcription initiation site. The phosphorylation of c-Jun, a component of AP-1, is induced by CSR, which seems to increase both the activity and stability of c-Jun (Lee, J. S., von der Ahe, D., Kiefer, B., and Nagamine, Y. (1993) Nucleic Acids Res. 21, 3365-3372). It has been shown that c-Jun is phosphorylated by members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, i.e. ERKs and JNKs. ERKs are activated through a growth factor-coupled Ras/Raf-dependent signaling pathway, while JNKs are activated through a stress-induced signaling pathway. Although CSR induces both ERK-2 and JNK activity, JNK does not seem to be involved in the uPA gene induction because UV irradiation, which activates JNK as efficiently as CSR, does not activate the uPA promoter. Further analysis showed the involvement of SOS, Ras, and Raf-1 in the pathway induced by CSR.

In order to further assess the role of Hip during protein biogenesis, a structure-function analysis of the Hip protein was initiated. By employing the yeast two-hybrid system, the Hsc70-binding site of Hip was mapped to a domain comprising multiple tetratricopeptide repeats and flanking charged α-helices. Affinity chromatography confirmed direct interaction of isolated Hip fragments and protein fusions bearing this region with the ATPase domain of Hsc70 in an ATP- and salt-dependent manner. Contact of Hip with the ATPase domain appears to be mediated primarily by the positively charged α-helix following the tetratricopeptide repeats. Furthermore, a domain required for homo-oligomerization was identified at the extreme amino terminus of Hip."

We compared the ability of Ang II and other compounds that increase intracellular calcium (i.e. the calcium ionophore A23187 and thapsigargin) or protein kinase C activity (the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) to activate p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK). In GN4 cells, increasing intracellular calcium stimulated p70S6K activity in a rapamycin- and wortmannin- sensitive manner, but did not affect p90RSK activity. In contrast, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate strongly activated p90RSK but only weakly stimulated p70S6K. The ability of calcium to activate p70S6K was confirmed by blocking the A23187-dependent activation through chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA; the effect of thapsigargin was inhibited by the cell permeant chelator bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N¹,N¹-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM). Similarly, BAPTA-AM prevented the activation of p70S6K by Ang II, suggesting that this signal was largely calcium-dependent. In contrast, the Ang II-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and p90RSK was not inhibited but was enhanced by BAPTA-AM. These results show that in GN4 cells, Ang II selectively activates p70S6K through effects on calcium, p90RSK through effects on protein kinase C. The activation of p70S6K by calcium stimuli or Ang II was independent of calmodulin but correlated well with the activation of the recently identified, nonreceptor calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK)/PYK-2. Both calcium- and Ang II-dependent activation of p70S6K were attenuated by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, and activation of p70S6K was higher in GN4 than WB cells, correlating with the increased expression and activation of CADTK/PYK-2 in GN4 cells.

This ubiquitous class of mitogen-activated protein kinases is best known for their ability to phosphorylate the S6 protein of the 40 S ribosome (reviewed in 12Proud C.G. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 245: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although related in sequence to another S6 kinase (p90RSK), the regulation of p70S6K is clearly distinct from the p90RSK, the latter being activated as part of the Ras-dependent MAPK cascade (13Ballou L.M. Luther H. Thomas G. Nature. 1991; 349: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast to p90RSK, activation of the p70S6K pathway is inhibited by rapamycin (14Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 15Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In mammals, the intracellular target for rapamycin is the binding protein FKB12, which forms a complex with the recently identified protein kinases known as FRAP and RAFT (16Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 17Sabatini D.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1994; 78: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Similar in sequence homology to the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI-3 kinases) (18Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), the FRAP/RAFT kinase is required for activation of p70S6K (16Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) but does not appear to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol, PI-3 kinase, or p70S6K. Thus the mechanism by which FRAP/RAFT regulates p70S6K signaling remains to be elucidated. The p70S6K can be activated by numerous stimuli, including growth factors, inhibitors of protein synthesis (cycloheximide or anisomycin), and, as noted above, hormones such as Ang II (11Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Price D.J. Gunsalus J.R. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Complete activation of p70S6K appears to require multisite phosphorylation by several protein kinases, at least one of which is proline-directed and phosphorylates a sequence(s) in the C-terminal region of the S6 kinase (21Banerjee P.

In addition to the involvement of the rapamycin-sensitive FRAP/RAFT mentioned above, p70S6K is inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002, implicating PI-3 kinase in the signaling to p70S6K (25Cheatham B.

Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). These results are further supported by studies involving expression of a constitutively active PI-3 kinase (27Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Kozlowski M.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A potential intermediary for PI-3 kinase in p70S6K activation is the serine and threonine kinase PKB, also known as Akt (28Bellacosa A. Franke T.F. Gonzalez P.M.E. Datta K. Taguchi T. Gardner J. Cheng J.Q. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 745-754PubMed Google Scholar, 29Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). The p70S6K is involved in mitogenesis; studies with neutralizing antibodies to p70S6K or the inhibitor rapamycin have shown that this kinase is required for G1 progression (31Terada N. Franklin R.A. Lucas J.J. Blenis J. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12062-12068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G.

The ability of p70S6K to phosphorylate the ribosomal S6 protein has been well characterized (34Jeno P. Ballou L.M. Novak-Hofer I. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but the contribution of this event to the regulation of protein synthesis is less clear (reviewed in 12Proud C.G. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 245: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the S6 protein has been found to enhance the translation of mRNAs containing 5¹-poly-pyrimidine tracts (35Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 36Jefferies H.B.J. Thomas G. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4367-4372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is likely that p70S6K plays a role in growth-related control of translation. For example, translation of specific messages such as those encoding elongation factor 1α (36Jefferies H.B.J. Thomas G. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4367-4372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or insulin-like growth factor II (37Nielsen F.C. Ostergaard L. Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Nature. 1995; 377: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) appear to be regulated by the S6 pathway; these may be members of a class of proteins required for progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Ang II also stimulates protein synthesis in a number of cell types (11Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 38Geisterfer A.A.T. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), an event that may be dependent on calcium (39Berk B.C. Vekshtein V. Gordon H.M. Tsuda T. Hypertension (Dallas). 1989; 13: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and p70S6K (11Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because of our interest in calcium and Ang II signaling, we compared the ability of these stimuli to activate the p70S6K in liver epithelial cells, cells known to have a proliferative response to Ang II (1Huckle W.R. Earp H.S. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 177-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, Ang II leads to a protein kinase C-independent increase in AP1 binding, as well as stimulation of MAP kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (10Zohn I.E. Yu H. Li X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and a calcium-dependent activation of a novel; calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK). In this article we describe the finding that agents and hormones that increase intracellular calcium activate p70S6K but not p90RSK. Furthermore, these studies suggest that the initial steps in Ang II action are well correlated with activation of CADTK. Human Ang II (DRVYIHPF) was obtained from Sigma and prepared in 50 mM acetic acid prior to use. The S6 peptide (RRLSSLRA) (40Pelech S.L. Olwin B.B. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5968-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and PKI peptide (TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD) (41Walsh D.A. Glass D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 304-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were synthesized by Dr. D. Klapper (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Thapsigargin, A23187, bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N¹,N¹-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), calyculin A, wortmannin, rapamycin, anisomycin, and calmidizolium were obtained from Biomol and prepared in Me2SO. Calmodulin, leupeptin, and aprotinin were obtained from Sigma. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was obtained and used as described previously (10Zohn I.E. Yu H. Li X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The intact 40 S ribosomal subunit was purified from rat liver by the procedure of Terao and Ogata (42Terao K. Ogata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Rat liver epithelial cells (GN4 or WB) were grown at 37°C in Richter's minimal essential media containing 0.1 μM insulin and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere as described earlier (3Huckle W.R. Dy R.C. Earp H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8837-8841Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were serum starved (0.1% fetal bovine serum) for 20-24 h prior to agonist stimulation. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and once with Buffer H (50 mMβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 1.5 mM EGTA, 0.15 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), after which they were scraped in 0.5 ml of Buffer H. The cells were then sonicated with two 5-s pulses (Fisher MDL 550 Sonic Dismembrator), and the lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 x g (4°C). The activity of p70S6K in cell lysates was determined as described earlier (43Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Argast G.M. Krebs E.G. Kong X. Lin T.A. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7222-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The 100,000 x g supernatants were assayed for p70S6K activity by monitoring the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 (2 μg) in a buffer (30 μl) containing 25 mMβ-glycerophosphate (pH 7.4), 1.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 μM calmidizolium, 2 μM PKI peptide, and 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP (2000 μCi/mmol) for 20 min at 30°C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (30 μl), heated, and applied to SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide). The radioactive band corresponding to the ribosomal S6 protein was identified by staining with Coomassie Blue and autoradiography; the radioactive band was excised from the dried gel and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Calmidizolium (10 μM) was included in the assay mixture to prevent the phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein by calcium- and calmodulin-dependent kinases. In some experiments, p70S6K was assayed by immunoprecipitation of the p70S6K after lysis of the cells in Tris/Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 nM calyculin A, and 148 μM Na3VO4). The samples were immunoprecipitated as described below and the immunoprecipitate/protein A-agarose beads were washed once with Tris/Triton lysis buffer and twice with PBS (1 ml). The S6 kinase assays were performed using a modification of the above assay procedure. In these assays, the immunoprecipitate/protein A-agarose beads (20 μL) were assayed in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 10 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, and 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP (1000 μCi/mmol) plus 250 μM S6 peptide in a final reaction volume of 60 μl. The assay was performed at 30°C for 20 min with constant shaking in an Eppendorf 5436 Thermomixer. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 100 mM EDTA (pH 7.0); the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 x g, and the supernatant (40 μl) was spotted on Whatman P-81 paper. The papers were washed in 10% phosphoric acid, and the radioactivity incorporated into S6 peptide was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The assays for p90RSK were performed exactly as described above, except the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody developed against the C terminus of p90RSK as described previously (44Eldar-Finkelman H. Seger R. Vandenheede J.R. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar; kindly provided by Dr. Edwin G. Krebs, Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington). For immunodetection of p70S6K, cells were washed as described above and lysed in RIPA buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1.0% Triton X-100, and 2.0 mM EDTA plus 10 nM calyculin A and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 10 min (4°C). The samples were immunoprecipitated using a rabbit polyclonal antibody developed against a C-terminal peptide (QAFPMISKRPEHLRMNL) of the p70S6K (kindly provided by Dr. J. Weiel, Glaxo-Wellcome). Immunoprecipitation was facilitated by the addition of protein A-agarose (20 μl, packed beads), and the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer prior to addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were applied to SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride, and the immunoprecipitated p70S6K was detected by incubating blots with the C-terminal p70S6K antibody (diluted 1:2500 in TBST). The immunoblot was incubated with goat anti-rabbit (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated) antibodies (diluted 1:5000 in TBST), and the color was developed according to the manufacturer's procedure (Promega). The activity of CADTK was assayed by determining the amount of tyrosine autophosphorylation by a modification of the procedure described earlier (4Earp H.S. Huckle W.R. Dawson T.L. Li X. Graves L.M. Dy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28440-28447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested in RIPA or Tris/Triton lysis buffer as described above for the S6 kinase immunoblotting experiments. The CADTK was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody developed against a glutathione S-transferase-CADTK fusion protein (5Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G. Dy R. Hunter D. Dawson T. Wilm M. Anderegg R. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272 (in press)Google Scholar). The CADTK immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA or Tris/Triton lysis buffer and applied to SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide). After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose, and the amount of phosphotyrosine on CADTK was quantitated by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting (PT66) and ECL as described earlier (4Earp H.S.

Incubation of GN4 rat liver epithelial cells with compounds that increase intracellular calcium (i.e. the ionophore A23187, thapsigargin (which releases calcium from internal stores; 45Thastrup O.

Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of calcium-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation on “downstream” kinase signaling pathways, we examined the ability of calcium to activate the ribosomal S6 kinase p70S6K. Incubation of GN4 cells with 1 μM A23187 or 2 μM thapsigargin increased S6 kinase activity as measured by the phosphorylation of the 40 S ribosomal S6 protein (Fig. 1A). A typical response to these stimuli was a 2-3-fold increase over basal levels, similar to that produced by EGF (See Fig. 3). The calcium-stimulated increase in S6 kinase activity was inhibited by the calcium chelators EGTA and BAPTA-AM. Preincubation with EGTA prevented activation of p70S6K by A23187; the cell-permeant chelator BAPTA-AM (BAPTA) inhibited both the thapsigargin- and ionophore-stimulated S6 kinase activity (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that for these agonists the increase in p70S6K activity is calcium-dependent, and with thapsigargin, the effect is primarily dependent on intracellular calcium.Fig. 3Thapsigargin activates p70S6K, but not p90RSK. Serum-starved GN4 cells were incubated with 2 μM thapsigargin (Thaps) or 6.6 nM EGF for the lengths of time indicated. The cells were washed two times with PBS and harvested in Tris/Triton lysis buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The lysate from each 10-cm dish was immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for p70S6K (A) or p90RSK (B) and assayed for S6 peptide kinase activity as described above. The S6 peptide activity is plotted as the amount of activity (pmol/min/ml), and the results represent the mean +; S.E. (bars) of duplicate samples. Data plotted are representative of n = 3 experiments. cont, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to the increased the phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein, calcium activated p70S6K as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 1B). In these experiments, p70S6K was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and immunoblotted for p70S6K as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Four immunoreactive bands corresponding to the multiple phosphorylated forms of p70S6K were detected (46Ballou L.M. Siegmann M. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7154-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In all experiments, increased p70S6K activity (as determined by S6 protein phosphorylation) correlated with an upward mobility shift of both the slowest and fastest migrating immunoreactive bands on SDS-PAGE. The increased upward mobility shift of p70S6K produced by A23187, or thapsigargin was prevented by preincubation with calcium chelators (Fig. 1B). BAPTA preincubation reduced the mobility shift of p70S6K from untreated and A23187- or thapsigargin-treated cells, demonstrating that BAPTA affected both the stimulated and basal S6 kinase activity. In contrast, EGTA inhibited only the A23187-stimulated S6 kinase mobility shift, similar to the results obtained by assaying S6 protein phosphorylation. (Fig. 1, A and B). Like thapsigargin, Ang II rapidly increases intracellular calcium and tyrosine phosphorylation in rat liver epithelial cells (2Huckle W.R. Prokop C.A. Dy R.C. Herman B. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, incubation of GN4 cells with Ang II rapidly stimulated p70S6K activity comparable with that observed with thapsigargin. The increase in p70S6K activity was apparent as early as 2-5 min after Ang II addition, with the peak of S6 phosphorylation occurring after 10-20 min. The effect of Ang II and thapsigargin was sustained for more than 60 min (data not shown). Similar results were found by analyzing immunoblots of p70S6K; Ang II, thapsigargin, and A23187 stimulated a time-dependent increase in the p70S6K mobility shift on SDS-PAGE, which paralleled the increase in S6 protein phosphorylation (see Fig. 4A).Fig. 4Rapamycin and wortmannin inhibit the activation of p70S6K by calcium agonists.

Site-directed mutagenesis was used to confirm this motif as the site of modification and to produce a nonpalmitylated version of the p37 protein.

Palmitylation involves the dynamic (reversible) post-translational addition of a 16-carbon saturated fatty acyl moiety via thioester or ester linkage to cysteine, serine, or threonine residues. Protein palmitylation has been demonstrated to play a variety of roles in vivo. When the function of palmitylation can be established, it usually falls into one of three categories. (i) Palmitylation can “activate” a protein, usually by targeting the protein to a site where it carries out its function (1Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) (the protein is then “inactivated” by depalmitylation); (ii) palmitylation can mediate protein-protein interactions (2Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar); or, as is most often the case, (iii) palmitylation mediates protein-membrane interactions (2Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). There are many examples of cellular and viral palmitylproteins (for reviews see Refs.2Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

In many cases the palmitate acceptor residues have been identified, but a sequence or structural motif specifying palmitylation of proteins remains elusive. Recently a thioesterase demonstrated to cleave the palmityl group from proteins has been purified and cloned, but the enzyme(s) responsible for the addition of palmitate to proteins has not been identified. In some cases, palmitylation of one protein is dispensable for function, while on closely related proteins it is absolutely necessary for function. For example, the hemagglutinin of influenza virus is palmitylated on conserved cysteine residues of its cytoplasmic tail. For the H1 subtype of influenza, a partial block on palmitylation resulted in attenuation, and mutants in which the hemagglutinin was not palmitylated were not viable (8Zurcher T. Luo G. Palese P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5748-5754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the hemagglutinin of the H3 subtype does not require palmitylation for the production of infectious particles (9Jin H. Subbarao K. Bagai S. Leser G.P. Murphy B.R. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1406-1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar disparity is found among cellular palmitylproteins. Palmitylation of the Src family of tyrosine kinases targets them to caveolae (1Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), while palmitylation of caveolin (a normally palmitylated constituent of caveolae) is not necessary for targeting to that structure (10Dietzen D.J.

Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Chanock R.M. Hirsch M.S. Melnick J. Monath T.P. Roizman B. Virology. Raven Press, New York1990: 2079-2111Google Scholar). With the eradication of smallpox, the focus on VV biology momentarily faded, but it has been “rediscovered” as a versatile tool for molecular biologists. This has spurred recent efforts to characterize the virus. The 191-kilobase pair genome has been completely sequenced (12Goebel S.J. Johnson G.P. Perkus M.E. Davis S.W. Winslow J.P. Paoletti E. Virology. 1990; 179: 247,517-66,563Crossref Scopus (717) Google Scholar) and appears to encode nearly 200 gene products. Many are involved in nucleic acid metabolism, immune modulation, or serve some other non-structural function, and about 100 are structural proteins that are packaged with the virion. The infectious virion may exist in one of four forms; intracellular mature virus (IMV), intracellular enveloped virus (IEV), cell-associated enveloped virus (CEV), and extracellular enveloped virus (EEV). IMV is the simplest in structure, being composed of the core particle and a double-layered membrane derived from the intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi stacks (13Sodeik B. Doms R.W. Ericsson M. Hiller G. Machamer C.E. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Moss B. Griffiths G. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 121: 521-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). By a process that is still poorly understood, IMV particles are targeted to the trans-Golgi and subsequently enwrapped by a double membrane derived from it (14Hiller G. Weber K. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 651-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schmelz M. Sodeik B. Ericsson M. Wolffe E.J. Shida H. Hiller G. Griffiths G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 130-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) resulting in the production of IEV. Virions then migrate to the cell surface, where by fusion and loss of the outermost membrane, followed by release into the medium, EEV are produced. If the virions remain attached to the outer face of the plasma membrane, they are referred to as CEV. This process is mediated by numerous VV-encoded proteins (16Blasco R. Moss B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5910-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Engelstad M. Smith G.L. Virology. 1993; 194: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Isaacs S.N. Wolffe E.J. Payne L.G.

Acylation of VV polypeptides has been demonstrated to play a major role in the assembly of virions. At least four proteins are myristoylated on glycine of the amino-terminal motif, methionine-glycine-(any 3 amino acids)-serine/threonine. The most studied of these is the 25-kDa protein product of the L1R open reading frame (21Ravanello M.P. Hruby D.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1479-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Expression of a nonmyristoylated L1R protein within infected cells rather than the normally acylated protein resulted in a one-log reduction in titer relative to wild-type virus. It has also been previously demonstrated that there are at least six palmitylproteins induced in VV-infected cells (22Child S.J. Hruby D.E. Virology. 1992; 191: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). They are all present in the membrane fraction of cells and when virion-associated, are present in the outer membrane fraction of CEV and EEV. Three remain unidentified, and the others are encoded by VV open reading frames A34R (23Duncan S.A. Smith G.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1610-1621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), B5R (18Isaacs S.N. Wolffe E.J. Payne L.G. Moss B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7217-7224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and F13L (14Hiller G. Weber K. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 651-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hirt P. Hiller G. Wittek R. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 757-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which express a 21-26-kDa glycoprotein, gp42, and the object of this study, p37, respectively. Inactivation of the parental genes for either p37 or gp42 proteins in the VV genome results in varying degrees of inhibition on the envelopment and release of enveloped virions. One such deletion mutant is vRB10 (16Blasco R. Moss B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5910-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a derivative of the IHD-J strain of vaccinia. In this mutant, 93% of the F13L open reading frame (encoding p37) has been replaced with the gpt gene under the control of the VV 7.5-kDa promoter (p7.5K). During the characterization of this recombinant, a striking biological defect was noted. While producing normal amounts of IMV, the production of enveloped virus was severely inhibited. Additionally, the virus was not able to efficiently spread (in tissue culture) from cell to cell. Most strains of VV produce visible plaques within 24 h after infection of a permissive cell monolayer, but vRB10 requires at least 4 days before minute plaques are visible. Clearly, p37 is a major contributor to the envelopment and release process. p37 is a 372-amino acid polypeptide expressed at late times during infection and has a predicted mass of 41 kDa. In gels it has an apparent mass of 37 kDa, which has been attributed to modifications that alter its electrophoretic mobility. Within infected cells, p37 localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN; 15Schmelz M. Sodeik B. Ericsson M. Wolffe E.J. Shida H. Hiller G. Griffiths G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 130-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where it is tightly associated with the outer face of the organelle. The significance of the palmitate moiety in mediating membrane attachment has been demonstrated in vitro (25Schmutz C. Rindisbacher L. Galmiche M.C. Wittek R. Virology. 1995; 213: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and we sought to confirm and extend that work in vivo. We are interested in several aspects of p37 palmitylation. The first is to define a motif that specifies palmitylation of VV proteins and perhaps refine it to include all viral and cellular palmitylproteins. Second, we wish to determine the biological function of p37 palmitylation as it pertains to activity of the protein, protein-protein interactions, or targeting to cellular or viral structures. We report here that we have defined a motif specifying palmitylation of p37. Furthermore, palmitylation of p37 is required for correct targeting to intracellular membranes, a prerequisite to function. Our results are discussed within the context of VV biology as well as the general aspects of eukaryotic protein acylation. BSC40 (African green monkey kidney) cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM-E) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine (LG), 10 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate (GS) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The IHD-J strain of VV was routinely propagated and titered in BSC40 cells as described previously (26Hruby D.E. Guarino L.A. Kates J.R. J. Virol. 1979; 29: 705-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant virus vRB10 (also referred to as I-VP37) has been described previously (16Blasco R. Moss B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5910-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a derivative of the IHD-J strain in which 93% of the gene encoding p37 has been replaced by the mycophenolic acid resistance gene gpt under the control of p7.5K. vRB10 was propagated by low multiplicity passages through BSC40 cells in the presence of mycophenolic acid, xanthine, and hypoxanthine. Virus stocks were titered by inoculating serial dilutions onto confluent monolayers of BSC40 cells subsequently transfected with plasmid DNA encoding a rescuing copy of the p37 gene (see below). Plaques were visualized by staining infected monolayers with crystal violet 72 h post-infection (HPI). The Net Entrez program was used to find and retrieve the gene and amino acid sequence to p37 from VV strain IHD-J. The sequence was analyzed using the Genetics Computer Group suite of programs to generate a Hopp-Woods (27Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar) hydrophilicity profile and a Chou-Fasman (28Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar) secondary structure prediction. The sequence was then submitted for analysis by TMPred (29Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar) 2This program is available on the World Wide Web (http://ulrec3.unil.ch/software/TMPRED_form.html). to identify potential transmembrane-spanning regions of the protein. Plasmid pDG3.0 is a pUC118-based vector that contains the VV tk gene into which p7.5K has been inserted. Plasmids pDG4.0, pDG4.1, pDG4.2, and pDG4.3 all have the VV F13L open reading frame cloned adjacent to p7.5K in pDG3.0 such that transcription initiating from p7.5K results in the production of an mRNA that encodes p37. Plasmid pDG4.0 encodes the wild-type p37 protein. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (30Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) was used to mutate the F13L sequence in pDG4.0 to generate plasmids pDG4.1, pDG4.2, and pDG4.3. The oligonucleotide oDG4.1 (5¹-GCTAACTGGCAGACAAGAAGCTGCAGAGC-3¹) was used to construct pDG4.1. It mutates the codon encoding cysteine 185 of p37 to encode serine and introduces a PstI restriction site by silent mutation. Plasmid pDG4.2 was constructed using the oligonucleotide oDG4.2 (5¹-GCTAACTGGCAGAGAACAAGCTGCAGAGC-3¹). It mutates the codon encoding cysteine 186 of p37 to encode serine and introduces a PstI restriction site by silent mutation. Plasmid pDG4.3 was constructed using oligonucleotide oDG4.3 (5¹-GCTCTGCGGCTTCTTCTCTGCCAGTATGC-3¹). The oligonucleotide oDG4.3 mutates the codons encoding cysteines 185 and 186 to encode serine. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Subconfluent monolayers of BSC40 cells in 35-mm wells were infected with either IHD-J or vRB10 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10. Concurrent with infection, vRB10-infected cells were transfected with plasmids pDG3.0, pDG4.0, pDG4.1, pDG4.2, or pDG4.3. Liposome-mediated transfection following the method of Rose et al. (31Rose J.K. Buonocore L. Whitt M.A. Biotechniques. 1991; 10: 520-525PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications described by Campbell (32Campbell M.J. Biotechniques. 1995; 18: 1027-1032PubMed Google Scholar) mediated the transfer of plasmid DNA and transient expression of p37. The inoculum was prepared in polystyrene tubes to which was added 500 μl of MEM-E, the appropriate amount of virus, 30 μl of liposomes, and 10 μg of the appropriate DNA. When no DNAs were to be transfected, liposomes were added to the inoculum as a control. After this mixture remained at room temperature for 15 min, it was added to the cell monolayer from which the culture medium had been aspirated. The cells were placed at 37°C for 4 h, after which the inoculum was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of MEM-E with 3% FCS, LG, and GS. At 6 HPI, the culture supernatant was aspirated and the cells washed with warm MEM-E. The wash was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of MEM-E containing 200 μCi of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid ([3H]PA, DuPont NEN) or 1 ml of MEM-E containing 200 μCi of [9,10-3H]oleic acid ([3H]OA, DuPont NEN). At 24 HPI the cells were harvested in the culture supernatant and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 30 min to pellet cells and any virions released during the infection. The pellet was resuspended in 60 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and freeze-thawed three times. Each cell extract was divided into three fractions of 20 μl each. The first fraction was prepared for immunoprecipitation by addition of 500 μl of a 2 x strength radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1 x RIPA: 1% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 0.2% w/v SDS, 150 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 unit/ml Benzonase™ endonuclease) and incubation on ice for 15 min. The samples were then heated to 70°C for 2 min, followed by centrifugation at 6500 x g for 2 min. The supernatant was transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes and the RIPA adjusted to 1 x concentration with water. Anti-p37 antiserum (α-p37) was added to the extracts, followed by incubation on ice for 2 h. 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads in 1 x RIPA were then added, and incubation was continued for 18 h at 4°C with constant agitation. The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times with 1 x RIPA, transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, and washed again. The beads were pelleted a final time and resuspended in reducing sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. The proteins were resolved by discontinuous gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), utilizing 12% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (33Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 79: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis the gels were fluorographed by impregnation with 22.2% PPO in Me2SO (34Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (5621) Google Scholar), drying, and exposure to Kodak BIOMAX MR film at -70°C. The second and third fractions from the total cell extracts were directly subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. One gel was fluorographed as above to detect all vaccinia-encoded [3H]PA- or [3H]OA-labeled proteins. The other gel was subjected to immunoblot analysis (35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) by blotting it to a nitrocellulose filter, which was then probed with α-p37. Antigen-antibody complexes on the filter were detected by incubation with goat anti-rabbit antiserum conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) and development with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride. BSC40 cells were grown to 95% confluence in 100 mm tissue culture dishes. The cells were infected with IHD-J or vRB10 at high multiplicity (m.o.i. = 10) or low multiplicity (100-300 plaque-forming units/plate). Concurrent to infection with vRB10, the cells were transfected with 300 μl of liposomes and 100 μg of pDG3.0, pDG4.0, or pDG4.3 DNA. Low multiplicity infection/transfections were done in duplicate. The cells were placed at 37°C for 4 h, after which the inoculum was aspirated and the cells washed once with warm MEM-E. Then 10 ml of MEM-E with 2.5% FCS, LG, and GS were added to each plate, and the cells were placed at 37°C for the remainder of the experiment. At 24 HPI the cells infected at a high m.o.i. were harvested and assayed for p37 production by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using α-p37 essentially as described above. Additionally, one set of the duplicate plates infected at a low m.o.i. was stained with crystal violet (0.1% crystal violet in 30% ethanol) at 24 HPI, while the infection of the other set was allowed to continue until 72 HPI. They were then stained with crystal violet as well. BSC40 cells were grown to 95% confluence in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. The cells were infected with IHD-J or vRB10 at an m.o.i. of 10. Concurrent to infection with vRB10, the cells were transfected with 300 μl of liposomes and 100 μg of pDG3.0, pDG4.0, or pDG4.3 DNA. The cells were placed at 37°C for 4 h, after which the inoculum was aspirated and the cells washed once with warm MEM-E. Then, 10 ml of MEM-E with 2.5% FCS, LG, and GS were added to each plate and the cells were placed at 37°C. In a duplicate experiment, [35S]methionine/cysteine (DuPont NEN) was added to the culture to a final concentration of 25 μCi/ml in the culture supernatant to label nascent peptides. At 12 HPI the culture medium was aspirated and the cells washed free of the plates with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 700 x g for 10 min, followed by fractionation utilizing differential centrifugation essentially as described by Child and Hruby (22Child S.J. Hruby D.E. Virology. 1992; 191: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with modifications as follows. The PBS was aspirated and the cells resuspended in 2.0 ml of hypotonic buffer (HB: 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 150 mM sodium chloride) and incubated 10 min on ice to swell the cells. All subsequent steps were at 4°C. The cells were then lysed by Dounce homogenization. One half of the cell lysate (1.0 ml) was set aside as the total cell extract, while the remainder was centrifuged at 700 x g for 10 min. The supernatant (post-nuclear supernatant, PNS) was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube for further fractionation, while the pellet from that centrifugation was resuspended in 1.0 ml of HB and set aside as the nuclear pellet (NP). The PNS was centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 30 min. The pellet from this centrifugation was resuspended in 1 ml of HB and set aside as the virus-containing fraction (P15). The supernatant from this centrifugation was transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube and diluted to 4.5 ml with HB and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 x g for 60 min. The pellet from this centrifugation was resuspended in 1 ml of HB and set aside as the subcellular organelle/cytosolic aggregate fraction (P100). The supernatant from this centrifugation was adjusted to be 10% trichloracetic acid and centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 30 min. The pellet from this centrifugation was set aside as the soluble cytosolic fraction (S100). All other fractions were adjusted to be 10% trichloracetic acid and centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 30 min. All precipitated pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 1 M Tris, pH 10.0, to neutralize the acid and briefly sonicated to facilitate resuspension. Twenty μl of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using α-p37 (12% polyacrylamide gel) as well as antiserum directed against the VV major core protein precursor P4a (α-P4a, 10% polyacrylamide gel) and the VV-encoded thymidine kinase (α-TK, 15% polyacrylamide gel). Detection of the rabbit antibody-protein complexes (α-p37, α-P4a, α-TK) was by color development as described above or by chemiluminescence. For chemiluminescent detection, the primary antibody incubation was followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce). The protein-antibody complexes were detected by incubation with a chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate and exposure to film. Relative quantitation of protein-antibody complexes was performed by film densitometry. To determine the subcellular fractions that contained gp42, cells were infected/transfected as outlined above. The nascent peptides were labeled from 4 until 12 HPI by addition of [35S]methionine/cysteine. At 12 HPI the cells were harvested in PBS and fractionated as described above. Each fraction was subject to immunoprecipitation using a mouse monoclonal antibody to gp42 (α-gp42) essentially as described above. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and fluorographed. The immunoprecipitates were quantitated by film densitometry. BSC40 cells were seeded onto microscope slide coverslips (“microcover glasses,” VWR) in 35-mm wells at a density of 5 x 105 cells/well and cultured at 37°C for 18 h. They were then infected with either IHD-J or vRB10 at an m.o.i. of 10. The vRB10-infected cells were concurrently transfected with either pDG3.0, pDG4.0, or pDG4.3 as described above. At 12 HPI the culture medium was aspirated and the cells washed once by incubation for 5 min in ice-cold PBS. The wash was aspirated, and the cells were fixed to the microcover glasses by incubation at -20°C in 100% methanol for 20 min. Immunofluorescent antibody labeling techniques (adapted from 36Watkins S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. CD-ROM Edition. Greene/Wiley Interscience, New York1991Google Scholar) were employed to detect the presence and localization of VV proteins. The cells were washed by two 5-min incubations in ice-cold PBS and then incubated for 2 h at 4°C in 1 ml of primary antibody solution/well. The antibody solution was prepared as 1:1000 dilutions of either α-p37, α-gp42 or a mixture of α-p37 +α-gp42 in PBS + 5% (v/v) FCS. The primary antibody solution was then aspirated, and the cells washed four times with ice-cold PBS. Five hundred μl of secondary antibody solution were added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 4°C. The cells that had been incubated with the rabbit-produced α-p37 antiserum were incubated with goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (GαR-FITC, 1:100 dilution in PBS + 5% FCS, Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp.) as the secondary antibody. The cells that had been incubated with mouse monoclonal α-gp42 were incubated with goat anti-mouse tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate conjugate (GαM-TRITC, 1:200 dilution in PBS + 5% FCS, Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp.) as the secondary antibody. The cells that had been incubated with the α-p37 +α-gp42 primary antibody mixture were incubated with a secondary antibody mixture of GαR-FITC (1:100 dilution) + GαM-TRITC (1:200 dilution) in PBS + 5% FCS. Following the secondary antibody incubation, the cells were washed four times for 5 min each with ice-cold PBS. After the last wash, the microcover glasses were removed from the tissue culture dishes and allowed to air-dry for 10 min"
https://openalex.org/W2072106016,"Mouse lung carbonyl reductase, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, exhibits coenzyme specificity for NADP(H) over NAD(H). Crystal structure of the enzyme-NADPH complex shows that Thr-38 interacts with the 2′-phosphate of NADPH and occupies the position spatially similar to an Asp residue of the NAD(H)-dependent SDRs that hydrogen-bonds to the hydroxyl groups of the adenine ribose of the coenzymes. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we constructed a mutant mouse lung carbonyl reductase in which Thr-38 was replaced by Asp (T38D), and we compared kinetic properties of the mutant and wild-type enzymes in both forward and reverse reactions. The mutation resulted in increases of more than 200-fold in the Km values for NADP(H) and decreases of more than 7-fold in those for NAD(H), but few changes in the Km values for substrates or in the kcat values of the reactions. NAD(H) provided maximal protection against thermal and urea denaturation of T38D, in contrast to the effective protection by NADP(H) for the wild-type enzyme. Thus, the single mutation converted the coenzyme specificity from NADP(H) to NAD(H). Calculation of free energy changes showed that the 2′-phosphate of NADP(H) contributes to its interaction with the wild-type enzyme. Changing Thr-38 to Asp destabilized the binding energies of NADP(H) by 3.9-4.5 kcal/mol and stabilized those of NAD(H) by 1.2-1.4 kcal/mol. These results indicate a significant role of Thr-38 in NADP(H) binding for the mouse lung enzyme and provide further evidence for the key role of Asp at this position in NAD(H) specificity of the SDR family proteins. Mouse lung carbonyl reductase, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, exhibits coenzyme specificity for NADP(H) over NAD(H). Crystal structure of the enzyme-NADPH complex shows that Thr-38 interacts with the 2′-phosphate of NADPH and occupies the position spatially similar to an Asp residue of the NAD(H)-dependent SDRs that hydrogen-bonds to the hydroxyl groups of the adenine ribose of the coenzymes. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we constructed a mutant mouse lung carbonyl reductase in which Thr-38 was replaced by Asp (T38D), and we compared kinetic properties of the mutant and wild-type enzymes in both forward and reverse reactions. The mutation resulted in increases of more than 200-fold in the Km values for NADP(H) and decreases of more than 7-fold in those for NAD(H), but few changes in the Km values for substrates or in the kcat values of the reactions. NAD(H) provided maximal protection against thermal and urea denaturation of T38D, in contrast to the effective protection by NADP(H) for the wild-type enzyme. Thus, the single mutation converted the coenzyme specificity from NADP(H) to NAD(H). Calculation of free energy changes showed that the 2′-phosphate of NADP(H) contributes to its interaction with the wild-type enzyme. Changing Thr-38 to Asp destabilized the binding energies of NADP(H) by 3.9-4.5 kcal/mol and stabilized those of NAD(H) by 1.2-1.4 kcal/mol.

https://openalex.org/W2163696121,"The physiological response to endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) can be regulated by two closely related LPS-binding proteins, LPS-binding protein (LBP), which potentiates LPS' inflammatory activity via interaction with the monocytic antigen CD14, and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), which neutralizes LPS. Both proteins bind LPS with high affinity sites in their N-terminal domains, whereas interaction between LBP and CD14 is dependent upon the LBP C-terminal domain. We have created fusions of the N- and C-terminal domains from each protein and compared the functional activities and pharmacokinetics of these fusions, the individual N-terminal domains, and the parent proteins. The N-terminal domains of BPI and LBP bound lipid A with their characteristic apparent affinity constants, regardless of the C-terminal fusion partner. In addition, the C-terminal domain of LBP allowed transfer of LPS to CD14 in conjunction with either N-terminal LPS binding domain. Proteins containing a BPI N-terminal domain had greater heparin binding capacities in vitro and were cleared more rapidly from the plasma of whole animals. Taken together, these data better define how closely related proteins such as BPI and LBP can have opposing effects on the body's response to LPS.

Because Gram-negative sepsis remains one of the primary causes of severe systemic inflammation in hospitalized and immunocompromised patients, there is great interest in characterizing proteins involved in the biological response to LPS. In this paper, we focus on two LPS-binding proteins, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI). LBP and BPI are members of a family of lipid transfer/lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins that also includes cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP). These proteins share significant sequence homology and all bind lipophilic substrates (1Tall A. Annu. Rev.

Involved in a complex array of responses to LPS, LBP is a 60-kDA serum glycoprotein that binds the lipid A portion of the LPS molecule to form a high affinity LBP·;LPS complex (2Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10867-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This complex potentiates the cellular response to LPS via interaction with the monocytic differentiation antigen CD14 (3Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Matheson J.C.

Recent evidence suggests that LBP may additionally be involved in the neutralization of LPS via interaction with serum lipoproteins (5Wurfel M.M. Kunitake S.T. Lichenstein H. Kane J.P. Wright S.D. J.

BPI is a 55-kDa protein found in granules of mature neutrophils and, like LBP, interacts with LPS to form a high affinity complex. BPI, however, binds LPS with higher affinity than does LBP (8Weiss J.K. Muello K. Victor M. Elsbach R. J. Immunol. 1984; 142: 2807-2812Google Scholar, 9Gazzano-Santoro H. Parent J.B. Grinna L.

Both BPI and LBP contain 456 amino acids and show an approximate 45% homology at the amino acid level which is distributed over the entire protein sequence. Interestingly, the genes for BPI and LBP lie adjacent to each other in the human genome, suggesting that they might have arisen from a gene duplication event (24Gray P.W. Corcorran A.E. Eddy R.L.J.

The C-terminal region of LBP is required for CD14 interaction (27Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Williams R.E. Liu P.-S. Chan I. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Meszaros K. Parent J.B. Kasler H. Aberle S. Trown P.W.

There is evidence that the C-terminal region of BPI possesses some LPS neutralization activity, especially in regard to smooth LPS (possessing long chain polysaccharides) (16Ooi C.E. Weiss J. Doerfler M.E. Elsbach P. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition to binding LPS, the N-terminal fragment of BPI also binds heparin (30Little R.G. Kelner D.N. Lim E. Burke D.J. Conlon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1865-1872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine how the structure of these closely related proteins affects their opposing functions, we have created fusion proteins with shuffled N-terminal and C-terminal domains from LBP and BPI and have tested the fusion in both in vitro and in vivo model systems. Our results demonstrate that each fusion protein retains the LPS binding characteristics of the N-terminal domain of the parent protein and that the transduction of the LPS-induced inflammatory signal is dependent on the presence of the LBP C-terminal domain. Additionally, our data suggest that the heparin binding characteristics of BPI, LBP, and the fusion proteins play a role in their pharmacokinetics. Cloning of the cDNAs encoding the N-terminal BPI (rBPI21) protein (31Horwitz A.H. Leigh S.D. Abrahamson S.L. Gazzano-Santoro H. Liu P.-S. Williams R.E. Carroll S.F. Theofan G. Protein Expression and Purif. 1996; 8: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal and full-length LBP (rLBP25 and rLBP) proteins (9Gazzano-Santoro H. Parent J.B. Grinna L. Horwitz A. Parsons T. Theofan G. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Conlon P. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4754-4761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described previously. Cloning of full-length rBPI was done in a similar manner as described for full-length rLBP (27Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Williams R.E. Liu P.-S. Chan I. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Meszaros K. Parent J.B. Kasler H. Aberle S. Trown P.W. Gazzano-Santoro H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3623-3629PubMed Google Scholar). The cloned cDNAs were then inserted into the mammalian expression vectors described below. Plasmids encoding the LBP(1-197)BPI(200-456) fusion protein P4160(L-B) or the BPI(1-199)LBP(198-456) fusion protein P4161(B-L) were constructed by combining appropriate portions of these molecules at ClaI restriction sites engineered by overlap polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis within homologous regions of the BPI or LBP cDNA. The introduced ClaI sites did not modify the encoded amino acid sequences within these regions of the LBP and BPI proteins. The mammalian expression vectors for all proteins in this study were constructed by cloning DNA encoding the protein of interest into vectors containing the human cytomegalovirus promoter, the mouse light chain 3ʹ-untranslated region, and the Escherichia coli guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene for selection of transfectants in mammalian cells (32Robinson R.R.

The P4160(L-B) fusion protein was purified according to the procedure outlined in Theofan et al. (27Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Williams R.E. Liu P.-S. Chan I. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Meszaros K.

Protein Expression and Purif. 1996; 8: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was followed for the purification of P4161(B-L). All proteins were purified to greater than 98% purity from either CHO-K1 transfectants (rBPI21,P4160(L-B), P4161(B-L)) or CHO-DG44 (a DHFR- mutant of CHO Toronto obtained from Dr. Lawrence Chasin, Columbia University, New York) transfectants (rBPI, rLBP25, rLBP). Concentrations of the purified proteins were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the following set of values for E(1 ng/ml/cm): rBPI21, 1.02; rBPI, 0.58; rLBP25, 0.71; rLBP, 0.63; P4160(L-B), 0.54; P4161(B-L), 0.62. One hundred μg of rBPI21, rBPI, or rLBP were iodinated using 100 μl of lactoperoxidase glucose oxidase-immobilized beads (Enzymobeads, Bio-Rad) in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 1.0 mCi of iodine-125 (Amersham Corp., IMS30), and 50 μl of 55 mMD-glucose for 45 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by centrifugation for 1 min. 125I-ligand was purified by gel filtration with Sephadex G25 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 5 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% pluronic F68 (BASF, Mount Olive, NJ) and 0.002% Tween 80. 125I-Ligand recovery and specific activity were determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. For binding analysis, 96-well plates were coated with lipid A (LIST Biological Laboratories Inc., Campbell, CA) by treating with 50 μl of a 2.5 μg/ml solution of lipid A in phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C overnight. Plates were then washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) + 1.0% bovine serum albumin in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (DBH). 50 μl of 0.5 nM125I-rBPI21 or 125I-rLBP in DBH were mixed with 50 μl of 20 pM to 10 μM unlabeled ligand, added to the wells, and incubated for 5 h at 4°C. Binding was terminated by washing the wells three times with DBH and quantitated by extracting the wells with 1 N NaOH and counting the resultant extract in a Packard Gamma counter. Data from direct and competitive binding experiments were analyzed by the weighted nonlinear least squares curve fitting program Ligand adapted for Macintosh (MacLigand (33Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar)). Objective statistical criteria (F, test, extra sum squares principle) were used to evaluate goodness of fit and for discriminating between models. Nonspecific binding was treated as a parameter subject to error and was fitted simultaneously with other parameters. The human monocytic cell line THP-1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated (56°C for 30 min) fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 1 mM glutamine, 1 mM pyruvate, 0.2 μMβ-mercaptoethanol. For induction of surface CD14, THP-1 cells (3 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated with 80 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) for 3 days as described (27Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Williams R.E. Liu P.-S. Chan I. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Meszaros K. Parent J.B. Kasler H. Aberle S. Trown P.W. Gazzano-Santoro H. J.

CD14 expressing THP-1 cells were harvested and washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (phosphate-buffered saline; Life Technologies, Inc.) and resuspended in RPMI medium. They were then diluted to 2 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free medium (SFM) made from RPMI medium plus 1% HB101 (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine. For neutralization studies (Fig. 2), LPS (E. coli 0128:B12 LPS (Sigma)) was used at 1 ng/ml in SFM containing 1 μg/ml rLBP. For TNF induction studies (Fig. 3), 1 ng/ml 0128 LPS was used in SFM. Cells (2 × 105/well) were plated, and after protein addition were incubated at 37°C for 2 h with 5% CO2. TNF levels in the culture supernatants were measured using a TNF ELISA kit (T Cell Sciences, Cambridge, MA) according to the directions specified by the manufacturer. Each sample was assayed in duplicate.Fig. 3Effect of parent and fusion proteins on LPS-dependent TNF production in THP-1 cells. LPS-dependent TNF production was measured at varying protein concentrations (from 0 to 1000 pM). LPS concentration was 1 ng/ml, and incubation was in serum-free media for 2 h at 37°C. Each point is the mean of two replicates.

Kelner D.N. Lim E. Burke D.J. Conlon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1865-1872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and each sample was assayed in duplicate. Apparent affinity constants and binding capacities were calculated using the GraFit software (Erithacus Products Ltd.) Data shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 was analyzed by 2-way between groups analysis of variance with Fischer's protected least significant difference post hoc tests using SuperANOVA software (ABACUS Concepts Inc. Berkeley, CA). All experimental protocols followed the guidelines according to Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and National Institutes of Health. Male CD® rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) weighing 250-300 g were used in all experiments. Animals were received healthy and housed in conventional cages and received standard laboratory chow and water ad libitum in an environmentally controlled animal room with 12-h light-dark cycles. Plasma samples were assayed for rBPI21 or rBPI using affinity purified rabbit anti-rBPI23 as the capture antibody and biotin conjugated rabbit anti-rBPI23 as the detection antibody as described (37White M.L. Ma J.K. Birr C.A. Trown P.W. Carroll S.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 167: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Plasma standards were prepared by adding known amounts of rBPI21 or rBPI to rat plasma for the determination of percent recovery. The plasma concentrations in the samples were then corrected based on the recovery values. Similarly, LBP and fusion proteins were also assayed by ELISA. For rLBP25 and rLBP, affinity purified polyclonal rabbit anti-rLBP antibody was used as the capture antibody, and biotin-labeled, affinity-purified rabbit anti-rLBP antibody was used as the secondary antibody. For P4161(B-L), rabbit anti-rBPI23 antibody was used for the capture antibody, and biotin-labeled, affinity purified rabbit anti-rLBP antibody was the detection antibody. For P4160(L-B), mouse monoclonal anti-C-terminal rBPI was used as the capture antibody (6C2), and biotin-labeled, affinity purified rabbit anti-LBP25 was used for the secondary antibody. Each protein was administered via the tail vein at a dose of 1 mg/kg to three male CD® rats for a given experiment. Blood samples were collected from the retro-orbital sinus into tubes containing sodium citrate (Sigma). The plasma was extracted and stored at -70°C until assayed. For rBPI21, blood samples were collected at selected times from 0.5 min to 2 h after administration of rBPI21. For rLBP25, rLBP, and P4160(L-B), blood samples were collected at selected times from 0.5 min to 72 h after administration of dose. For P4161(B-L), blood samples were collected at selected times from 0.5 min to 8 h after administration of dose. A two- or three-exponential disposition function was used to describe the change in concentration with time after protein was administered. The data were fitted by weighted nonlinear least squares analysis using the software program PCNONLIN (Statistical Consultants, Inc., Lexington, KY). The pharmacokinetic parameters clearance rate (CL, ml/min/kg), steady state volume of distribution (Vss, ml/kg), volume of distribution of the central compartment (Vc, ml/kg), and total body mean residence time (bMRT, minutes) were calculated from curve fit parameters using standard equations (38Gibaldi N. Perrier D. Pharmacokinetics. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1982: 45-112Google Scholar). In addition, the plasma mean residence time (pMRT, minutes) was calculated as Vc/CL. To examine the specific structure/function properties and intramolecular domain interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains in BPI and LBP, we prepared the following six recombinant protein species: full-length forms of BPI (rBPI) and LBP (rLBP (27Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Williams R.E. Liu P.-S. Chan I. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Meszaros K. Parent J.B. Kasler H. Aberle S. Trown P.W. Gazzano-Santoro H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3623-3629PubMed Google Scholar)), truncated N-terminal forms of BPI and LBP (rBPI21 (31Horwitz A.H. Leigh S.D. Abrahamson S.L. Gazzano-Santoro H. Liu P.-S. Williams R.E. Carroll S.F. Theofan G. Protein Expression and Purif. 1996; 8: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and rLBP25 (27Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Williams R.E. Liu P.-S. Chan I. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Meszaros K. Parent J.B. Kasler H. Aberle S. Trown P.W. Gazzano-Santoro H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3623-3629PubMed Google Scholar)), and two fusion proteins. The fusion protein P4160(L-B) was made by joining the N-terminal amino acids 1-197 of LBP to the C-terminal amino acids 200-456 of BPI. The converse construct, termed P4161(B-L), was made by fusing the N-terminal amino acids 1-199 of BPI to the C-terminal amino acids 198-456 of LBP (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1). The properties of these recombinant proteins were then compared in both in vitro and in vivo assays as described below. Previously we have shown that BPI binds lipid A with a much higher affinity than LBP (apparent Kd values of 2-5 nM for BPI versus 60-80 nM for LBP (9Gazzano-Santoro H. Parent J.B. Grinna L. Horwitz A. Parsons T. Theofan G. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Conlon P. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4754-4761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Williams R.E. Liu P.-S. Chan I. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Meszaros K. Parent J.B. Kasler H. Aberle S. Trown P.W. Gazzano-Santoro H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3623-3629PubMed Google Scholar)). To evaluate the apparent Kd values of each recombinant protein species, we measured the ability of rBPI21, rBPI, rLBP, P4160(L-B), or P4161(B-L) to compete with the binding of 125I-rBPI21 to immobilized lipid A. The data shown in Fig. 2 are from a representative experiment and indicate that rBPI21 competes best with radiolabeled rBPI21 for lipid A binding, whereas P4160(L-B) and rLBP show significantly lower activity (p < 0.05 for rBPI21 versus P4160(L-B) and p < 0.05 for rBPI21 versus rLBP). Since this is an experimental system utilizing immobilized substrate, it is possible that smaller molecules such as rBPI21 have an increased ability to compete for radiolabeled rBPI21 binding, due to less steric hindrance, than a larger molecule such as rBPI. However, rBPI, rLBP, P4160(L-B), and P4161(B-L) are all of approximately equal mass, and so we can readily compare the relative apparent Kd values of these proteins. We have also shown previously that rLBP25 and rLBP have nearly identical apparent Kd values for lipid A binding (9Gazzano-Santoro H. Parent J.B. Grinna L. Horwitz A. Parsons T. Theofan G. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Conlon P. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4754-4761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, proteins containing the BPI N-terminal domain (rBPI21, rBPI, and P4161(B-L)) are most active in competing with radiolabeled rBPI21 for lipid A binding, whereas those with the LBP N-terminal domain (rLBP and P4160(L-B)) show significantly lower activity (p < 0.05 for rBPI21 versus rLBP or P4160(L-B)). When the various proteins were examined for their ability to compete with radiolabeled rLBP for binding to lipid A, similar trends were found. Unlabeled rLBP, rLBP25, and P4160(L-B) all had equivalent activities in inhibiting the binding of radiolabeled rLBP to lipid A, whereas rBPI21, rBPI, and P4161(B-L) were more active (data not shown). We next examined the ability of the recombinant proteins to induce LPS-dependent TNF expression in THP-1 cells. In the presence of LPS, both rLBP and P4161(B-L) were able to induce TNF production (Fig. 3). The C-terminal domain of rLBP is necessary for interaction with CD14 (39Pugin J. Schurer-Maly C.-C. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2744-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), and the data in Fig. 3 demonstrate that it is sufficient to confer this property on the fusion protein P4161(B-L) possessing the LPS binding domain of rBPI. rBPI23 is known to block LPS-induced gene expression in isolated adherent human monocytes (40Meszaros K. Aberle S. Dedrick R. Machovicj R. Horwitz A.H. Birr C.B. Theofan G. Parent J.B. Blood. 1994; 83: 2516-2525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we characterized the ability of the recombinant proteins to block LPS-induced TNF expression in THP-1 cells. rBPI and rBPI21 showed the greatest ability to inhibit TNF production (Fig. 4), indicating neutralization of LPS inflammatory activity. The fusion protein P4160(L-B) also inhibited TNF induction but was approximately 10-fold less active then rBPI (p < 0.05 for difference of rBPI or rBPI21 versus P4160(L-B)). The C-terminal portion of BPI has been previously reported to have LPS neutralization activity (16Ooi C.E. Weiss J. Doerfler M.E. Elsbac"

Based on the crystal structure of the G protein, β1A is composed of an N-terminal α helix, a loop, and five β strands in which the C-terminal four β strands form a β sheet, the first of seven sheets that make up the propeller structure of the β subunit. A mutant of β1A (L4P, L7P, and L14P), in which the α helix was potentially destroyed, interacted poorly with the G protein γ subunit but effectively with domains of AC2, GIRK1, and PLC-β2. In contrast, another mutant of β1A (S72A, D76A, and W82A), in which a network of hydrogen bonds was disrupted, interacted poorly with GIRK1 and PLC-β2 domains, but effectively with the γ subunit and the AC2 domain. These results suggest that the proper folding of the first five β strands in the G protein β subunit is a requirement for appropriately positioning residues that interact with GIRK1 and PLC-β2. Furthermore, since mutations that potentially disrupted the folding of these β strands did not affect interaction with AC2, the structural determinants on the G protein β subunit for interaction with various effectors may be different.

https://openalex.org/W2089450973,"Expression of the Escherichia coli sugar phosphate transporter UhpT is induced by extracellular glucose 6-phosphate through a transmembrane signaling process dependent on the sensor kinase UhpB and the UhpT homolog, UhpC. These proteins are thought to regulate the phosphorylation of the transcription activator, UhpA. To examine the effect of protein phosphorylation on the binding of UhpA to target sequences in the uhpT promoter region, the UhpA protein was overexpressed and purified. Purified UhpA was phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate in a reaction that was dependent on Mg2+ and on the presence of aspartate 54, the site of phosphorylation in homologous response regulators. Gel electrophoretic mobility shift and DNase I and hydroxyl radical protection assays showed that UhpA bound specifically to the region of the uhpT promoter extending from -80 to -50 bp, relative to the transcription start site. At higher concentrations of UhpA, binding was extended to the -32 region. Binding to the -64 element exhibited positive cooperativity and was stimulated severalfold by phosphorylation of UhpA, whereas extension to the downstream region was more strongly affected by phosphorylation. The consensus sequences for the high affinity UhpA-binding sites in the -64 element and for the downstream, low affinity sites are proposed. The pattern of in vitro binding by UhpA agreed with the in vivo observations that phosphorylation-independent assembly of the transcription initiation complex can occur at elevated concentrations of UhpA.

Expression of the uhpT gene allows growth of Escherichia coli on various phosphorylated sugars. The UhpT anion-exchanging transporter mediates the uptake of many organo-phosphate compounds, but its synthesis is induced only by extracellular glucose 6-phosphate (1Dietz G.W. Adv. Enzymol. 1976; 44: 237-259PubMed Google Scholar, 2Maloney P.C. Ambudkar S.V. Anantharam V. Sonna L.A. Varadhachary A. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pogell B.M. Maity B.R. Frimkin S. Shapiro S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 116: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Regulatory proteins encoded by the uhpABC genes couple the expression of UhpT with detection of exogenous Glu-6-P (reviewed in 4Kadner R.J. Island M.D. Dahl J.L. Webber C.A. Res.

Because UhpC is related to the transporter UhpT in both amino acid sequence and transmembrane structure, it is likely to serve as the receptor for external Glu-6-P. UhpA and UhpB contain sequence motifs characteristic of the response regulators and sensor kinases, respectively, of two-component bacterial signaling systems. Transcription at the uhpT promoter is absolutely dependent on UhpA and is also subject to catabolite repression through the action of the catabolite gene activator protein, CAP 1The abbreviations used are: CAPcatabolite gene activator proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisbpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionIPTGisopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranosideDTTdithiothreitolHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyTricineN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine.

Sequence comparisons group UhpA into a family of response-regulator proteins that includes NarL from E. coli, DegU from Bacillus subtilis, and FixJ from Rhizobium species (7Pao G.M. Tam R. Lipshitz L.S. Saier Jr., M.H. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Members of this family share a common modular organization with an N-terminal phosphorylation module linked through a highly variable, flexible linker to a C-terminal output module (8Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain contains a highly conserved aspartyl residue (Asp-54 in UhpA), which is the site of phosphorylation in homologous proteins, CheY and NtrC (9Sanders D.A. Gillece-Castro B.L.

J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5117-5122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This aspartyl residue is part of an acidic pocket with bound Mg2+ necessary for structure and catalytic activity (11Lukat G.S. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5436-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Stock A.M. Martinez-Hackert E. Rasmussen B.F. West A.H. Stock J.B. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13375-13380Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Response regulators are normally phosphorylated by their cognate sensor kinases, but many can be phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate or other low molecular weight phospho-donors (13McCleary W.R. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31567-31572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains of the UhpA family of response regulators contain a highly conserved segment predicted to form a helix-turn-helix motif that is similar to the DNA-binding regions of some transcription factors that are not regulated by protein phosphorylation, such as MalT from E. coli and LuxR from Vibrio fischeri (14Henikoff S. Wallace J.C. Brown J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 111-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The existence of these predicted structural motifs has been verified by the recent description of the structure of NarL at 2.4-Å resolution (15Baikalov I. Schröder I. Kaczor-Grzeskowiak M. Grzeskowiak K. Gunsalus R.P. Dickerson R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11053-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). When the uhpA gene is overexpressed from multicopy plasmids, high level constitutive expression from the uhpT promoter occurs even in the absence of UhpB and UhpC function (16Weston L.A. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3375-3383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The D54N variant of UhpA, in which aspartate 54 at the putative site of phosphorylation is replaced with asparagine, is totally inactive for Uhp expression when in single gene copy, but is as active as the wild-type protein when overexpressed (17Webber C.A. Kadner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that both protein concentration or relative stoichiometry and phosphorylation are important parameters for UhpA activity, and that the requirement for phosphorylation of UhpA is lost when it is overexpressed. Previous genetic analyses identified four regulatory elements in the uhpT promoter: a -10 region typical of σ70-dependent promoters, a 10-bp inverted repeat centered at -32, a 31-bp hyphenated inverted repeat centered at -64, and a CAP-binding sequence centered at -103.5 (all nucleotide coordinates are relative to the transcription start site) (18Merkel T.J. Nelson D.M. Brauer C.L. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2763-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multicopy plasmids carrying portions of the uhpT promoter were used in in vivo titration experiments to identify a binding site for UhpA by their ability to compete with the chromosomal uhpT promoter for limiting amounts of UhpA. Titration of UhpA was seen only if the multicopy plasmid carried the -64 element. Either half of the -64 element conferred reduced in vivo titration activity (18Merkel T.J. Nelson D.M. Brauer C.L. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2763-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that each half of the -64 element can bind UhpA, but not as well as the intact element. Disruption of the -32 element with a 6-bp linker substitution eliminated promoter activity, but the -32 element did not compete for UhpA binding in vivo and its function is yet unknown. Although UhpA protein has been implicated genetically as an essential activator of uhpT expression, the biochemical demonstration of its role in transcription activation has been lacking. Here we report that phosphorylation of UhpA by acetyl phosphate occurs on Asp-54, that UhpA binds specifically to target sequences in the uhpT promoter, and that phosphorylation strongly affects the ability of UhpA to bind to the -64 element and a downstream region. Strain BL21(DE3) was obtained from Novagen, Inc. and bears a λ lysogen with the phage T7 gene 1 (19Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides (i, 5¹-GGGTCTAGAGGAGGAGACTCATGATCACCGTTGCCCTTATA-3¹; and ii, 5¹-GGGTAATTAAGCTCGAGAACAACGTC-3¹) were used as primers in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with plasmids pRJK10 (21Weston L.A. Kadner R.J.

Microbiol. 1995; 15: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) as DNA template. Primer i introduces a BspHI site at the initiation codon of uhpA, and primer ii generates an XhoI site downstream of the uhpA coding sequence. The 610-bp PCR products containing uhpA+ or uhpA[D54N] were ligated into NcoI + XhoI-digested pET-15b (Novagen, Inc.) to form plasmids pBW6 and pJLD1, respectively, in which the uhpA genes are expressed under the control of the IPTG-inducible T7lac promoter. The inserts cloned in pBW6 and pJLD1 were sequenced using the Sequenase 2.0 reaction system (United States Biochemical Corp.) to confirm that no sequence changes were introduced during amplification and cloning. Isolation and manipulation of recombinant DNA molecules employed standard techniques (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or the product manufacturers' recommendations. Plasmids pBW6 and pJLD1 were introduced into strain BL21(DE3) by transformation. Isolates were grown in Luria broth at 37°C to a culture A600 of 0.7-0.8. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and incubation was continued for 3 h until A600 reached 1.15. Cells were harvested and suspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris acetate, pH 6.9, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) containing 0.15 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to minimize proteolysis. The cell suspension was passed three times through a French pressure cell at 15,000 pounds/square inch, and the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 10 min and then at 100,000 x g for 1 h. Nucleic acids and bound proteins were precipitated by addition of polyethyleneimine (final concentration, 0.2%) for 10 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 10 min. The pellet was washed with TEMB buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 430 mM betaine). UhpA was released from the particulate material by extraction with TEMB buffer containing 1 M NaCl. After 15 min on ice, the mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 x g for 30 min, and the supernatant solution was retained. Following addition of saturated ammonium sulfate, pH 7.5, for 60 min, the fraction that precipitated between 10% and 45% saturation with ammonium sulfate was collected by centrifugation at 7,000 x g for 80 min, suspended in buffer A, and dialyzed overnight against 2,000 volumes of buffer A. The supernatant fraction after centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 5 min was applied to a MacroPrep DEAE support column (Bio-Rad), which was equilibrated and washed with buffer A, and developed with a linear gradient from 0 to 250 mM NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing active UhpA (eluting at 50 mM NaCl) were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, concentrated using a Centricon-10 membrane ultrafiltration device (Amicon Corp., Beverly, MA), and stored at -70°C. Protein concentrations were determined by the dye-binding method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Purification was estimated by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and scanning with a Personal Densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). UhpA protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred by electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. This membrane was subjected to direct automated amino acid sequence analysis using a vertical cross-flow reaction vessel (24Sheer D.G. Yuen S. Wong J. Wasson J. Yuan J. Biotechniques. 1991; 11: 526-533PubMed Google Scholar), connected to an Applied Biosystems model 470A Sequenator with on-line model 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer, using the manufacturer's suggested reaction cycles. UhpA was phosphorylated by incubation at 37°C in a mixture containing 13 μM UhpA and 10 mM acetyl phosphate in buffer D (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT). Acetyl [32P]phosphate was prepared as described (13McCleary W.R. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31567-31572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the experiments shown in Fig. 3, proteins (2.5-10 μM) were incubated at 37°C in a 27-μl reaction volume containing buffer D and 20 mM acetyl [32P]phosphate. The half-life of phospho-UhpA (P-UhpA) was determined by labeling UhpA with acetyl [32P]phosphate for 60 min and then removing excess acetyl phosphate by passing the reaction mixture through a Sephadex G-50 QuickSpin column pre-equilibrated with buffer D. The filtrate was then incubated at 37°C, and portions were pipetted at various times onto nitrocellulose filters (0.05 μm pore size, 25 mm diameter, presoaked in buffer D) on a porous plastic filter support. Each 24-μl sample was filtered under gentle vacuum and washed immediately with 0.5 ml of buffer D. Filters were dried and exposed to a phosphorimager plate. Background binding by a labeling mixture without UhpA was less than 0.01% of filter-bound 32P-UhpA at time 0. DNA fragments used for gel mobility shift assays were generated with PCR reactions. PCR primers that annealed to the coding strand of the uhp locus were as follows: A, 5¹-CCCTTTTTGAATTCCCAGACACC-3¹; B, 5¹-CCGGCAAAACTAAGAAATTTTCCAGGTTTTGCCTGG-3¹; and C, 5¹-CGCTATCTCAGGCCTGATTTGCTG-3¹. PCR primers used to anneal to the noncoding strand of the uhp locus were as follows: 1, 5¹-GGGTCGGATCCCGAACCTGGTTTAA-3¹; 2, 5¹-GATAGCGTCCAGGCAAAA-3¹; and 3, 5¹-TATGAAGTGAAAAGGTGA-3¹. The DNA templates were plasmid pRJK10 or plasmid pRS415:PT RsaI derivatives containing 6-bp NcoI linker substitutions at selected sites throughout the uhpT promoter (18Merkel T.J. Nelson D.M. Brauer C.L. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2763-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR-products were purified on Wizard spin columns (Promega, Madison, WI) and labeled at the 5¹ end by incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN). Nucleotide precursors were removed by gel filtration through G-50 QuickSpin columns, and the labeled DNA was suspended in buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA) and quantified by ethidium bromide fluorescence using the saran wrap method (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions (10 μl) contained buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 5% (v/v) glycerol), 120 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer Mannheim), 5.4-7 nM32P-labeled DNA fragment, and differing amounts of UhpA in buffer B. The reaction mixes were incubated at 25°C for 20 min. Unlabeled competitor DNA was added in H2O, dried by lyophilization in the reaction tube, and dissolved in binding assay components before addition of UhpA. Gels were pre-electrophoresed to constant current before samples were loaded with addition of 1.1 μl of 50% glycerol with 0.25% xylene cyanol and 0.25% bromphenol blue in buffer B. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.5-mm-thick 10% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 38:1) with gel and electrode buffer of 96 mM Tris, pH 8.6, 90 mM borate, 3 mM EDTA. Electrophoresis was performed at 560 V for 1 to 2 h. The gels were dried under vacuum, and the positions of radioactive fragments were visualized on a phosphor storage screen, which was analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, running the ImageQuant program. PCR primers A and 1 were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and purified with Sephadex G-25 QuickSpin columns. The labeled primers were used in separate PCR reactions with unlabeled primers 1 and A, respectively, and template pRJK10 to generate 210-bp DNA fragments that were 5¹-labeled on either the noncoding or coding strand. End-labeled DNA fragments were purified on 10% acrylamide gels and suspended in buffer B. A 10-μl solution containing end-labeled DNA (1.4-2.2 nM) in buffer C was mixed with different amounts of UhpA or P-UhpA, as indicated. The DNA-protein mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 25°C. Limited digestion of the protein-bound DNA was initiated by the addition of RQ1 DNase solution (Promega) (used at 2.3 x 10-3 units/μl after dilution in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM DTT). Digestion was carried out for 1 min at 25°C and terminated by the addition of formamide to 50% and boiling for 5 min. DNase digestion patterns were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 8.3 M urea in TBE buffer. For alignment of DNase digestion patterns with DNA sequences, the 210-bp A1 PCR fragment was sequenced using primers A or 1 and run alongside the digestion reaction lanes. Hydroxyl radical footprinting (25Tullius T.D. Dombrowski B.A. Churchill M.E.A. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) was performed essentially as described by Craig et al. (26Craig M.L. Suh W.-C. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15624-15632Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 5¹-32P-Labeled primer 1 was used in a PCR reaction with primer D, 5¹-CTCGATACCTGGCACTGGAGCGGA, and plasmid pRJK10 as template, to generate a 285-bp DNA fragment labeled on the bottom strand. Labeled DNA was suspended in buffer B (prepared with HPLC-grade water) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a 40-μl volume with 480 ng of poly(dI-dC) and UhpA or P-UhpA at indicated concentrations. A volume of 4 μl of 14 mM sodium ascorbate and 2 μl of 3% hydrogen peroxide was pipetted onto the side of the microcentrifuge tube. A drop containing freshly prepared solution of 60 mM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and 120 mM EDTA was pipetted as a second drop onto the side of the tube. The solutions were mixed by gentle vortex action. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 2 min and quenched by addition of 4 μl of a solution containing 143 mM thiourea and 26 mM EDTA. Following addition of 10 μg of yeast tRNA and 200 mM sodium acetate, the DNA was precipitated with ethanol, denatured by dissolution in 50% formamide, and separated by electrophoresis as described in the previous section. Protein molecular weight measurements were made by electrospray mass spectrometry using a Finnigan-MAT TSQ7000 mass spectrometer system, as described previously (27Covey T.R. Bonner R.F. Shusan B.I. Henion J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectr. 1988; 2: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Samples were introduced by either capillary column HPLC or infusion at 0.6 μl/min. Electrospray ionization was carried out at 4.5 kV with a sheath liquid flow of 70% methanol, 30% water at 1.2 μl/min and a co-axial nitrogen flow. Spectra were acquired by scanning the first quadrupole of the tandem quadrupole instrument and were deconvoluted using the algebraic method of Mann. UhpA and its D54N variant were overexpressed using the pET15b expression plasmid carrying inserts of PCR products that should yield the UhpA proteins with their natural termini. IPTG induction of synthesis of phage T7 RNA polymerase resulted in high level expression of a 24-kDa polypeptide, which was not seen in uninduced cells or in cells carrying the vector plasmid lacking an insert. Fig. 1 shows the SDS-PAGE display of the purification of the wild-type UhpA protein through the steps of polyethyleneimine precipitation, fractional precipitation between 10% and 45% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and salt gradient elution from a DEAE column. Similar results were obtained for the UhpA[D54N] variant (data not shown). The size of the 24-kDa polypeptide is in reasonable agreement with the molecular mass of 20,889 Da deduced from the uhpA nucleotide sequence, and this polypeptide migrates at the position for 21 kDa on Tricine gels. 2C. Webber, manuscript in preparation. Based on densitometric scanning of the electropherograms, the degree of purification was >90%. Confirmation that the purified protein was UhpA was provided by several tests. The sequence of the first 20 N-terminal residues was determined by automated Edman degradation and matched exactly that of the deduced UhpA polypeptide (28Island M.D. Wei B.-Y. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), showing that the N-terminal methionine residue was retained in the product. Purified UhpA was subjected to analysis by electrospray mass spectrometry, and the major protein species had a molecular mass of 20,900 +; 4 Da, in close agreement with its predicted molecular mass (data not shown). Finally, rabbit polyclonal antisera raised to this polypeptide reacted in Western blot analysis with a 21-kDa polypeptide that was present only in uhpA+ cells and was present in amplified amounts in cells with a uhpA-bearing plasmid (17Webber C.A. Kadner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Several response regulators can be phosphorylated and activated by incubation with low molecular weight phospho-donors, such as acetyl phosphate (13McCleary W.R. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31567-31572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Drapal N. Sawers G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Feng J. Atkinson M.R.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4985-4992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transfer of phosphate to purified UhpA from acetyl [32P]phosphate and the properties of the phosphorylated protein were investigated. Fig. 2B demonstrates that [32P]phosphate was transferred from acetyl phosphate to UhpA in a reaction containing 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4.8 μM UhpA, and 20 mM acetyl [32P]phosphate at 37°C (lane 2). Transfer of phosphate was completely blocked in the presence of 10 mM EDTA (lane 1) or when aspartate-54 of UhpA was replaced with asparagine (lane 3). The requirement for magnesium and for aspartate 54 is consistent with the proposed role of the conserved acidic pocket for binding the Mg2+ atom necessary for the phosphotransfer reaction (11Lukat G.S.

A. 1992; 89: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). There was no detectable difference in the electrophoretic mobilities of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of UhpA during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). The time course of phosphorylation was slow, and steady-state levels were reached only after incubation for 1 h (Fig. 3A). From the amount of radioactivity in the separated protein species, a rough estimate of the stoichiometry of labeling was 0.5-1 mol of phosphate/mol of protein. Labeling was competed by nonradioactive acetyl phosphate (Fig. 3B). Half-maximal inhibition was obtained at 20 mM acetyl phosphate, indicating that the phosphate donor was acetyl phosphate and not some other species that might have formed during the chemical synthesis of the labeled acetyl phosphate. The stability of phospho-UhpA (P-UhpA) was determined by separating UhpA from acetyl [32P]phosphate by rapid gel filtration through a QuickSpin column after a 120-min incubation period to allow maximal protein labeling. At intervals, UhpA was separated from released inorganic phosphate by collection on nitrocellulose filters. The rate of loss of filter-bound radioactivity indicated a half-time for hydrolysis of about 60 min at pH 7.5 (Fig. 3C). The stability of P-UhpA is thus comparable to the t1/2 of ∼1.5 h for P-OmpR (34Igo M.M. Ninfa A.J. Stock J.B. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1725-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and P-PhoB (13McCleary W.R. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31567-31572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is much higher than for P-CheY and P-NtrC, whose half-lives are 6-15 s and 4-8 min, respectively (35Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 36Weiss V. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8919-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The extent of incorporation of radioactivity, the kinetics of labeling, and the lack of phosphorylation of the D54N variant suggested that treatment with acetyl phosphate resulted in the phosphorylation of Asp-54 on the majority of the UhpA molecules. The stoichiometry of labeling was investigated in two ways. First, UhpA protein before and after reaction with acetyl phosphate was rapidly separated from the reaction components by gel filtration in a spin column equilibrated with water. The protein, now in the presence of reduced salt concentrations, was rapidly injected for electrospray mass spectrometry. As stated above, the molecular weight of the major species of UhpA in the unphosphorylated sample was 20,904. The molecular weight of the major species in the phosphorylated sample was 20,985, indicative of the covalent addition of a single phosphate moiety (data not shown). These spectra were complicated by the presence of a complex mixture of bound ions, which led to a number of peaks of slightly higher molecular weight that were not seen when the protein sample was infused into the spectrometer in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. However, this standard sample infusion protocol did not allow recovery of P-UhpA, presumably owing to its rapid hydrolysis. To test for changes in state of oligomerization following phosphorylation, samples of UhpA were incubated with acetyl [32P]phosphate in the presence or absence of EDTA and were separated by PAGE under nondenaturing conditions. The mobility of the protein was determined by staining with Coomassie Blue, and the location of the radioactive species was determined by exposure to phosphor storage screens. The two images were aligned with the aid of radioactive dye marks. Fig. 4A shows that, after 2 h of electrophoresis in a water-cooled electrophoresis chamber, the phosphorylated form of UhpA (lane 2) migrated more rapidly than the native form (lane 1). The pattern of radioactivity shown in Fig. 4B confirmed that the radioactivity co-migrated with the Coomassie Blue-stained material in the phosphorylated sample (lane 2) and that phosphorylation was completely blocked by EDTA (lane 1). The majority (>90%) of the protein molecules incubated with acetyl phosphate exhibited this increased mobility and hence must be phosphoryla"

In cell lysate and in vitro reconstitution system, phospholipase D (PLD) activity in response to guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) was up-regulated by dbcAMP or all-trans retinoic acid treatment. In the present study, the mechanism(s) for increased PLD activity during differentiation was examined. Western blot analysis revealed that the contents of ADP-ribosylation factor, Rac2, and Cdc42Hs but not RhoA and Rac1 in the cytosolic fraction were elevated during differentiation. However, the cytosolic fraction from undifferentiated cells was almost equally potent as the cytosolic fraction from differentiated cells in the ability to stimulate membrane PLD activity. It was shown that the GTPγS-dependent PLD activity in membranes from differentiated cells was much higher than that in membranes from undifferentiated cells, suggesting that the increased PLD activity during differentiation was due to alterations in some membrane component(s). Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 and C. difficile toxin B, which are known as inhibitors of RhoA and Rho family proteins, respectively, effectively suppressed PLD activity in membranes from differentiated cells. In fact, the amount of membrane-associated RhoA was increased during differentiation. Furthermore, the extent of GTPγS-dependent PLD activity partially purified from membranes from differentiated cells was greater than that from membranes from undifferentiated cells in the presence of recombinant ADP-ribosylation factor 1. The PLD (hPLD1) mRNA level was observed to be up-regulated during differentiation, as inferred by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Our results suggest the possibility that the increased Rho proteins in membranes and the changed level of PLD itself may be, at least in part, responsible for the increase in GTPγS-dependent PLD activity during granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). PLD hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholine (PC), and produces phosphatidic acid, which can be further metabolized to diacylglycerol by phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (2Billah M.M. Anthes J.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). PLD is activated by many extracellular signal molecules, and several factors are involved in its activation. In reconstitution experiments, activation of membrane-associated PLD by nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS), was observed only when cytosol was present in the reaction mixture (3Olson S.C. Bowman E.P. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17236-17242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar findings were obtained in permeabilized cells in which the loss of cytosolic components resulted in the reduction of GTPγS-dependent PLD activity (4Geny B. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These results imply that cytosolic factors for PLD activation are presumed to be GTP-binding proteins. Indeed, two small GTP-binding proteins have been identified as regulatory factors for PLD activity (1Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) from the brain cytosol acts as a cytosolic factor to activate PLD in human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 membranes (5Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.

Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In addition to Arf, evidence for the involvement of Rho family proteins in PLD activation comes from the demonstration that Rho-specific GDP dissociation inhibitor inhibits activation of PLD by GTPγS in neutrophil membranes (7Bowman E.P.

Differentiated (but not undifferentiated) HL60 cells exhibit formylmethionylleucylphenylalamine (fMLP)- and ATP-induced PLD activation (17Xie M. Jacobs L.S. Dubyak G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that PLD activities stimulated by 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in intact cells and by GTPγS in electropermeabilized cells increased during differentiation induced by dbcAMP (17Xie M. Jacobs L.S. Dubyak G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the mechanism underlying the enhancement of PLD activity during differentiation, we have studied GTPγS-dependent PLD activation in the lysate and the reconstitution system (the membrane and cytosolic fractions) prepared from undifferentiated and differentiated HL60 cells. GTPγS-dependent membrane PLD activity is higher in differentiated cells than in undifferentiated cells, although comparable amounts of Arf and Rho family proteins were present in the cytosolic fractions from both undifferentiated and differentiated HL60 cells. The results obtained in the present study suggest the possibility that the translocation of RhoA from the cytosol to membrane and the changed level of PLD protein may be, at least in part, responsible for the increase in GTPγS-dependent PLD activity during differentiation.

Other reagents were of the highest quality available. The human promyelocytic leukemic HL60 cell line was kindly supplied by Dr. T. Okazaki (Osaka Dental University, Japan). HL60 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. For differentiation, cells were cultured in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin and 5 μg/ml transferrin for 24 h. Differentiation was initiated by the addition of 0.5 mM dbcAMP or 1 μM ATRA. For the differentiation marker, NBT reduction activity was measured (12Chaplinski T.J. Niedel J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For assay of PLD activity utilizing the endogenous substrate, cells were labeled with [3H]oleic acid (0.5 μCi/ml) for 12-15 h. Under this condition, 60-65% of the total radioactivity was incorporated into the PC fraction. HL60 cells were washed twice with buffer A (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 3 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and resuspended in buffer A. Cells were then disrupted by N2 cavitation (600 p.s.i. at 4°C for 30 min). After unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 900 x g for 5 min, the resulting supernatant was used as the HL60 cell lysate for experiments. The membrane and cytosolic fractions were further separated by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 60 min. Membranes were washed once and resuspended in buffer A. Cytosol proteins were concentrated using Centricon 10. The PLD fraction was prepared from membranes by the method described by Brown et al. (5Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Isolated membranes were resuspended in buffer B (20 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 1% cholate. After incubation at 4°C for 60 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 60 min to obtain the membrane extract. Aliquots were loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer C (buffer B containing 0.7% n-octyl β-glucopyranoside). Proteins adsorbed onto the column including PLD activity were eluted with 1 M NaCl in buffer C and concentrated. PLD activity was measured by production of [3H]phosphatidylbutanol (PBut), a specific product via its transphosphatidylation activity. [3H]Oleic acid-labeled HL60 cell lysates (200 μg of protein/assay) or membranes (20 μg of protein/assay) were incubated in buffer A containing 1 mM MgATP and CaCl2 to give a final free Ca2+ concentration of 1 μM (total, 0.l ml) and stimulated with 10 μM GTPγS at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of butanol (0.3%, v/v). Alternatively, PLD activity was measured in unlabeled membranes and cytosol and extracted PLD fractions using substrate phospholipid vesicles prepared according to Brown et al. (5Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Mixed-lipid vesicles (phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate/egg PC, 10:1.5:1 molar ratio) containing [palmitoyl-3H]DPPC (3 μCi/ml) were added to membranes and cytosolic and extracted PLD fractions in a reaction mixture containing 50 mM Na-HEPES (pH 7.5), 80 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 3 mM MgCl2, 3 mM EGTA, and 2 mM CaCl2 to give a final free Ca2+ concentration of 300 nM (total, 0.1 ml) and stimulated with 10 μM GTPγS at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of butanol (0.3%, v/v). To measure oleate-dependent PLD activity using exogenous substrate, the assays were carried out with egg PC and [palmitoyl-3H]DPPC essentially according to the method described by Massenburg et al. (29Massenburg D. Han J.-S. Liyanage M. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11718-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by the addition of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). Lipids were extracted and separated on Silica Gel 60 TLC plates in a solvent system of the upper phase of ethyl acetate/2,2,4-trimethylpentane/acetic acid/water (13:2:3:10, v/v) as described previously (30Alam M.S. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The plates were exposed to iodine vapor, and [3H]PBut was identified by comigration with PBut standard. The spots scraped off the plates were mixed with scintillation mixture, and the radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS-6500). The membrane and cytosolic fractions were isolated from HL60 cells as described above. Membranes were washed once in buffer D (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and then resuspended in buffer D containing 1% Triton X-100. After incubation at 4°C for 60 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 60 min to obtain the membrane extract. Proteins of the membrane extracts and cytosolic fractions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 13% polyacrylamide gel (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar) and then electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44891) Google Scholar). Blocking was performed in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% skimmed-milk powder and 0.05% Tween 20. Western blot analysis using specific antibodies was performed as described previously (33Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The intensity of the bands was quantified by a densitometer (Densitograph; ATTO, Japan). Total RNA was isolated from HL60 cells by acid guanidine thiocyanate method (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63145) Google Scholar). 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed by using random hexamer mixed primers. Temperatures used for PCR were: denaturation, 94°C for 30 s; annealing, 58°C for 1 min; and extension, 72°C for 1 min. Primers for hPLD1 were 5′-(2549)-TGTCGTGATACCACTTCTGCCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-(3080)-AGCATTTCGAGCTGCTGTTGAA-3′ (antisense) (35Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-S. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J.

For normalization, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified simultaneously using the sense primer 5′-(27)-ACGGATTTGGTCGTATTGGG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-(257)-TGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCGC-3′ (36Ercolani L. Florence B. Denaro M. Alexander M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15335-15341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amplification cycles were determined for individual primer sets to maintain an exponential rate of product amplification. Amplified DNA fragments were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The intensity of the bands was quantified by a densitometer (Densitograph; ATTO, Japan). The temporal correlation between cell differentiation and PLD activity was investigated by examining changes in GTPγS-dependent PLD activity in HL60 cell lysates at various stages during differentiation. Differentiation was initiated by the addition of 0.5 mM dbcAMP and assessed by NBT reduction test. Less than 5% of cells expressed NBT reduction activity in the undifferentiated state. With dbcAMP treatment, NBT-positive cells increased in a time-dependent manner and reached the maximal level at 72 h (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, PLD activation induced by 10 μM GTPγS in the cell lysates was up-regulated after dbcAMP treatment and reached an almost maximal level at 72 h (an approximately 4-fold increase compared with that of undifferentiated cells). The temporal profile of NBT reducing activity showed a good correlation with that of GTPγS-dependent PLD activation. In addition, ATRA, which is also known to induce granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells, caused an almost identical increase in NBT-positive cells (Fig. 1C). GTPγS-induced PLD activity in HL60 cells was also increased by ATRA treatment (an approximately 1.8-fold increase compared with that of undifferentiated cells) but the magnitude was lower than that observed in dbcAMP-treated cells (Fig. 1D). The reconstitution systems from both undifferentiated and differentiated HL60 cells were designed to further investigate the mechanisms for the increase in GTPγS-dependent PLD activity during differentiation. Recent studies with the cell-free system (3Olson S.C. Bowman E.P. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17236-17242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cytosol-depleted permeabilized cells (4Geny B. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have indicated that some cytosolic factors are required for activation of PLD by GTPγS. We have examined PLD activation by GTPγS in the membranes from undifferentiated and differentiated HL60 cells labeled with [3H]oleic acid. In the absence of the cytosolic fraction, GTPγS caused a marginal PLD activation in undifferentiated membranes (Fig. 2A). However, when the cytosolic fraction from undifferentiated HL60 cells was present in the reaction mixture, the PLD activity was enhanced nearly 4-fold by the addition of 10 μM GTPγS (Fig. 2A). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 2B, GTPγS and the cytosolic fraction exerted much greater effects on the membrane PLD activation in differentiated HL60 cells (an approximately 3-fold increase compared with that of undifferentiated cells). When the GTPγS-dependent PLD activity in the cytosolic as well as membrane fractions was determined using the exogenous substrate (phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate/egg PC, 10:1.5:1), the differentiation induced by dbcAMP caused a small but significant enhancement in cytosolic PLD activity (Fig. 3). The GTPγS-induced PLD activation in both undifferentiated and differentiated membranes was dependent on the cytosolic fraction from undifferentiated and differentiated cells, respectively. Furthermore, the maximal PLD activation in membranes from differentiated cells was approximately 3-fold higher than that in undifferentiated membranes (Fig. 3B). Thus, similar results were obtained in both endogenous and exogenous substrate systems.Fig. 3GTPγS-dependent PLD activity measured with exogenous substrate in membranes and cytosolic fractions isolated from undifferentiated and differentiated HL60 cells. Membranes (20 μg of protein/assay) and cytosolic fractions (60 μg of protein/assay) from undifferentiated HL60 cells (A) or differentiated cells treated with 0.5 mM dbcAMP for 72 h (B) were incubated with 10 μM GTPγS and the substrate phospholipid vesicles containing [palmitoyl-3H]DPPC at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of 0.3% butanol (total, 0.1 ml).

Chem. 1995; 270: 8466-8473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), changes in the contents of Arf and Rho family proteins in the cytosolic fractions were examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, the contents of Arf, Rac2, and Cdc42Hs in the cytosolic fractions from differentiated cells (Cyt-D) were approximately 3.5-fold higher than those in undifferentiated cells (Cyt-UD). In contrast, there were no significant increases in the levels of RhoA and Rac1 (Fig. 4). In the next experiments, the effects of the cytosolic fraction from undifferentiated or differentiated cells were examined for GTPγS-dependent PLD activity in undifferentiated membranes (Mem-UD). Two cytosolic fractions (Cyt-D and Cyt-UD) enhanced PLD activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5). However, relatively modest differences were observed between the undifferentiated and differentiated cytosolic fractions. The PLD activation by GTPγS in membranes isolated from undifferentiated or differentiated cells was compared in the presence of undifferentiated cytosol (Cyt-UD). The activation of GTPγS-dependent PLD in membranes (Mem-D) from differentiated cells was markedly distinct from that in membranes (Mem-UD) from undifferentiated cells (Fig. 6). These results suggested that the increased PLD activity during differentiation was caused primarily by changes of membrane component(s), e.g. activating factor(s) and/or PLD itself, but not of cytosolic factors.Fig. 6Activation of PLD in membranes from undifferentiated and differentiated HL60 cells by cytosolic fraction from undifferentiated cells. Membranes (indicated protein concentrations) from undifferentiated HL60 cells (Mem-UD) or differentiated cells treated with 0.5 mM dbcAMP for 72 h (Mem-D) and 60 μg of protein/assay of undifferentiated HL60 cytosolic fractions (Cyt-UD) were incubated with 10 μM GTPγS and the substrate phospholipid vesicles containing [palmitoyl-3H]DPPC at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of 0.3% butanol (total, 0.1 ml).

Therefore, the effect of C3 toxin, which inhibits RhoA (27Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), on GTPγS-induced PLD activation was examined. The GTPγS-induced PLD activation in differentiated HL60 membranes was suppressed in a concentration-dependent manner by C3 toxin in the presence of 10 μM NAD. Nearly maximal inhibition was obtained at 1 μg/ml (data not shown). Under the same condition, RhoA in differentiated HL60 membranes was ADP-ribosylated by 1 μg/ml C3 toxin, as assessed by the incorporation of [32P]NAD (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 7B, pretreatment of differentiated HL60 membranes with 1 μg/ml C3 toxin caused an approximately 65% inhibition of GTPγS-induced PLD activation. As demonstrated by Siddiqi et al. (9Siddiqi A.R. Smith J.L. Ross A.H. Qiu R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8466-8473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), in addition to RhoA, Cdc42Hs and Rac were able to activate PLD in HL60 membranes. Thus, to further examine the roles of Cdc42Hs and Rac in PLD activation of differentiated HL60 membranes, we used Toxin B, which was recently shown to glucosylate Rho family proteins and inhibit their interaction with effectors (28Aktories K. Just I. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 441-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7B, GTPγS-induced PLD activation in differentiated HL60 membranes was almost abolished by Toxin B treatment. These results suggest that RhoA may play a major role in GTPγS-induced PLD activation in differentiated HL60 membranes. Then, the contents of Rho family"

We have previously shown that overexpression of c-fps/fes in a CSF-1-dependent macrophage cell line (BAC1.2F5) partially released these cells from their factor dependence and that this correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of a subset of proteins in a tissue-specific manner. We have now identified one of the macrophage substrates of Fes as the crk-associated substrate (Cas) and a second substrate as a 130-kDa protein that has been previously described as a T cell activation-dependent substrate and is unrelated to Cas. Both of these proteins, which have optimal consensus sequences for phosphorylation by Fes, were tightly associated with this kinase through its SH2 domain, suggesting that they were direct substrates of Fes. Remarkably, when the Fes SH2 domain was used as an affinity reagent to identify potential substrates of endogenous Fes in control BAC1.2F5 cells, the phosphotyrosyl proteins that were recognized were the same as those that were specifically phosphorylated when Fes was overexpressed in the same cells. We conclude that the substrates we identified may be structurally related or identical to the physiological targets of this kinase in macrophages. The known functions of Cas and p130 suggest that Fes kinase may play a role in signaling triggered by cell adhesion and cell-cell interactions during immune responses of macrophages.

Montesoro E. Parolini I. Russo G. Colombo M.P. Peschle C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 739-747PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue specificity of Fes expression has suggested that this kinase may play a role in myelopoiesis or in specialized functions of myeloid cells (1Feldman R.A. Gabrilove J.L. Tam J.P.

However, the mechanism of action and biological role of this kinase in its target tissues is not well understood. Since identification of the substrates of Fes kinase is one of the keys to elucidate its biological role, efforts have been made to uncover these substrates. One approach has been to express this kinase in different cell types and to correlate biological activity with phosphorylation of specific cellular targets. In established murine fibroblasts, where Fes is normally not present, expression of this kinase at high levels causes tumorigenic transformation (12Feldman R.A. Lowy D.R. Vass W.C. Velu T.J. J.

By contrast, the biological and biochemical activity of ectopically expressed p92c-fes in macrophages, a cell type where this kinase is normally expressed at the highest levels, was more restricted. Fes expression in the CSF-1-dependent BAC1.2F5 cell line resulted in only partial relief of factor dependence, and Fes phosphorylated a limited subset of proteins on tyrosine, including a 130-kDa (p130) and a 75-kDa (p75) protein, which have so far not been implicated in major mitogenic pathways (19Areces L.B. Dellos-Barba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The lack of a strong proliferative effect of Fes in macrophages and the failure to phosphorylate or activate targets frequently involved in mitogenic and oncogenic signaling suggest that, in contrast to its effect on cell proliferation in fibroblasts, in macrophages Fes may participate in a specialized function of these cells. In this paper we have identified Cas and p130 as two distinct tissue-specific substrates of Fes in macrophages. Their known functions suggest a possible role of Fes during signaling in response to cell adhesion and interactions with other cells of the immune system.

For immunoprecipitation cell lysates containing 200 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antisera, and the immunoprecipitates were collected on Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) as described (19Areces L.B.

For adsorption to bacterial fusion proteins, cell lysates containing 200 μg of protein were incubated with 1-2 μg of bacterial protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose for 2 h at 4°C.

To identify potential physiological substrates of Fes in macrophages, we have overexpressed this kinase in BAC1.2F5, a CSF-1-dependent macrophage cell line (20Morgan C. Pollard J.W. Stanley E.R. J.

Human p92c-fes was introduced into these cells by retroviral-mediated gene transfer using the retroviral expression vector pFF (12Feldman R.A. Lowy D.R. Vass W.C. Velu T.J. J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As previously shown, this vector induced the expression of p92c-fes at levels 30-50 times higher than background levels found in control cells (19Areces L.B. Dellos-Barba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ectopically expressed Fes protein was enzymatically active as shown by its in vitro kinase activity (Fig. 1A) and by the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins that were largely undetectable in control BACI.2F5 cells (Fig. 1B). The most prominent were two phosphotyrosyl proteins of 130-kDa (p130) and a 75-kDa (p75) that we have previously described (19Areces L.B. Dellos-Barba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). p75 did not cross-react with known signaling proteins in the same molecular weight range (19Areces L.B. Dellos-Barba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and may be a novel protein, whereas p130 was recognized by an antibody (4F4) directed to a known substrate of v-src (19Areces L.B. Dellos-Barba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl.

This v-src substrate has been cloned and named crk-associated substrate (Cas) because of its association with the v-crk oncoprotein in v-crk-transformed cells (23Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yasaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 27Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2638-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Since the original antibody used to characterize p130 also recognized other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (19Areces L.B. Dellos-Barba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we sought additional evidence that p130 and Cas were the same protein. To this end we used specific antibodies raised to the bacterially expressed Cas protein. In BAC1.2F5 cells where Fes was ectopically expressed (BAC1-Fes), this kinase was tightly associated with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. The most prominent bands had apparent molecular masses of 130, 115, 95, and 65-70 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 1). To determine if the 130-kDa species was related to Cas, we used specific anti-Cas antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, lane 2, the anti-Cas antibody precipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas from lysates of BAC1-Fes cells, and direct immunoblotting of Fes immunoprecipitates with anti-Cas antibody confirmed that Cas coprecipitated with Fes (Fig. 2, lane 3). However, we were surprised to find that anti-Cas antibodies did not recognize the major 130-kDa species (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4) and that Cas and p130 had different electrophoretic mobilities, suggesting that they were different proteins. p130 and Cas were not differentially phosphorylated forms of the same protein: anti-Cas antibody precipitated the different phosphorylated forms of Cas but not p130 (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained using two other different antibodies raised to bacterially expressed Cas (obtained from H. Hirai and from A. Bouton) (data not shown). The phosphotyrosyl Cas protein in BAC1-Fes cells had a higher electrophoretic mobility than the phosphorylated Cas protein in v-src-transformed cells (data not shown), which may reflect differences in the state of phosphorylation of Cas in Fes-expressing macrophages and v-src-transformed fibroblasts. Although the Cas product is often referred to as p130cas (23Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yasaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), in the present study we refer to it as Cas to avoid confusion with the protein we call p130. We have previously shown that the SH2 domain of Fes had high specificity for the substrates of this kinase and that it mediated binding of Fes to some of its substrates (19Areces L.B. Dellos-Barba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine if the Fes SH2 domain mediated the association of Fes with tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas, we incubated lysates of BAC1-Fes cells with a bacterial fusion protein encoding the Fes SH2 domain (GST-SH2), followed by immunoblot analysis of the adsorbed proteins with anti-Cas antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3, GST-SH2 but not control GST vector protein was able to precipitate Cas, suggesting that the tight association of Fes with phosphorylated Cas was mediated through the Fes SH2 domain. This association and the presence in Cas of two putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites (YDXV) (23Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yasaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) that are close to the optimal consensus sequence for Fes phosphorylation and binding to its SH2 domain (YEXV) suggest that Cas may be a direct substrate of Fes in BAC1-Fes cells. From these results we conclude that Cas or a closely related protein is one of the substrates phosphorylated by Fes in BAC1-Fes cells and that this substrate remains tightly associated with Fes kinase through the Fes SH2 domain. The results presented above indicated that Cas was distinct from the phosphotyrosyl p130 protein we originally described (19Areces L.B. Dellos-Barba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore we sought to identify p130 using antisera to known signaling proteins in the same molecular weight range. One of the candidates we tested was a 120-130-kDa protein that is selectively expressed in lymphoid and myeloid cells and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated during T cell activation (22da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Muller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Like our p130 substrate, this T cell protein was also recognized by 4F4 antibody (28da Silva A.J. Janssen O. Rudd C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2107-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but the use of specific polyclonal antibodies raised against purified p120/130 has recently revealed that p120/130 was unrelated to Cas (22da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Muller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, DNA sequence analysis of cloned p120/130 cDNA confirmed that this protein had no homology to Cas or any other protein in the data bank. 2A. J. da Silva, submitted for publication. Therefore, we used this specific anti-p120/130 antiserum to determine if the 120-130-kDa T cell protein and the p130 substrate of Fes were related proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, anti-p120/130 precipitated a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated 130-kDa protein from lysates of BAC1-Fes cells, which co-migrated with the phosphotyrosyl p130 present in anti-Fes immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4). This suggested that the 120-130-kDa protein identified in T cells was the same or related to the p130 protein phosphorylated in BAC1-Fes cells. Using specific antibodies to other proteins in the same molecular weight range of p130 and Cas, we also determined that the β subunit of granulocyte/macrophage-CSF receptor (29Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Harada N. Yokota T. Arai K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 295-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), JAK kinases (30Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), focal adhesion kinase (31Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.C. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar), phospholipase C-γ (32Kim J.W. Sim S.S. Kim U.-H. Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Carpenter G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3940-3943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the pp120 v-src substrate (33Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were not detectably tyrosine-phosphorylated in BAC1-Fes cells and that therefore these were not primary substrates of Fes kinase in these cells (19, data not shown). However, we cannot rule out that there are other substrates of Fes in this molecular weight range in BAC1-Fes cells, which were not identified in this study. We then examined whether phosphotyrosyl p130 was recognized by the Fes SH2 domain. Cell lysates from BAC1-Fes cells were adsorbed with bacterially expressed GST-SH2 fusion protein, and the adsorbed proteins were analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. GST-SH2 but not control GST vector protein was able to precipitate several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins including p130 and p75 from cell lysates of Fes overexpressing cells (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2). Immunoblotting of GST-SH2 precipitates with anti-p120/130 antibody confirmed the identity of the phosphotyrosyl p130 protein recognized by the Fes SH2 domain as p120/130 (Fig. 5, lane 5). Fig. 5, lane 3, also shows that in BAC1.2F5 cells, p130 consists of two closely migrating species. We conclude that the 120-130-kDa substrate identified in T cells and the p130 substrate of Fes are the same or related proteins and that p130 and Cas are two different substrates of Fes in BAC1-Fes cells. DNA sequence analysis of full-length p120/130 cDNA clones revealed the presence of two phosphotyrosine motifs (YDDV) that are close to the optimal consensus sequence for Fes phosphorylation,2 which is consistent with the idea that p130 may be a direct substrate of Fes. Further analysis will be required to identify the Fes tyrosine phosphorylation sites in p130. Since the Fes SH2 domain appears to have high specificity for the substrates of this kinase (19Areces L.B. Dellos-Barba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we reasoned that this SH2 domain might have affinity for potential physiological targets of endogenous p92c-fes in control macrophages. To determine if the Fes SH2 domain recognized any phosphotyrosyl proteins in BAC1.2F5, cell lysates were adsorbed with GST-SH2 fusion protein, and the adsorbed proteins were analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 4, GST-SH2 but not GST recognized a number of phosphotyrosyl proteins from control BAC1.2F5. Remarkably, these phosphotyrosyl proteins had the same electrophoretic mobilities as those that were identified as the major substrates of Fes in BAC1-Fes cells (Fig. 6A, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5). Immunoblotting of the Fes-SH2-adsorbed proteins from control BAC1.2F5 cells with anti-p120/130 antibody confirmed that p120/130 was one of the proteins recognized by the Fes SH2 domain (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 5). Taken together, these results are highly suggestive that the Fes substrates we identified are structurally related or identical to the physiological substrates of Fes kinase in BAC1.2F5 macrophages. In this study we have identified Cas and p130 as two different tissue-specific substrates of Fes in macrophages. Overexpression of Fes kinase in BAC1.2F5 cells resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of a subset of proteins, which were different from known adapter proteins associated with mitogenic signaling. These proteins were tightly bound to Fes through its SH2 domain and contained optimal consensus sequences for phosphorylation by Fes kinase and binding to its SH2 domain, suggesting that they were direct substrates of this kinase. Using peptide library technology it was previously shown that the optimal consensus sequences for phosphorylation by non-receptor tyrosine kinases were very similar to the optimal consensus sequences for binding to the SH2 domains of the corresponding kinases (34Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo R.X. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell.

Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Thus, the catalytic and SH2 domains of tyrosine kinases have co-evolved so that some of the phosphorylated substrates can be retained by their SH2 domains. This mechanism may allow for phosphorylation of additional sites in the retained substrates or in other proteins present in the phosphotyrosyl complex. Our results are consistent with some of the predictions of this model. We showed that some of the Fes substrates in BAC1-Fes cells remain associated with Fes after phosphorylation and that this association was mediated through the Fes SH2 domain. Although the Fes tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Cas and p130 have not yet been mapped, these two proteins contain optimal Fes tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which may be phosphorylated first and mediate subsequent binding to the Fes SH2 domain. Cas contains several additional tandem YDPY motifs that do not conform to the optimal sequences for Fes phosphorylation. Yet, the detection of multiple Cas forms in the Fes·;Cas complex, which may represent different phosphorylated forms of Cas, suggests that some of these non-canonical sites may also be phosphorylated by Fes, perhaps facilitated by the formation of the initial complex between Fes and its substrate. Further analysis using mutants of Fes and its substrates should clarify the mechanism used by Fes to select and phosphorylate its targets. Our previous work (12Feldman R.A. Lowy D.R. Vass W.C. Velu T.J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5469-5474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Feldman R.A. Lowy D.R. Vass W.C. Oncogene Res. 1990; 5: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar, 19Areces L.B. Dellos-Barba P. Jücker M.

In established murine fibroblasts, Fes expression led to cell transformation mediated through phosphorylation or activation of proteins involved in mitogenic and oncogenic signaling such as the GTPase-activating protein·;p62·; p190 complex (12Feldman R.A.

On the other hand, overexpression of p92c-fes had only a modest effect on the proliferative capacity of BAC1 cells, and Fes kinase phosphorylated a subset of proteins which so far have not been implicated in mitogenic pathways (19Areces L.B. Dellos-Barba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the action of other tyrosine kinases present in the same cells. In BAC1.2F5, the CSF-1 receptor is involved in the control of cell proliferation, and this is mediated through activation of the Shc/Grb2/Ras and PI 3-kinase pathways (19Areces L.B. Dellos-Barba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37Stanley E. R The Cytokine Handbook.in: Thompson A Picknett T Watts M. 13. Academic Press, London1994: 387-418Google Scholar). Thus, in macrophages Fes may not be involved in mitogenic signaling but participate in specialized signaling pathways that operate in these cells. One of the most interesting findings of this study was the observation that the phosphotyrosyl proteins recognized by the SH2 domain of Fes in control BAC1.2F5 cells were very similar to the substrates identified by overexpression of Fes in the same cells. Thus the Fes SH2 domain, which does not recognize the substrates of other tyrosine kinases present in BAC1.2F5 (19Areces L.B. Dellos-Barba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), appears to be a very specific reagent for Fes substrates. Taken together, our results are consistent with the idea that some of the substrates phosphorylated by ectopically expressed Fes in macrophages may be structurally related or identical to its physiological substrates. The identity of the two substrates described in this study provides insight into the possible site of action of Fes kinase in macrophages. Cas has an SH3 domain that is a binding site for focal adhesion kinase (38Law S.F. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), 3E. Golemis, personal communication. a tyrosine kinase that is activated by integrin engagement (39Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Cas also binds tensin (40Lo S.H. Weisberg E. Chen L.B. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and is believed to play a role in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and other signaling events induced by cell adhesion and cell-cell interactions. Moreover, Cas is phosphorylated on tyrosine following integrin engagement (41Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

This suggests that in macrophages and leukocytes, which carry out functions that involve close interactions with other cells of the immune system and with the cell matrix (e.g. cell adhesion during inflammatory responses), Fes may relay some of the signals generated during these processes. Similarly, the identity of p130 as a Fes substrate also suggests a role for Fes during cell-cell interactions. The expression of p130 in T cells and in myeloid cells and its tyrosine phosphorylation during engagement of receptors during T cell activation (22da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Muller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that this protein may play a role in the generation of bi-polar signals in interacting immunocompetent cells. In T cells p130 is believed to be phosphorylated by Fyn (22da Silva A.J. Rosenfield J.M. Muller I. Bouton A. Hirai H. Rudd C.E. J. Immunol. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in macrophages Fes may be one of the kinases involved in the phosphorylation of this protein. The identity of the macrophage substrates uncovered in this study suggests that Fes kinase may play a role in signaling triggered by cell adhesion and cell-cell interactions during immune responses of macrophages. Excellent technical assistance by Margaret Tate is greatly appreciated. We thank Amy Bouton, J. T. Parsons, and H. Hirai for generously providing us with antibodies against Cas, and E.

To learn more about the regulation of H blood group expression, cDNA encoding the human H-type GDPFuc:β-D-galactoside α1,2-fucosyltransferase (α1,2FT) was stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The new cell line, designated CHO(α1,2)FT, expressed surface neoglycans containing the H antigen. The structures of the fucosylated neoglycans in CHO(α1,2)FT cells and the distribution of these glycans on glycoproteins were characterized. Seventeen percent of the [3H]Gal-labeled glycopeptides from CHO(α1,2)FT cells bound to the immobilized H blood group-specific lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I), whereas none from parental CHO cells bound to the lectin. The glycopeptides from CHO(α1,2)FT cells binding to UEA-I contained polylactosamine [3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-]n with the terminal sequence Fucα1-2Galβ1- 4GlcNAc-R. Fucosylation of the polylactosamine sequences on complex-type N-glycans in CHO(α1,2)FT cells caused a decrease in both sialylation and length of polylactosamine. Unexpectedly, only small amounts of terminal fucosylation was found in diantennary complex-type N-glycans. The O-glycans and glycolipids were not fucosylated by the H-type α1,2FT. Two major high molecular weight glycoproteins, one of which was shown to be the lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein LAMP-1, preferentially contained the H-type structure and were bound by immobilized UEA-I. These results demonstrate that in CHO cells the expressed H-type α1,2FT does not indiscriminately fucosylate terminal galactosyl residues in complex-type N-glycans, but it favors glycans containing polylactosamine and dramatically alters their length and sialylation.

The glycopeptides from CHO(α1,2)FT cells binding to UEA-I contained polylactosamine [3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-]n with the terminal sequence Fucα1-2Galβ1- 4GlcNAc-R. Fucosylation of the polylactosamine sequences on complex-type N-glycans in CHO(α1,2)FT cells caused a decrease in both sialylation and length of polylactosamine. Unexpectedly, only small amounts of terminal fucosylation was found in diantennary complex-type N-glycans. The O-glycans and glycolipids were not fucosylated by the H-type α1,2FT. Two major high molecular weight glycoproteins, one of which was shown to be the lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein LAMP-1, preferentially contained the H-type structure and were bound by immobilized UEA-I. These results demonstrate that in CHO cells the expressed H-type α1,2FT does not indiscriminately fucosylate terminal galactosyl residues in complex-type N-glycans, but it favors glycans containing polylactosamine and dramatically alters their length and sialylation."
https://openalex.org/W1526444179,"Serum amyloid P (SAP) is a member of the pentraxin family. These are evolutionarily conserved proteins made up of five noncovalently bound identical subunits that are arranged in a flat pentameric disc. Although a variety of activities have been attributed to SAP and other pentraxins, their biological functions remain unclear. In humans SAP is a constitutive serum protein that is synthesized by hepatocytes. It is encoded by a single copy gene on chromosome 1. SAP is a component of all amyloid plaques and is also a normal component of a number of basement membranes including the glomerular basement membrane. The association and distribution of SAP within the glomerular basement membrane are altered or completely disrupted in a number of nephritides (e.g. Alport's Syndrome, type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and membranous glomerulonephritis). In the present study the binding of SAP to laminin was characterized. SAP binds to human laminin and merosin as well as mouse and rat laminins. The binding of SAP to mouse laminin is saturable and calcium-dependent. The Kd of this interaction is 2.74 × 10-7M, with a SAP/laminin molar ratio of 1:7.1. Competition binding assays indicate that the binding of SAP to laminin is inhibited by both SAP and its analog, C-reactive protein, as well as phosphatidylethanolamine. In turbidity assays SAP enhanced the polymerization of laminin in a concentration-dependent manner. However, SAP did not alter the ability of laminin to serve as a cell adhesion substrate. Previous observations indicating that SAP binds to extracellular matrix components such as type IV collagen, proteoglycans, and fibronectin in concert with the data presented here suggest that SAP may play an important role in determining the structure of those basement membranes with which it is associated.

The biological role of pentraxins is not yet clear, however, they have been shown to mediate a variety of biological activities. SAP binds to the collagen-like region of C1q and activates the classical complement pathway (3Ying S.C. Gewurz A.T. Jiang H. Gewurz H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 169-176PubMed Google Scholar).

The binding of SAP to sulfated glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and dextran sulfate proteoglycans is thought to mediate the extravascular procoagulant activity of SAP (11Williams E.C. Huppert B.J. Asakura S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 120: 159-167PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo SAP is found in association with amyloid deposits of Alzheimer's disease and secondary amyloidosis (12Pepys M.B.

Basement membranes are complex structures made up of a number of glycoprotein components (17Timpl R. Dziadek M. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1986; 29: 1-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). They form sheet-like structures in close association with tissues and organs. They are involved in maintaining the morphology of specific organs, filtration functions, and maintenance of the differentiated state and basal apical polarity of the cells associated with them (17Timpl R.

The structure, and consequently the function, of a basement membrane is determined by factors such as the shape of its components, their concentration, their affinity, and their interaction (18Timpl R.

They are cruciform-shaped proteins that are composed of three polypeptide chains (21Engel J. Odermatt E. Engel A. Madri J.A. Furthmayr H. Rohde H. Timpl R. J. Mol.

Skubitz A.P. Koliakos G.G. Reger L.A. Dege J. Vogel A.M. Wohlhueter R. Furcht L.T. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Via the above interactions, various laminin isotypes play an important role in maintaining the structure and function of different basement membranes and their adjacent tissues (25Lesot H. Kuhl U. von der Mark K. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 861-865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Malinoff H. Wicha M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 27Terranova V.P.

Previous studies indicate that SAP constitutes approximately 10% of the protein released from the GBM after collagenase treatment (13Dyck R.F. Lockwood C.M. Kershaw M. McHugh N. Duance V.C. Baltz M.L. Pepys M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The pattern of association of SAP with specific basement membranes, its altered disposition in the GBM in a number of nephritides, and its interactions with components of the ECM suggest that it may play a role in determining the structure and function of the basement membrane. Therefore, characterizing the binding of SAP to ECM components and its effect on their interactions will provide a better understanding of the biological function of this molecule and the mechanism by which it affects the structure of the specific basement membranes with which it is associated. In the present study the binding of SAP to laminin was examined. SAP binding to laminin was specific, saturable, and dependent on the presence of calcium. The Kd of the interaction was 2.74 × 10-7M, and the molar ratio of SAP/laminin was 1:7.1. The inhibition studies indicated that the binding of SAP to laminin is most likely mediated via its galactan binding region or a site near this region. SAP was also shown to enhance the polymerization of laminin molecules in solution in a concentration-dependent manner. The binding of SAP to laminin did not alter the ability of laminin to serve as a cell adhesion substrate. Human SAP and C-reactive protein (CRP) were purchased from Calbiochem. Each protein gave a single band of Mr~23,0000 and 25,0000, respectively, when size-fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12% acrylamide) under reducing conditions. Mouse SAP was purified from acute-phase mouse serum by Ca2+-dependent affinity chromatography on a column of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) as described previously (28Le P.T. Muller M.T. Mortensen R.F. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 665-672PubMed Google Scholar), followed by anion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The purified protein gave a single band after size fractionation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Mouse, rat, and human laminin and merosin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Size fractionation of these proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave bands of Mr~400,000 and Mr~200,000. Crystalline PE, phosphorylcholine chloride (PC), and monoclonal anti-human SAP antibody were purchased from Sigma. Human SAP and CRP antibodies were purchased from DAKO. Purified human SAP was iodinated by mixing 0.250 mCi of [125I]sodium iodide (Amersham Corp.) with 500 μg of SAP in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mM EDTA) in a glass vial precoated with Iodogen reagent (Pierce). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 25°C. Unincorporated radioactivity was removed by desalting on a Microcon 50 microconcentrator (Amicon). The remaining protein was diluted in TBS containing 1 mM EDTA. Radioactivity of the final protein preparation was 95-98% precipitable with trichloroacetic acid. The iodinated SAP molecule ran as a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and retained its Ca2+-dependent binding to phosphatidylethanolamine. Laminin (1 μg/well) was coated overnight at 4°C onto 96-well microtiter plates (Corning) using carbonate buffer (45.3 mM NaHCO3 and 18.2 mM Na2CO3, pH 9.6). The plates were washed with TBS buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.45) containing 10 mg/ml blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) and blocked with TBS blocking buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mg/ml blocking reagent, pH 7.45). Dilutions of SAP in TBS buffer were added to triplicate wells, and binding was allowed to proceed for 3 h at 37°C. Wells were washed and incubated for 24 h at 4°C with rabbit anti-human SAP antibody (DAKO). After washing, goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem) was added to each well and allowed to bind for 90 min at 25°C. Plates were washed, substrate solution (10 μg/ml O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in 50 mM acetic acid, 100 mM Na2HPO4, and 0.0003% H2O2, pH 5.0) were added to each well, and the color was allowed to develop for 15 min at 25°C. The reaction was then stopped by the addition of 9.6% H2SO4. The absorption of each well at 492 nm was determined using an ELISA plate reader (Titer Tek, Co.). Immulon I Removawells (Dynatech, Inc.) were coated with 60 μl of 50 μg/ml mouse laminin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Wells were washed with TBS buffer and blocked with TBS blocking buffer. Wells were washed and incubated with dilutions of 125I-SAP in TBS buffer (100 μg/well) for 20 h at 4°C. To determine the amount of SAP added to each well, 2 μl of each sample were counted using a gamma counter (Isoflex, Co.). The results were converted to picomole concentrations using the calculated specific activity of 125I-SAP. After washing the wells with TBS buffer, the bound radioactivity was measured by counting the entire well. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding (bound radioactivity in the presence of 100-fold SAP in low SAP concentration samples or in the presence of 10 mM EDTA all samples) from total binding (binding in TBS buffer). The results were converted to picomole concentrations using the specific activity of 125I-SAP. The amount of laminin bound to the wells was determined directly by measuring the bound protein levels using the BCA protein quantitation assay (Pierce). Briefly, wells coated with 60 μl of 50 μg/ml laminin were incubated with 100 μl of protein quantification reagent. Wells containing known levels of laminin were used to generate a standard curve. The bound laminin levels were determined by measuring the average A562 of 12 wells and calculating the bound laminin levels based on the standard curve. Total bound laminin was determined to be approximately 1.7 ± 0.17 μg/well. Samples containing 2.5 μg of 125I-SAP and various concentrations of SAP and CRP (0-750 μg/ml) were added to each of the triplicate wells coated with 100 μl of 10 μg/ml laminin and incubated at 4°C for 20 h. Wells were then washed with TBS buffer, and the bound counts were determined. The percentage of inhibition was determined by assuming that the binding was 100% in the absence of the inhibitor. The binding of 125I-SAP in the presence of the inhibitor was then calculated as a percentage of the above. The inhibition of SAP binding to laminin by PE and PC was examined by ELISA. SAP (25 μg/ml) was incubated with increasing concentrations of PE and PC (0-500 mM) for 1 h at 37°C. Samples (100 μl) were then added to laminin-coated wells and stored at 4°C for 20 h. The rest of the assay was performed as described for the ELISA binding assay. The effect of SAP on the polymerization of laminin was examined in a turbidometric assay. The development of turbidity in a solution of laminin (350 μg/ml) was monitored in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of SAP (30-150 μg/ml). Laminin was thawed and dialyzed against 1 liter each of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 0.5 M CaCl2 and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; and PBS. SAP and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were also dialyzed against PBS. All dialysis steps were performed at 4°C for 24 h. All solutions contained 10 μl/liter of 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Both laminin and SAP preparations were cleared of aggregates by centrifugation. Aliquots of laminin in the presence or absence of SAP in a final volume of 1000 μl were incubated at 37°C, and the change in their absorbance at 360 nm was monitored for 80 min. The effect of SAP on the adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (American Type Culture Collection) to laminin substrate was examined using the methodology described by Sriramarao et al. (29Sriramarao P. Mendler M. Bourdon M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1001-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Linbro/Titertek, ICN Biomedicals Inc.) were coated with 1 pmol/well of laminin or BSA in PBS for 24 h at 4°C. The remaining binding sites were blocked with PBS containing 10 mg/ml blocking reagent. Increasing amounts of SAP (0.01-5 μg/well in 50 μl) were added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 5 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested by treatment with 0.5 mM EDTA and washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were resuspended in Ultraculture serum-free medium (BioWhittaker) to a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml, and 50 μl of the suspension were added to each well. The plates were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing the plates with PBS containing 1 mM Mg2+ and Ca2+. Adherent cells were fixed and stained with PBS containing 3.75% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% crystal violet. Wells were washed twice with PBS, and adherent cells were quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm on a microtiter plate reader. Nonquantitative ELISAs indicate that SAP binds to immobilized laminin and that the binding reaches equilibrium within 3-4 h at 37°C (data not shown). To characterize the interaction of SAP with immobilized laminin quantitatively, the direct binding of 125I-SAP to immobilized laminin was examined. Dilutions (100 μl/well) of 125I-SAP (0.1-58 pmol/100 μl) were added to immobilized laminin. The binding of SAP to laminin approached saturation when 28-35 pmol of SAP were added to plates coated with 1.8-2.1 pmol of laminin (Fig. 1A). Scatchard analysis of the saturation binding data indicates that SAP binding to laminin has a Kd~2.74 × 10-7M, a molar ratio of SAP (native decameric form)/laminin of 1:7.1 at saturation (Fig. 1B). Because the binding experiments described here use heterologous sources of protein (human SAP and mouse laminin), the binding of mouse SAP and human SAP to mouse laminin was compared by ELISA. SAP from both species binds to immobilized mouse laminin (Fig. 2). Saturation concentrations for both human and mouse SAP were approximately 20 μg/ml. The binding of human SAP to immobilized human laminin, mouse laminin-1 (composed of α1, β1, and γ1 chains), rat laminin, and human merosin (composed of α2, β1, and γ1 chains) was measured by ELISA. SAP binds to all four molecules. A comparison of SAP binding to human and mouse laminin indicates that SAP binding to human laminin is lower than SAP binding to mouse laminin (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the binding of SAP to merosin was lower than SAP binding to either mouse or rat laminin (Fig. 3B). This lower binding may be due to proteolytic cleavage of human laminin by pepsin during its extraction or to the differential binding of SAP by the α chains of laminin and merosin. These results indicate that SAP binding to laminin is saturable and has a relatively high affinity. Furthermore, this interaction is consistent between proteins from the same species or proteins isolated from different species.Fig. 2The binding of human and mouse SAP to mouse laminin-1. Increasing quantities of human (▪) and mouse (○) SAP (100 μl/well of 0-100 μg/ml dilutions) were added to triplicate microtiter wells coated with mouse laminin-1. The binding was measured by ELISA.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26950-26955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) is dependent on the presence of Ca2+. The role of Ca2+ in the binding of SAP to laminin was examined (Fig. 4) by determining the extent of the binding of SAP (2.5 μg in 100 μl) to laminin in the presence (0.5-7 mM CaCl2) or absence of Ca2+ (0-10 mM EDTA). The binding of SAP to laminin was enhanced up to 8-fold in the presence of Ca2+. Increased binding was observed in the presence of 0.5-1 mM Ca2+, whereas the binding of SAP to laminin in the presence of higher Ca2+ concentrations (2-7 mM) remained constant, about 8-fold greater than the binding observed in the absence of Ca2+. The binding of SAP to laminin diminished significantly upon the addition of EDTA. Furthermore, other divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+) could not replace Ca2+ (data not shown). Under all conditions the binding of SAP to immobilized BSA was minimal. These data indicate that SAP binding to laminin is dependent on the presence of Ca2+ and that enhanced binding is observed within the physiological range of Ca2+. CRP and SAP exhibit extensive structural and amino acid sequence homology. Previous studies indicate that CRP binds to laminin in a Ca2+-dependent manner via its PC binding site (32Swanson S.J. McPeek M.M. Mortensen R.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 40: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based on the structural and sequence homology of SAP and CRP and their binding to laminin, the ability of CRP to interfere with the binding of SAP to laminin was examined. Both SAP and CRP inhibited the binding of 125I-SAP to immobilized laminin (Fig. 5), but BSA, even at very high concentrations (1000 μg/ml), did not inhibit the binding of SAP to laminin (data not shown). The data in Fig. 5 indicate that an approximately 6-fold molar excess of CRP as compared to SAP is required to inhibit the binding of 125I-SAP to immobilized laminin by 50%. The results indicate that the binding of SAP to laminin is specific and occurs at a site that is similar or closely located to the CRP binding site on the laminin molecule. To determine the role of the SAP galactan binding site in its interaction with laminin, the ability of PE, which binds to the galactan binding site of SAP (33Schwalbe R.A. Dahlback B. Coe J.E. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4907-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), to inhibit the binding of SAP to laminin was examined. The binding of SAP to laminin was inhibited by PE but not by PC (Fig. 6). The maximum inhibition achieved in these assays was approximately 65%, which was observed when SAP was preincubated with 500 mM PE. These results indicate that SAP binding to laminin is mediated via its galactan binding site. The interaction of SAP with laminin raises the possibility that it may affect the polymerization of laminin, which in turn may affect the overall structure and function of the basement membrane. To determine the effect of SAP on the polymerization of laminin, turbidity assays were performed in the absence or presence of SAP (30-150 μg/ml) (Fig. 7). A comparison of the laminin only to laminin/SAP samples indicates that SAP enhanced the polymerization rate of the laminin in solution in a concentration-dependent manner. Control samples containing 150 μg/ml SAP were also examined. The A360 of SAP remained constant throughout the experiment, indicating that self-polymerization of SAP is not responsible for the increased turbidity of the laminin/SAP samples. Furthermore, the presence of BSA (100 μg/ml) did not affect the polymerization of laminin. These data suggest that SAP can bind to laminin or polymerized laminin in solution and enhance its polymerization reaction or lattice formation. The molecular composition and structure of basement membranes are major determinants of their interaction with adjacent cells and the phenotypes of these cells. The binding of SAP to laminin may affect its interaction with other ECM components and lead to changes in the structure of the basement membrane. This may in turn alter the cell matrix interactions and modify the phenotype of these cells. The effect of SAP on the ability of laminin to serve as a cell binding substrate was examined. Immobilized SAP did not support cell attachment. In addition, neither the binding of SAP to immobilized laminin (Fig. 8) nor its incorporation into a laminin matrix before immobilization (data not shown) had any effects on the binding of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to laminin. SAP is a member of the pentraxin family of proteins (2Osmand A.P. Friedenson B. Gewurz H. Painter R.H. Hofmann T. Shelton E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These are proteins with a high degree of sequence and structural homology that have been evolutionarily conserved (2Osmand A.P.

Exp. Immunol. 1978; 32: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo observations indicate that it is an integral part of a specific group of basement membranes including the GBM (13Dyck R.F. Lockwood C.M.

Histochem. J. 1993; 25: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). SAP binds to ECM components such as proteoglycans (e.g. heparan and dermatan sulfate proteoglycans) (10Hamazaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1456-1460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fibronectin (8De Beer F.C. Baltz M.L. Holford S. Feinstein A. Pepys M.B. J. Exp.

SAP binds to laminin molecules derived from a variety of sources. SAP binding to laminin was calcium-dependent, saturable, and specific, with a calculated Kd of 2.74 × 10-7M. Inhibition studies indicate that SAP binding to laminin is inhibited by both soluble SAP and its analog, CRP, suggesting that these proteins may bind to similar or closely located binding sites on the laminin molecule. The binding of SAP to laminin was inhibited by PE but not by PC, suggesting that the binding of SAP to laminin is mediated via its galactan binding site. The involvement of the lectin binding sites of pentraxins in their interactions with other molecules has been extensively documented. For example, the binding of CRP to laminin is mediated via its PC binding site (32Swanson S.J. McPeek M.M. Mortensen R.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 40: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that the binding of SAP to C4bp and heparan and dermatan sulfate proteoglycans as well as amyloid fibrils is mediated through its galactan binding sites (6Garcia de Frutos P. Dahlback B. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2430-2437PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hamazaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 38Tennent G.A. Lovat L.B. Pepys M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4299-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Although the exact nature of this site is not known, studies by Loveless et al. (39Loveless R.W. Floyd O.S.G. Raynes J.G. Yuen C.T. Feizi T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) indicate that it includes amino acid residues 27-38 of the SAP molecule. The structure and function of a basement membrane is determined by the interaction of its constituent components, their assembly, and their turnover (17Timpl R. Dziadek M. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1986; 29: 1-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 487-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Laminin is a major component of all basement membranes (20Timpl R. Rohde H. Robey P.G. Rennard S.I. Foidart J.-M. Martin G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9933-9937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It interacts with the cells that are in contact with the ECM (25Lesot H. Kuhl U. von der Mark K. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 861-865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Malinoff H. Wicha M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 27Terranova V.P. Rao C.N. Kalebic T. Margulies I.M. Liotta L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), other ECM components (22Paulsson M. Aumailley M. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Beck K. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 23Charonis A.S. Tsilibary E.C. Yurchenco P.D. Furthmayr H. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through these interactions laminin influences the structure and function of the basement membrane. Polymerization of laminin is an important step in the formation and maintenance of the basement membrane structure. Turbidity assays indicate that SAP enhances the polymerization of soluble laminin or laminin polymers. This observation as well as the Scatchard analysis data showing that SAP can bind multiple laminin molecules suggests that SAP may act as a nucleating or scaffolding agent by simultaneously binding to a number of molecules. This potential function becomes even more interesting when the ability of SAP to bind to different components of the ECM such as type IV collagen and proteoglycans is considered. The incorporation of SAP into the ECM may affect the structure and function of this matrix through a number of mechanisms. The binding of SAP to ECM components may modify their interaction and the kinetics of their assembly, thereby modifying the structure and, consequently, the function of the basement membrane. SAP may contribute to the maintenance of the net negative charge and the structure of the glomerular capillary wall basement membrane and the integrity of its filtration functions (13Dyck R.F. Lockwood C.M. Kershaw M. McHugh N. Duance V.C. Baltz M.L. Pepys M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Another potential mechanism by which SAP may affect the structure of the basement membrane is the alteration of basement membrane turnover. The SAP molecule is very compact and highly structured (42Emsley J. White H.E. O'Hara B.P. Oliva G. Srinivasan N. Tickle I.J. Blundell T.L. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. Nature. 1994; 367: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). It is also very resistant to proteolysis (43Kinoshita C.M. Gewurz A.T. Siegel J.N. Ying S.C. Hugli T.E. Coe J.E. Gupta R.K. Huckman R. Gewurz H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The binding of SAP to amyloid fibrils derived from secondary amyloidosis and Alzheimer's disease plaques protects these molecules from digestion by a variety of proteases (38Tennent G.A. Lovat L.B. Pepys M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4299-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the binding of SAP to components of the ECM and its incorporation into the basement membrane may protect this matrix from digestion by ECM proteases, modify its turnover and, consequently, affect its structure and function. Basement membranes and some of their components are cell adhesion substrates that influence the phenotypes of their adjacent tissue. Data presented here as well as those examining the effect of SAP on cell adhesion to type IV collagen and fibronectin 2K. Zahedi, unpublished data. indicate that SAP probably does not play a role in tissue matrix interaction. The potential influence of SAP on the cell matrix interaction, however, cannot be completely ruled out because the mixture of ECM components and their interaction may create an environment that is quite different than the conditions used in the in vitro cell adhesion assays. The majority of the present studies were performed using Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor matrix-derived laminin. Differential localization of laminin isoforms has been well documented (44Sanes J.R. Engvall E. Butkowski R. Hunter D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1685-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 45Laurie G.W. Horikoshi S. Killen P.D. Segui R.B. Yamada Y. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 46Ekblom M. Klein G. Mugrauer G. Fecker L. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Cell. 1990; 60: 337-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and it is possible that SAP may have a more or less dramatic effect on the interaction and polymerization of other laminin isoforms specifically expressed in those basement membranes with which SAP is associated. This possibility is to a certain extent supported by the variable degrees of SAP binding to different laminin isoforms and laminin molecules from different species. The association of SAP with a specific group of basement membranes has been documented in a number of studies (13Dyck R.F. Lockwood C.M. Kershaw M. McHugh N. Duance V.C. Baltz M.L. Pepys M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 14Al Mutlaq H. Wheeler J. Robertson H. Watchorn C. Morley A.R. Histochem. J. 1993; 25: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This association cannot simply be due to the exposure of these basement membranes to circulating SAP because it is absent from a number of basement membranes that are exposed to high levels of SAP (basement membranes of the liver sinuses and venous sinuses of the spleen) (14Al Mutlaq H. Wheeler J. Robertson H. Watchorn C. Morley A.R. Histochem. J. 1993; 25: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the association of SAP with the GBM is completely disrupted or altered in a variety of nephritides (15Melvin T. Kim Y. Michael A.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 125: 460-464PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dyck R.F. Evans D.J. Lockwood C.M. Rees A.J. Turner D. Pepys M.B. Lancet. 1980; ii: 606-609Abstract Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is possible that the absence of SAP or its altered disposition as a result of an initial injury could lead to further alterations in the basement membrane. This may partially account for some of the pathological changes associated with diseases such as the nephritides mentioned here. The biological role of SAP in the basement membrane is not known. However, previous in vivo observations and in vitro experimental data describing the interaction of SAP with the ECM components indicate that it may play an important role in the structure and function of those basement membranes with which it is associated. Immunohistochemical studies indicate that SAP is associated with a specific group of basement membranes including the GBM, alveolar basement membrane, and sweat gland basement membrane as well as the basement membranes in the posterior chamber of the eye. It is possible that SAP binding to the ECM components can modify their interactions and lead to the development of specific capacities in those basement membranes with which it is associated. Further examination of the role of SAP in the basement membrane and the mechanism(s) by which it modifies the structure of the basement membrane is required to determine its biological significance and its role as a structural protein."

For this reason, and because of the unusual kinetic features of OxlT, the initial objective of work reported here was to assess secondary structure in this transporter. To do this, we installed a histidine tag at the OxlT C terminus and purified the tagged protein, OxlTHis, by affinity chromatography using a Ni2+-linked adsorbent. The CD spectrum of solubilized, purified OxlTHis shows that the majority of its residues are organized in an α-helical configuration, supporting a generic model in which this and similar transporters contain 10-12 transmembrane α-helices. Our second objective was to use the purified protein to correlate structure and function. Such studies show that the loss of activity observed in the absence substrate reflects a spontaneous breakdown of the α-helical ensemble.

For this reason, and because of the unusual kinetic features of OxlT, the initial objective of work reported here was to assess secondary structure in this transporter. To do this, we installed a histidine tag at the OxlT C terminus and purified the tagged protein, OxlTHis, by affinity chromatography using a Ni2+-linked adsorbent. The CD spectrum of solubilized, purified OxlTHis shows that the majority of its residues are organized in an α-helical configuration, supporting a generic model in which this and similar transporters contain 10-12 transmembrane α-helices. Our second objective was to use the purified protein to correlate structure and function. Such studies show that the loss of activity observed in the absence substrate reflects a spontaneous breakdown of the α-helical ensemble."

Using affinity-purified rabbit anti-human TR-(1-41) IgG and immunoblotting, we demonstrated TR-(1-41) release from platelets suspended in Tyrode's buffer containing 2 mM CaCl2 and incubated with ≥0.5 nMα-thrombin for 10-60 s at 37°C. As quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 0.32-0.59 nM TR-(1-41) was released from washed platelets (5 x 1011 platelets/liter) after their incubation with 10 nMα-thrombin for 10 s. Parallel binding of α-thrombin to and activation of the platelets were confirmed by flow cytometry. A monoclonal antibody against the hirudin-like domain of the G-protein-linked receptor abrogated α-thrombin binding to platelets, cleavage of TR-(1-41), and platelet activation by ≤1.0 nM (but not 10 nM) α-thrombin. Proteolysis of platelet GPIb with Serratia marcescens protease or O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase had no effect on α-thrombin binding to platelets or their subsequent activation. In contrast, chymotrypsin, which cleaves both GPIb and the G-protein-linked receptor, abrogated α-thrombin binding to platelets, TR-(1-41) release, and platelet activation. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies directed against the reported α-thrombin-binding site on GPIb inhibited neither α-thrombin binding to nor activation of the platelets. Thus, α-thrombin binds to and cleaves the G-protein-linked receptor when it activates platelets, and GPIb does not appear to serve as an important binding site when α-thrombin activates platelets. The roles of the G-protein-linked thrombin receptor and platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) as α-thrombin-binding sites on platelets remain controversial. α-Thrombin has been proposed to bind to both GPIb and the hirudin-like domain of the G-protein-linked receptor (from which it cleaves the NH2-terminal extracellular domain to release a 41-mer peptide (TR-(1-41), where TR is α-thrombin receptor)) to initiate platelet activation.

Based on the results of studies estimating α-125I-thrombin binding to platelets, ∼50 high-affinity sites (Kd∼ 1 nM) involving GPIb 1The abbreviations used are: GPglycoproteinTBSTris-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered saline. and ∼2000 GPIb-independent binding sites with moderate affinity (Kd∼ 10 nM) for α-thrombin on platelets have been reported (3Harmon J.T.

Distinct sites on GPIb for α-thrombin and von Willebrand factor binding are located within the Mr 45,000 NH2-terminal domain of GPIbα (5Lopez J.A.

Support for GPIb as a high-affinity binding site for α-thrombin arises from observations that Bernard-Soulier platelets (congenitally deficient in platelet GPIb) are poorly activable by α-thrombin (1Jamieson G.A. Okumura T. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 861-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Additionally, cleavage of GPIb by chymotrypsin, elastase, or Serratia marcescens protease impairs the responses of platelets to subnanomolar (but not higher) concentrations of α-thrombin (13Cooper H.A.

Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies recognizing epitopes in the Mr 45,000 NH2-terminal domain of GPIbα inhibit the responses of platelets to ≤1.0 nMα-thrombin (17Brass L.F. Thromb.

Whether interactions of α-thrombin with this G-protein-linked thrombin receptor, GPIb, or both are required for platelet activation by α-thrombin remains an unresolved question. Some investigators consider the G-protein-linked α-thrombin receptor to be the moderate-affinity binding site since there are 1700 copies of this α-thrombin receptor/platelet (23Gralnick H.R.

Krutzsch H. Blood. 1992; 80: 265aGoogle Scholar). However, monoclonal antibodies that bind to the hirudin-like domain of the G-protein-linked thrombin receptor abrogate the responses of platelets to ≤1.0 nMα-thrombin (25Hung D.T. Vu T.K.H.

It is possible that GPIb, by initiating α-thrombin binding to platelets, could localize α-thrombin to sites on platelets where the cleavage of the G-protein-linked α-thrombin receptor would be facilitated to cause platelet activation (19Mazurov A.V. Vinogradov D.V. Vlasik T.N. Thromb. Res. 1991; 62: 673-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Gralnick H.R. Williams S. McKeown L.P. Hansmann K. Fenton J.W. II Krutzsch H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against the 41-mer activation peptide (TR-(1-41)) released from the G-protein-linked thrombin receptor by α-thrombin were used to detect cleavage of this receptor and release of the 41-mer activation peptide from platelets incubated with α-thrombin. Binding of α-thrombin to and activation of the same platelets were assessed by flow cytometry (28Liu L. Freedman J. Hornstein A. Fenton II, J.W. Ofosu F.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1994; 88: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Whether α-thrombin binding to GPIb is a prerequisite for platelet activation by α-thrombin was also explored by cleaving GPIb from platelets with three proteases known to cleave this platelet glycoprotein (13Cooper H.A.

Additionally, cleavage of GPIb or occupancy of GPIb by some monoclonal anti-GPIb antibodies inhibits platelet aggregation and release by ≤1.0 nMα-thrombin, but not by 10 nMα-thrombin (1Jamieson G.A.

Thus, the primary site on platelets to which α-thrombin binds to initiate platelet activation remains unclear.In this study, cleavage of platelet TR-(1-41) by α-thrombin was directly monitored, as were α-thrombin binding to platelets and the subsequent activation of the same platelets. No attempt was made in this study to quantify the number of α-thrombin molecules/platelet or the concentrations of markers of platelet activation that became expressed on activated platelets. Rather, the percentages of platelets that rapidly bound α-thrombin and subsequently expressed surface P-selection, CD63, and the activated conformer of GPIIb-IIIa for each concentration of the enzyme were quantified. We have presented data demonstrating the parallel binding of α-thrombin to platelets, cleavage and release of TR-(1-41) from the platelets, and activation of the same platelets with each concentration of α-thrombin. There was a similar (∼1:1) relationship between the binding of α-thrombin to platelets and the expression of each of the three markers of platelet activation within 60 s of α-thrombin addition. This study also confirmed the observation by Norton et al. (33Norton K.J. Scarborough R.M. Kutok J.L. Escobedo M.A. Nannizzi L. Coller B.S. Blood. 1993; 82: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that α-thrombin releases TR-(1-41) from platelets. It is unclear why 1.0 nMα-thrombin did not release TR-(1-41) as effectively as 10 nMα-thrombin when both concentrations of the enzyme activated ≥75% of the washed platelets (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). We eliminated the possibility that this α-thrombin receptor became inaccessible to α-thrombin following the exposure of platelets to suboptimal concentrations of α-thrombin. Specifically, we demonstrated that platelets preincubated with 0.5 or 1 nMα-thrombin responded appropriately to a subsequent addition of α-thrombin. Thus, the fraction of the thrombin receptor not previously occupied by suboptimal concentrations of α-thrombin remained accessible to added α-thrombin. Since ∼2.0 nM TR-(1-41) could be theoretically released from platelets (27Brass L.F. Vassallo Jr., R.R. Belmonte E. Ahuja M. Cichowski K. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13795-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the fact that 10 nMα-thrombin fully activated the platelets but released only ≤0.6 nM TR-(1-41) suggests that complete cleavage of the receptor is not required for maximum platelet activation. Nonetheless, partial cleavage of this α-thrombin receptor is required to initiate platelet activation since abrogation of thrombin-mediated cleavage of this receptor by ATAP-138 also abrogated platelet activation.A likely reason for the failure of α-thrombin to quantitatively cleave all available TR-(1-41) from platelets may reside in the ability of α-thrombin to induce endocytosis of this receptor, as demonstrated for two megaloblastic cell lines, namely human erythroleukemia cells and Children's Hospital Research Foundation cell line 288 (34Hoxie J.A.

Stadel J.M. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2943-2952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This failure of up to 10 nMα-thrombin to fully cleave the G-protein-linked thrombin receptor and to release TR-(1-41) from platelets parallels the effects α-thrombin has on fibrinogen and fibrin has on the enzymatic activity of α-thrombin. Similar to the release of TR-(1-41), α-thrombin cleaves fibrinogen in a dose-dependent manner, with fibrinopeptide A release proceeding to the maximum extent achievable with each α-thrombin concentration within 60 s (37Weitz J.I. Hudoba M. Massel D. Maraganore J. Hirsh J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). α-Thrombin binding to fibrin also clearly impairs the ability of this enzyme to release fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen (37Weitz J.I. Hudoba M. Massel D. Maraganore J. Hirsh J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Binding of α-thrombin to the cleaved receptor (which then becomes phosphorylated (17Brass L.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Lau L.F. Pumiglia K. Cole Y.P. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)) may similarly impair the ability of the bound enzyme to cleave nearby receptors. Continued tight binding of α-thrombin to this site may be important, and one study has reported that continued occupancy of the G-protein-linked receptor by α-thrombin is required to propagate tyrosine phosphorylation. Specifically, Lau et al. (38Lau L.F. Pumiglia K. Cole Y.P. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have reported that addition of hirudin to platelets preincubated with α-thrombin for 60 s does not deaggregate the platelets, but inhibits specific tyrosine phosphorylation and simultaneously accelerates specific tyrosine dephosphorylation. Occupancy of this receptor by α-thrombin at the hirudin-like domain of the receptor is clearly crucial for platelet activation since ATAP-138 abrogates the binding of 0.5 or 1 nMα-thrombin to platelets, release of TR-(1-41) from the platelets, and activation of the platelets. As previously reported by Brass et al. (27Brass L.F. Vassallo Jr., R.R. Belmonte E. Ahuja M. Cichowski K. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13795-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that 10 nMα-thrombin binds to and activates washed platelets in the presence of a saturating concentration ATAP-138.The high-affinity binding sites for α-thrombin on GPIb are reportedly located within the Mr 45,000 NH2-terminal domain of GPIbα (3Harmon J.T.

This study has demonstrated that platelets with this putative high-affinity α-thrombin-binding domain on GPIb removed (by protease digestion) bound normally to α-thrombin. In further experiments, two monoclonal antibodies against this putative high-affinity α-thrombin-binding domain on GPIb (TM60 and LJ-1B10) that inhibit the responses of platelets to ≤1 nMα-thrombin (7Yamamoto N.

In the presence of 2 mM CaCl2, α-thrombin bound normally to and activated platelets that had been preincubated with either monoclonal anti-GPIb antibody.Therefore, we conclude that GPIb does not normally participate in the initial interactions of α-thrombin with platelets and that cleavage(s) by chymotrypsin additional to GPIb abrogate the responsiveness of platelets to α-thrombin. Chymotrypsin cleaves the G-protein thrombin-linked receptor at a point distal to Arg-41/Ser-42 (43Vouret-Craviari V. Grall D. Chambard J.-C. Rasmussen U.B. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. J.

Using a chimeric fusion protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase and residues 25-97 corresponding to the NH2-terminal extracellular domain of the G-protein-linked thrombin as the substrate, Bouton et al. (44Bouton M.-C. Jandrot-Perrus M. Moog S. Cazenave J.-P. Guillin M.-C. Lanza F. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported that the glycocalicin portion of GPIb did not alter the kinetics describing the cleavage of this fusion protein by α-thrombin, whereas fibrinogen fragment E, thrombomodulin, and hirudin fragment 54-65 did. These results suggest minimal rapid binding interactions between α-thrombin and the extracellular domain of GPIb when the enzyme normally cleaves the G-protein-linked thrombin receptor.There are three reasons why we could not ascribe a critical role to GPIb for mediating α-thrombin binding to platelets in the time required for α-thrombin to optimally activate platelets. (i) We used 10-60-s incubations to demonstrate optimal binding of α-thrombin to platelets, compared with ≥30-min incubations used in some of the previous studies (7Yamamoto N. Greco N.J. Barnard M.R. Tanoue K. Yamazaki H. Jamieson G.A. Michelson A.D. Blood. 1991; 77: 1740-1748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Katagiri Y. Hayashi Y. Yamamoto K. Tanoue K. Kosaki G. Yamazaki H. Thromb.

The incubation times of 10 and 60 s were chosen as activation of platelets by α-thrombin proceeds to the maximum extent achievable with each concentration of thrombin in ≤60 s (28Liu L. Freedman J. Hornstein A. Fenton II, J.W. Ofosu F.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1994; 88: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This choice was also justified by the demonstration of decreased binding of α-thrombin to platelets after the enzyme was incubated with platelets for 30 min (compared with 10 s), as shown in Table I. (ii) The platelets used in this study were fixed with 10 g/liter paraformaldehyde after their incubation with α-thrombin to immobilize the enzyme on platelets. Fixation of the platelets also inactivated α-thrombin and halted further platelet reactions resulting from α-thrombin binding to the platelets. Fixation does not alter the binding of α-thrombin to platelets (40Ware J. Russell S.R. Marchese P. Murata W. Mazzucato M. De Marco L. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1213-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). (iii) We also estimated α-thrombin binding to platelets resuspended in CaCl2-containing media, while the previous studies were without addition of this salt. CaCl2 enhances the binding of α-thrombin to platelets and stabilizes the expression of P-selectin on the activated platelets (28Liu L. Freedman J. Hornstein A. Fenton II, J.W. Ofosu F.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1994; 88: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), as was confirmed in"

We therefore carried out polymerase chain reaction-mediated random mutagenesis over a large part of the cAR1 sequence (from TMIII through the proximal part of the cytoplasmic tail). We devised a rapid screen for loss-of-function mutations based on the essential role of cAR1 in the developmental program of Dictyostelium.

We used biochemical screens to select about 100 of these mutants and chose eight representative mutants for extensive characterization. These fell into distinct classes.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Ligands for this family of receptors vary from small compounds like cAMP to large peptides (3Fishman H.A. Orwar O. Scheller R.H.

Despite the diversity of ligands, occupancy of these receptors typically triggers an analogous array of excitation and desensitization events (6Strosberg A.D. Camoin L. Blin N. Maigret B. Drug Des. Discov. 1993; 9: 199-211PubMed Google Scholar). The occupied receptors activate heterotrimeric G proteins which, in turn, activate downstream effector molecules, such as adenylyl cyclases, ion channels, phosphodiesterases, and phospholipases (7Bourne H.R.

Site-directed mutagenesis and chimeric receptor studies have provided information regarding the interactions of GPCRs with G proteins, the localization of ligand contact sites, and the location of domains important for activational isomerization (14Strader C.D.

In the case of adrenergic receptors, catecholamines are thought to interact with amino acid residues within a pocket formed by the transmembrane helices. The domains important in coupling to G proteins reside in small segments exiting from TMV, TMVI, and TMVII to the cytoplasmic loops (16Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Candelore M.R. Rands E. Hill W.S.

FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Segments of the third intracellular loop, in particular, determine the specificity of G protein coupling (18Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1989; 1: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). From these studies, a general model has emerged; agonist binding rearranges interactions among the helices and transmits conformational changes to the segments exiting from membrane to cytoplasm (20Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). These changes are then detected by intracellular components of the signaling machinery. Despite these advances, much remains to be learned about the molecular determinants for ligand binding to G protein-coupled receptors and the sequence of events that follow. We devised a genetic screen to isolate random mutations that alter the biological and biochemical properties of the chemoattractant receptors of Dictyostelium. This organism utilizes four homologous receptors (cAR1-cAR4), which vary in affinity for cAMP, to coordinate morphological transitions throughout a developmental program in which individual amoebae aggregate to form multicellular structures (21Bonner J.T. Sci. Am. 1949; 180: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 22Devreotes P.N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 235-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cells clonally seeded on bacterial lawns divide and, by consuming the bacteria, create plaques. Within several days, the cells in the centers of these plaques are induced by starvation to aggregate and form macroscopic fruiting bodies (23Wu L. Valkema R. Van Haastert P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cells lacking cAR1 or expressing only defective versions of the receptor fail to aggregate or differentiate (24Sun T.J. Devreotes P.N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and therefore form smooth plaques, providing a convenient biological “read out” for function. This screen has allowed us to rapidly assess thousands of point mutations in the receptor and identify those affecting particular functions. At the outset, we expected to find mutants which failed to bind cAMP or were defective in coupling to G proteins or G protein-independent pathways. We found that most amino acid substitutions did not impair receptor function. Of those that did, we saw a large array of phenotypes that fell into multiple classes. In some mutants, the cAMP binding affinity was decreased conditionally at low ionic strength or, alternatively, decreased under all conditions to one of three discrete steps. In other mutants, cAMP binding and agonist-induced phosphorylation were intact, but signaling through G protein-dependent and G protein-independent pathways was defective. These mutant classes complement those of a companion study (50Milne J.L.S. Caterina M.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2069-2076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which describes a series of mutants derived from random mutagenesis of the third intracellular loop. The 1.3-kilobase pair cAR1 cDNA, EcoRI-EcoRI fragment, was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pPL1 (25Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in BglII (5ʹ-end)-BamHI (3ʹ-end) orientation to construct pJK53. This plasmid was used as a template for PCR under conditions designed to induce frequent misincorporation of nucleotides (26Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ng of pJK53 PCR-template was incubated with 30 ng each of primers T3 and T7, 1 mM each of dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.2 mM dATP, 7 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM MnCl2, and 5 units Taq thermostable DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.3, in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was carried out in a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) for 30 cycles with 94°C, 1.5-min denaturation, 45°C, 2-min annealing, and 72°C, 2-min extension. The resulting PCR products were extracted with phenol-chloroform, then digested simultaneously with BamHI, NdeI, and BstXI. The mutagenized NdeI/BstXI fragment (583 base pairs), encoding the amino acids from the third to the seventh cAR1 transmembrane domains, was gel-purified and used to replace the corresponding wild-type NdeI/BstXI fragment of pJK53. The resulting mutant cAR1 cDNAs were excised with BamHI/BstXI and directionally subcloned into Dictyostelium expression vector, pMC34 (27Caterina M.J. Milne J.L.S. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformation of the mutant cAR1 library into car1- or car1-/car3- cells was performed by electroporation as described previously (27Caterina M.J. Milne J.L.S. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One day after electroporation, nonselective medium was replaced with HL-5 containing G418 (Geneticin) (20 μg/ml), and for each transformation, 4 × 106 cells were placed into each well of a 24-well plate. For the initial aggregation assay, approximately 150 Dictyostelium clones from each of the 24 wells were seeded onto SM agar plates with lawn of Klebsiella aerogenes. After 5-6 days of growth and development, Dictyostelium plaques that created aggregation-deficient “smooth” plaques were picked into HL-5 with G418 (20 μg/ml). Plasmids DNA was recovered and transformed into bacteria as described (27Caterina M.J. Milne J.L.S. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterially propagated plasmids were then transformed by electroporation into car1-/car3- or car1- cells for subsequent phenotypic analysis. The mutant plasmids were sequenced using automated sequencer. The receptor electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described elsewhere (28Kim J.-Y. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28724-28731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using cAR1-specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum (29Vaughan R.A. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14538-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies and chemiluminescence (Dupont). Growth stage cells were washed once in development buffer (DB) (30Klein P.S. Sun T.J. Saxe III, C.L. Kimmel A.R. Johnson R.L. Devreotes P.N.

Excess buffer was drained, and cells were left undisturbed for 24 h at 22°C to undergo development (30Klein P.S. Sun T.J. Saxe III, C.L. Kimmel A.R. Johnson R.L. Devreotes P.N.

Cells grown in shaking culture were washed with DB, developed with 300 nM cAMP pulses every 6 min for 6 h, and shaken rapidly for 30 min in the presence of 5 mM caffeine to inhibit the cAMP oscillation and to obtain cells with basal level of adenylyl cyclase activity (31Parent C.A.

After basalation, cells were washed 4 times with ice-cold phosphate manganese buffer (10 mM KH2 PO4, pH 6.5, 2 mM MgSO4) to remove caffeine, resuspended to 8 × 107 cells/ml, and kept on ice until use. Cells were transferred to 22°C, stimulated with 10-3M cAMP at time 0, and the amount of [α-32P]ATP converted into [32P]cAMP in 1 min was measured as described previously (32Lilly P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14123-14129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were developed as in the adenylyl cyclase assay, resuspended in phosphate manganese buffer (see above), and placed on ice. Ten minutes before each experiment, cells were transferred to a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at 22°C. At time 0, 10-7M cAMP and 10 mM dithiothreitol were added to induce actin polymerization, and at various times, the reactions were stopped by transferring the aliquots of cells into fixing solution (3.7% formaldehyde, 10 mM Pipes, 0.1% Trion X-100, 20 mM K2HPO4, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, and 250 nM tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-phalloidin, pH 6.8) (33Condeelis J. Hall A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After staining at least 1 h at room temperature, fixed cells were pelleted in a tabletop centrifuge (14,000 rpm, 5 min), and the pellet was resuspended into 1 ml of methanol. Rhodamine fluorescence was detected with a Perkin-Elmer fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation at 540 nm, emission at 575 nm). cAMP binding assays were performed in either phosphate buffer or in the presence of 3 M ammonium sulfate as described previously (11Caterina M.J. Devreotes P.N. Borleis J. Hereld D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8667-8672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Scatchard data were analyzed using the software program LIGAND. Cells were developed as before, washed once in phosphate buffer, and resuspended to 6 × 107/ml. Cell were then lysed through 5-μm filters (Millipore), and the lysates were pelleted (5 min, 10,000 rpm SS34 rotor). The membrane pellets were washed once and resuspended in phosphate buffer to a density of 8 × 107 cell equivalent/ml and kept on ice. The amount of cAMP binding to membrane measured with 2 nM [3H]cAMP either in the presence or absence of 100 μM GTP was then assessed by spinning the membrane through silicon oil as described previously (34Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 45Ca2+ entry was followed for 40 s in the presence or absence of cAMP using a standard centrifugation assay. Values shown are the ratio of Ca2+ uptake into cAMP-treated cells/Ca2+ uptake into unstimulated cells (35Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of cAR1 was performed in bacteriophage M13 as described elsewhere (27Caterina M.J. Milne J.L.S. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to create cDNAs encoding mutants I-22 and II-22. The resulting cDNAs were subcloned into pMC34 (27Caterina M.J. Milne J.L.S. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used PCR under conditions of decreased fidelity to generate a population of mutant cAR1 cDNAs (26Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Each receptor contained an average of two amino acid substitutions within the region extending from within the third transmembrane domain to the proximal portion of the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus (residues 88-264). Over 2000 mutant cDNAs were subcloned into a segregating extrachromosomal plasmid that direct expression of the receptor throughout growth and early development (27Caterina M.J. Milne J.L.S. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid library was electroporated into car1- cells (28Kim J.-Y. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28724-28731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and about 4000 transformants were allowed to form plaques on bacterial lawns for phenotypic screening and subsequent characterization (Fig. 1). The results of a typical mutant screen are illustrated in Table IA. Of 1659 transformants analyzed, nearly 90% regained fully the ability to aggregate. Of the remaining 193 clones, 177 exhibited very weak aggregation, and 16 were completely aggregation-deficient. An aggregation-deficient phenotype could result from the expression of a dysfunctional cAR1 mutant or, alternatively, from low receptor protein expression. To distinguish these possibilities, we immunoblotted 116 nonaggregating or weakly aggregating clones for cAR1 expression. About two-thirds of the clones had little or no cAR1, while the remainder had wild-type levels of the protein (Table IB). We focused our studies on the latter type of clones isolated from four independent transformations and screens.Table ITypical distribution of mutant phenotypes in an initial screen of the cAR1 mutant libraryAssayNo. of clonesPercent of total%A.Strong aggregation146688.5Weak aggregation17710.6No aggregation160.9Total clones screened1659100.0B.cAR13731.8No or little cAR17968.2Total screened116100.0 Open table in a new tab We carried out several tests to define the biochemical basis of the aggregation-deficient phenotype conferred by these mutant receptors. The initial test examined agonist-induced phosphorylation. Upon cAMP binding, serine residues (Ser-303 and Ser-304) in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of cAR1 undergo phosphorylation, resulting in a discrete mobility retardation on SDS-PAGE (11Caterina M.J. Devreotes P.N. Borleis J. Hereld D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8667-8672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Klein P. Theibert A. Fontana D. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1757-1764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This alteration, detected by immunoblot, provides a convenient method for assessing agonist activated receptor-kinase coupling. At steady-state, the fraction of receptors in the slower mobility form is proportional to the concentration of the applied stimulus (37Klein P. Vaughan R. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 358-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the assay is carried out at multiple concentrations of cAMP, the EC50 typically reflects the cAMP binding affinity (38Hereld D. Devreotes P.N. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137B: 35-47PubMed Google Scholar). In our initial screen, we treated the mutant expressing clones with three concentrations of cAMP, 0, 50 nM, and 100 μM for 15 min, sufficiently long to attain the steady state. Since the EC50 is 35 nM (Fig. 2), at 50 nM the majority of wild-type cAR1 molecules are found in the slower mobility form. At 100 μM, even very low affinity receptors are expected to be maximally occupied and phosphorylated (28Kim J.-Y. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28724-28731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When 93 clones treated with cAMP at these three concentrations were examined, the mutants fell into five categories based on the severity of the impairment (Table II). Eighteen of the clones (19.4%) exhibited a profile identical to that seen with wild-type cAR1 (row a); the remaining 75 exhibited an altered profile. Of these, 60 (64.5%) responded fully to 100 μM but displayed only a partial or no response to 50 nM (rows b and c). The remaining 15 (16.1%) exhibited little or no response even at 100 μM (rows d and e).Table IIDistribution of electrophoretic mobility shift profiles in functionally impaired cAR1 mutantsTable IIDistribution of electrophoretic mobility shift profiles in functionally impaired cAR1 mutants We carried out additional assays to further classify the mutants. We measured binding of [3H]cAMP to intact cells in phosphate buffer at 16 nM and in ammonium sulfate at 25 nM. Since the Kd of cAR1 under physiological conditions in phosphate buffer is 25-300 nM, the former assay is designed to quickly distinguish high from low affinity receptors. The ammonium sulfate assay is designed to measure the total number of binding sites, since addition of the salt reduces the Kd of wild-type cAR1 to about 8 nM (39Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cAMP-induced electrophoretic mobility shift profiles of the mutants corresponded with the amount of [3H]cAMP bound under physiological conditions. The amount of binding measured in the presence of ammonium sulfate also paralleled these data (data not shown). We rescued the plasmids encoding eight representative mutants, one from row a, three from the row d, and two from the rest to represent the biochemical phenotypes observed in the initial screen (Table II), retransformed them into car1- or car1-/car3- cells, and subjected them to more extensive characterization. With the exception of the cAMP-induced electrophoretic mobility shift experiments which were carried out in a car1- background, all of the following studies were carried out in a car1-/car3- background. We chose these backgrounds for the following reason. Although the car1- cells do not aggregate upon starvation and therefore are adequate for initial identification of functionally deficient receptors, some of the cAMP-mediated responses still persist in the car1- cells (40Pupillo M. Insall R. Pitt G.S. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 41Insall R.H. Soede R.D. Schaap P. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the car1-/car3- cell, cAMP responsiveness is completely absent (41Insall R.H. Soede R.D. Schaap P. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and expression of wild-type cAR1 restores all of the measured wild-type functions. We next examined the full concentration dependence of the cAMP-induced electrophoretic mobility shift of the eight representative mutants (Fig. 2). On the basis of these dose-response profiles and the cAMP binding analysis presented below, the eight mutants fell into the following classes, I, II, and IIIa-c. For wild-type cAR1, the EC50 was 35 nM, consistent with our previously published results (28Kim J.-Y. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28724-28731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hereld D. Devreotes P.N. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137B: 35-47PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant I-21 exhibited a nearly wild-type concentration-dependence, while mutants IIIa-21 and IIIa-22 and IIIb-21 and IIIb-22 required about 5 and 100 times higher cAMP concentrations, respectively (Fig. 2). The two class IIIc mutants failed to show a mobility shift, even at the highest cAMP concentrations (10-2M) tested. The electrophoretic mobility shift of three additional mutants (IIIa-23, IIIb-23, and IIIc-23) also exhibited EC50 increases clustered around these 5-fold, 100-fold, and infinite ranges (data not shown). Mutant II-21 displayed a dose dependence similar to that of the class IIIb mutants; however, it was placed in a separate class because of its unique binding properties, as described below. For these 11 mutants, the full cAMP concentration dependence of this response was consistent with that observed in the rapid two-dose screening assay (Table II). Therefore the electrophoretic mobility shift phenotypes exhibited in the initial screen, although crude, represented intrinsic, reproducible properties of the mutants, and Fig. 2 and Table II reflect the distribution of observable phenotypes. We next carried out a more extensive phenotypic analysis of the eight mutants. Exponentially growing cells were washed and spread on nutrient-free agar plates. Under these conditions, cells expressing wild-type cAR1 aggregate and form fruiting bodies within 24-48 h, while the vector-transformed cells remain as a monolayer (Fig. 3, A and B). The results for one member of each class are illustrated in Fig. 3, C-G. The members of classes I, II, and IIIc failed to restore any sign of aggregation (Fig. 3, C, D, and G), while the members of the remaining two subclasses, IIIa and IIIb, mediated aggregation to varying degrees. Cells expressing either of the two IIIa mutants nearly always aggregated and were capable of forming slugs and fruiting bodies with a relatively wild-type morphology (Fig. 3E). Cells expressing either of the two IIIb receptors could also aggregate, although a smaller fraction of cells participated. These formed either loose mounds that went on to form tiny fruiting bodies (Fig. 3F) or tight aggregates that transformed into normal fruiting bodies. Thus, among the class III subclasses, there is a correlation between the efficacy of the expressed receptor and the resulting aggregation phenotype. We next measured the affinity of [3H]cAMP binding to the mutant receptors. Since the members of a given class displayed similar properties, we chose one from each of the classes for detailed binding analysis (I-21, II-21, IIIa-21, IIIb-21, and IIIc-21). The resulting Scatchard data are illustrated in Fig. 4 and Table III. Wild-type cAR1 displayed two classes of binding sites as described previously. Most (about 93%) of the sites had an affinity of 500 nM, while a small fraction had an affinity of 30 nM in phosphate buffer. Since the lower affinity sites constitute most of the binding sites, we concentrated our analysis on them. As shown in Fig. 4A, the affinities of the class III mutants, measured in phosphate buffer, corresponded to the relative EC50 values of their electrophoretic mobility shift. IIIa-21 had a 5-7-fold lower cAMP sensitivity than wild-type cAR1, as assessed by both EC50 and Kd; IIIb-21 had a >10-fold decreased sensitivity reaching the detection limit of the binding assay; and IIIc-21 did not show any detectable cAMP binding (data not shown). The affinities of the class III mutants, measured in ammonium sulfate, were also reduced in a corresponding pattern (Fig. 4C). The progressive decreases in cAMP efficacies and binding affinities are highly correlated for the class III mutants. The affinities and the EC50 of the electrophoretic mobility shift of subclasses IIIa, IIIb, and IIIc were moderate, low, and undetectable, respectively, as summarized in Table III.Table IIISummary of cAMP binding affinity in phosphate buffer and ammonium sulfate and EC50 of electrophoretic mobility-shift of mutantsMutant classKd in PBKd in ASEC50Relative EC50Site 1Site 2Site 1Site 2nMWild-typeKd34 ± 13517 ± 1312 ± 136 ± 11% of Btotal7932377351I-21Kd20 ± 13123 ± 401 ± 0.18 ± 5% of Btotal8922080501.2I-22Kd38 ± 13254 ± 1046 ± 1(H191P)% of Btotal8812100501.2II-21Kd4237 ± 4875 ± 0.4124 ± 82% of Btotal10084165000120II-22Kd5128"

https://openalex.org/W2041891056,"The Raf-1 serine/threonine protein kinase plays a central role in many of the mitogenic signaling pathways regulating cell growth and differentiation. The regulation of Raf-1 is complex, and involves protein-protein interactions as well as changes in the phosphorylation state of Raf-1 that are accompanied by alterations in its electrophoretic mobility. We have previously shown that a 33-kDa COOH-terminal, kinase-inactive fragment of Raf-1 underwent a mobility shift in response to the stimulation of cells with serum or phorbol esters. Here we demonstrate that treatment of NIH 3T3 cells or Sf9 cells with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) also induces the mobility shift of the kinase-inactive Raf-1 fragment. A series of deletion mutants of the Raf-1 COOH terminus were analyzed, and the region required for the mobility shift was localized to a 78-amino acid fragment (residues 566-643). Metabolic labeling revealed that the slower migrating forms of the 33-kDa and of the smaller fragment contained phosphorus. Mutation of a previously characterized phosphorylation site, serine 621, to alanine prevented the mobility shift as well as phosphate incorporation or Src and Ras-dependent kinase activation in Sf9 cells when this mutation was engineered into the full-length Raf-1. Mutation of 621 to aspartate yielded a protein that existed in both the shifted and unshifted forms, demonstrating that a negative charge at 621 was necessary, but not sufficient, for the mobility shift to occur; however, its full-length form was still resistant to activation in the Sf9 system. Additional mutation of nearby serine 624 to alanine blocked the shift, implicating this residue as the site of the second of a two-step modification process leading to the slower migrating form. Co-expression of the 33-kDa fragment with an activated form of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase in NIH 3T3 led to the appearance of the shifted form in a serum-independent manner. These results demonstrate that a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-induced event involving modification of serines 621 and 624 leads to the mobility shift of Raf-1.

Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Activated MAP kinase phosphorylates both cytosolic and nuclear proteins (23Seth A. Gonzalez F.A. Gupta S. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24796-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and plays a role in subsequent events, which lead to immediate early gene expression (24Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated previously that Raf-1 exhibits an electrophoretic mobility shift that occurs after mitogenic stimulation of cells and that this event correlates with a change in the state of Raf-1 phosphorylation (25Carroll M.P. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1249-1256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Rapp U.R. Roberts T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 5544-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown that the region of Raf-1 responsible for the serum and phorbol ester-induced shift in gel mobility is localized to a catalytically inactive COOH-terminal fragment of Raf-1 (29Olah Z. Ferrier A. Lehel C. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since the amino-terminal domain of Raf-1 is responsible for direct binding to Ras (14Marshall M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), these results suggested that the modification of Raf-1 can take place in the absence of direct interaction with Ras. To determine the site and nature of the modification(s) of Raf-1 that accompany the shift in electrophoretic mobility, additional deletion mutants of the carboxyl terminus and point mutants within this region were created and analyzed. From these experiments, the site of modification(s) was further localized to a region of 78 amino acids, within which was a known serine phosphorylation site (Ser-621). Therefore, we analyzed the role of this serine, as well as a neighboring serine (Ser-624), in the modification of Raf-1, through the creation of site-directed mutants of these residues. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation, as well as immunoblotting of the proteins encoded by these mutants, revealed that the altered electrophoretic mobility of the Raf-1 COOH-terminal fragments occurs following a two-step process that involves the addition of phosphate to two neighboring serine residues. Deletion mutants of Raf-1 were constructed to include a COOH-terminal epitope-tagging sequence encoding the last 12 amino acids of the protein kinase C epsilon (ϵ) gene to provide rapid detection of the expressed protein. Deletion mutants were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification with the Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), using a COOH-terminal ϵ-tagged fragment of Raf-1 (RIII-ϵ) encoding amino acids 381-643 (30Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as the template. NH2-terminal sense primers containing a BamHI restriction site were created at regular intervals originating at amino acid 381, 412, 443, 474, 505, 536, or 566 of Raf-1. A COOH-terminal antisense primer was generated containing the ϵ-tag, along with EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. Using RIII-ϵ as template and the COOH-terminal ϵ-epitope tagging sequence as primer with various NH2-terminal primers, six additional NH2-terminally truncated epitope-tagged Raf-1 constructs were created. Several additional COOH-terminal ϵ-epitope tagged constructs were generated using COOH-terminal primers, which originated at amino acids 612, 581, or 550 along with the ϵ-tag, and with the NH2-terminal primer originating at amino acid 381. The full-length Raf-1 mutant plasmid pKSRafS621A was described previously (31Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding activated MEK-1 and a linked hygromycin resistance gene was provided by James C. Stone, University of Alberta, Edmonton (Canada) (32Bottorff D. Stang S. Agellon S. Stone J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5113-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The RIII-ϵ single and double point mutants were generated by sequential PCR amplifications (33Ho S.N. Hunt D.H. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6830) Google Scholar). The point mutations other than S621A were created using the RIII-ϵ construct as template, and the following sense primers (for S621D, 5ʹCCGGAGCGCTGACGAGCCATCC3ʹ; for S621D/S624A, 5ʹGCGCTGACGAGCCAGCCTTGCATCGGGC3ʹ) along with a COOH-terminal antisense primer containing the ϵ-tag and EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. RIII-ϵ S621A was generated using the pKSRaf1S621A plasmid as template, the sense primer 5ʹCCGGAGCGCTGCCGAGCCATCC3ʹ, and the same antisense primer as above. The PCR product from each of these reactions was then used as the antisense primer to generate RIII-ϵ mutant fragments, which were then cloned into baculovirus expression vectors for expression in Sf9 cells. The presence of point mutations was verified by direct DNA sequence analysis. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and glutamine. The isolation of NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing epitope-tagged Raf-1 mutants is described elsewhere (30Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To induce maximal expression of the recombinant proteins, the transfected cells were changed to serum-free medium supplemented with 20 μM zinc acetate (to up-regulate expression from the metallothionine promoter-linked genes) for 48 h prior to stimulation with 10% serum, 100 nM PMA, or 500 μM H2O2. Stable transfectants expressing both RIII-ϵ and activated MEK-1 were isolated following cotransfection of cells with the expression plasmids and selection in neomycin and hygromycin. The Sf9 insect cell line was maintained in spinner flasks in Grace's supplemented medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% pluronic F-68 (Life Technologies, Inc.). To express the Raf-1 deletion mutants, Sf9 cells were co-transfected with the baculovirus transfer vector pEVMOD-Raf-ϵ-tag and BaculoGold baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen) using the Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant baculoviruses encoding the various Raf-1 proteins were isolated and enriched according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pharmingen). For Raf-1 point mutants, the Bac-To-Bac Baculovirus expression system for Sf9 cells was used (Life Technologies, Inc.). For experimental purposes, Sf9 cells (2.5 × 106) were infected with virus and harvested after 48 h. For the experiments shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by resuspension of the cell pellet in buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mM sodium orthovanadate), and disrupted by Dounce homogenization (100 strokes). Lysates were adjusted to 1 × Laemmli sample buffer concentration and stored at -70°C. For the experiments shown in Table I and Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, cytosolic extracts of insect cells and mammalian cells were prepared as follows. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by resuspension of the cell pellet in buffer B (0.05% SDS, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM EDTA, containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mM sodium orthovanadate) for insect cells and buffer C (same as B except 0.1% SDS) for mammalian cells. Cytosolic fractions were isolated by centrifugation of the cell homogenates at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Lysates for use in immunoblotting were adjusted to 1 × Laemmli sample buffer concentration and stored at -70°C.Fig. 2Expression of RIII-ϵ protein in Sf9 cells.

After incubation for 4-24 h at 4°C, immunoprecipitates were washed as described previously (34DeClue J.E. Cohen B.D. Lowy D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9914-9918Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and processed for SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitates were prepared for electrophoresis by the addition of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol and boiled prior to electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12%). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblot analysis was performed using 10 μg/ml anti-PKC-ϵ antibody as described previously (30Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cell labeling experiments were performed by first rinsing infected cells once with either methionine- or phosphate-deficient medium. The cells then were incubated either in methionine-deficient medium containing 2.5% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Expre35S35S Label; DuPont NEN), or in phosphate-deficient medium with 2.5% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham). After 3 h of labeling, the cells were stimulated by the addition of 500 μM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for the final hour of labeling. The labeled cells were harvested and disrupted, and immunoprecipitation of the ϵ-tagged Raf-1 proteins was carried out as described above. Recombinant human ϵ-epitope-tagged Raf-1 proteins were specifically immunoprecipitated as described above from lysates of singly infected Sf9 cells, or from cells coexpressing Raf-1, p21ras, and activated pp60src. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, and once with kinase buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2). Raf kinase activity was assayed by the phosphorylation of kinase-negative MEK, and the autophosphorylation of Raf-1 was assayed by omitting the MEK from the reactions (35Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Gisela H. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Briefly, the washed immunoprecipitates were incubated in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 100 ng of kinase-negative MEK, 10 μM ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30°C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiling. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation of the kinase-inactive MEK was determined by autoradiography. Alternatively, Raf-1 protein kinase activity was assayed using a coupled assay of extracellular-regulated kinase and MAP kinase activation (21Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), and the activity was determined by the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by the activated MAP kinase. Briefly, Raf-1 immunoprecipitates were incubated with 2 μg of recombinant MAP kinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in reaction mixtures (40 μl) of kinase buffer containing 200 μM ATP along with 1 μg of recombinant active MEK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After 30 min at 30°C, 10 μl of the reaction mixtures were added to 40 μl of ice-cold kinase buffer containing 100 μM Na3VO4. Ten microliters of the diluted reaction mixture was combined with 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μg of myelin basic protein and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 20 min at 30°C, assays were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphoproteins were visualized by autoradiography. Previously, we identified a 33-kDa catalytically inactive COOH-terminal fragment of Raf-1 (amino acids 381-643; designated RIII-ϵ), which exhibited a Ras-independent serum- and phorbol ester-induced shift in gel mobility that mimicked the shift observed with full-length Raf-1 (29Olah Z. Ferrier A. Lehel C. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recent interest has focused on the possible role(s) of oxygen free radicals, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in the regulation of various signal transduction processes. Oxygen free radicals have been suggested to play a role in regulating several enzymes involved in transmembrane signaling pathways, including protein kinase C, tyrosine-specific protein kinases, and MAPK in certain cell systems (36Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 37Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol.

Moreover, in one recent report the normal responses of vascular smooth muscle cells to platelet-derived growth factor, including MAPK activation and DNA synthesis, were shown to require H2O2 generation (39Sundaresan M. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). Since Raf-1 functions as an upstream activator in the MAPK kinase cascade, we investigated whether Raf-1 might also be affected by treatment of cells with H2O2. To examine the effect of various agents on Raf-1 mobility, quiescent NIH 3T3 cells expressing RIII-ϵ were treated with 10% serum, 100 nM PMA, or 500 μM H2O2. Cytosolic extracts were isolated and separated by SDS-PAGE, then subjected to immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1). In quiescent cells, only a single electrophoretic form of the RIII-ϵ protein was observed (Fig. 1, lane 1). In contrast, two forms of RIII-ϵ were observed following treatment with serum or phorbol ester, as shown previously, or hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1, lanes 2-4). The similar migration rates of the upper band induced by each treatment suggested that this form of RIII-ϵ resulted from a similar modification(s) in each instance. Experiments performed using the Sf9 insect cell system to analyze the activation of Raf-1 have revealed that co-expression of Src, Ras, or PKC with Raf-1 led to its activation (9Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Williams N.G. Paradis H. Agarwal S. Charest D.L. Pelech S.L. Roberts T.M. Proc.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To develop a simplified system for the analysis of Raf-1 COOH-terminal modifications, we examined whether treatment of Sf9 cells expressing only RIII-ϵ with H2O2 would lead to a shift in electrophoretic mobility similar to that observed in mammalian cells. After 48 h of infection with an RIII-ϵ expressing baculovirus, readily detectable levels of RIII-ϵ protein were expressed (Fig. 2). Unexpectedly, a doublet corresponding to RIII-ϵ was observed in the untreated cells (Fig. 2, lane 1). The doublet is probably a result of the presence of serum in the infected Sf9 culture. However, the more rapidly migrating form, corresponding to the unmodified form of RIII-ϵ, was found in greater amount in the untreated cells. As early as 30 min after H2O2 treatment, a greater amount of the more slowly migrating form of Raf-1 was observed (Fig. 2, lane 2), and after 60 min, almost all of the RIII-ϵ was found in the modified form (Fig. 2, lane 3). Thus, a similar shift to a more slowly migrating form of RIII-ϵ was noted both in"

https://openalex.org/W1972295089,"Transcription termination factor Rho from Micrococcus luteus, a high G + C Gram-positive bacterium, contains an unusual extra sequence within its RNA binding domain that is rich in Arg, Glu, and Asp residues and deficient in hydrophobic residues. To determine the role of this extra sequence, we compared the biochemical properties of a variant lacking nearly all the extra sequence, des(60-300) Rho, to that of wild-type M. luteus Rho. The two forms had very similar properties except that the des(60-300) Rho was unable to terminate transcription with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at the promoter proximal sites used by the wild-type Rho on a λ cro DNA template but could cause termination at more distal sites and did cause termination at proximal sites when ITP replaced GTP in the reaction mixture. The RNA binding properties of the two forms of this Rho with normal and inosine-substituted RNAs were found to correlate fully with their termination properties. These results indicate that the arginine-rich extra sequence is directly involved in the selection of the termination site and support the hypothesis that the sequence is present in M. luteus Rho to facilitate its binding to M. luteus transcripts, which are likely to have a high degree of base-paired secondary structure because of their high proportion of G residues.

Transcription termination factor Rho is a strongly conserved component in bacteria (1Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To cause termination, it first binds to the nascent RNA and then uses the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to mediate the dissociation of the RNA (2Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 365-388Google Scholar). The Rho polypeptide has two distinct domains, one for binding RNA, the other for binding ATP (3Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A comparison of the rho genes isolated from several different phylogenetic groups has revealed that the ATP binding domain is more highly conserved than the RNA binding domain (1Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most radical divergence that has been discovered so far is the presence of a 150-250-residue extra sequence in the RNA binding domain of the Rhos in organisms from the high G + C Gram-positive group (5Nowatzke W.L.

Four Rho sequences from this group are known and they all have similar extra sequences. In M. luteus, the main extra sequence is between the phylogenetically conserved residues Ile48 and Gly312, and it is unusual in its high proportion of Arg, Glu, and Asp residues and the very low abundance of hydrophobic residues. We refer to it as the arginine-rich extra sequence. Although the sequences of these extra residues in the four known examples are not highly conserved, their compositions and properties are very similar (6Ingham C.J. Hunter I.S. Smith M.C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21803-21807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting that they have a similar function and that the extra sequences arose through adaptive evolution. Since the RNA transcripts in these organisms would have a high proportion of G residues, they are likely to have high levels of base-paired secondary structures. One possible function for the insert is to give Rho the ability to bind to and cause termination of transcripts that would have a high degree of secondary structure (5Nowatzke W.L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 742-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rho factor from M. luteus was found to cause termination of transcription in a heterologous system with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and a λ DNA template (5Nowatzke W.L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 742-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The M. luteus Rho differed from the E. coli Rho in being able to terminate transcription at far upstream sites on that template, at sites that were not normally used by E. coli Rho. Since E. coli Rho binds preferentially to RNA that is largely single-stranded and rich in unpaired cytosine residues (2Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 365-388Google Scholar) and since the λ cro transcript that was available for interaction with Rho when RNA polymerase was at the upstream sites of λ cro is predicted to have a substantial degree of base-paired secondary structure (7Faus I. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), these results suggest that M. luteus Rho was using these sites because it was capable of binding to highly structured transcripts. In this report we test the role of the arginine-rich extra sequence in the RNA binding domain of M. luteus Rho on the specificity of the termination by comparing the properties of wild-type M. luteus Rho with those of a variant, called des(60-300) Rho, that lacks most of the extra sequence. We also test the role of the RNA secondary structure on the process by using ITP to replace GTP for the synthesis of RNA, which would have less stable base pairing. The results indicate that the extra sequence does have a major role in allowing the M. luteus Rho to bind to RNA with a relatively high degree of base-paired secondary structures. E. coli Rho protein was provided by Lislott Richardson (Indiana University). M. luteus Rho was purified as described elsewhere (8Nowatzke W.L. Richardson J.V. Richardson J.P.

This fragment was cloned into the 2994-bp BamHI/RsrII fragment of pMLRHOSK+ creating the in-frame deletion of Arg60 to Glu300 (rho bp +180 to +900) in plasmid pBN16. base pair(s). The Arg60 to Glu300 region (rho bp +180 to +900) in plasmid pBN16 was flanked by two unique restriction sites, SphI and NcoI. Digestion of pBN16 with these restriction endonucleases released a 183-bp fragment, which was swapped for the 906-bp SphI/NcoI fragment in pTB1, introducing the desired deletion into the M. luteus rho gene (pTB3). The approximately 2550-bp BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pTB3 was ligated in the overexpression vector pRSETa (Invitrogen) to create pBN18. Primers WN7 (5′-CATATGGCTAGCATGACCGAATCCACGGAACAG-3′) and WN3 (5′-GGGCGGTCTCGGCGGCGGGG-3′) were used to amplify with a polymerase chain reaction a 247-bp DNA fragment in M. luteus rho (−12 to +235). Primer WN7 includes the addition of NdeI and NheI sites at the 5′ end of the M. luteus rho gene. Additionally, the M. luteus translation initiation codon at +1, GTG, was changed to ATG. Digestion of the polymerase chain reaction product with NheI and SphI yielded a 118-bp fragment, which was ligated into the 4130-bp NheI/SphI fragment of plasmid pBN18 to create pBN19. This resulted in the in-frame placement of M. luteus des(60-300) rho into plasmid pRSETa and added the primary amino acid sequence MRGSHHHHHHGMASM to the N terminus. Plasmid pBN21 was constructed by ligation of the 1398-bp NheI/EcoRI fragment from pBN19 into the 5330-bp NheI/EcoRI fragment of vector pET28a (Novagen) which added the primary amino acid sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMASM to the N terminus. Verification of the sequence changes were confirmed by DNA sequencing (10Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, we were unable to remove the His-tag via digestion with thrombin. was transformed into the protease-deficient (ompT−) E. coli strain BL21DE3[pLysS]. A colony of BL21DE3[pBN21; pLysS] was used to inoculate 150 ml of 2 × YT containing chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). The culture was grown to A600 = 0.4. Overexpression was induced by the addition of IPTG to 1 mM. The culture was aerated an additional 3 h at 37°C with moderate shaking. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (10 min, 3000 × g), washed once in STE (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA), pelleted as above and stored at −20°C for up to 2 months. The cell pellet (1 g) was resuspended in 5 ml of grinding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 M NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol) and blended at low speed with a Virtis homogenizer for 30 s. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM) and lysozyme (2 mg) were added, the cell mixture was again blended, and cell lysis was allowed to continue at room temperature for 15 min. Sodium deoxycholate was added to a final concentration of 0.05%, and the mixture was kept at room temperature an additional 10 min. After chilling the lysate to 4°C, MgCl2 and DNase were added to final concentrations of 40 mM and 10 μg/ml, respectively. The mixture was kept at 4°C, for 30 min. The cell extract was diluted with 5 ml of grinding buffer, and the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation (15 min, 12000 × g). The supernatant was centrifuged (30 min, 100,000 × g) in a Beckman 50Ti rotor. The supernatant was collected (11 ml), and the conductivity was determined. This fraction was applied to a 10-ml (1 cm × 12.5 cm) column of Biorex-70 resin (Bio-Rad), which had been equilibrated in buffer TGED (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol) containing 0.1 M NaCl. Unbound protein was washed through the column with buffer TGED containing 0.1 M NaCl. M. luteus des(60-300) Rho protein was eluted with a 150-ml NaCl gradient (0.1 M to 1.5 M) in buffer TGED. Fractions containing poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity (5Nowatzke W.L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 742-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer D (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 0.3 M NaCl). The dialyzed pool was applied to a 1-ml (0.5 cm × 5 cm) Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) column and washed with 10 column volumes of buffer D. The His-tagged protein was eluted from the resin in a 20-ml imidazole gradient (in buffer D) from 5 mM to 500 mM imidazole. Fractions containing poly(C) dependent ATPase activity were pooled, concentrated with a Centriprep-100 (Amicon), and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of buffer F (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol). The protein was stored at −20°C. λ cro RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (11Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Plasmid pIF2, which contains the cro gene with a modified promoter recognized by T7 RNA polymerase, was digested with either TaqI or HaeIII restriction endonuclease to use as a template to synthesize runoff transcripts of 378 or 115 nucleotides, respectively. 3 pmol of template were added to a 100-μl reaction containing reaction buffer (80 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 20 mM Mg(OAc)2, 1 mM spermidine, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 2 mM each of UTP, CTP, GTP, and 0.125 mM [α-32P]ATP (350 nCi/pmol), and 40 units of RNasin (Promega)). To synthesize RNA molecules in which the guanosine residues were replaced with inosine residues, 2 mM ITP was substituted for 2 mM GTP in the polymerization reaction. The addition of 5 mM GMP was found to enhance the product yield. Synthesis was initiated by the addition of 200 units of T7 RNA polymerase, and the reaction was incubated for 2 h at 37°C. RNA of the desired length was gel-purified on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea after electrophoresis at 30 watts for 2 h. The RNA was electroeluted from the gel slice, precipitated with 0.1 volume of 5 M ammonium acetate and 3 volumes of EtOH, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in double-distilled H2O, and stored at −80°C. Typical yields were 20 pmol for guanosine-incorporated RNA or 100 fmol for inosine-substituted RNA. 32P-Labeled RNA obtained by in vitro synthesis was diluted into 50 μl of transcription reaction mix (150 mM potassium glutamate, pH 7.8, 40 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 4 mM Mg(OAc)2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.002% acetylated bovine serum albumin, 1% glycerol) to a final concentration of 0.2 nM. This mixture was added to various concentrations of Rho protein (final concentration from 0.05 to 100 nM hexamer) and incubated at 25°C for 10 min. Reactions were filtered under vacuum on Biotrace NT filters (Gelman) which had been prewetted in binding buffer. The filters were washed with 6 volumes of wash buffer (binding buffer without the acetylated bovine serum albumin), dried, and assayed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Sample values were adjusted for the fraction of actively binding protein which was determined by the method of Witherell and Uhlenbeck (12Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed with the GraFit program v. 3.0 (Erithacus Software Ltd). Reactions were performed with E. coli RNA polymerase-initiated cro DNA complexes as described previously (5Nowatzke W.L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 742-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When inosine-substituted RNA was characterized, ITP was substituted for GTP in the reaction mixtures with the following modifications. ITP was used in the formation of the A24 complex at 40 μM rather than 4 μM. Additionally, during elongation NTP concentrations were increased to 2.7 mM (ATP), 1.4 mM (UTP), 0.7 mM (CTP), and 1.1 mM (ITP). Rho concentrations were saturating (28 nM) under these conditions. To address the potential role of the arginine-rich amino acid extra sequence in the M. luteus Rho protein, a mutant form of the factor, M. luteus des(60-300) Rho, which lacks most of that extra sequence was prepared and used for functional assays. To allow rapid purification and separation from endogenous E. coli Rho, the gene for expressing M. luteus des(60-300) Rho was engineered to encode an N-terminal hexahistidine sequence. After expression from a T7 RNA polymerase promoter by induction with IPTG, this variant of M. luteus Rho comprised greater than 40% of the total cellular protein (data not shown). Purification to homogeneity was achieved by cation exchange chromatography over Biorex-70 and metal ion affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Table I shows the summary of the purification of 0.77 mg of M. luteus des(60-300) Rho protein from 1 g of induced cells. The purified des(60-300) Rho protein consisted of a single Coomassie Blue R250-stainable component which migrated at the position expected for a 51-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1, lane 3), or slightly slower than the 47-kDa E. coli Rho polypeptide (Fig. 1, lane 2). As was found previously (5Nowatzke W.L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 742-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the 76-kDa wild-type M. luteus Rho protein migrated anomalously at the position for a 95-kDa protein (Fig. 1, lane 4), presumably due to the arginine-rich composition of its extra sequence (13Hu C.C. Ghabrial S.A. J. Virol. Methods. 1995; 55: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine if the 241-amino acid deletion from within the RNA binding domain of the M. luteus protein significantly altered the ATPase activity of M. luteus des(60-300) Rho, ATPase assays were performed using homopolymer RNA cofactors which had been used previously to characterize E. coli (14Lowery C. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and M. luteus Rho (5Nowatzke W.L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 742-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The results (Table II) indicated that removal of the insert had no effect of the specific activity of M. luteus des(60-300) Rho compared to the wild-type protein when poly(C) was the cofactor. Furthermore, M. luteus des(60-300) Rho was activated to nearly the same extents as the wild-type protein by the other homopolymers tested. Finally, removal of the insert did not abolish the requirement for an RNA cofactor as no ATPase activity was detected in the absence of RNA. M. luteus des(60-300) Rho was indistinguishable from the wild-type M. luteus Rho with respect to its ability to hydrolyze the three other NTPs and dATP and its sensitivity to the Rho-specific inhibitor, bicyclomycin (data not shown). To determine what effect the alteration of the RNA binding domain had on the ability of the protein to terminate transcription, we tested its function in vitro with E. coli RNA polymerase transcribing a λ cro DNA fragment, which has the Rho-dependent terminator, tR1 (15Lau L.F. Roberts J.W. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9391-9397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strong E. coli Rho termination stop points occur at sites I (296 nucleotides), II (318 nucleotides), and III (351 nucleotides) within the tR1 terminator. When a saturating amount of M. luteus des(60-300) Rho was added to the transcription mixture, RNA transcripts were synthesized that ended at several positions, but primarily at nt 240 and nt 260 (Fig. 2a, lane 4). These preferred end point positions were very different from those for the transcripts made when wild-type M. luteus Rho was present (lane 6). This result shows that the des(60-300) Rho has termination activity but with a different specificity than that of the full-length M. luteus Rho. Its specificity also differed from that of E. coli Rho (Fig. 2a, lane 2) but was very similar to that of E. coli Rho with NusG present (lane 3). Although M. luteus des(60-300) Rho caused termination primarily at more upstream sites, it was able to recognize signals within tR1, causing RNA polymerase molecules that had passed through those upstream sites to terminate transcription at sites I, II, and III (Fig. 2, lane 4). We do not know whether the observation of the close similarity of the termination specificity of M. luteus des(60-300) Rho and E. coli Rho with NusG present is merely a coincidence or is an indication that M. luteus Rho normally circumvents the requirement for NusG. E. coli NusG had very little effect on the termination specificity with M. luteus des(60-300) Rho or with M. luteus Rho (Fig. 2a, lanes 5 and 7). We did not have M. luteus NusG available to test its function. However, in further experiments (16Burns, C. M., (1996) Nus Factor Modulation of RNA Chain Elongation and Rho-dependent Transcription Termination in Escherichia coli. Ph.D. dissertation, Indiana University.Google Scholar) termination by M. luteus Rhos could be enhanced by E. coli NusG, but not nearly to the same extent as E. coli Rho. We verified that the shorter transcripts synthesized in the presence of the Rho factors were not produced by RNase degradation by doing control experiments in which the factors were added to reaction mixtures which had synthesized full-length runoff transcripts prior to adding the factors (data not shown). Titrations of the individual Rho factors revealed that the amount of Rho that was half-maximal for termination activity was approximately 2 nM for each of the proteins (data not shown). The ability of these three Rho factors to terminate transcription was also assessed for tiZ1, the first intragenic terminator in lacZ (17Burns C.M. Richardson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4738-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the results closely paralleled those for the λ tR1 terminator; M. luteus Rho caused transcripts to terminate at points well upstream from the first stop points used by E. coli Rho, and the M. luteus des(60-300) Rho terminated transcription at points just slightly upstream from the E. coli stop points (data not shown). This indicates that the extra sequence in M. luteus Rho has a general effect on the specificity of termination. To determine whether the differences in the specificities of the three Rho factors is dependent on the degree of stability of the base-paired secondary structures in the nascent RNAs, we tested their function on the transcription of λ cro DNA in a reaction mixture containing ITP in place of GTP. ITP can replace GTP as a substrate for E. coli RNA polymerase (18Chamberlin M.J. Fed. Proc. 1965; 24: 1446-1457PubMed Google Scholar) and because inosine forms only two hydrogen bonds with cytosine, the base-paired secondary structures in inosine-substituted RNA will be less stable than the corresponding structures in RNA with guanosine residues (18Chamberlin M.J. Fed. Proc. 1965; 24: 1446-1457PubMed Google Scholar, 19Adhya S. Sarkar P. Valenzuela D. Maitra U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1613-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The effect of the substitution of GTP with ITP on Rho action was first recognized by Adhya et al. (19Adhya S. Sarkar P. Valenzuela D. Maitra U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1613-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and Morgan et al. (20Morgan W.D. Bear D.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9553-9564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Morgan W.D. Bear D.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9565-9574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the substitution caused E. coli Rho to terminate transcription at new sites well upstream from the normal sites on λ cro DNA. Since the efficiency of transcription termination at a particular site is very sensitive to the RNA chain elongation rate (22Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Richardson J.P. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and since that rate is about 5-fold lower in reaction mixtures containing ITP than in reaction mixtures containing GTP at the same concentration (16Burns, C. M., (1996) Nus Factor Modulation of RNA Chain Elongation and Rho-dependent Transcription Termination in Escherichia coli. Ph.D. dissertation, Indiana University.Google Scholar), we increased the levels of NTP concentrations in the reaction mixtures for our termination studies to a level that allowed the RNA chains to grow at the same average rate as in the standard reaction mixtures with GTP. With these conditions E. coli Rho terminated transcription at more upstream sites than were used during synthesis of guanosine-containing RNAs (compare Fig. 2, panel b, lane 1, with panel a, lane 2). The sizes of these transcripts, as estimated by gel migration, were similar to those reported by Morgan et al. (20Morgan W.D. Bear D.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9553-9564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, smaller, novel transcripts were produced when M. luteus des(60-300) Rho was present for the synthesis of inosine-containing RNA than for the synthesis of guanosine-containing RNA (Fig. 2, panel b, lane 2). The termination pattern was in fact very similar to that produced by E. coli Rho (compare Fig. 2, panel b, lanes 1 and 2), although there was a slightly greater preference for terminating at earlier points. The wild-type M. luteus protein was also functional on inosine-substituted RNA and the overall preference of termination stop points with it was similar to that produced with the guanosine-containing RNA at nucleotide positions 96, 120, 145, 170, and 240 (compare Fig. 2, panel a, lane 6, with panel b, lane 3, which has a darker exposure). A control reaction in which no Rho factor was added indicated that most of the polymerase molecules were able to read through the template to produce the run-off cro transcript (Fig. 2, panel b, lane 4). The effect of ITP substitution was also assessed with the tiZ1 terminator in lacZ. The results (data not shown) closely paralleled those for the cro template. When transcription was carried out with ITP in place of GTP, termination was shifted to more upstream positions with des(60-300) Rho and E. coli Rho but not with M. luteus Rho. To determine if the inability of M. luteus des(60-300) Rho to terminate at the upstream sites used by the wild-type M. luteus protein during transcription with GTP was due to a lack of protein-RNA interaction in the highly structured 5′ end of the RNA molecule, RNA binding studies with λ cro RNAs of various lengths and compositions were performed. Using the same procedures as described by Faus and Richardson (11Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we confirmed that the equilibrium dissociation constant for the complexes of E. coli Rho with the full-length, 378-nucleotide λ cro RNA was approximately 1 nM (Table III). With M. luteus Rho and M. luteus des(60-300) Rhos, the Kd values for their complexes with the same RNA were both about 10-fold lower (Table III). When the RNA was a partial transcript of the cro gene of only 115 nucleotides, which is about the size of the shorter transcripts produced by action of M. luteus Rho but shorter than the transcript terminated by the other Rhos, M. luteus Rho bound to it with the same affinity as to the full-length cro transcript, while M. luteus des(60-300) Rho bound to it with nearly 20-fold lower affinity, and E. coli Rho gave barely detectable binding (Table III). However, when a 115-nt partial cro transcript which has been synthesized using ITP instead of GTP was used, M. luteus Rho again bound to it with the same affinity as to the guanosine-containing transcript, while M. luteus des(60-300) Rho and E. coli Rho were able to bind to it almost as well as the M. luteus Rho (Table III). These results strongly suggest that higher ordered nucleic acid structure near the 5′ end of the cro RNA is inhibitory to binding of Rho factors lacking the arginine-rich insertion within the RNA-binding domain. We have shown that the arginine-rich subdomain of M. luteus Rho confers on it the ability to bind RNA molecules that do not interact well with two Rho proteins which lack that subdomain, E. coli and M. luteus des(60-300) Rhos, and that this difference in RNA binding properties accounts for the altered transcription termination specificity of M. luteus Rho. We then showed that the differences in RNA binding and termination selectivity are largely eliminated when the RNA transcripts contain inosine residues instead of guanosine residues. Together, these results support the contention that the subdomain in M. luteus Rho gives it the ability to terminate transcription of its G-rich transcripts. To date the rho genes from 15 organisms from several subgroups of the bacteria have been sequenced. These genes contain a number of highly conserved sequence motifs. The arginine-rich subdomain of M. luteus Rho is an unusual, extended sequence in an unconserved segment between two well conserved sequences in the RNA binding domain. So far, similar extended insert-like sequences have been found only in the proteins encoded by genes from organisms in the same phylogenetic group that includes M. luteus, the high G + C Gram-positive group. Sequences for four members of that group have been reported and all have similar extra sequences. They are similar in having greater than 150 residues, in being rich in Arg residues with balancing Glu and Asp residues, in being poor in hydrophobic residues, and in being in the same position, just preceding the highly conserved RNP1-like sequence. However, the four sequences show very little conservation among themselves with the greatest similarity in the Arg- and Gly-rich C-terminal parts (6Ingham C.J. Hunter I.S. Smith M.C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21803-21807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In spite of the lack of sequence conservation, the presence of this similar extra subdomain in all of the known putative Rho factors in members of this phylogenetic group suggests that it arose as an evolutionary adaptation. This extra sequence is apparently not a characteristic of all the Gram-positive bacteria nor of all organisms with a high G + C content, because it is not present in the putative Rho homologs from the low G + C Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis (23Quirk P.G. Dunkley E.A. Lee P. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 647-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (24Gomelsky M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1946-1954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a Gram-negative organism with a G + C content of 69%. Rather, the extra sequence appears to have evolved along the lineage of the high G + C Gram-positive bacteria. The abundance of arginine residues in the extra sequence of some Rho factors make those factors members of the arginine-rich motif family of RNA-binding protein. Even though these extra sequences are also rich in Gly residues, they do not have many multiples of the RGG motif, thus they are not members of the family with that feature. Since the Rho factors with the extra sequence also contain all of the highly conserved RNP1-like sequence motifs found in all Rho factors, they are also members of the RNP motif family (25Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 837-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The finding that both forms of M. luteus Rho could bind to the full-length λ cro RNA with a higher affinity than E. coli Rho could indicate that an important part of the difference in termination selectivity between M. luteus and E. coli Rho resides in the sequences that were still present in the des(60-300) derivative, that is within the RNP1-like sequences. The residual difference in binding affinity is probably the reason for the ability of M. luteus des(60-300) Rho to terminate transcription at sites upstream from those used by E. coli Rho in the absence of NusG. Arginine residues in RNA-binding proteins are known to interact with specific RNA sequence elements (26Calnan B.J. Tidor B. Biancalana S. Hudson D. Frankel A.D. Science. 1991; 252: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and nonspecifically with the RNA phosphate backbone (27Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). Although the arginines within the subdomain could be providing either or both of these interactions to the RNA binding properties of M. luteus Rho, we suggest they could have another possible function. The lack of hydrophobic residues, which are important organizing elements for α-helical and β-strand secondary structures in globular proteins, indicates that the subdomain does not have an ordinary globular structure but instead has a loosely ordered structure of largely solvent accessible residues stabilized by salt bridges. Thus, this subdomain could be providing a local solvent environment that could affect the properties of the RNA as the protein is making initial contacts with it through the conserved elements of the RNA binding domain. Taking into consideration the partial specific volumes of the residues included in the extra sequence, we estimate that the concentration of guanido groups from the arginine residues in this 3.4 × 10−20 cm3 subdomain to be approximately 2.8 M. At this concentration these guanido groups could be acting as a localized general denaturant causing the disruption of base-paired RNA secondary structure. The disruption of base-paired structures could then allow M. luteus Rho to make strong functional contacts with single-stranded segments of the RNA using the conserved elements of the RNA binding domain. Studies on how the subdomain affects the structure of the bound RNA and on how specific Arg residues affect the binding specificity should be able to distinguish whether the subdomain is merely serving to alter the local solvent properties or is contributing more directly to the binding process through side chain-nucleotide interactions. We thank Barbara Stitt for generously providing NusG, Lislott Richardson for E. coli Rho protein, and Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. for the bicyclomycin. We also thank Dr. Michael Marletta for his suggestion that the arginine residues in the extra sequences could be acting as local denaturation."
https://openalex.org/W2069828620,"The recombinant NADH-cytochrome c reductase fragment of spinach NADH-nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1), consisting of the contiguous heme-containing cytochrome b domain and flavin-containing NADH-cytochrome b reductase fragment, has been characterized spectroscopically and kinetically. Reductive titration with sodium dithionite indicates heme reduction takes place prior to flavin reduction, which correlates well with the reduction potentials for enzyme-bound heme (15 mV) and FAD (-280 mV). Reductive titration with NADH also indicates that the reduced enzyme forms a charge-transfer complex with NAD+. The circular dichroism spectrum of the oxidized fragment is primarily due to the flavin, whereas the ferrous heme dominates the circular dichroism spectrum of reduced enzyme. Three kinetic phases are observed in the course of the reaction of the enzyme with NADH, each with a distinct spectral signature. The fast phase represents flavin reduction, concomitant with the formation of a charge-transfer complex between reduced flavin and NAD+, and exhibits hyperbolic dependence on NADH concentration with a Kd of 3 μM and a limiting rate constant of 560 s-1. Electron transfer from reduced flavin to heme with a rate constant of 12 s-1 is the intermediate phase, which is rate-limited by breakdown of the charge-transfer complex between NAD+ and reduced flavin. The slow phase is dismutation of a pair of molecules of two-electron reduced enzyme (generated at the end of the second phase of the reaction) to give one molecule each of one- and three- electron reduced enzyme, with a second order rate constant of 2 × 106M-1 s-1. In the presence of excess NADH, this dismutation reaction is followed by the rapid reaction of the one-electron reduced enzyme with a second equivalent of NADH to generate fully reduced enzyme. On the basis of this work, it appears that dissociation of NAD+ from the reduced flavin site rate limits electron transfer to the cytochrome and likely represents the overall rate-limiting step of catalysis.

https://openalex.org/W2076200859,"Escherichia coli tRNA pseudouridine synthase I (PSUI) catalyzes the conversion of uridine residues to pseudouridine in positions 38, 39, and 40 of various tRNA molecules. In previous biochemical studies with this enzyme (Kammen, H. O., Marvel, C. C., Hardy, L., and Penhoet, E. E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2255-2263) it was reported that cysteine residues are important in maintaining the active structure of the enzyme and are possibly involved in the catalytic reaction mechanism via a covalent cysteine intermediate. In order to further investigate the biochemical properties of PSUI, a high level expression and purification system for the enzyme and its corresponding mutants was developed. PSUI has three cysteine residues among 270 amino acids. In the present investigation, each cysteine residue was individually changed to serine and alanine. In addition, a triple mutant was prepared wherein all three cysteine residues were replaced by alanine. Surprisingly, while two of the three cysteine to serine mutants were inactive, all alanine mutants exhibited near wild-type levels of activity, including the triple mutant. These results provide the first direct and unambiguous chemical evidence against a covalent cysteine intermediate in the rearrangement mechanism of uridine to pseudouridine."
https://openalex.org/W2069360805,"cAMP receptor 1 (cAR1) of <i>Dictyostelium</i> couples to the G protein G2 to mediate activation of adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases, chemotaxis, and cell aggregation. Other cAR1-dependent events, including receptor phosphorylation and influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, do not require G proteins. To further characterize signal transduction through cAR1, we performed random mutagenesis of the third intracellular loop (24 amino acids), since the corresponding region of other seven helix receptors has been implicated in the coupling to G proteins. Mutant receptors were expressed in <i>car1</i><sup>-</sup> cells and were characterized for G protein-dependent and -independent signal transduction. Our results demonstrate that cAR1 is remarkably tolerant to amino acid substitutions in the third intracellular loop. Of the 21 positions where amino acid substitutions were observed, one or more replacements were found that retained full biological function. However, certain alterations resulted in receptors with reduced ability to bind cAMP and/or transduce signals. There were specific signal transduction mutants that could undergo cAMP-dependent cAR1 phosphorylation but were impaired either in coupling to G proteins, in G protein-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, or in both pathways. In addition, there were general activation mutants that failed to restore aggregation to <i>car1</i><sup>-</sup> cells and displayed severe defects in all signal transduction events, including the most robust response, cAMP-dependent cAR1 phosphorylation. Certain of these mutant phenotypes were obtained in a complementary study, where the entire region of cAR1 from the third to the seventh transmembrane helices was randomly mutagenized. Considered together, these studies indicate that the activation cycle of cAR1 may involve a number of distinct receptor intermediates. A model of G protein-dependent and -independent signal transduction through cAR1 is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2016151463,"The <i>RET</i> (recombined in transfection) gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase homolog involved in innervation of the gut and renal development. A chimeric epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/RET receptor was constructed which contained the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the EGF receptor fused to the intracellular domain of <i>RET</i>. This construct was expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, and the functional properties of the receptor were characterized and compared with those of the wild type EGF receptor. Whereas the EGF receptor exhibited both high and low affinity binding sites for <sup>125</sup>I-EGF, the EGFR/RET chimera exhibited only low affinity binding of <sup>125</sup>I-EGF. The chimera was able to internalize EGF more rapidly than the wild type EGF receptor and recycled to the cell surface at twice the rate of the EGF receptor. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that EGF stimulated the degradation of the wild type EGF receptor but had no effect on the rate of degradation of the EGFR/RET receptor. The combination of increased recycling and decreased degradation resulted in the relatively inefficient down-regulation of the EGFR/RET chimera. Incubation of cells expressing the wild type EGF receptor with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate led to a reduction in <sup>125</sup>I-EGF binding and a loss in EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. However, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment had only a limited effect on EGF binding and EGF-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity in cells expressing EGFR/RET chimeras. These findings suggest that the ret tyrosine kinase is not regulated by many of the common mechanisms used to terminate signaling via growth factor receptors. Such persistent activation of the Ret tyrosine kinase may be relevant to the physiological function of Ret in cells that normally express this growth factor receptor."
