https://openalex.org/W1966120793,"Abstract A protein with a molecular weight of 130,000 (130K protein) was extracted from chicken gizzard and purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation and ion-exchange chromatography. Antibodies prepared against the pure protein were used for its immunochemical characterization and immunofluorescent visualization in cultured chicken cells. Both peptide mapping and immunochemical analysis indicated that the 130K protein is not related either structurally or antigenically to other mechanochemical proteins, including α-actinin, actin, myosin, tropomyosin, filamin and tubulin. Immunofluorescent labeling of different cultured embryonic chicken cells (from skin, heart and gizzard) indicated that the label was predominantly organized in intracellular plaques at the bottom of the cells and in some areas of cell-cell contact. Immunoprecipitation of the 130K protein from biosynthetically 35 S-methionine-labeled cultured cells, using the pure antibodies and Staphylococcus aureus, resulted in the specific isolation of a single labeled electrophoretic band indistinguishable from the chicken gizzard 130K protein. The 130K protein-rich plaques were found, by interference-reflection microscopy, to coincide with cell substrate adhesion plaques. Double immunofluorescent labeling for the 130K protein and other cytoskeletal proteins (actin, α-actinin and tropomyosin) indicated that the 130K protein-rich areas are localized at the termini of stress fibers. α-Actinin was found in close association with the 130K protein, while tropomyosin was usually excluded from those areas."

The spike waves are accompanied by behavioral ""absence"" attacks and intermittent focal motor seizures showing somatotopic progression. Cerebral metabolic activity during seizures was assayed by autoradiography of brain sections from mice injected intravenously with 14C-labeled 2-deoxyglucose. Metabolic activity was increased bilaterally in selected brainstem structures. Spontaneous electrocorticographic and clinical seizures of this general pattern were recognized hitherto only in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2032312505,"We prepared the cytoskeletal framework by gently extracting cells with Triton X-100. Lipids and soluble proteins were removed, leaving a complex meshlike structure which contains the cell nucleus and is composed of the major cell filament networks as well as the microtrabeculae with attached polyribosomes. The surface sheet or lamina covering this structure contains most of the cell surface proteins by the following criteria. Intact cells are labeled externally with radioiodine and then extracted with detergent. The iodinated poteins remain almost entirely with skeletal framework. A new major integral protein, the coat protein of Sindbis virus, is inserted into the plasma membrane of infected cells. This new protein is heavily iodinated and remains almost completely associated with the framework after extraction. Lectin binding and poliovirus binding sites are also retained after detergent extraction. Our results indicate that plasma membrane proteins form a sheet or lamina upon removal of lipids. This lamina reproduces even complex surface convolutions and appears to be supported by and intimately connected to the underlying skeleton. In this case, the surface lamina, and hence the plasma membrane of the original intact cell, might be viewed as a component of the cytoskeletal framework."

https://openalex.org/W2067776958,"Exposure to ethanol retards growth and differentiation in cultured rat embryos during organogenesis. The development of untreated embryos is indistinguishable from growth in utero. These data suggest that the hypoplastic features of children born to chronically alcoholic mothers are due, at least in part, to a direct action of ethanol, which causes reduced embryonic cellular proliferation early in gestation."
https://openalex.org/W2052351788,"Although exposure to inescapable shocks induced analgesia in rats, the analgesia was not manifest 24 hours later. A brief reexposure to shock, however, restored the analgesia. This reexposure to shock had an analgesic effect only if the rats had been shocked 24 hours previously. Further, long-term analgesic effects depended on the controllability of the original shocks and not on shock exposure per se. Implications of these results for learned helplessness and stress-induced analgesia are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1998387305,"Female rats subjected to prenatal stress later experienced fewer conceptions, more spontaneous abortions and vaginal hemorrhaging, longer pregnancies, and fewer viable young than nonstressed rats. The offspring of the prenatally stressed rats were lighter in weight and less likely to survive the neonatal period. Prenatal stress may influence the balance of adrenal and gonadal hormones during a critical stage of fetal hypothalamic differentiation, thereby producing a variety of reproductive dysfunctions in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2067811757,"Old memory, when reactivated by cue exposure, was disrupted by mild or deep hypothermia treatments. New memory was impaired only by deep cooling. Moreover, old but not new learning showed spontaneous recovery. Old reactivated memory may be qualitatively different from newly acquired memory."
https://openalex.org/W2039588845,"In laboratory rodents, concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) are exceedingly high (up to 7 to 8 millimolar) in the glandular gastric tissue compared to concentrations in other portions of the gastrointestinal tract or to those of most other organs. Gastric GSH varies diurnally, with the highest levels occurring in the late afternoon or early evening. Starvation, treatment with diethyl maleate, or cold-restraint stress all caused marked decreases in stomach GSH, whereas treatment with cobaltous chloride caused an increase in the GSH concentrations. The physiological significance of the high gastric GSH is unknown, but because this endogenous compound may strongly modulate (decrease or increase) the macromolecular binding of certain chemicals capable of inducing stomach tumors, the possible role of glutathione in the pathogenesis of chemically induced gastric cancer should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W1993052466,"We have examined the effect of the tumor promoter, 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), on the actin-containing elements of the cytoskeleton of chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF). TPA at concentrations as low as 7.3 times 10-10M indices a reversible change in the cytoskeleton as visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-actin antibodies. Cells incubated with TPA lose the ordered actin-containing structures found in normal cells and resemble Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells in that the immunofluorescent actin pattern is diffuse. The TPA effects are both dose-and time-dependent. Analogs of TPA which are inactive as tumor promoters do not induce cytoskeletal changes at the concentrations tested, while a second tumor promoter, PDD, is also able to cause alterations in actin-containing structures. The action of TPA requires de novo synthesis of both RNA and protein. The direct cytoskeletal changes are neither plasmin-dependent nor subject to inhibition by incubating the cells with high levels of protease inhibitors during the exposure to TPA. However, plasminogen does increase the sensitivity of cells to TPA."
https://openalex.org/W2091318575,The electrical fields above chick embryos were explored with a vibrating probe. These fields indicate that steady currents with exit densities of the order of 100 microamperes per square centimeter leave the whole streak and return elsewhere through the epiblast. The epicenter of these strong exit currents lies near Hensen's node. They are probably pumped into the intraembryonic space by the epiblast and then leak out of the streak because it is a zone of junctional disruption.
https://openalex.org/W1975484124,"The nuclear gel of Xenopus oocytes contains a meshwork of randomly oriented microfilaments which have been identified as F-actin by decoration with rabbit skeletal muscle myosin subfragment-1 (S-1). Nuclear gel preparations treated with S-1 differ in several respects from control preparations incubated in either aqueous medium alone, or medium containing BSA. Actin filaments in control preparations appear less well preserved than those in S-1 treated preparations of the nuclear gel. The nucleoli of control preparations are extremely dense, while those of S-1 treated preparations have a more open, granular appearance. Large granular aggregates, which are a prominent feature of the controls, are seen much less frequently in S-1-treated preparations of the nuclear gel. These morphological differences appear to be correlated with the binding of protein to F-actin, since nuclear gel preparations incubated in tropomyosin, which also binds to actin filaments, appear similar to those treated with S-1. Approximately 63% of the total nuclear actin exists in a globular state, while 37% is filamentous."

https://openalex.org/W1539463185,"When chick limb bud mesenchyme cells from stage 23 to 24 embryos are plated at high density, they rapidly divide and a large proportion initiate chondrogenic expression during the first 2 to 3 days in culture. Between Days 4 and 8, the emergent chondrocytes mature and elaborate a cartilaginous matrix. The proteoglycans synthesized by the newly emergent Day 3 to 4 chondrocytes differ from those synthesized by either the prechondrogenic mesenchyme cells or the mature Day 8 chondrocytes. Cultures were grown from initial plating (Day 0) or from Day 2 in the continuous presence of 1 mM 4-methyl umbelliferyl-beta-D-xyloside, which acts intracellularly as a competitive acceptor with the endogenous core protein of proteoglycans for chondroitin sulfate synthesis. The proteoglycans synthesized by Day 8 cultures which had been maintained on xyloside or to which xyloside was added only 1 h prior to labeling were essentially identical. They were able to form aggregates, and they contained the same number of keratan sulfate chains, but only about 40% as many chondroitin sulfate chains, as normal. Additionally, both the chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate chains were 25% shorter than in the normal proteoglycans. The proteoglycans synthesized by cells in a culture maintained on xyloside until Day 8, and then switched to medium with no xyloside 1 h prior to labeling, were characteristic of those synthesized by normal mature Day 8 chondrocytes. These data suggest that stage 23 to 24 mesenchyme cells undergo normal chondrogenic maturation in culture in the presence of xylosides even though (a) most of the polysaccharides are synthesized onto the exogenously supplied xyloside substrate and released into the medium, (b) the proteoglycans that are synthesized are greatly reduced in polysaccharide content, and (c) the extracellular matrix as a consequence is greatly depleted in chondroitin sulfate content and, therefore, is abnormal in general morphology."
https://openalex.org/W1529580389,"We have raised antisera against human prothrombin activation fragment F2 in rabbits and have chromatographed the respective immunoglobulin G fractions on prothrombin-Sepharose, Pr1-Sepharose, and F2-Sepharose immunoadsorbents. The specific antibody population obtained was utilized to construct a double antibody radioimmunoassay capable of measuring as little as 0.8 ng/ml of this component. Our studies suggest that the immunoreactive site defined by this antibody population is most probably located within the negatively charged COOH-terminal region of F2. The immunologic expression of this area is unaffected by denaturation or reduction-alkylation of F2 as well as by attachment of polypeptide to the NH2-terminal of this component. However, the presence of covalently bound polypeptide at the COOH-terminal of F2 reduces its immunologic reactivity by 300- to 400-fold. Prothrombin, Pr1, and Pr*1, which contain the F2 region as part of their covalent structure, are at least 4000 to 7000 times less immunoreactive than F2 on a molar basis. Conversion of these components to thrombin as well as activation fragments generates the theoretically predicted level of immunoreactivity. Masking of the immunoreactive site within these zymogens is due to two phenomena. Firstly, covalent attachment of polypeptides on the COOH-terminal of the F2 segment significantly depresses the reactivity of this region. Secondly, a critical S--S bridge aids in the sequenstration of the immunoreactive site. This cross-link may facilitate interactions between the COOH-terminal of the F2 segment and other regions of the zymogen."

https://openalex.org/W2116943817,"Intracellular recordings show that (i) paramecia hyperpolarize slightly in attractants and depolarize in repellents that depend on the avoiding reaction (an abrupt change of swimming direction), and (ii) paramecia more strongly hyperpolarize in repellents and more strongly depolarize in attractants that depend on changes of swimming velocity. These membrane potential changes are in agreement with a hypothesis of membrane potential control of chemokinesis in Paramecium."
https://openalex.org/W1993513457,"Long-term amphetamine administration to cats (a mean of 8.75 milligrams per kilogram twice daily for 10 days) produced large decreases (40 to 67 percent in serotonin and its major metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, in all brain regions examined. This treatment also produced several behaviors that are dependent on depressed central serotonergic neurotransmission, and which normally are elicited exclusively by hallucinogenic drugs. Short-term amphetamine administration (15 mg/kg) did not produce these behaviors and resulted in small decreases in brain serotonin and no change in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. These data are discussed in the context of monoamine theories of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W1966193393,Androgen formation (3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity) was detectable in the rabbit blastocyst on day 5 of gestation (before implantation); estrogen formation was first detectable on day 7. The capacity to form estrogen on the day of implantation suggests that estrogen formation in the blastocyst may play a role in the implantation process.

https://openalex.org/W2044166627,"Hepatic hydroxylated metabolites of chlorpromazine (10(-5)M to 10(-4)M), a frequently used phenothiazine tranquilizer, produce solid gel formation with filamentous actin, but the less toxic chlorpromazine sulfoxide metabolite does not. At higher concentrations (5 x 10(-4)M) chlorpromazine inhibits actin polymerization. These dose-response relationships parallel the drug's hepatic toxicity in vivo and suggest that interactions between chloropromazine or chlorpromazine metabolites and actin could be an underlying mechanism of cell injury."
https://openalex.org/W2090517254,"Male mice release luteinizing hormone when exposed for a short time to a female. In this experiment, multiple blood samples were withdrawn by atrial cannulas from tethered males during either continuous or intermittent exposure to nonreceptive females. After an immediate, transient release of luteinizing hormone, continuous exposure to the same female was accompanied by only random, spontaneous elevations in plasma levels of this hormone. Successive presentations of the same female at 2-hour intervals elicited gradually diminishing luteinizing hormone responses. Exposing such unresponsive males to novel, diestrous females, however, dramatically stimulated their release of the hormone. These results demonstrate habituation of a socially induced, neuroendocrine response involving reproductive hormones."

https://openalex.org/W1592026515,"Ruthenium myoglobins have been prepared by the reconstitution of horse heart apomyoglobin with either ruthenium(II) or ruthenium(III) mesoporphyrin IX (MpIX) derivatives. The ruthenium(II) and -(III) myo globins (RuMb and RuMb+, respectively) contain one ruthenium porphyrin/heme binding site; the species are readily interconverted using dithionite for reduction and bromine for oxidation. RuMb binds carbon monoxide to give the known carbonyl complex. Reversible oxygenation occurs readily with protein-free RuII(MpIX) species in dimethylformamide, but RuMb in phosphate buffer is irreversibly oxidized by dioxygen to give RuMb+ via an outer sphere electron transfer mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1599660718,"The enzyme responsible for the stimulation by ATP AND NADPH of light emission catalyzed by bacterial luciferase has been partially purified from extracts of the luminescent bacterium, Photobacterium phosphoreum. The stimulatory activity was found to be stabilized by high concentrations of mercaptoethanol, permitting it to be separated from luciferase into an active and stable form and enabling further characterization of its functional properties. The activity of the enzyme was shown to be dependent not only on ATP and NADPH but also on the presence of a long chain fatty acid, and was inhibited by the addition of NADH and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase. The specificity for fatty acids, as measured by the stimulation of luciferase activity, had a very limited range, with maximal luminescence being obtained with myristic acid and lower responses being observed only with tridecanoic and pentadecanoic acid. These results provide evidence in vitro for an enzyme in bioluminescent bacteria that functions as a fatty acid reductase converting fatty acids to aldehydes which in turn can be utilized by luciferase in the light-emitting reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1526299845,"Three DNA-dependent RNA polymerases have been isolated and partially purified from the mycelium of the fungus Podospora anserina. Separated by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography, they have been designated RNA polymerases I, II, and III according to their order of elution. Their catalytic properties and alpha-amanitin sensitivity are in agreement with those of the homologous enzymes found in other eukaryotic organisms. The three enzymes exhibit rather sharp monophasic ammonium sulfate dependence with optima which are, respectively, 0.035 M, 0.050 M, and 0.075 M. Enzyme I has the largest Mn2+/Mg2+ activity ratio, shows a marked preference for native DNA, and is insensitive to alpha-amanitin. Enzyme III uses poly(dA-dT) in preference to native DNA as template and is only partially sensitive to alpha-amanitin. Enzyme II is sensitive to alpha-amanitin, but high concentrations of the toxin are required for inhibition compared to other eukaryotic class II enzymes. Three similar RNA polymerases with comparable levels of activity were found in the temperature-dependent VR strain when cellular incompatibility, leading to a rapid cessation of RNA synthesis, was induced."
