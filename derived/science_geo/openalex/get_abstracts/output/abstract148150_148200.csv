https://openalex.org/W2012591289,"More than half of the 170 million metric tons of polymers produced each year are polyolefins. Current technology uses highly active cationic catalysts, which suffer from an inability to tolerate heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. These systems require scrupulously clean starting materials and activating cocatalysts. A family of catalysts has been developed whose members are tolerant of both heteroatoms and less pure starting materials. These heteroatom-tolerant neutral late transition metal complexes are in fact highly active systems that produce high-molecular-weight polyethylene, polymerize functionalized olefins, and require no cocatalyst."

https://openalex.org/W2160150335,"Mesostructured silica waveguide arrays were fabricated with a combination of acidic sol-gel block copolymer templating chemistry and soft lithography. Waveguiding was enabled by the use of a low-refractive index (1.15) mesoporous silica thin film support. When the mesostructure was doped with the laser dye rhodamine 6G, amplified spontaneous emission was observed with a low pumping threshold of 10 kilowatts per square centimeter, attributed to the mesostructure's ability to prevent aggregation of the dye molecules even at relatively high loadings within the organized high-surface area mesochannels of the waveguides. These highly processible, self-assembling mesostructured host media and claddings may have potential for the fabrication of integrated optical circuits."

https://openalex.org/W1972563610,"A scheme is proposed wherein nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be induced and monitored using only optical fields. In analogy to radio-frequency fields used in traditional NMR, circularly polarized light creates electron spins in semiconductors whose hyperfine coupling could tip nuclear moments. Time-resolved Faraday rotation experiments were performed in which the frequency of electron Larmor precession was used as a magnetometer of local magnetic fields experienced by electrons in n-type gallium arsenide. Electron spin excitation by a periodic optical pulse train appears not only to prepare a hyperpolarized nuclear moment but also to destroy it resonantly at magnetic fields proportional to the pulse frequency. This resonant behavior is in many ways supportive of a simple model of optically induced NMR, but a curious discrepancy between one of the observed frequencies and classic NMR values suggests that this phenomenon is more complex."
https://openalex.org/W2027077464,"The PML gene of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) encodes a cell-growth and tumor suppressor. PML localizes to discrete nuclear bodies (NBs) that are disrupted in APL cells. The Bloom syndrome gene BLM encodes a RecQ DNA helicase, whose absence from the cell results in genomic instability epitomized by high levels of sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) and cancer predisposition. We show here that BLM co-localizes with PML to the NB. In cells from persons with Bloom syndrome the localization of PML is unperturbed, whereas in APL cells carrying the PML-RARα oncoprotein, both PML and BLM are delocalized from the NB into microspeckled nuclear regions. Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) induces the relocalization of both proteins to the NB. In primary PML−/− cells, BLM fails to accumulate in the NB. Strikingly, in PML−/− cells the frequency of SCEs is increased relative to PML+/+ cells. These data demonstrate that BLM is a constituent of the NB and that PML is required for its accumulation in these nuclear domains and for the normal function of BLM. Thus, our findings suggest a role for BLM in APL pathogenesis and implicate the PML NB in the maintenance of genomic stability."

https://openalex.org/W2324533686,"The serine threonine kinase protein kinase B regulates cellular activities as diverse as glycogen metabolism and apoptosis. Full activation of protein kinase B requires 3-phosphoinositides and dual phosphorylation on threonine-308 and serine-473. CaM-K kinase and 3-phosphoinositide dependent-kinase-1 phosphorylate threonine-308. Integrin-linked kinase reportedly phophorylates serine-473. Consistent with this, in a model COS cell system we show that expression of wild-type integrin-linked kinase promotes the wortmannin sensitive phosphorylation of serine-473 of protein kinase B and its downstream substrates, and inhibits C2-ceramide induced apoptosis. In contrast, integrin-linked kinase mutated in a lysine residue critical for function in protein kinases is inactive in these experiments, and furthermore, acts dominantly to block serine-473 phosphorylation induced by ErbB4. However, alignment of analogous sequences from different species demonstrates that integrin-linked kinase is not a typical protein kinase and identifies a conserved serine residue which potentially regulates kinase activity in a phosphorylation dependent manner. Mutation of this serine to aspartate or glutamate, but not alanine, in combination with the inactivating lysine mutation restores integrin-linked kinase dependent phosphorylation of serine-473 of protein kinase B. These data strongly suggest that integrin-linked kinase does not possess serine-473 kinase activity but functions as an adaptor to recruit a serine-473 kinase or phosphatase."

https://openalex.org/W2028333426,"Elk-1, a member of the TCF family of Ets domain proteins, contains a C-terminal transcriptional activation domain with multiple copies of the MAPK core consensus sequence S/T-P. This region is phosphorylated by MAP kinases in vitro and in vivo, but the extent and kinetics of phosphorylation at the different sites have not been investigated in detail. We prepared antisera against the phosphorylated forms of residues T353, T363, T368, S383, S389 and T417. The antisera specifically recognize the phosphorylated Elk-1 C terminus and are specific for their cognate sites, as assessed by peptide competition and mutagenesis experiments. Analysis of cells stably expressing Elk-1 in vivo shows that following serum or TPA stimulation, residues T353, T363, T368, S383, S389 and T417 become phosphorylated with similar kinetics. Mutation of any one site does not prevent phosphorylation of the others. Mutation to alanine of S383, F378 or W379, which virtually abolishes transcriptional activation by Elk-1, does not affect phosphorylation of any sites tested. Analysis of Elk-1 using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis shows that following ERK activation Elk-1 receives at least six phosphates in addition to those present prior to stimulation. We propose that the Elk-1 C-terminal regulatory domain becomes stoichiometrically phosphorylated following growth factor stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1964418777,"Optical spectra of high-transition-temperature superconductors in the mid-infrared display a gap of in-plane conductivity whose role for superconductivity remains unresolved. Femtosecond measurements of the mid-infrared reflectivity of YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-delta) after nonequilibrium optical excitation are used to demonstrate the ultrafast fill-in of this gap and reveal two gap constituents: a picosecond recovery of the superconducting condensate in underdoped and optimally doped material and, in underdoped YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-delta), an additional subpicosecond component related to pseudogap correlations. The temperature-dependent amplitudes of both contributions correlate with the antiferromagnetic 41-millielectronvolt peak in neutron scattering, supporting the coupling between charges and spin excitations."

https://openalex.org/W2046232988,"Accurate measurement of the lifetime of the neutron (which is unstable to beta decay) is important for understanding the weak nuclear force1 and the creation of matter during the Big Bang2. Previous measurements of the neutron lifetime have mainly been limited by certain systematic errors3; however, these could in principle be avoided by performing measurements on neutrons stored in a magnetic trap. Neutral-particle and charged-particle traps are widely used for studying both composite and elementary particles, because they allow long interaction times and isolation of particles from perturbing environments4. Here we report the magnetic trapping of neutrons. The trapping region is filled with superfluid 4He, which is used to load neutrons into the trap and as a scintillator to detect their decay. Neutrons in the trap have a lifetime of 750+330-200 seconds, mainly limited by their beta decay rather than trap losses. Our experiment verifies theoretical predictions regarding the loading process and magnetic trapping of neutrons. Further refinement of this method should lead to improved precision in the neutron lifetime measurement."

https://openalex.org/W1971078530,"The edge of a two-dimensional electron system in a magnetic field consists of one-dimensional channels that arise from the confining electric field at the edge of the system. The crossed electric and magnetic fields cause electrons to drift parallel to the sample boundary, creating a chiral current that travels along the edge in only one direction. In an ideal two-dimensional electron system in the quantum Hall regime, all the current flows along the edge. Quantization of the Hall resistance arises from occupation of N one-dimensional edge channels, each contributing a conductance of e2/h. Here we report differential conductance measurements, in the integer quantum Hall regime, of tunnelling between the edges of a pair of two-dimensional electron systems that are separated by an atomically precise, high-quality, tunnel barrier. The resultant interaction between the edge states leads to the formation of new energy gaps and an intriguing dispersion relation for electrons travelling along the barrier: for example, we see a persistent conductance peak at zero bias voltage and an absence of tunnelling features due to electron spin. These features are unexpected and are not consistent with a model of weakly interacting edge states. Remnant disorder along the barrier and charge screening may each play a role, although detailed numerical studies will be required to elucidate these effects."
https://openalex.org/W2316715032,"In Ewing tumor, the (11;22) chromosomal translocation produces a chimeric molecule composed of the amino-terminal domain of EWS fused to the carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding domain of FLI-1. Previously, we have identified a novel protein TAFII68, which is highly similar to EWS and another closely related protein TLS (also called FUS). We demonstrate that the N-terminus of TAFII68 efficiently stimulates transcription when fused to two different DNA binding domains and that overexpression of TAFII68-FLI-1 chimeras in NIH3T3 cells leads to oncogenic transformation. We have also investigated the molecular mechanisms which could account for the transcriptional activation and the oncogenic transformation potential of the N-termini of TAFII68 and EWS. Thus, we have tested whether the artificial recruitment of components of the preinitiation complex (PIC) or a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) could bypass the requirement for the activation domains of either EWS or TAFII68. Recruitment of individual components of the transcription machinery or the GCN5 HAT is not sufficient to promote activation from FLI-1 responsive genes either in transfection experiments or in oncogenic transformation assays. These results suggest that the TAFII68 or EWS activation domains enhance a step after PIC formation in the transcriptional activation process."

https://openalex.org/W2064770308,"We reexamined the Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary apparent polar wander path for the Pacific plate using 27 paleomagnetic poles from seamounts dated by (40)Ar/(39)Ar geochronology. The path shows little motion from 120 to 90 million years ago (Ma), northward motion from 79 to 39 Ma, and two groups of poles separated by 16 to 21 degrees with indistinguishable mean ages of 84 +/- 2 Ma. The latter phenomenon may represent a rapid polar wander episode (3 to 10 degrees per million years) whose timing is not adequately resolved with existing data. Similar features in other polar wander paths imply that the event was a rapid shift of the spin axis relative to the mantle (true polar wander), which may have been related to global changes in plate motion, large igneous province eruptions, and a shift in magnetic field polarity state."

https://openalex.org/W2007707307,"The heartbeat is recorded on an electro- cardiogram (ECG) as a characteristic trace determined by changes in the electrical activity of the heart muscle. The T wave is a component of this waveform that is associated with the repolarization phase of the action potentials1. It is asymmetrical in healthy subjects, but tends to become symmetrical with heart disease2. The reason for the T-wave shape is not clear3. Here we show that T waves become more symmetrical as a result of an increase in the dispersion of the regional repolarization of cardiac muscle."

The data in BCGD is extracted from the published biomedical research literature and stored as a collection of 'Facts', which in turn are collected into topical categories organized by gene. This organization facilitates quick searches and rapid retrievals of specific data such as gene characteristics, functions and role in oncogenesis, and is an important factor allowing for continuous updates. BCGD can be searched either by gene name or keyword. Data is deposited and retrieved from the database through a set of interactive Web forms, making it both platform-independent and universally accessible in facilitating worldwide collaborative authoring of the database. Data in BCGD is linked to other on-line resources such as Entrez, GeneCards and On-Line Mendelian Inheritance in Man. BCGD is located at http://mbcr.bcm.tmc.edu/ermb/bcgd/bcgd.html."

https://openalex.org/W2314149597,"CDC42, a Ras-related small GTP binding protein, is involved in diverse cellular functions in lymphocytes. We generated transgenic mice expressing constitutively active murine CDC42 (Q61L) under the control of the human CD2 promoter. Transgenic mice showed smaller thymi with a dramatic reduction of CD4+CD8+, CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes and with increase of CD4-CD8- thymocytes at CD25-CD44+ and CD25+ stage. A high percentage of the transgenic thymocytes were apoptotic, explaining the reduction of cellularity and size of the thymus. Mature T cells (TCR alphabeta+) in peripheral lymph organs, spleen and lymph node, were also dramatically reduced, and exhibited massive apoptosis. Expression of Fas and Fas ligand on both thymocytes and peripheral T cells was upregulated in transgenic mice, but the increased apoptosis in the thymus was independent of Fas (CD95), whereas peripheral spleen and lymph node T cell apoptosis was Fas dependent. Thus, activated CDC42 triggers distinct apoptotic pathways in thymocytes and peripheral T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1993374030,"Optical second harmonic generation was used to study the in-plane alignment of self-assembled silane monolayers attached to a glass surface under mechanical loading. The measurements allow correlation of the macroscopic forces acting on the monolayer with the average orientation and the azimuthal molecular alignment of the terminal molecular entity. Compression and shear forces lead to an alignment of the initially randomly oriented molecules on a macroscopic length scale. The change in azimuthal alignment of molecules under mechanical stress was found to be irreversible on the time scale of 12 hours, whereas changes of the molecular tilt angle were reversible."

Two specimens have since been caught off the island of Manado Tua, north Sulawesi, Indonesia, some 10,000 kilometres away2. We sought to determine the ecological and geographic distribution of Indonesian coelacanth populations with a view to drawing up conservation measures for this extremely rare fish2,3. During our explorations, we discovered two living Indonesian coelacanths 360 km southwest of Manado Tua."
https://openalex.org/W2009696441,"Simian Virus 40 Large T-antigen expressed in NIH3T3 cells increases p53 level and interacts with this tumor suppressor to form large nuclear complexes. We show here that T-antigen sensitizes NIH3T3 cells to low doses of the oxidative stress inducer menadione. This oxidant increased p53 accumulation and disrupted p53/T-antigen interaction, but not T-antigen/pRb, T-antigen/Hsc70 and p53/Hsc70 complexes; a phenomenon inhibited by the anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine. Analysis of several p53 downstream gene products revealed that the level of Fas receptor, which was sharply reduced by T-antigen expression, was drastically increased in response to menadione treatment. Menadione also induced a T-antigen dependent cleavage of Fas ligand. Analysis performed with Fas receptor antagonist antibody and metalloproteinases inhibitor revealed that menadione triggers a Fas-dependent death of a fraction of T-antigen expressing cells. This Fas pathway does not activate caspase 8 or 3, probably because of the inhibition induced by T-antigen, and leads to a necrotic cell death which contributes at least in part to the hypersensitivity of T-antigen transformed cells to oxidative stress."
