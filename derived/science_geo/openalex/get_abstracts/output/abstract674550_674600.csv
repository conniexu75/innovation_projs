https://openalex.org/W3118121970,"Long-lived bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) are a persistent and essential source of protective antibodies1-7. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 have a substantially lower risk of reinfection with SARS-CoV-28-10. Nonetheless, it has been reported that levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies decrease rapidly in the first few months after infection, raising concerns that long-lived BMPCs may not be generated and humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may be short-lived11-13. Here we show that in convalescent individuals who had experienced mild SARS-CoV-2 infections (n = 77), levels of serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) antibodies declined rapidly in the first 4 months after infection and then more gradually over the following 7 months, remaining detectable at least 11 months after infection. Anti-S antibody titres correlated with the frequency of S-specific plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates from 18 individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 at 7 to 8 months after infection. S-specific BMPCs were not detected in aspirates from 11 healthy individuals with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that S-binding BMPCs are quiescent, which suggests that they are part of a stable compartment. Consistently, circulating resting memory B cells directed against SARS-CoV-2 S were detected in the convalescent individuals. Overall, our results indicate that mild infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces robust antigen-specific, long-lived humoral immune memory in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3119309452,"A combination of plasma phospho-tau (P-tau) and other accessible biomarkers might provide accurate prediction about the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia. We examined this in participants with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment from the BioFINDER (n = 340) and Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (n = 543) studies. Plasma P-tau, plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, plasma neurofilament light, APOE genotype, brief cognitive tests and an AD-specific magnetic resonance imaging measure were examined using progression to AD as outcome. Within 4 years, plasma P-tau217 predicted AD accurately (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.83) in BioFINDER. Combining plasma P-tau217, memory, executive function and APOE produced higher accuracy (AUC = 0.91, P < 0.001). In ADNI, this model had similar AUC (0.90) using plasma P-tau181 instead of P-tau217. The model was implemented online for prediction of the individual probability of progressing to AD. Within 2 and 6 years, similar models had AUCs of 0.90–0.91 in both cohorts. Using cerebrospinal fluid P-tau, Aβ42/Aβ40 and neurofilament light instead of plasma biomarkers did not improve the accuracy significantly. The clinical predictions by memory clinic physicians had significantly lower accuracy (4-year AUC = 0.71). In summary, plasma P-tau, in combination with brief cognitive tests and APOE genotyping, might greatly improve the diagnostic prediction of AD and facilitate recruitment for AD trials. Plasma P-tau, in combination with clinical measures, predicts future Alzheimer’s disease dementia in two independent cohorts with high accuracy and is superior to the clinical diagnostic predictions of specialists."
https://openalex.org/W3164329676,"Single-cell transcriptomics provide a systematic map of gene expression in different human cell types. The next challenge is to systematically understand cell-type-specific gene function. The integration of CRISPR-based functional genomics and stem cell technology enables the scalable interrogation of gene function in differentiated human cells. Here we present the first genome-wide CRISPR interference and CRISPR activation screens in human neurons. We uncover pathways controlling neuronal response to chronic oxidative stress, which is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Unexpectedly, knockdown of the lysosomal protein prosaposin strongly sensitizes neurons, but not other cell types, to oxidative stress by triggering the formation of lipofuscin, a hallmark of aging, which traps iron, generating reactive oxygen species and triggering ferroptosis. We also determine transcriptomic changes in neurons after perturbation of genes linked to neurodegenerative diseases. To enable the systematic comparison of gene function across different human cell types, we establish a data commons named CRISPRbrain."
https://openalex.org/W3164369261,"Vital signs, including heart rate and body temperature, are useful in detecting or monitoring medical conditions, but are typically measured in the clinic and require follow-up laboratory testing for more definitive diagnoses. Here we examined whether vital signs as measured by consumer wearable devices (that is, continuously monitored heart rate, body temperature, electrodermal activity and movement) can predict clinical laboratory test results using machine learning models, including random forest and Lasso models. Our results demonstrate that vital sign data collected from wearables give a more consistent and precise depiction of resting heart rate than do measurements taken in the clinic. Vital sign data collected from wearables can also predict several clinical laboratory measurements with lower prediction error than predictions made using clinically obtained vital sign measurements. The length of time over which vital signs are monitored and the proximity of the monitoring period to the date of prediction play a critical role in the performance of the machine learning models. These results demonstrate the value of commercial wearable devices for continuous and longitudinal assessment of physiological measurements that today can be measured only with clinical laboratory tests."
https://openalex.org/W3165328634,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While COVID-19 is often benign, a subset of patients develops severe multilobar pneumonia that can progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is no cure for severe COVID-19 and few treatments significantly improved clinical outcome. Dexamethasone and possibly aspirin, which directly/indirectly target the biosynthesis/effects of numerous lipid mediators are among those options. Our objective was to define if severe COVID-19 patients were characterized by increased bioactive lipids modulating lung inflammation. A targeted lipidomic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) by tandem mass spectrometry was done on 25 healthy controls and 33 COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. BALs from severe COVID-19 patients were characterized by increased fatty acids and inflammatory lipid mediators. There was a predominance of thromboxane and prostaglandins. Leukotrienes were also increased, notably LTB4, LTE4, and eoxin E4. Monohydroxylated 15-lipoxygenase metabolites derived from linoleate, arachidonate, eicosapentaenoate, and docosahexaenoate were also increased. Finally yet importantly, specialized pro-resolving mediators, notably lipoxin A4 and the D-series resolvins, were also increased, underscoring that the lipid mediator storm occurring in severe COVID-19 involves pro- and anti-inflammatory lipids. Our data unmask the lipid mediator storm occurring in the lungs of patients afflicted with severe COVID-19. We discuss which clinically available drugs could be helpful at modulating the lipidome we observed in the hope of minimizing the deleterious effects of pro-inflammatory lipids and enhancing the effects of anti-inflammatory and/or pro-resolving lipid mediators."

Factors associated with willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated using an ordered logistic regression as well as a Random Forest classification algorithm.Among 9,106 study participants, 81.3% (n = 7402) responded and had available demographic data. The majority (91.3%) reported a willingness to be vaccinated. Factors most strongly associated with vaccine willingness were beliefs about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general. Women and Black or African American respondents reported lower willingness to vaccinate. Among those less willing to get vaccinated, 66.2% said that they would talk with their health provider before making a decision. During the study, positive results from the first COVID-19 vaccine outcome study were released; vaccine willingness increased after this report.Even among older adults at high-risk for COVID-19 complications who are participating in a longitudinal clinical study, 1 in 11 reported lack of willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine in November 2020. Variability in vaccine willingness by gender, race, education, and income suggests the potential for uneven vaccine uptake. Education by health providers directed toward assuaging concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy can help improve vaccine acceptance among those less willing.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04276441."
https://openalex.org/W3165323072,"Viral proteins are known to be methylated by host protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) necessary for the viral life cycle, but it remains unknown whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins are methylated. Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG motifs, preferred PRMT target sequences. We confirmed arginine methylation of N protein by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated from cell culture. Type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95 or R177 with lysine inhibited interaction of N protein with the 5’-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, a property required for viral packaging. We also defined the N protein interactome in HEK293 cells, which identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates, including the known interacting protein G3BP1 as well as other components of stress granules (SGs), which are part of the host antiviral response. Methylation of R95 regulated the ability of N protein to suppress the formation of SGs, as R95K substitution or MS023 treatment blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the coexpression of methylarginine reader Tudor domain-containing protein 3 quenched N protein–mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, pretreatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Because type I PRMT inhibitors are already undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment, inhibiting arginine methylation to target the later stages of the viral life cycle such as viral genome packaging and assembly of virions may represent an additional therapeutic application of these drugs.

The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae of genus Betacoronavirus and has a positive-sense strand RNA genome of ∼30 kb (1Kim D.

It contains two large overlapping ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) and encodes four structural proteins, namely spike (S), envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins as well as nine accessory proteins (1Kim D.

ORF1a and ORF1b are further processed to generate 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1–16). Among the viral proteins, N protein is the most abundant in the virions and is expressed at the highest levels in infected cells (2McBride R. van Zyl M. Fielding B.C. The coronavirus nucleocapsid is a multifunctional protein.Viruses. 2014; 6: 2991-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Thus, its abundance, essential roles during infection, and immunogenic nature make the SARS-CoV-2 N protein a valuable target for developing new strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic (3Ray M.

Besides phosphorylation, post-translational modifications that regulate N function are not known. We identify that SARS-CoV-2 N protein contains five undefined and uncharacterized RGG/RG motifs. RGG/RG motifs are prevalent in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and play key roles in mediating protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions (31Thandapani P. O'Connor T.R. Bailey T.L. Richard S.

The arginine residues located within the RGG/RG motifs are the preferred sites of methylation by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) (33Bedford M.T. Clarke S.G. Protein arginine methylation in mammals: Who, what, and why.Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are nine PRMTs (PRMT1–9) that are classified into three types based on the methyl marks they produce: NG-monomethylarginine, asymmetric NG, NG-dimethylarginine, and symmetric NG, N'G dimethylarginine (33Bedford M.T. Clarke S.G. Protein arginine methylation in mammals: Who, what, and why.Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar).

The regulation, functions and clinical relevance of arginine methylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 642-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar)). Arginine methylation is known to methylate host and viral proteins necessary for viral replication. For example, the arginine methylation of HIV Tat protein decreases its transactivation function (43Boulanger M.C. Liang C. Russell R.S. Lin R. Bedford M.T. Wainberg M.A. Richard S. Methylation of Tat by PRMT6 regulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gene expression.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The inhibition of PRMT5 prevents host heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) RGG/RG motif methylation and inhibits HIV-1 and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 internal ribosome entry sites function (44Barrera A.

Moreover, PRMT5 methylates hepatitis B virus core protein within its C-terminal arginine-rich domain to regulate its cellular localization (45Lubyova B. Hodek J. Zabransky A. Prouzova H. Hubalek M.

Arginine methylation of prototype foamy virus Gag in its glycine–arginine–rich box by PRMT1 regulates its nucleolar localization during replication (46Paris J. Tobaly-Tapiero J. Giron M.L.

The invariant arginine within the chromatin-binding motif regulates both nucleolar localization and chromatin binding of Foamy virus Gag.Retroviralogy. 2018; 15: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 N protein within its RGG/RG motifs to regulate the RNA-binding activity of the N protein toward its 5’-UTR genomic RNA. Moreover, arginine methylation modulates the role of N protein to inhibit SG formation. Our findings show for the first time that inhibition of type I PRMTs decreased SARS-CoV N methylation within virions and that arginine methylation is required for viral production. We noted that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein harbors two RGG (Fig. 1A) and three RG motifs like SARS-CoV, but unlike Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). As RGG/RG motifs are preferred sites of PRMT1, PRMT5, and PRMT6 (31Thandapani P. O'Connor T.R. Bailey T.L. Richard S. Defining the RGG/RG motif.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 613-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), we tested whether they could be methylated. We first expressed and purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein fragments (GST-N 1–150, GST-N 150–262, and GST-N 263–419, Fig. 1A) and performed in vitro arginine methylation assays. Both the N-terminal fragment (amino acid residues 1–150) and the central region (amino acid residues 150–262) were arginine-methylated by PRMT1 (Fig. 1B). By contrast, the N protein fragments were not methylated by PRMT5 or PRMT6 (Fig. 1, C and D). We then substituted arginines in the RGG/RG motifs to lysines to identify the methylated sites and maintain the charge. Mutation of arginine 68 (R68K) in the N-terminal fragment had no significant effect on arginine methylation, whereas mutation of arginine 95 (R95K) completely abolished PRMT1 methylation (Fig. 1E), suggesting that R95 was the methylated residue in the GST-N 1 to 150 fragment. Similarly, mutation analysis identified R177 as the methylated residue in the central fragment (Fig. 1F). Taken together, R95 and R177 within the RGG/RG motifs of the SARS-CoV-2 N were methylated in vitro by PRMT1. We then determined whether the SARS-CoV-2 N protein was methylated in cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing Flag-epitope N protein (Flag-N). The cells were lysed, and the N protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies and its methylation detected by Western blotting using the ASYM26 antibody, which specifically recognizes asymmetrically dimethylated arginine residues within RGG/RG motifs. Importantly, the asymmetrical dimethylarginine methylation of the Flag-N (N-me2) was significantly reduced by treatment of the cells with the type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 (Fig. 1G) and transfection with siPRMT1 (Fig. 1H). We next monitored patient data to identify modulation of PRMT1 expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of nasopharyngeal and bronchial samples from 19 clinically well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 patients and five healthy controls was performed (47Chua R.L. Lukassen S. Trump S. Hennig B.P. Wendisch D. Pott F. Debnath O. Thürmann L. Kurth F. Völker M.T. Kazmierski J. COVID-19 severity correlates with airway epithelium–immune cell interactions identified by single-cell analysis.Nature biotechnology. 2020; 38: 970-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Importantly, analysis of their data showed that PRMT1 was significantly upregulated in infected patients (Fig. S1). These data suggest PRMT1 may play a role during the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. We then performed MS analysis to identify SARS-CoV-2 N-interacting proteins in the absence or presence of MS023. Flag-tagged SARS-CoV-2 N protein was expressed in HEK293 cells and a pull-down performed using anti-Flag affinity resin. Co-purified cellular proteins were subsequently analyzed by affinity-purification (AP) LC-MS/MS. We identified 119 cellular proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 N protein (peptide count >2, fold change >2 between Flag-N and empty vector transfected, 0.1% false discovery rate, Fig. 2, A and B, Supplementary Dataset 1). Importantly, we identified several protein components of SGs such as G3BP1 and G3BP2 (Ras-GTPase–activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 and 2) (48Tourrière H. Chebli K. Zekri L.

https://openalex.org/W3164680687,"How regular physical activity is able to improve health remains poorly understood. The release of factors from skeletal muscle following exercise has been proposed as a possible mechanism mediating such systemic benefits. We describe a mechanism wherein skeletal muscle, in response to a hypertrophic stimulus induced by mechanical overload (MOV), released extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing muscle-specific miR-1 that were preferentially taken up by epidydimal white adipose tissue (eWAT). In eWAT, miR-1 promoted adrenergic signaling and lipolysis by targeting Tfap2α, a known repressor of Adrβ3 expression. Inhibiting EV release prevented the MOV-induced increase in eWAT miR-1 abundance and expression of lipolytic genes. Resistance exercise decreased skeletal muscle miR-1 expression with a concomitant increase in plasma EV miR-1 abundance, suggesting a similar mechanism may be operative in humans. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that skeletal muscle promotes metabolic adaptations in adipose tissue in response to MOV via EV-mediated delivery of miR-1."
https://openalex.org/W3165693406,"Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) accounts for one third of the annual deaths due to antimicrobial resistance1. Drug resistance-conferring mutations frequently cause fitness costs in bacteria2-5. Experimental work indicates that these drug resistance-related fitness costs might be mitigated by compensatory mutations6-10. However, the clinical relevance of compensatory evolution remains poorly understood. Here we show that, in the country of Georgia, during a 6-year nationwide study, 63% of MDR-TB was due to patient-to-patient transmission. Compensatory mutations and patient incarceration were independently associated with transmission. Furthermore, compensatory mutations were overrepresented among isolates from incarcerated individuals that also frequently spilled over into the non-incarcerated population. As a result, up to 31% of MDR-TB in Georgia was directly or indirectly linked to prisons. We conclude that prisons fuel the epidemic of MDR-TB in Georgia by acting as ecological drivers of fitness-compensated strains with high transmission potential."
https://openalex.org/W3165143088,"Aims of the study The novel coronavirus pandemic has affected emergency department consultations for surgical pathologies. The aim of our study was to compare the number of acute appendicitis cases and the proportion of complicated appendicitis before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We retrospectively analyzed all data collected from a multi-center database of patients presenting to the emergency department for acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 12 to June 6, 2020, and compared these data with those from the same periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The number of acute appendicitis cases, proportion of complicated appendicitis, and pre- and postoperative patient characteristics were evaluated. Results A total of 306 patients were included in this evaluation. Sixty-five patients presented during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (group A), and 241 patients in previous years (group B: 2017–2019). The number of consultations for acute appendicitis decreased by almost 20 percent during the pandemic compared with previous periods, with a significant increase in complicated appendicitis (52% in group A versus 20% in group B, p &lt; 0,001.). Comparing the two groups, significant differences were also noted in the duration of symptoms (symptoms &gt; 48h in 61% and 26%, p &lt; 0,001), the intervention time (77 vs 61 minutes, p = 0,002), length of hospital stay (hospitalization of &gt; 2 days in 63% and 32%, p &lt; 0.001) and duration of antibiotic treatment (antibiotics &gt; 3 days in 36% and 24% p = 0.001). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decreased number of consultations for acute appendicitis, with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis, most likely due to patient delay in consulting the emergency department at symptom onset. Patients and general practitioners should be aware of this problem to avoid a time delay from initial symptoms to consultation."
https://openalex.org/W3164138935,"Considering the importance of psychological variables on health-related processes, this study investigated the role of resilience and coping strategies in relation to health. The aim of this research was to explore the underlying association between these aspects for the better understanding of the effect of psychosocial variables on mental health in cancer. This information could lead to the design of adapted psychological interventions in cancer. Participants with different diagnosis of cancer were recruited (N = 170). They came from the Spanish Association Against Cancer of Biscay. Resilience was measured with the 10 items Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, coping with the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and mental health was measured as a global indicator through the SF-12 and the GHQ-12. A structural equation model (SEM) was conducted to test the effects between the constructs. Results showed that resilience and coping were significantly associated. Results reflected an absence of significant correlation between adaptive and disadaptive coping strategies. Resilience was the factor that most correlated with health outcomes (β = -.45, p < .001). However, disadaptive coping strategies did not correlate with resilience or mental health indicators. Findings in this study underscore the positive contribution of high levels of resilience and an adaptive coping on participants´ level of health. Disadaptive coping strategies did not reflect any positive relation with resilience or health indicators. Thus, promoting resilience and adaptive coping could be a significant goal for psychosocial and educational interventions in people with cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3165120403,"Background Research on children and youth on the autism spectrum reveal racial and ethnic disparities in access to healthcare and utilization, but there is less research to understand how disparities persist as autistic adults age. We need to understand racial-ethnic inequities in obtaining eligibility for Medicare and/or Medicaid coverage, as well as inequities in spending for autistic enrollees under these public programs. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of U.S. publicly-insured adults on the autism spectrum using 2012 Medicare-Medicaid Linked Enrollee Analytic Data Source ( n = 172,071). We evaluated differences in race-ethnicity by eligibility (Medicare-only, Medicaid-only, Dual-Eligible) and spending. Findings The majority of white adults (49.87%) were full-dual eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. In contrast, only 37.53% of Black, 34.65% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 35.94% of Hispanic beneficiaries were full-dual eligible for Medicare and Medicare, with most only eligible for state-funded Medicaid. Adjusted logistic models controlling for gender, intellectual disability status, costly chronic condition, rural status, county median income, and geographic region of residence revealed that Black beneficiaries were significantly less likely than white beneficiaries to be dual-eligible across all ages. Across these three beneficiary types, total spending exceeded $10 billion. Annual total expenditures median expenditures for full-dual and Medicaid-only eligible beneficiaries were higher among white beneficiaries as compared with Black beneficiaries. Conclusions Public health insurance in the U.S. including Medicare and Medicaid aim to reduce inequities in access to healthcare that might exist due to disability, income, or old age. In contrast to these ideals, our study reveals that racial-ethnic minority autistic adults who were eligible for public insurance across all U.S. states in 2012 experience disparities in eligibility for specific programs and spending. We call for further evaluation of system supports that promote clear pathways to disability and public health insurance among those with lifelong developmental disabilities."

Pro-Hyp promotes differentiation/maturation of tendon cells with modulation of lineage-specific factors and induces significant chemotactic activity in vitro. In addition, Pro-Hyp has profound effects on cell proliferation, with significantly upregulated extracellular signal–regulated kinase phosphorylation and extracellular matrix production and increased type I collagen network organization. Using proteomics, we have predicted molecular transport, cellular assembly and organization, and cellular movement as potential linked-network pathways that could be altered in response to Pro-Hyp. Mechanistically, cells treated with Pro-Hyp demonstrate increased directional persistence and significantly increased directed motility and migration velocity. They are accompanied by elongated lamellipodial protrusions with increased levels of active β1-integrin–containing focal contacts, as well as reorganization of thicker peripheral F-actin fibrils.

We have recently demonstrated that tendon progenitor cells but not residential tenocytes play a central role in the repair following adult tendon injury (20Sakabe T. Sakai K. Maeda T. Sunaga A.

Scleraxis (SCX) is a basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor that has been identified as a highly specific marker for tendon and ligament cells (21Murchison N.D. Price B.A. Conner D.A. Keene D.R.

The tenogenic marker Scx and the chondrogenic marker SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9) are known to coordinately regulate the determination of cellular lineages during embryonic development (25Asou Y.

Adult tenocytes in tendon/ligaments with osteoarthritis acquire chondrogenic potential, showing downregulation of SCX and upregulation of SOX9 (20Sakabe T. Sakai K. Maeda T. Sunaga A. Furuta N.

Mohawk homeobox (MKX) and tenomodulin (TNMD) are also tenogenic markers during development. MKX is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of tendon-related genes such as Scx and type I collagen (27Anderson D.M. Arredondo J. Hahn K. Valente G. Martin J.F. Wilson-Rawls J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 10538-10542Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). TNMD is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is predominantly expressed in tendons and ligaments in the late stage of tendon development (30Docheva D. Hunziker E.B. Fassler R. Brandau O. Tenomodulin is necessary for tenocyte proliferation and tendon maturation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, no studies to date have identified a requirement for Hyp-containing peptides in tenogenic differentiation and tenocyte maturation. The major ECM component in tendon tissues is type I collagen (31O'Brien M. Structure and metabolism of tendons.Scand. J. Med. Sci. Sports. 1997; 7: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that there are at least two independent mechanisms underlying type I collagen fibril reorganization following adult tissue injury, a fibronectin-dependent mechanism and a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)/type V collagen–dependent mechanism (32Saneyasu T.

Integrins are ECM receptors composed of transmembrane αβ heterodimeric subunits that mediate the organization of ECM, focal contacts, and actin-containing cytoskeleton (34Hynes R.O.

Integrins: Bidirectional, allosteric signaling machines.Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6687) Google Scholar). A knowledge of complex integrin-mediated “outside-in” and “inside-out” signal transduction is crucial to our understanding of how integrin is associated with extracellular ligands and/or intracellular effector molecules and consequently regulates cellular behavior (36Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Integrin signaling.Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3757) Google Scholar, 37Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Networks and crosstalk: Integrin signalling spreads.Nat.

Cell migration is a dynamic process that is important for a variety of biological processes, including embryonic development, tissue repair, immune response, and tumor invasion (39Lauffenburger D.A.

Integrin engagement has a significant impact in migrating cells (41DeMali K.A. Wennerberg K. Burridge K. Integrin signaling to the actin cytoskeleton.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 42Hall A. Rho GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton.Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar): it is associated with the extension of lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions at the leading edge, where newly polymerizing actin fibers and activated but unligated integrins are clustered (43Galbraith C.G. Yamada K.M. Galbraith J.A. Polymerizing actin fibers position integrins primed to probe for adhesion sites.Science. 2007; 315: 992-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Growing evidence reveals that the persistence of lamellipodia is a critical factor in steering cell migration and regulating cell directionality (44Krause M. Gautreau A. Steering cell migration: Lamellipodium dynamics and the regulation of directional persistence.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The directionality of cell migration is defined as the displacement divided by the total path length of the cell; thus, if the cell is migrating more randomly, the cell directionality decreases and vice versa (45Petrie R.J. Doyle A.D. Yamada K.M. Random versus directionally persistent cell migration.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 538-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). It remains to be elucidated how Hyp-containing peptides alter tendon cell phenotypes in vitro, and the precise underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized that Hyp-containing peptides have functional roles in improving cellular homeostasis in tendon cells. We recently established adult tenocyte and tendon progenitor cell lines from mouse Achilles tendon tissues that express the scx promoter-driven GFP as a marker, in which the expression of Scx promoter–driven GFP (SCXGFP) is observed when the cells differentiate into mature tenocytes (20Sakabe T. Sakai K. Maeda T. Sunaga A. Furuta N. Schweitzer R. Sasaki T. Sakai T. Transcription factor scleraxis vitally contributes to progenitor lineage direction in wound healing of adult tendon in mice.J.

The phenotypic contribution of Hyp-containing peptides to tendon cells has not yet been studied. Micro-to-millimolar concentrations of collagen-derived peptides induce chemotactic activity in a variety of cell types in vitro (47Postlethwaite A.E. Kang A.H. Collagen-and collagen peptide-induced chemotaxis of human blood monocytes.J. Exp. Med. 1976; 143: 1299-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 48Postlethwaite A.E. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H.

Taguchi Y. Morimatsu F. Sato K. Nakamura Y. Higashi A. Kido Y. Nakabo Y. Ohtsuki K. Identification of food-derived collagen peptides in human blood after oral ingestion of gelatin hydrolysates.J.

Highly accurate quantification of hydroxyproline-containing peptides in blood using a protease digest of stable isotope-labeled collagen.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2014; 62: 12096-12102Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To study the cell response to Hyp-containing peptides, cells were initially cultured with four different Hyp-containing peptides at micromolar concentrations (Ala–Hyp–Gly, Leu–Hyp–Gly, Hyp–Gly, and Pro-Hyp; 80 μg/ml [289–462 μM]) in medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS). Among the peptides examined, Pro-Hyp showed the greatest activity in adult tenocytes and tendon progenitor cells at day 3, which was accompanied by significant upregulation of type I collagen and fibronectin mRNA levels (Fig. S1, A and B). mRNA of the tendon-specific transcription factor Scx was also significantly upregulated at day 6 (Fig. S1B). Next, to explore the cell response to Hyp-containing peptides, the dose response to Pro-Hyp peptide was studied focusing on micromolar concentrations (0.1–500 μg/ml [0.5–2200 μM]). We found that higher concentrations, 200 and 500 μg/ml, showed more effective cell proliferation activity in both tenocytes and tendon progenitor cells (Fig. 1A). More specifically, Pro-Hyp significantly upregulated cell proliferation activity in both cell types in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Treatment of cells with the same concentration of l-Pro or l-Hyp did not produce any changes (data not shown). These results indicate that Pro-Hyp is the most active peptide in tendon cells. Hereafter, we focused on cellular phenotypes induced by 200 and 500 μg/ml of Pro-Hyp. The important unsolved questions are whether Pro-Hyp is directly associated with specific receptors and activates subsequent intracellular signaling cascades, or carrier-mediated intracellular uptake of Pro-Hyp occurs, which results in the activation of inside-out signaling cascades. To study the potential for Pro-Hyp uptake into adult mouse tenocytes, a time-course assay was carried out using a stable isotopically labeled Pro-Hyp, 13C515N1-Pro-Hyp (SI-Pro-Hyp). SI-Pro-Hyp uptake into adult mouse tenocytes exhibited transporter-mediated uptake kinetics with a linear phase of uptake (about 30 min) (Fig. 2A). Importantly, this uptake was significantly decreased at 4 °C (Fig. 2B). To further investigate this process, a kinetic analysis was performed at 37 °C in the linear phase of uptake at a fixed 30-min time point with increasing Pro-Hyp concentrations ranging from 200 to 30,000 μg/ml. However, saturation was not observed up to 30,000 μg/ml Pro-Hyp, and Pro-Hyp uptake did not follow Michaelis−Menten kinetics (data not shown). Glycylsarcosine, a typical substrate for peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) (51Liu Z. Wang C. Liu Q. Meng Q. Cang J. Mei L. Kaku T. Liu K. Uptake, transport and regulation of JBP485 by PEPT1 in vitro and in vivo.Peptides. 2011; 32: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), did not inhibit Pro-Hyp uptake in adult tenocytes (data not shown), indicating that the uptake of Pro-Hyp is not mediated by PEPT1. Recently, a series of studies on cell-penetrating peptides have revealed that these peptides are incorporated into cells via various nonselective pathways such as endocytosis and direct translocation pathways (52Gallo M. Defaus S. Andreu D. 1988-2018: Thirty years of drug smuggling at the nano scale. Challenges and opportunities of cell-penetrating peptides in biomedical research.Arch. Biochem.

Peneva K.J.B. Cell-penetrating peptides for nanomedicine–how to choose the right peptide.BioNanoMaterials. 2015; 16: 59-72Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To study further the localization of internalized Pro-Hyp in adult tenocytes, subcellular localization analysis was carried out using SI-Pro-Hyp immediately after uptake. Interestingly, 75.5% of total SI-Pro-Hyp incorporated into cells was localized in the cytosolic fraction, 16.4% in the membranes, 5.8% in the cytoskeleton, and 2.3% in the nucleus (Fig. 2C) at 60 min after Pro-Hyp treatment, suggesting that tenocytes internalize Pro-Hyp through multiple pathways, including transporters and nonselective pathways. We next explored the extent of the contribution of Pro-Hyp to differentiation and maturation in adult tenocytes and tendon progenitor cells. At day 6, mRNA of the tenogenic marker Scx was significantly upregulated (up to ∼4.0-fold increase compared with untreated control), whereas mRNA of the chondrogenic marker Sox9 was significantly downregulated (∼0.3-fold compared with untreated control) in both tenocytes and tendon progenitor cells. Thereafter, Scx mRNA levels were markedly downregulated by day 11 (Fig. 3A). The mRNA levels of another tenogenic marker, mohawk, and of the tendon maturation marker, tenomodulin (55Huang A.H. Lu H.H. Schweitzer R. Molecular regulation of tendon cell fate during development.J. Orthop. Res. 2015; 33: 800-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), were upregulated (up to ∼40-fold increase compared with untreated control) at a later stage (day 11) in both tenocytes and tendon progenitor cells (Fig. 3A). The expression levels of type II collagen and aggrecan mRNA in both cell types were undetectable even after treatment with Pro-Hyp (data not shown). The protein expression of SCXGFP (20Sakabe T.

From day 4 after treatment of adult tenocytes with Pro-Hyp, SCXGFP became visible, suggesting promotion to more mature tenocytes (Fig. 3B). Although there was only weak induction, SCXGFP had also become visible in tendon progenitor cells by day 10, confirming promotion to tendon-lineage differentiation by Pro-Hyp (Fig. 3B). SCXGFP was not induced in untreated cells used as negative controls (Fig. 3B). SCX is known to directly regulate the Col1a1 and Col1a2 genes in tendon cells (24Lejard V. Brideau G. Blais F. Salingcarnboriboon R. Wagner G. Roehrl M.H. Noda M. Duprez D. Houillier P. Rossert J. Scleraxis and NFATc regulate the expression of the pro-alpha1(I) collagen gene in tendon fibroblasts.J. Biol.

Since Scx is upregulated in response to Pro-Hyp dipeptide, the functional link between Pro-Hyp and ECM production was addressed.

https://openalex.org/W3164692556,"The present study is the first comprehensive report on diversity, population structure, genetic admixture and mitochondrial DNA variation in South Indian draught type zebu cattle. The diversity of South Indian cattle was moderately high. A significantly strong negative correlation coefficient of -0.674 (P<0.05) was observed between the effective population size of different breeds and their estimated FIS. The genetic structure analysis revealed the distinctness of Kangayam, Vechur and Punganur cattle from the rest of the zebu breeds. The results showed the influence of Hallikar breed in the development of most Mysore type cattle breeds of South India with the exception of Kangayam. Bayesian clustering analysis was performed to assess the taurine admixture in South Indian zebu cattle using purebred Jersey and Holstein-Friesian as reference genotypes. Relatively high levels of taurine admixture (>6.25%) was observed in Punganur, Vechur, Umblachery and Pulikulam cattle breeds. Two major maternal haplogroups, I1 and I2, typical of zebu cattle were observed, with the former being predominant than the later. The pairwise differences among the I2 haplotypes of South Indian cattle were relatively higher than West Indian (Indus valley site) zebu cattle. The results indicated the need for additional sampling and comprehensive analysis of mtDNA control region variations to unravel the probable location of origin and domestication of I2 zebu lineage. The present study also revealed major concerns on South Indian zebu cattle (i) risk of endangerment due to small effective population size and high rate of inbreeding (ii) lack of sufficient purebred zebu bulls for breeding and (iii) increasing level of taurine admixture in zebu cattle. Availability of purebred semen for artificial insemination, incorporation of genomic/molecular information to identify purebred animals and increased awareness among farmers will help to maintain breed purity, conserve and improve these important draught cattle germplasms of South India."
https://openalex.org/W3165164963,"Pregnancy rates for in vitro produced (IVP) embryos are usually lower than for embryos produced in vivo after ovarian superovulation (MOET). This is potentially due to alterations in their trophectoderm (TE), the outermost layer in physical contact with the maternal endometrium. The main objective was to apply a multi-omics data integration approach to identify both temporally differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes (DEG and DMG), between IVP and MOET embryos, that could impact TE function. To start, four and five published transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets, respectively, were processed for data integration. Second, DEG from day 7 to days 13 and 16 and DMG from day 7 to day 17 were determined in the TE from IVP vs. MOET embryos. Third, genes that were both DE and DM were subjected to hierarchical clustering and functional enrichment analysis. Finally, findings were validated through a machine learning approach with two additional datasets from day 15 embryos. There were 1535 DEG and 6360 DMG, with 490 overlapped genes, whose expression profiles at days 13 and 16 resulted in three main clusters. Cluster 1 (188) and Cluster 2 (191) genes were down-regulated at day 13 or day 16, respectively, while Cluster 3 genes (111) were up-regulated at both days, in IVP embryos compared to MOET embryos. The top enriched terms were the KEGG pathway ""focal adhesion"" in Cluster 1 (FDR = 0.003), and the cellular component: ""extracellular exosome"" in Cluster 2 (FDR<0.0001), also enriched in Cluster 1 (FDR = 0.04). According to the machine learning approach, genes in Cluster 1 showed a similar expression pattern between IVP and less developed (short) MOET conceptuses; and between MOET and DKK1-treated (advanced) IVP conceptuses. In conclusion, these results suggest that early conceptuses derived from IVP embryos exhibit epigenomic and transcriptomic changes that later affect its elongation and focal adhesion, impairing post-transfer survival."
https://openalex.org/W3165736499,"Sufficient samples of extreme precipitation events are needed in order to obtain reliable estimates of the probability of their occurrence. Here, we use a large ensemble simulation with 50 members from the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario to give future projection of the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events under different warming levels relative to the current climate over China. A bias-correction method based on quantile mapping is first used to remove systematic biases in the ensemble. The return value and return period are obtained by fitting enough annual maximum precipitation samples with the generalized extreme value to represent the intensity and frequency of extreme events, respectively. The results show that the average intensity of extreme precipitation in China will increase by nearly 8% per 1°C of global warming, which closely follows the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. Rarer extreme events will experience greater changes in frequency, especially under higher warming. The nationally averaged extreme precipitation events, presently expected to occur every 50 years (100 years) under the current climate conditions, are expected to occur approximately every 41 years (82 years), 32 years (62 years), 22 years (42 years) and 15 years (29 years) under warming levels of 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0°C, respectively. Northwestern China (NW), southwestern China (SW) and the Yangtze River valley (YZ) exhibit the greatest increase in probability ratio (PR) under future climate condition. The risk of extreme precipitation events, currently expected to occur once every 50 years, will be nearly 11 (21) times more likely to occur under a climate warming by 3.0°C (4.0°C). Limiting warming to 1.5°C will help avoid approximately 40%-50%, 70%-80% and over 90% of the increase in the risk of extreme events in almost all subregions if the global mean surface temperature (GMST) continues warming to 2.0°C, 3.0°C and 4.0°C, respectively. Our study provides a useful information for the understanding the impact of climate change on the future risk of extreme events over China."

Depleting cellular cholesterol impedes this process and results in viral particles with reduced viability. Viperin (Virus Inhibitory Protein, Endoplasmic Reticulum-associated, Interferon iNducible) is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane–associated enzyme that exerts broad-ranging antiviral effects, including inhibiting the budding of some enveloped viruses. However, the relationship between viperin expression and the retarded budding of virus particles from lipid rafts on the cell membrane is unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of viperin expression on cholesterol biosynthesis using transiently expressed genes in the human cell line human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T). We found that viperin expression reduces cholesterol levels by 20% to 30% in these cells. Following this observation, a proteomic screen of the viperin interactome identified several cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes among the top hits, including lanosterol synthase (LS) and squalene monooxygenase (SM), which are enzymes that catalyze key steps in establishing the sterol carbon skeleton. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that viperin, LS, and SM form a complex at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. While coexpression of viperin was found to significantly inhibit the specific activity of LS in HEK293T cell lysates, coexpression of viperin had no effect on the specific activity of SM, although did reduce SM protein levels by approximately 30%. Despite these inhibitory effects, the coexpression of neither LS nor SM was able to reverse the viperin-induced depletion of cellular cholesterol levels, possibly because viperin is highly expressed in transfected HEK293T cells.

Cholesterol biosynthesis occurs on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), primarily in the liver and intestines (2Cerqueira N.M.F.S.A. Oliveira E.F. Gesto D.S. Santos-Martins D.

Ehehalt R. Cholesterol, lipid rafts, and disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Notably, various enveloped viruses require cholesterol-rich lipid rafts to bud from the cell, thereby completing the viral replication cycle to produce infectious viruses (13Simons K. Ehehalt R.

Viperin, a key player in the antiviral response.Microbes Infect. 2012; 14: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As part of the innate immune response, the first line of defense against infection, production of interferons (IFNs) promotes the upregulation of a wide range of genes to combat infection (20Duschene K.S.

In humans, viperin is a ∼42 kDa and 361-residue amino acid, ER-associated protein that, interestingly, is one of only eight radical-SAM enzymes identified in the human genome. The enzyme comprises three domains: an N-terminal amphipathic helix responsible for localizing the enzyme to the ER membrane, a conserved radical-SAM domain containing a canonical Fe4–S4 cluster-binding motif (CxxxCxxC), and a C-terminal domain, largely responsible for binding the substrate (Fig. 1) (23Shaveta G.

There is also evidence for the benefits of various training modalities on cognition and functional ability in older adults. The aim of this study was to compare effects of a 12-week active video gaming intervention (X Box Kinect Sports) to conventional multimodal supervised exercise on fitness, functional ability and cognitive performance in older adults with memory complaints.Participants (n = 45, 72±5 yrs.) were recruited from 6 retirement homes and cluster-randomized into the Interactive Video Gaming (IVG) group (N = 23) or Conventional Multimodal (CM) group (N = 22), meeting 2 x 1 hour sessions, weekly for 12 weeks. Pre-post measures included: 6 min walk, timed up and go, dynamic balance, functional reach, Mini-Mental State Examination, N-back Task and the Modified Stroop task.The IVG group demonstrated significant improvement in the total number correct responses on the Stroop task (P = 0.028) and for average reaction time of correct colour-words (P = 0.024), compared to the CM group. Functional ability improved significantly in the IVG group, including the 6-min walk (P = 0.017), dynamic balance (P = 0.03), timed up and go (P<0.001) and functional reach (P<0.0010).An active interactive video gaming intervention was more effective than conventional multimodal exercise in improving executive and global cognitive performance and functional capacity in older adults with subjective memory complaints.Pan African Clinical Trial Registry-PACTR202008547335106."
https://openalex.org/W3165689341,"The fungal cyclohexadepsipeptides destruxins (DTXs), isaridins (ISDs), and isariins (ISRs) are nonribosomal peptides whose structures include a 19-membered ring composed of five amino acid residues and one α- or β-hydroxy acid residue. These cyclohexadepsipeptides contain unusual nonproteinogenic amino acid-building blocks and possess a range of antiviral, antibacterial, and other activities. The biosynthetic gene clusters for ISDs and ISRs have not been identified, and the biosynthesis of the nonproteinogenic (3S)-methyl-l-proline residue, which is found in DTXs, ISDs, and many other natural products, lacks full characterization. In an ongoing effort to identify compounds that can inhibit the Zika virus (ZIKV), we examined the extract of marine-derived fungus Beauveria felina SX-6-22 and discovered 30 DTXs, ISDs, and ISRs (1-30) including seven new compounds (1-7). The anti-ZIKV assays showed that 9-12 and 16-18 possess inhibitory activities against ZIKV RNA replication and NS5 (nonstructural protein 5) production in ZIKV-infected A549 cells. We sequenced the genome of B. felina SX-6-22 and identified three biosynthetic gene clusters detx, isd and isr, which are responsible for the biosynthesis of DTXs, ISDs, and ISRs, respectively. Comparative analyses of the three gene clusters clarified the biosynthetic relationships among these cyclohexadepsipeptides. Finally, we characterized the entire biosynthesis of nonproteinogenic building block (3S)-methyl-l-proline. The Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductases (P5CRs), also used in the biosynthesis of l-proline, were demonstrated to catalyze the final reduction step in (3S)-methyl-l-proline formation, suggesting potential cross talk between primary and secondary metabolisms. These results provide opportunities for biosynthetic pathway engineering to generate new anti-ZIKV cyclohexadepsipeptides."
https://openalex.org/W3164637514,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is commonly encountered and causes high mortality in hospitalized patients; however, effective therapies for AKI have still not been established. Accordingly, we performed a rodent model with acute renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) and tested the hypothesis that combined tacrolimus and melatonin therapy could be superior to either one for protecting the kidney against IR injury. Adult-male SD rat (n = 30) were equally categorized into group 1 (receiving laparotomy only), group 2 (IR treated by 3.0 cc/normal-saline), group 3 [IR + tacrolimus/0.5 mg/kg by intravenous administration at 30 minutes and at days 1/2/3 after IR], group 4 (IR + melatonin/50 mg/kg by intra-peritoneal administration at 30 minutes and 25 mg/kg at days 1/2/3 after IR] and group 5 (IR + tacrolimus +melatonin). By day 3 after IR, the creatinine/BUN levels and ratio of urine protein to urine creatinine were highest in group 2, lowest in group 1 and significantly lower in group 5 than in groups 3/4 (all P < .0001), but they did not differ between the groups 3/4. The protein expressions of oxidative-stress (p47phox/NOX-1/NOX-2/NOX-4), upstream (TLR4/MAL/MyD88/TRAF6/ASK1/MKK4/MKK7/NF-κB) and downstream (IL-6/INF-γ/MMP-9/IL-1ß) inflammatory signaling, MAPK-family-signaling cascades(ERK1/2, JNK/p38/c-JUN), apoptotic/autophagic (p53/caspase 3/mitochondrial-Bax, ratio of LC3B-II/LC3B-I), and mitochondrial-damaged (cyclophilin D/cytochrome C/DRP1) biomarkers, and the expressions of inflammatory-immune cells (F4/80, CD14/CD3/CD8) as well as the kidney injured score exhibited an identical pattern of creatinine level (all P < .0001).

https://openalex.org/W3164833797,"Accidental exposure to ionizing radiation may lead to delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) in many organ systems. Activated protein C (APC) is a known mitigator of the acute radiation syndrome. To examine the role of APC in DEARE, we used a transgenic mouse model with 2- to 3-fold increased plasma levels of APC (high in APC, APCHi). Male and female APCHi mice and wild-type littermates were exposed to 9.5 Gy γ-rays with their hind-legs (bone marrow) shielded from radiation to allow long-term survival. At 3 and 6 months after irradiation, cardiac function was measured with ultrasonography. At 3 months, radiation increased cardiac dimensions in APCHi males, while decreases were seen in wild-type females. At this early time point, APCHi mice of both sexes were more susceptible to radiation-induced changes in systolic function compared to wild-types. At 6 months, a decrease in systolic function was mainly seen in male mice of both genotypes. At 6 months, specimens of heart, small intestine and dorsal skin were collected for tissue analysis. Female APCHi mice showed the most severe radiation-induced deposition of cardiac collagens but were protected against a radiation-induced loss of microvascular density. Both male and female APCHi mice were protected against a radiation induced upregulation of toll-like receptor 4 in the heart, but this did not translate into a clear protection against immune cell infiltration. In the small intestine, the APCHi genotype had no effect on an increase in the number of myeloperoxidase positive cells (seen mostly in females) or an increase in the expression of T-cell marker CD2 (males). Lastly, both male and female APCHi mice were protected against radiation-induced epidermal thickening and increase in 3-nitrotyrosine positive keratinocytes. In conclusion, prolonged high levels of APC in a transgenic mouse model had little effects on indicators of DEARE in the heart, small intestine and skin, with some differential effects in male compared to female mice."

With government subsidy and CSR being threshold variables, the internal mechanism about the influence of government subsidy and CSR on brand value was explored. Results show that the following. (1) CSR has a significantly inverted U-type threshold effect on brand value. (2) Government subsidy facilitates CSR with diminishing marginal utility. (3) When a difference exists in the strength of government subsidy, the influence of CSR on brand value presents a significant N-type law. Furthermore, threshold regression method was used to innovatively explore the complex nonlinear relationship among government subsidy, CSR, and brand value. This relationship has a significantly practical significance for listed firms for weighing the business decisions regarding the input of CSR and brand value, as well as subsidy policies for enterprises by the government."
https://openalex.org/W3165206866,"Accurate prediction of aerobic capacity is necessary to guide appropriate exercise prescription. It is common to use 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) to predict peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) in the clinical environment. The aim of this study was to determine whether prediction of VO2peak can be improved by the inclusion of cardiovascular indices derived by impedance cardiography (ICG) during the 6MWT. A total of 62 healthy university students aged 21±1 years completed in separate days, a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and two 6MWTs (30 min apart), during which heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) were measured by ICG (PhysioFlow® PF07 EnduroTM). The CPET was conducted with the Ergoselect 200 Ergoline and oxygen consumption measured by a MasterScreenTM CPX breath-by-breath metabolic cart. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to generate VO2peak prediction equations using 6MWD with, or without the cardiovascular indices recorded at the end of the best performed 6MWT as predictor variables. The mean peak HR (bpm), SV (ml) and CO (L/min) recorded during 6MWT were 156±18, 95.6±9, 15±2.8 and during CPET were 176±16, 91.3±8, 16.2±2.7, respectively. Analyses revealed the following VO2peak prediction equation: VO2peak = 100.297+(0.019x6MWD)+(-0.598xHR6MWT)+(-1.236xSV6MWT) + (8.671 x CO6MWT). This equation has a squared multiple correlation (R2) of 0.866, standard error of the estimate (SEE) of 2.28 mL/kg/min and SEE:VO2peak (SEE%) of 7.2%. Cross-validation of equation stability using predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS) statistics showed a R2 (Rp2), SEE (SEEp) and SEEp% of 0.842, 2.38 mL/kg/min and 7.6% respectively. The minimal shrinkage of R2 implied regression model stability. Correlation between measured and predicted VO2peak using this equation was strong (r = 0.931, p<0.001). When 6MWD alone was used as the predictor for VO2peak, the generated equation had a lower R2 (0.549), and a higher SEE (4.08 mL/kg/min) and SEE% (12.9%). This is the first study which included cardiac indices during a 6MWT as variables for VO2peak prediction. Our results suggest that inclusion of cardiac indices measured during the 6MWT more accurately predicts VO2peak than using 6MWD data alone."

The hallmark of CYTH enzymes is an N-terminal ExExK motif that is involved in metal ion coordination and substrate binding (3Martinez J. Truffault V. Hothorn X.M.

Chem. 2015; 290: 23348-23360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The opposing acidic and basic patches shape the substrate binding tunnel. Although the overall coordination of the triphosphate itself is very similar among CYTH enzymes, the directionality of asymmetric organic substrates such as triphosphate nucleotides or thiamine triphosphate within the tunnel determines catalytic specificity (3Martinez J.

For triphosphatases and ThTPases, the organic moiety points toward a C-terminal helix, termed plug helix (3Martinez J. Truffault V. Hothorn X.M.

Acta. 2013; 1830: 4513-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Such enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of the triphosphate by a two-metal ion mechanism using metal one to establish the catalytically competent binding of the triphosphate moiety and metal two to position and activate a water for nucleophilic attack onto the γ-phosphate moiety (3Martinez J.

Accordingly, triphosphatases generate pyrophosphate and an orthophosphate by hydrolysis of the β–γ phosphoanhydride bond. The situation for AC-IV enzymes in the CYTH superfamily is different. Here, the directionality of the organic moiety binding within the tunnel fold is inverted causing a reversed placement of the α- and γ-phosphates within the binding tunnel (7Gallagher D.T. Kim S.K.

The founding members of the CYTH superfamily are involved either in mammalian thiamine triphosphate metabolism or bacterial signal transduction via 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotides. Some members of the CYTH superfamily are parts of multidomain proteins by being fused to HD hydrolase, exopolyphosphatase, nucleotidyl kinase, or CHAD domains (1Iyer L.M. Aravind L. The catalytic domains of thiamine triphosphatase and CyaB-like adenylyl cyclase define a novel superfamily of domains that bind organic phosphates.BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It was postulated that CYTH orthologs play a central role at the interface between nucleotide and phosphate metabolism (1Iyer L.M. Aravind L.

Archaeal representatives encode at least one copy of a CYTH ortholog in their genomes, which are generally annotated as adenylyl cyclases. 3′,5′-Cyclic AMP has been described for only a few archaeal species with a role in starvation and cell cycle (12Baumann A. Lange C. Soppa J. Transcriptome changes and cAMP oscillations in an archaeal cell cycle.BMC Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Leichtling B.H. Rickenberg H.V.

In a search for a potential nucleotidyl cyclase in the crenarchaeote Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, we identified Saci_0718, a member of the CYTH superfamily and annotated as CyaB-like class IV adenylyl cyclase. Although the substrate binding mode and the hydrolysis mechanisms differ between triphosphatases and CyaB (3Martinez J. Truffault V. Hothorn X.M. Structural determinants for substrate binding and catalysis in triphosphate tunnel metalloenzymes.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 23348-23360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), at the sequence level, Saci_0718 shares ∼29% identity with the Yersinia pestis cyclase CyaB and with the inorganic triphosphatase from Clostridium thermocellum. Here, we have performed a structure–function analysis of Saci_0718 and designated it as SaTTM due to its triphosphatase activity. Its structures in apo and substrate-bound (triphosphate and ATP) states revealed transition between open and closed states during catalysis. Trapping of the Michaelis complex in its calcium-inhibited state confirmed a two-metal ion mechanism for SaTTM. Furthermore, this archaeal TTM is subject to feedback inhibition by its reaction product pyrophosphate. Our comparative structural and bioinformatic analysis of CYTH allowed us to identify molecular determinants, which clearly discriminate the adenylyl cyclase from the different phosphatase activities. This provides now an improved rationale for correct functional annotation within the broad CYTH domain family. To date, the CYTH-like domain superfamily (IPR033469) comprises 41,000 enzymes from all three domains of life divided into two subfamilies, the smaller mRNA triphosphatase Cet1-like(IPR004206) and the bigger subfamily of CYTH domain proteins (IPR023577) including adenylyl cyclases, ThTPases, and inorganic tri- or polyphosphatases (also known as triphosphatase tunnel metalloenzymes or TTMs). The discrimination between Cet1-like and CYTH enzymes is also consistent within the Pfam database (mRNA_triPase: PF02940 and CYTH: PF01928). Hence, we aimed to obtain a detailed understanding of the CYTH family by combining biochemical analysis combined with structural snapshots of the catalytic mechanism, as the functional annotations of CYTH enzymes are still vague and misleading among TTMs and adenylyl cyclases. To ensure unambiguous assignment, we chose the Pfam family CYTH (PF01928) as the least common denominator for our analysis. As stated above, this protein family contains enzymes with known functions as TTMs, AC-IVs, and ThTPases. We therefore performed a systematic sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis of the CYTH superfamily PF01928 using EFI-EST (14Gerlt J.A. Bouvier J.T. Davidson D.B. Imker H.J. Sadkhin B. Slater D.R.

Acta. 2015; 1854: 1019-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The network generated with an E-value of 10−20 against the CYTH-domain boundaries for 38,246 sequences clustered to 4128 nodes with pairwise sequence identities of >40% within the nodes, which are connected by a total of 121,791 edges. This SSN analysis covering all members of the CYTH enzymes of PF01928 showed 10 major distinct clusters (Fig. 1). Among these clusters, three of them (clusters 1, 4, and 7) comprise members adopting a multidomain architecture, while the length histograms for the remaining seven clusters are in the expected range of ∼160 to 200 amino acids for single-domain proteins (Fig. S7A). For example, cluster 1 contains YgiF from Escherichia coli, which possesses a two-domain architecture with an N-terminal CYTH and a C-terminal CHAD domain (PF05235) (3Martinez J. Truffault V.

Similar modular architectures including the CHAD domain can be found in cluster 4, which does not contain any structurally described homologs and whose members occur mostly in actinobacteria. The additional domain in cluster 7, whose members are exclusively found in Viridiplantae and Amoebozoa, is a phosphoribulokinase domain (PF00485). Of interest, the SSN analysis discriminates the cyaB-like class IV adenylyl cyclase (7Gallagher D.T. Kim S.K. Robinson H. Reddy P.T.

Structure and function of adenylyl cyclases, key enzymes in cellular signaling.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2020; 63: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Like AC-IV, the ThTPases form a separate cluster, cluster 8, that is distinct from other triphosphatases. The key molecular determinant of ThTPase was reported previously (3Martinez J. Truffault V.

NeuTTM and CthTTM were found in cluster 2; TTM3 from Arabidopsis thaliana is a member of cluster 9 (3Martinez J. Truffault V. Hothorn X.M.

The two other described enzymes from A. thaliana (TTM1 and TTM2) are in cluster 7, and interestingly they utilize pyrophosphate and not triphosphate (18Ung H. Karia P. Ebine K. Ueda T. Yoshioka K. Moeder W. Triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme function in senescence highlights a biological diversification of this protein superfamily.Plant Physiol. 2017; 175: 473-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). AtTTM1 and AtTTM2 do not possess the TTM signature motifs required for catalysis (Table S1). In cluster 5, unpublished structures annotated before as adenylyl cyclase from Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus halodurans can be found. A member of this cluster from Staphylococcus aureus has further been described to be incompetent in cAMP formation and to be distinct from class IV adenylyl cyclases (19Zhang Y. Agrebi R. Bellows L.E. Collet J.F. Kaever V. Gründling A. Evolutionary adaptation of the essential tRNA methyltransferase TrmD to the signaling molecule 3′,5′-cAMP in bacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 313-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cluster 3 contains orthologs of mostly archaeal origin from Pyrococcus furiosus and Pyrococcus horikoshii, as well as Saci_0718 (Uniprot: Q4JAT2). The SSN analysis clearly indicates that archaeal CYTH enzymes are functionally diverge from CyaB-like class IV adenylyl cyclases. To gain in-depth biochemical and structural insights into this protein, we heterologously overproduced a C-terminal His6-tagged variant of Saci_0718 in E. coli. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity using an initial heat denaturation step to remove E. coli proteins followed by IMAC and subsequent size exclusion chromatography as a polishing step. The enzyme formed a dimer in solution corresponding to 56 kDa compared with standards (Fig. S1). Dimerization behavior is typical among other CYTH proteins (11Bettendorff L. Wins P. Thiamine triphosphatase and the CYTH superfamily of proteins.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 6443-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The first ambiguity to be resolved was determination of its substrate preference and the nature of its hydrolysis products. Initially, we tested its activity against ATP using Mg2+ as cofactor at 75 °C and the reaction product analyzed by HPLC (Fig. S2A). This experiment clearly showed that the enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing ATP to ADP and Pi without any formation of cAMP. Saci_0718 showed no base specificity during its phosphohydrolase reaction and able to utilize both ATP or GTP with similar efficiency (Fig. 2A). As the reaction products are diphosphate nucleosides and not (c)AMP/GMP, we used nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP, AMPCPP, and AMPPCP to identify the nucleophilic attack site (Fig. S2B). It shows that Saci_0718 acts on the terminal phosphate of ATP, as the enzyme was active on AMPCPP but no phosphate release was observed for AMPPCP. Next, we tested triphosphate (PPPi) as substrate. Under the conditions outlined before Saci_0718 is ∼19 times more active compared with NTP as substrate. The result is consistent with the previous reports of tunnel metalloenzymes (2Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. Novel triphosphate phosphohydrolase activity of Clostridium thermocellum TTM, a member of the triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme superfamily.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 3Martinez J. Truffault V. Hothorn X.M. Structural determinants for substrate binding and catalysis in triphosphate tunnel metalloenzymes.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 23348-23360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We also observed that the enzyme is able to hydrolyze higher polyphosphates like tetraphosphate with final formation of pyrophosphate and phosphate (Fig. S3). As triphosphate seems to be the preferred substrate, we named Saci_0718 SaTTM (S. acidocaldarius triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme). The optimal assay conditions were observed at a basic pH 8.6 at 75 °C using Mg2+ as a cofactor, whereas Zn2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+ could be used as weaker cofactor alternatives. Similar to the metal ion chelator EDTA, calcium exerted an inhibitory effect on phosphatase activity (Fig. 2, B and C). At optimal conditions, kinetic measurement revealed a classical Michaelis–Menten behavior with a Km of 41.0 μM and a Vmax of 29.7 μM s−1 (Fig. 2D). This shows a highly efficient catalysis performed by SaTTM with a kcat/Km of 1.45 × 108 s−1 M−1 close to the diffusion limit and a turnover rate, kcat, of 5934 s–1, which is in the range of untagged NeuTTM (7900 s−1) (16Delvaux D. Murty M.R.V.S. Gabelica V. Lakaye B. Lunin V.V. Skarina T. Onopriyenko O. Kohn G. Wins P. De Pauw E. Bettendorff L. A specific inorganic triphosphatase from Nitrosomonas europaea: Structure and catalytic mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 34023-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For structural information, we crystallized SaTTM in different catalytically relevant complexes. Initial attempts to produce diffraction quality crystals using apoenzyme were unsuccessful, but crystallization was finally possible under a high-sulfate condition. In contrast, ligand-bound states regularly produced high hit numbers for diffraction quality crystals, indicating that SaTTM is highly flexible in solution and stabilized upon ligand binding. Crystals of SaTTM in its different catalytic states were obtained after a week at 4 °C that diffracted to 1.75- to 2.3-Å resolution. For structure determination, the P. horikoshii OT3 PH1819 (Protein Data Bank [PDB] entry 2EEN, 39% identity with SaTTM)-based homology model of SaTTM was used as a search model in molecular replacement. SaTTM was crystallized as an open-state homodimer (Fig. 3A), bound with two sulfate anions instead of the ATP that was included in cocrystallization. Of note, a solution structure of mouse thiamine triphosphatase (PDB 2JMU) reported a similarly open state. The open state of SaTTM was crystallized in space group P41212 with one monomer per asymmetric unit. The polypeptide is defined by electron density for R6-A176 but lacks completely residues P44-R49 and Q73-R80 due to missing density. The general topology of SaTTM is described by an eight-stranded β-barrel comprising the antiparallel strands β1-β9/β5-β4-β3-β2-β6-β7-β8(-β1) with three interspersing α helices and the C-terminal plug helix α4. The dimerization of SaTTM was also found in the crystal structure formed by two symmetry mates along the α2 helices and parts of the preceding β5 strand. PDBePISA revealed that the dimer interface covered 875 Å2 with a CSS score of 0.32 and accounts for 8.5% of the total solvent-accessible area of one protomer (20Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6493) Google Scholar). The dimerization is mainly established by hydrophobic interactions of residues from β3, β4, β5, and α2 and salt bridges between K99 from one protomer and E81 from the other protomer. The C-terminal α4 plug helix blocks the tunnel entry from one side. It was previously reported that this plug helix plays a major role in determining substrate preference (17Jain R. Shuman S. Polyphosphatase activity of CthTTM, a bacterial triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31047-31057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Next, we aimed to trap the Michaelis complex of SaTTM, for which we cocrystallized the enzyme together with PPPi or ATP and the respective cofactors Mg2+ or Ca2+ at 4 °C. Substrate-bound states of SaTTM crystallized in a closed tunnel conformation, highlighting the structural rearrangement upon ligand binding (Fig. 3B). This supports the previous notion that CYTH enzymes are highly flexible and can breathe during their catalytic cycle (6Delvaux D. Kerff F. Murty M.R.V.S. Lakaye B. Czerniecki J. Kohn G. Wins P.

Chem. 2008; 283: 31047-31057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In all states but the open state, a closed tunnel conformation including the missing stretches P44-R49 (loop β2/β3) and Q73-R80 (loop β4/β5) of the open state were observed (Fig. 3C). As shown for AtTTM3 (3Martinez J. Truffault V. Hothorn X.M. Structural determinants for substrate binding and catalysis in triphosphate tunnel metalloenzymes.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 23348-23360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we observed electron density in the PPPi⋅Mg2+ state for just one metal ion octahedrally coordinated by PPPi, E7, and E135 (Fig. 4A and S4A), whereas the second ion necessary for water activation was missing (Fig. S5C). When using a complete PPPi molecule during refinements, we found higher B-factors for the γ-phosphate. Therefore, the molecule was split into PPi and γ-Pi and occupancies were separately refined. This revealed that only 76% of the substrate-binding site were occupied with γ-phosphates, suggesting a slow turnover of the triphosphate in crystallo. The PPPi⋅Ca2+ state (Figs. 4B and S5D) revealed not only metal ion 1 (M1) but also the water-activating position of metal ion 2 site (M2) present in the electron density. The two Ca2+ ions are coordinated by PPPi, E5, E7, and E137 (Fig. S4B), thereby positioning a water molecule in an inline-attack position 3.2 Å away from the γ-phosphate phosphorous as observed for the E. coli YgiF⋅PPPi states (PDB: 5A60, 5A61). Here, no differences of γ-phosphate B-factors and occupancies were observed, indicating no hydrolysis during crystallization, which is in line with activity assays in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2C). As SaTTM catalyzes asymmetrical cleavage of a symmetric substrate it is difficult to judge the directionality of the substrate, a prerequisite for firm mechanistic conclusions. Hence, we solved the ATP-bound form of SaTTM in the presence of Ca2+ ions (Figs. 4C and S5B). The SaTTM⋅ATP state revealed the adenosine base on the side of the plug helix α4, defining the orientation of the triphosphate moiety. It also showed that the catalytic mechanism of SaTTM follows a classical inorganic triphosphatase, but not an AC-IV, providing the structural base of TTM function. Of interest, the predicted inline attack by an activated water nucleophile (see Figs. 4B, 5A, and S4B) onto the γ-phosphate apparently misses a general-base support by protein side chains and is consistent with the high pH optimum of 8.6 for SaTTM. Upon the structural and biochemical confirmation of SaTTM's inability to use calcium as reaction-competent cofactor we wondered how Ca2+ competes with Mg2+. Hence, we performed a titration experiment with increasing concentrations of calcium on a magnesium-catalyzed reaction (Fig. S6A). As expected, we observed at equimolar concentrations a highly reduced activity of SaTTM using PPPi as substrate, and almost no turnover with 5-fold excess of the inhibiting metal ion, indicating that calcium is a potent inhibitor of TTM.Figure 5Two-metal ion catalysis by TTMs. A, in two-metal ion catalysis metal ion 2 (M2) activates a coordinated water for inline attack on the γ-phosphate with αβ-pyrophosphate as leaving group.

From three domains, 10 subthemes emerged: 1) typical work-up of axSpA patients in primary care, with subthemes including the clues involved in work-up and role of clinical examinations for axSpA; 2) feedback on questions from the Inflammatory Back Pain Assessment: ASAS Expert Criteria, with subthemes to evaluate contents/questions of a potential screening tool for axSpA; and 3) implementation of the screening tool in primary care settings, with subthemes of perceived barriers including awareness, time, other conditions to screen, rare disease, and lack of structured questionnaire for back pain and perceived facilitators including workflow issues and awareness.Primary care physicians believed that an improved screening instrument and a strong evidence-base to support the need for screening for axSpA are required. The implementation of axSpA screening into a busy primary care practice requires integration into the practice workflow, with use of technology suggested as a possible way to improve efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3164642512,"Transparency of Chinese media coverage became an international controversy when the COVID-19 outbreak initially emerged in Wuhan, the eventual crisis epicenter in China. Unlike studies characterizing mass media in authoritarian contexts as government mouthpieces during a crisis, this study aims to disaggregate Chinese media practices to uncover differences in when, where, and how the severity of COVID-19 was reported. We examine differences in how media institutions reported the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic in China during the pre-crisis period from 1 January 2020 to 20 January 2020 in terms of both the “vertical” or hierarchical positions of media institutions in the Chinese media ecosystem and the “horizontal” positions of media institutions’ social proximity to Wuhan in terms of geographical human traffic flows. We find that the coverage of crisis severity is negatively associated with the media’s social proximity to Wuhan, but the effect varies depending on the positional prominence of a news article and situation severity. Implications of the institutions’ differentiated reporting strategies on future public health reporting in an authoritarian context are also discussed."

The Student Adaption to College Questionnaire (SACQ) examined participants' levels of adjustment to university, while Schlossberg's 4 S transition model was utilised in a framework analysis of the focus group and interview responses.Complete survey responses were obtained from 198 students, 17 of whom also participated in focus group discussions or interviews. Mean adjustment ratings obtained from the SACQ responses were academic (6.09 ± 1.3) personal-emotional (5.53 ± 1.55), social (6.30 ± 1.38), and institutional attachment (6.96 ± 1.6). These results indicate that the personal and emotional aspects of this transition were more challenging for the students. Analysis of the qualitative data revealed that generally, for these highly motivated health-professions students, dropping out of university was not an option and this had a positive influence on their ability to adjust to their new learning environment. Nonetheless, the transition involved role change; school-leavers were excited about their newly found independence, while for mature-aged students, returning to university allowed them to pursue their lifelong dreams. Adjustment was more challenging for international, mature-aged and female students, with personal and social factors influencing the transition for each of these demographic groups.To facilitate smooth transition into university, tertiary education institutions must consider tailored on-going support strategies that promote social interaction among students with varied backgrounds and personal characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3165841629,"Movement, positioning and coordination of player formations is a key aspect for the performance of teams within field-based sports. The increased availability of player tracking data has given rise to numerous studies that focus on the relationship between simple descriptive statistics surrounding team formation and performance. While these existing approaches have provided a high-level a view of team-based spatial formations, there is limited research on the nature of collective movement across players within teams and the establishment of stable collective states within game play. This study draws inspiration from the analysis of collective movement in nature, such as that observed within schools of fish and flocking birds, to explore the existence of collective states within the phases of play in soccer. Order parameters and metrics describing group motion and shape are derived from player movement tracks to uncover the nature of the team's collective states and transitions. This represents a unique addition to the current body of work around the analysis of player movement in team sports. The results from this study demonstrate that sequences of ordered collective behaviours exist with relatively rapid transitions between highly aligned polar and un-ordered swarm behaviours (and vice-versa). Defensive phases of play have a higher proportion of ordered team movement than attacking phases, indicating that movements linked with attacking tactics, such as player dispersion to generate passing and shooting opportunities leads to lower overall collective order. Exploration within this study suggests that defensive tactics, such as reducing the depth or width to close passing opportunities, allows for higher team movement speeds and increased levels of collective order. This study provides a novel view of player movement by visualising the collective states present across the phases of play in football."

In Tunisia, O . crenata and O . foetida are among the major problems limiting faba bean production and productivity. Breeding for resistance and development of resistant varieties remain the most efficient control strategy to combat these parasites. In our study, field trials were conducted over two consecutive cropping seasons. A set of 42 genotypes were used in this study; 39 advanced lines and three checks; Najeh and Baraca (resistant) and Badi (susceptible). The trials were conducted in highly infested O . foetida plot at Oued-Beja Research Station in Tunisia. Results showed that advanced lines XAR-VF00.13-1-2-1-2-1 and XBJ90.04-2-3-1-1-1-2A expressed high resistance level exceeding those recorded for resistance checks Najeh and Baraca. O . foetida significantly affected the biomass, grain yield, chlorophyll content index (CCI) and the maximum quantum efficiency (F v /F m ratio). No significant effect was observed on host plant water content (WC). CCI decreases varied from 46.4% for the susceptible check Badi and 4.2% and 9.3%, respectively, for Baraca and XBJ90.04-2-3-1-1-1-2A. Orobanche parasitism resulted in a slight decreases of F v /F m ratio for the advanced lines XBJ90.04-2-3-1-1-1-2A and XAR-VF00.13-1-2-1-2-1 against important decreases observed for Badi and Baraca. Correlation between resistance to O . foetida and CCI and F v /F m makes this, easy-to-measure, parameter very useful as a practical screening tool for early parasitism detection, diagnosis and identification and selection of high resistant plants against this parasite."
https://openalex.org/W3165368369,"Effectiveness of psychological treatment is often assessed using patient-reported health evaluations. However, comparison of such scores over time can be hampered due to a change in the meaning of self-evaluations, called 'response shift'. Insight into the occurrence of response shift seems especially relevant in the context of psychological interventions, as they often purposefully intend to change patients' frames of reference.The overall aim is to gain insight into the general relevance of response shift for psychological health intervention research. Specifically, the aim is to re-analyse data of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of psychological interventions targeting different health aspects, to assess (1) the occurrence of response shift, (2) the impact of response shift on interpretation of treatment effectiveness, and (3) the predictive role of clinical and background variables for detected response shift.We re-analysed data from RCTs on guided internet delivered cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) for insomnia in the general population with and without elevated depressive symptoms, an RCT on meaning-centred group psychotherapy targeting personal meaning for cancer survivors, and an RCT on internet-based CBT treatment for persons with diabetes with elevated depressive symptoms. Structural equation modelling was used to test the three objectives.We found indications of response shift in the intervention groups of all analysed datasets. However, results were mixed, as response shift was also indicated in some of the control groups, albeit to a lesser extent or in opposite direction. Overall, the detected response shifts only marginally impacted trial results. Relations with selected clinical and background variables helped the interpretation of detected effects and their possible mechanisms.This study showed that response shift effects can occur as a result of psychological health interventions. Response shift did not influence the overall interpretation of trial results, but provide insight into differential treatment effectiveness for specific symptoms and/or domains that can be clinically meaningful."

The impact of the ratio between venous diameter and the size of the inserted catheter (catheter to vein ratio, CVR) on the first attempt success rate can be of added value in clinical. This study tries to give insight into the consideration that must be made when selecting the target vein and the type of catheter, and proved the null hypothesis that an optimal CVR would not be associated with increased first attempt cannulation success.This was a post-hoc analyses on adult patients admitted for peripheral intravenous cannulation. Intravenous cannulation was performed according to practice guidelines, by applying the traditional landmark approach. The CVR was calculated afterwards for each individual patient by dividing the external diameter of the inserted catheter by the diameter of the target vein, which was multiplied by 100%.In total, 610 patients were included. The median CVR was 0.39 (0.15) in patients with a successful first attempt, whereas patients with an unsuccessful first attempt had a median CVR of 0.55 (0.20) (P<0.001). The optimal cut-off point of the CVR was 0.41. First attempt cannulation was successful in 92% of patients with a CVR<0.41, whereas as those with a CVR>0.41 had a first attempt success rate of 65% (P<0.001).This first introduction of the CVR in relation to cannulation success should be further investigated. Although, measuring the venous diameter or detection of a vein with a specific diameter prior to cannulation may increase first attempt cannulation success."

This study aims to explore the barriers to early presentation, information needs and sources in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC).A convenience sample of patients who presented with locally advanced breast cancer to the Department of General Surgery in a teaching tertiary hospital were recruited for the study. We conducted semi-structured interviews face to face with the recruited patients. We recorded the interviews, transcribed them verbatim and analysed using thematic content analysis.Twenty-three participants were recruited of which 12 were Chinese and 11 were Malay women. Mean age was 60 years (± 13 SD). The most common knowledge barrier resulting in delay was the misconception that a breast lump must be painful to be malignant. Other knowledge barriers include the lack of knowledge and misinformation from the internet or other social media platforms. Some perceived barriers include fear of diagnosis, fear of treatment and fear of imposing financial burden on family members. A significant proportion of participants were also not aware of a national breast screening programme.Our study has found that barriers to early presentation of women with locally advanced breast cancer remain similar and have persisted over the years despite targeted efforts. There is a need for a rethink of existing strategies and to develop new innovative ways to reach out to this group of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3164527380,"N-glycosylation is a common posttranslational modification of proteins in eukaryotic cells. The modification is often analyzed in cells which are able to produce extracellular, glycosylated proteins. Here we report an improved method of the use of genetically modified, secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as a reporter glycoprotein which may be used for glycoanalysis. Additional N-glycosylation sites introduced by site-directed mutagenesis significantly increased secretion of the protein. An improved purification protocol of recombinant SEAP from serum or serum-free media is also proposed. The method enables fast and efficient separation of reporter glycoprotein from a relatively small amount of medium (0.5-10 ml) with a high recovery level. As a result, purified SEAP was ready for enzymatic de-glycosylation without buffer exchange, sample volume reductions or other procedures, which are usually time-consuming and may cause partial loss of the reporter glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W3164830065,"Bacterial two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases cleave the stable C–S bond of environmental and anthropogenic organosulfur compounds. The monooxygenase MsuD converts methanesulfonate (MS−) to sulfite, completing the sulfur assimilation process during sulfate starvation, but the mechanism of this conversion remains unclear. To explore the mechanism of C–S bond cleavage, we report a series of crystal structures of MsuD from Pseudomonas fluorescens in different liganded states. This report provides the first crystal structures of an alkanesulfonate monooxygenase with a bound flavin and alkanesulfonate, elucidating the roles of the active site lid, the protein C terminus, and an active site loop in flavin and/or alkanesulfonate binding. These structures position MS− closest to the flavin N5 position, consistent with an N5-(hydro)peroxyflavin mechanism rather than a classical C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin mechanism. A fully enclosed active site is observed in the ternary complex, mediated by interchain interaction of the C terminus at the tetramer interface. These structures identify an unexpected function of the protein C terminus in this protein family in stabilizing tetramer formation and the alkanesulfonate-binding site. Spurred by interest from the crystal structures, we conducted biochemical assays and molecular docking that redefine MsuD as a small- to medium-chain alkanesulfonate monooxygenase. Functional mutations verify the sulfonate-binding site and reveal the critical importance of the protein C terminus for monooxygenase function. These findings reveal a deeper understanding of MsuD’s functionality at the molecular level and consequently how it operates within its role as part of the sulfur assimilation pathway.

These structures position MS− closest to the flavin N5 position, consistent with an N5-(hydro)peroxyflavin mechanism rather than a classical C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin mechanism. A fully enclosed active site is observed in the ternary complex, mediated by interchain interaction of the C terminus at the tetramer interface. These structures identify an unexpected function of the protein C terminus in this protein family in stabilizing tetramer formation and the alkanesulfonate-binding site. Spurred by interest from the crystal structures, we conducted biochemical assays and molecular docking that redefine MsuD as a small- to medium-chain alkanesulfonate monooxygenase. Functional mutations verify the sulfonate-binding site and reveal the critical importance of the protein C terminus for monooxygenase function. These findings reveal a deeper understanding of MsuD’s functionality at the molecular level and consequently how it operates within its role as part of the sulfur assimilation pathway. Flavin-dependent monooxygenases catalyze the monooxygenation of a wide range of substrates using dioxygen and either a reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH−) or reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH−), making them incredibly useful biocatalysts (1Huijbers M.M.

For example, sulfur’s redox properties make the element key for electron carrier molecules such as glutathione (6Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R.

Biosynthetic pathways for incorporating sulfur use exogenous sulfate, which is reduced to sulfite and subsequently sulfide in the cell (Fig. 1A) (8Kertesz M.A. Riding the sufur cycle - metabolism of sulfonates and sulfate esters in Gram-negative bacteria.FEMS Microbiol.

In pseudomonads, msu and sfn genes contain the flavin-dependent monooxygenases SfnG, MsuC, and MsuD that convert DMSO2 to sulfite (Fig. 1B). SfnG converts DMSO2 to methanesulfinate (MSI−) (27Wicht D.K. The reduced flavin-dependent monooxygenase SfnG converts dimethylsulfone to methanesulfinate.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2016; 604: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), MsuC oxidizes MSI− to methanesulfonate (MS−) (28Soule J. Gnann A.D. Gonzalez R. Parker M.J. McKenna K.C. Nguyen S.V. Phan N.T. Wicht D.K. Dowling D.P. Structure and function of the two-component flavin-dependent methanesulfinate monooxygenase within bacterial sulfur assimilation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2020; 522: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and MsuD catalyzes the conversion of MS− to sulfite (Fig. 1C) (17Kertesz M.A. Schmidt-Larbig K. Wuest T. A novel reduced flavin mononucleotide-dependent methanesulfonate sulfonatase encoded by the sulfur-regulated msu operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together SfnG and MsuD are responsible for sequential cleavage of the two C–S bonds of DMSO2, and each methyl group is presumed to be oxidized to formaldehyde. The enzymes SfnG, MsuC, and MsuD are members of a small subset of flavin-dependent monooxygenases that are characterized by their use of reduced flavin as a cosubstrate rather than a cofactor. Termed two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases, members of this family lack an NAD(P)H-binding site and therefore require a separate reduced NAD(P)H:oxidized flavin mononucleotide (FMN) oxidoreductase to provide the FMNH− cosubstrate. MsuE was identified within the msu operon of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the likely NADH:FMN oxidoreductase for MsuC (28Soule J. Gnann A.D. Gonzalez R. Parker M.J.

A novel reduced flavin mononucleotide-dependent methanesulfonate sulfonatase encoded by the sulfur-regulated msu operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and SfnF was identified in the sfn operon of Pseudomonas putida (29Endoh T. Habe H. Nojiri H. Yamane H. Omori T.

Microbiol. 2005; 55: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Structurally characterized two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases that catalyze C–S bond cleavage include CmoJ, DmoA, BdsA, and SsuD, which adopt a (β/α)8 triose isomerase phosphate (TIM) barrel fold and are denoted as group C two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases (1Huijbers M.M. Montersino S. Westphal A.H. Tischler D. van Berkel W.J. Flavin dependent monooxygenases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2014; 544: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This is separate from MsuC, a group D flavin-dependent monooxygenase that instead exhibits the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase fold and catalyzes formation of a S–O bond. The group C monooxygenase DmoA functions on dimethylsulfide (30Cao H.Y. Wang P. Peng M. Shao X. Chen X.L. Li C.Y. Crystal structure of the dimethylsulfide monooxygenase DmoA from Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans.Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Commun. 2018; 74: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), CmoJ is involved in the cysteine salvage pathway (31Bhandari D. Studies on the Flavin-Mediated Cysteine Salvage Pathway, Structural Enzymology of Riboflavin Lyase and Mechanistic Investigation of the Radical S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine-Mediated Tryptophan Lyase. Texas A&M University, 2017Google Scholar), and BdsA is part of the 4S utilization pathway to convert dibenzothiophene to sulfite (32Okai M. Lee W.C. Guan L.J. Ohshiro T. Izumi Y. Tanokura M. Crystal structure of dibenzothiophene sulfone monooxygenase BdsA from Bacillus subtilis Wu-S2B.Proteins. 2017; 85: 1171-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, MsuD is most closely related to Escherichia coli alkanesulfonate monooxygenase SsuD with 67% sequence identity. SsuD catalyzes C–S bond cleavage of C2-C10 alkyl-substituted sulfonates, in addition to alkyl chains with bulkier chemical groups and larger buffer molecules (26Eichhorn E. van der Ploeg J.R. Leisinger T. Characterization of a two-component alkanesulfonate monooxygenase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26639-26646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), whereas MsuD is reportedly most active with a C1 sulfonate (17Kertesz M.A. Schmidt-Larbig K. Wuest T. A novel reduced flavin mononucleotide-dependent methanesulfonate sulfonatase encoded by the sulfur-regulated msu operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, no known alkanesulfonate monooxygenase structure has been solved with flavin or an alkanesulfonate bound, and only the structure of E. coli SsuD without ligands has been reported. As such, the disorder of the SsuD active site has hindered our understanding of the vital alkanesulfonate monooxygenase reaction (33Eichhorn E. Davey C.A. Sargent D.F. Leisinger T. Richmond T.J. Crystal structure of Escherichia coli alkanesulfonate monooxygenase SsuD.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The overall monooxygenase reaction was originally thought to advance through a C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin intermediate (3Walsh C.T. Wencewicz T.A. Flavoenzymes: Versatile catalysts in biosynthetic pathways.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2013; 30: 175-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but recent structural, computational, and biochemical studies of two monooxygenases, EncM from enterocin biosynthesis (34Saleem-Batcha R. Stull F. Sanders J.N. Moore B.S. Palfey B.A. Houk K.N. Teufel R. Enzymatic control of dioxygen binding and functionalization of the flavin cofactor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 4909-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and RutA from uracil degradation (35Matthews A. Saleem-Batcha R. Sanders J.N. Stull F. Houk K.N. Teufel R. Aminoperoxide adducts expand the catalytic repertoire of flavin monooxygenases.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), support the use of either an N5-(hydro)peroxyflavin or flavin-N5-oxide. Although EncM is structurally similar to flavin oxidases/dehydrogenases (36Teufel R. Miyanaga A. Michaudel Q. Stull F. Louie G. Noel J.P. Baran P.S. Palfey B. Moore B.S. Flavin-mediated dual oxidation controls an enzymatic Favorskii-type rearrangement.Nature. 2013; 503: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and RutA exhibits a TIM barrel fold (37Mukherjee T. Zhang Y. Abdelwahed S. Ealick S.E. Begley T.P. Catalysis of a flavoenzyme-mediated amide hydrolysis.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 5550-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), their structures identified that dioxygen and the substrate bind on opposite faces of the flavin, and a conserved dioxygen reactivity motif (F/L-T/S-NxV-A-F/L/Y, where x is a branched chain amino acid) was identified within RutA and a subset of group C monooxygenases, including CmoJ, DmoA, and DszA (catalyzes the same reaction as BdsA). Matthews et al. (35Matthews A. Saleem-Batcha R. Sanders J.N. Stull F. Houk K.N. Teufel R. Aminoperoxide adducts expand the catalytic repertoire of flavin monooxygenases.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) investigated RutA via computational studies that support the thermodynamic possibility of inversion at the N5 position of the flavin, which would move the (hydro)peroxy group toward the substrate for catalysis to proceed. RutA and MsuD share only 25% sequence identity, and the dioxygen reactivity motif of RutA is not fully conserved in MsuD, SsuD, or SfnG; therefore, it is unclear if a similar N5-(hydro)peroxyflavin could be employed in enzymes that facilitate C–S bond cleavage. Observing the ordered active site would help elucidate this question. Likewise, a completely ordered model could help clarify regions of disorder that exist in RutA and other group C monooxygenases such as the active site lid and seemingly functionless C terminus. Here we report the first crystal structures and biochemical activity studies of P. fluorescens MsuD, which adopts a group C (β/α)8 TIM barrel fold. Structural experiments entailing soaks and cocrystallization of MsuD with FMN and MS− enabled us to obtain the first ever crystallographic snapshots of an alkanesulfonate monooxygenase in different complexed states with its substrates. Because the FMNH− cosubstrate is aerobically sensitive (38Massey V. Activation of molecular oxygen by flavins and flavoproteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22459-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Gibson Q.H. Hastings J.W. The oxidation of reduced flavin mononucleotide by molecular oxygen.Biochem. J. 1962; 83: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we have employed oxidized FMN, a product of the monooxygenase, to obtain crystal structures that detail the flavin-binding site. We report the structures of unliganded MsuD, MsuD in complex with FMN, and MsuD in complex with both FMN and MS−. The 2.4-Å resolution structure of MsuD with flavin and MS− has enabled us to revisit the chemical mechanism to assess if C–S cleavage likely advances through the C4a or N5-(hydro)peroxyflavin intermediates, as well as put into context many of the biochemical experiments that have been difficult to rationalize without an experimentally determined binding mode for the flavin and alkanesulfonate moieties. Our studies further have led us to redetermine the substrate scope for MsuD. The resulting structures reveal an exquisite molecular connection between the flavin- and MS−-binding sites, the active site lid, and the protein C terminus, providing an unrealized function for the C-terminal extension that may be used in other group C flavin monooxygenases. The 2.4-Å resolution crystal structure of MsuD in complex with FMN and MS− (ternary-MsuD) was obtained by cocrystallization with greater than 5-fold molar excess of both ligands. MsuD adopts a classic (β/α)8 TIM barrel fold (Fig. 2A) (40Banner D.W. Bloomer A.C. Petsko G.A. Phillips D.C. Pogson C.I. Wilson I.A. Corran P.H. Furth A.J. Milman J.D. Offord R.E. Priddle J.D. Waley S.G. Structure of chicken muscle triose phosphate isomerase determined crystallographically at 2.5Å resolution using amino acid sequence data.Nature. 1975; 255: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), with four insertion segments (ISs) to the (β/α)8 core of MsuD: IS-1 includes two β-strands (labeled β1a/b); IS-2 includes an α-helix (labeled α4a); IS-3 includes a β-hairpin (labeled β4a/b); and IS-4 includes three α-helices (labeled α7a/b/c), a 310 helix (labeled η7d), and three short β-strands (labeled β7a/b/c). In addition, MsuD contains an extended protein C terminus. All but the last four residues of the protein C terminus were able to be placed into electron density along with the ligands FMN and MS−. Ternary-MsuD crystallized in the space group P61 with four MsuD chains per asymmetric unit, arranged as a dimer-of-dimers (Fig. 2B). The dimer and tetramer interfaces bury approximately 1960 and 2940 Å2 per molecule, respectively, determined by the PISA server (41Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6493) Google Scholar). The buried surface area is consistent with size exclusion data that support MsuD is a tetramer (Fig. S1A). The dimer interface consists of portions of the (β/α)8 core, IS-2, and IS-3 (Fig. 2C), where the β4a/b-hairpin packs against α4a of the dimer molecule. The main tetramer interface is made up of components from the (β/α)8 core, where α1 and its preceding loop as well as α8 combine with a symmetry-related molecule to generate a four-helix bundle (Fig. 2D). The ordering of the C terminus constitutes approximately 1650 Å2 of the tetramer interface, making the tetramer interface the largest interface between monomeric subunits; however, as will be discussed below, the C terminus appears to be a mobile element that is related to substrate binding. It is intriguing that truncation of the last 16 residues from the C terminus affects migration of the protein by gel filtration (Fig. S1B), causing MsuD to behave as a dimer. As was predicted, the closest reported structure to MsuD is E. coli SsuD (42Zhang R. Skarina T. Savchenko A. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Midwest Center for Structural Genomics (MCSG)Structural Genomics, Crystal Structure of Alkanesulfonate Monooxygenase. protein databank entry, 2003https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb1NQK/pdbCrossref Google Scholar), which aligns with an RMSD of 1.3 Å for 330 cα atoms (43Holm L. DALI and the persistence of protein shape.Protein Sci. 2020; 29: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Related structures with less than 32% sequence identity are included in Table S2, and sequence alignment of MsuD with SsuD and a more distantly related homolog representative, RutA, is shown in Figure 3. Like MsuD, both SsuD and BdsA crystallize as homotetramers (Fig. S3), whereas the other structural homologs are reported homodimers. The observed protein–protein interfaces are highly conserved with SsuD (33Eichhorn E. Davey C.A. Sargent D.F. Leisinger T. Richmond T.J. Crystal structure of Escherichia coli alkanesulfonate monooxygenase SsuD.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); however, there is less than 15% conservation of interfacing residues with other structurally characterized group C monooxygenases. Therefore, this enzyme family can accommodate greatly divergent sequences that still preserve the overall quaternary structure. In the absence of ligands, MsuD crystallizes in space group P21 with two MsuD tetramers (chains A/B/C/D and E/F/G/H) per asymmetric unit. The 2.8-Å resolution crystal structure of unliganded MsuD provides a snapshot of the enzyme prior to FMNH−, MS−, and O2 binding. The two tetramers align with an overall RMSD of 0.34 Å for 1188 cα atoms, indicating their structures are largely identical. Of interest, residues in all chains within IS-4 (between α7a and β7a) and from L354 to the C terminus lack any electron density, preventing their modeling and resulting in a very open structure (Fig. 4A). In each chain of ternary-MsuD, α7b and α7c from IS-4, as well as the protein C terminus of an adjacent chain, are ordered and observed to enclose the C-face of the (β/α)8 barrel, covering FMN and MS− and blocking solvent access to the active site (Fig. 4B and electron density is shown in Fig. S4, A–C). The region spanning residues 250 to 282 in SsuD is similarly disordered (33Eichhorn E. Davey C.A. Sargent D.F. Leisinger T. Richmond T.J. Crystal structure of Escherichia coli alkanesulfonate monooxygenase SsuD.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and reported as a “mobile loop region” (44Carpenter R.A. Xiong J. Robbins J.M. Ellis H.R. Functional role of a conserved arginine residue located on a mobile loop of alkanesulfonate monooxygenase.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We will refer to the α7b–α7c region (D250-L282) as a “lid.” In ternary-MsuD, we observe that the two lid helices pack antiparallel to each other and are connected by a three-residue linker (F263-S265). Both hydrophobic and polar interactions contribute to stabilizing the antiparallel positioning of α7b and α7c, which are splayed apart at an angle of 32.7°. To further explore the results of ligand binding on MsuD, FMN alone or FMN with MS− was soaked into crystals of unliganded MsuD using excess concentrations of each ligand. Ligand binding and protein ordering results are summarized in Table S3. Datasets for crystals soaked with FMN were prepared in two ways: an overnight soak with >1 mM FMN (binary-soak MsuD) and an overnight soak titrated with a low concentration of FMN until crystals became pale yellow (binary-titrated MsuD). Both crystals contained 2 mM FMN in their cryoprotectants, yielding datasets of approximately 2.8-Å resolutions. In both structures, six FMNs were placed but distributed differently between the two tetramers. Binary-soak MsuD contained FMN in chains A/B/C/D of the first tetramer and chains E/G of the second tetramer, whereas binary-titrated MsuD contained FMN in chains A/C/D and E/G/H. Chains A, C, and E contain the strongest electron density for FMN in both structures (Fig. S4, D and E). FMN binding led to ordering of the active site lid only when FMN bound with nearly full occupancy, and the B-factor values for portions of these lids are nearly double the average protein B factor, indicative of lid mobility within the crystal. Only one or three C termini were observed in both FMN-soaked structures: chain H in binary-soak MsuD extends into the active site of FMN-bound chain E, and chains B, D, and H in binary-titrated MsuD extend into the FMN-bound active sites of chains C, A, and E, respectively. For each active site that has an inserted C-terminal tail, electron density is within the sulfonate-binding site that best refines as a succinate from the crystallization condition, likely serving as a mimic of MS−. MsuD soaked with FMN and MS− (ternary-soak MsuD) was solved to 2.7-Å resolution, and four FMN with MS− pairs were placed within all protomers of the first tetramer (chains A/B/C/D) (electron density displayed in Fig. S4F). Within the second tetramer, three FMN molecules were placed within chains E/G/H, and MS− could only be placed in chain E. Ligand binding similarly led to ordering of the active site lid with FMN bound at nearly full occupancies; the lid was observed in chains A/B/C/D of the first tet"

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a cocoa extract (Theobroma cacao L.) on F. nucleatum with respect to growth, biofilm formation, adherence, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production. The anti-inflammatory properties and the effect on epithelial barrier function of the cocoa extract were also assessed. The cocoa extract, whose major phenolic compound is epicatechin, dose-dependently inhibited the growth, biofilm formation, adherence properties (basement membrane matrix, oral epithelial cells), and H2S production of F. nucleatum. It also decreased IL-6 and IL-8 production by F. nucleatum-stimulated oral epithelial cells and inhibited F. nucleatum-induced NF-κB activation in monocytes. Lastly, the cocoa extract enhanced the barrier function of an oral epithelial model by increasing the transepithelial electrical resistance. We provide evidence that the beneficial properties of an epicatechin-rich cocoa extract may be useful for preventing and/or treating periodontal diseases."

However, the precise signaling events that lead to this increased cleavage are unclear. We showed that BACE1 cleaves the insulin receptor in the early secretory pathway. Indeed, coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal the interaction of the proforms of the two proteins. Moreover, fragments of insulin receptor are detected in the early secretory pathway and a mutated form of BACE1 that retains its prodomain cleaves an early secretory pathway-resident form of the insulin receptor. We showed that BACE1 proform levels are regulated by proteasome and/or lysosome-dependent degradation systems whose efficiencies are dependent on the O-GlcNacylation process. Our results showed that enhanced O-GlcNacylation reduces the efficiency of intracellular protein degradation systems, leading to the accumulation of the proform of BACE1 in the early secretory pathway where it cleaves the precursor of the insulin receptor. All these dysregulations are found in the livers of diabetic mice. In addition, we performed a screen of molecules according to their ability to increase levels of the insulin receptor at the surface of BACE1-overexpressing cells. This approach identified the aminosterol Claramine, which accelerated intracellular trafficking of the proform of BACE1 and increased autophagy.

Dysfunctions in insulin signaling are responsible for the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (1Boucher J. Kleinridders A. Kahn C.R.

Ther. 2018; 24: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The decreased IR tyrosine kinase activity with reduction in post-receptor signaling is one of the causes of insulin signaling dysfunction. This aspect has been studied relentlessly for decades, and progress in this area is regularly and comprehensively reviewed (6Haeusler R.A. McGraw T.E. Accili D. Biochemical and cellular properties of insulin receptor signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). IR content reduction has long been suspected to contribute to the defective insulin signaling and diabetes progression. This has been firmly proven by showing that restoring IR expression in the liver of adult diabetic mouse models improves the diabetic phenotypes (7Wang Y. Zhou H. Palyha O. Mu J. Restoration of insulin receptor improves diabetic phenotype in T2DM mice.JCI Insight. 2019; 4e124945Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies have demonstrated that mechanisms regulating density of cell surface functional IR have significant effects on insulin cell signaling. In this line, it was reported that E3 ubiquitin ligases MARCH1 in liver (8Nagarajan A. Petersen M.C. Nasiri A.R. Butrico G. Fung A. Ruan H.-B. Kursawe R. Caprio S. Thibodeau J.

In liver, IR cell surface internalization, controlled by the module p31comet-MAD2-BUBR1, was shown to be a mechanism regulating insulin signaling (10Choi E. Zhang X. Xing C. Yu H. Mitotic checkpoint regulators control insulin signaling and metabolic homeostasis.Cell. 2016; 166: 567-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In adipocytes, redirection of internalized IR from endosomes to the plasma membrane, controlled by the intracellular sorting receptor SORLA, regulates IR cell surface expression and insulin signaling (11Schmidt V. Schulz N. Yan X. Schürmann A. Kempa S. Kern M. Blüher M. Poy M.N. Olivecrona G. Willnow T.E. SORLA facilitates insulin receptor signaling in adipocytes and exacerbates obesity.J. Clin. Invest. 2016; 126: 2706-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have previously established that IR ectodomain is cleaved by BACE1 (12Meakin P.J. Mezzapesa A. Benabou E. Haas M.E. Bonardo B. Grino M. Brunel J.-M. Desbois-Mouthon C. Biddinger S.B. Govers R. Ashford M.L.J. Peiretti F. The beta secretase BACE1 regulates the expression of insulin receptor in the liver.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This cleavage occurs in the liver and increases during diabetes, thus reducing the density of functional IR on the cell surface. Of interest, BACE1 inhibition restores functional cell-surface IR and increases insulin signaling, making the liver BACE1-dependent IR cleavage regulation system an original target for counteracting impaired insulin signaling. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate BACE1-dependent cleavage of IR during diabetes to identify regulatory steps that could be pharmacologically targeted to reduce IR cleavage and improve insulin sensitivity. Our previous results suggested that BACE1 zymogen (proBACE1, with its prodomain) was responsible for IR cleavage. This possibility was thoroughly investigated below. In lysates of cells expressing FLAG-tagged IR and HA-tagged BACE1, IR precursor (proIR composed of a single polypeptide chain) and mature IR (derived from the cleavage of proIR by furin and yielding the α and β subunits of IR) (Fig. S1) were detected with the antibody specific for the C-terminal region of IR (Fig. 1A). proBACE1 was detected by the antibody specific for BACE1 prodomain (below 60 kDa), whereas HA tag antibodies detected a form of BACE1 that migrates slower than proBACE1 (around 60 kDa) that likely corresponds to mature BACE1 (without its prodomain but with its complex glycans moiety) (Fig. 1A). Once immunoprecipitated, BACE1 was detected by immunoblot as two major distinct bands (Fig. 1B): the lowest one corresponding to proBACE1, since it was also detected by the antibody specific for BACE1 prodomain, and the upper one being the mature BACE1. A 100-kDa HA-tagged protein was also detected. proBACE1 and the 100-kDa HA-tagged protein coimmunoprecipitated with IR and were both detected with BACE1 prodomain-specific antibodies (Fig. 1B). Of interest, overexpression of the proprotein convertase (PC) furin, which increases the cleavage of BACE1 propeptide (13Creemers J.W. Ines Dominguez D. Plets E. Serneels L. Taylor N.A. Multhaup G. Craessaerts K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. Processing of beta-secretase by furin and other members of the proprotein convertase family.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4211-4217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), reduced the detection of proBACE1 and that of the 100-kDa protein (Fig. 1C) while allowing the detection of a HA-tagged protein that migrated slightly above 100 kDa. These features suggest that the 100-kDa protein is a high-molecular-weight form of proBACE1 and that the protein above 100 kDa, detected upon furin overexpression, is a high-molecular-weight form of mature BACE1. The nature of the 100-kDa proBACE1 was investigated by coimmunoprecipitation of overexpressed HA-tagged BACE1 and FLAG-tagged BACE1. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-BACE1 pulled down the proform of HA-BACE1 and that of the 100-kDa HA-tagged BACE1 (Fig. 1D), suggesting that proBACE1 is expressed in cells in a nonmonomeric form and that the 100-kDa high-molecular-weight form of proBACE1 is a reduction and SDS-resistant dimer of proBACE1. Likewise, the high-molecular-weight form of BACE1 detected upon furin overexpression (Fig. 1C) is likely a dimer of mature BACE1. In addition, immunoprecipitation of BACE1 mostly pulled down proIR (Fig. 1E). These results support that proIR interacts with monomeric and/or dimeric proBACE1. However, this interaction does not necessarily imply that proBACE1 is responsible for IR cleavage. To address this concern, we generated BACE1R42G that resists PC-induced maturation as shown by the detection of a slow migrating form of proBACE1 (Fig. 2A), which likely corresponds to proBACE1 that crossed the Golgi stack and acquired its complex N-glycosylation, as previously demonstrated (14Benjannet S. Elagoz A. Wickham L. Mamarbachi M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Lazure C. Cromlish J.A. Sisodia S. Checler F. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Post-translational processing of beta-secretase (beta-amyloid-converting enzyme) and its ectodomain shedding.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10879-10887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). BACE1R42G and wildtype BACE1 were similarly effective in cleaving IR as shown by the release of soluble IR (IRSOL) in the culture media (Fig. 2A) and the generation of the transmembrane IR C-terminal fragment (IRCTF) (Fig. 2B). By comparison, small amounts of IRSOL and IRCTF were generated when the inactive BACE1D289A was overexpressed. IRCTF is normally cleaved by the γ-secretase, which generates an unstable fragment of its intracellular domain (IRICD) that is rapidly degraded by the proteasome; therefore, inhibition of γ-secretase with DAPT is mandatory to observe an IRCTF that best reflects the BACE1-dependent cleavage of IR (Fig. S1). With respect to other BACE1 substrates: Neuregulin1 (NRG1) was less effectively cleaved by BACE1R42G than by wildtype BACE1, whereas the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its mutated form APPswe were similarly cleaved by both BACE1 forms (Fig. S2A). These results show that IR cleavage does not necessarily require the PC-dependent maturation of proBACE1, but they do not rule out that mature BACE1 may also cleave IR.Figure 2proBACE1 cleaves proIR in the early secretory pathway. Wildtype (WT), inactive (D289A), or PC-resistant (R42G) forms of BACE1 were overexpressed with IR or its indicated mutated forms. A, proBACE1, total BACE1, and IRα subunit were detected in cell lysates; IRSOL was detected in conditioned media. B, cells were treated with DAPT (10 μM, 17 h), then IRβ subunit and BACE1 were detected in cell lysates. C, cells were treated with DAPT, then IRβ and IRα subunits were detected in cell lysates. D, IRα subunit and IRSOL were detected in cell lysates and in conditioned media, respectively. E, cell lysates were treated with EndoH, and IRα subunit was detected. F, BACE1 and IR-expressing cells were treated with Dec-RVKR-CMK (RV; 20 μM, 17 h) or transfected with EK4 expression vector (EK) to inhibit PC, then IRSOL was detected in the conditioned media and IRβ subunit, proBACE1, and BACE1 were detected in cell lysates.

Positions of IR precursor (proIR), IR C-terminal fragment (IRCTF), IR N-terminal fragment (IRNTF, black arrowhead), and core glycosylated (co) and complex N-glycosylated (cx) proBACE1 are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cleavage of IR by proBACE1 implies that it takes place in the early secretory pathway (ESP), from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and before the trans Golgi network (TGN) where the PC cleaves BACE1 prodomain, whereas mature BACE1 would cleave IR from TGN and beyond. We therefore analyzed the BACE1-dependent cleavage of IR mutated forms that are sequestered in the ESP. We have previously described the ESP sequestration of an IR mutated form that resists BACE1 cleavage, in which amino acids flanking the scissile bond are substituted (F942K/Y943K giving IRFY/KK) (12Meakin P.J. Mezzapesa A. Benabou E. Haas M.E. Bonardo B. Grino M. Brunel J.-M. Desbois-Mouthon C. Biddinger S.B. Govers R. Ashford M.L.J. Peiretti F. The beta secretase BACE1 regulates the expression of insulin receptor in the liver.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Figure 2C confirms the ESP retention of IRFY/KK (mainly IRFY/KK precursor was detected) and its resistance to BACE1 cleavage (small amount of IRCTF was detected). The construct IRFY/AA was also retained in the ESP, but, unlike IRFY/KK, it was effectively cleaved by BACE1 as significant amounts of IRCTF (Fig. 2C) and IRSOL (Fig. 2D) were generated. These results support that BACE1 can cleave IR in the ESP where both proteins exist in their precursor forms. They also imply the existence of an N-terminal fragment of proIR (IRNTF) contained in intracellular vesicles, which once secreted is identified as IRSOL (Fig. S1). In lysates of active BACE1-expressing cells, anti-IRα subunit antibodies detected a protein below the position of IRFY/AA precursor, suggesting that this protein is the BACE1-generated IRNTF (Fig. 2, C and D). SDS-PAGE migration distances of IRFY/AA precursor and its IRNTF were increased by EndoH treatment of the cell lysates (Fig. 2E), which removes glycans from core glycosylated proteins that have not trafficked to the cis-medial Golgi apparatus, showing that these two proteins are present within the ESP. The IRNTF generated in the ESP cisternae should be a single polypeptide chain consisting of the entire IRα subunit and a fragment of the IRβ subunit, which, once in the TGN, should be cleaved by PC (Fig. S1). Inhibition of PC (by EK4 overexpression (15Kara I. Poggi M. Bonardo B. Govers R. Landrier J.-F. Tian S. Leibiger I. Day R. Creemers J.W.M. Peiretti F.

However, IRSOL generated under PC inhibition showed a reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE, which is consistent with an IRNTF that is not cleaved by PC. Of interest, fractionation of the subcellular membrane vesicles of HepG2 hepatoma cells by iodixanol density gradient ultracentrifugation allowed the detection of proIR, IRCTF, and IRNTF in the Golgi apparatus and ER-enriched fractions (Fig. 2G), suggesting that cleavage of endogenous IR occurs in the ESP. However, as expected for transmembrane proteins transported through the secretory pathway, IRCTF and IRβ have similar sedimentation profiles. IRNTF, which is an intravesicular fragment of proIR, was narrowly detected in Golgi apparatus and ER-enriched fractions. Taken together, these results provide arguments in favor of a cleavage of proIR by proBACE1 that occurs in ESP. We have previously observed that proBACE1 amount and IR cleavage were regulated by the glucose concentration of the cell culture media and have suggested that the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) plays a key role in this process (12Meakin P.J. Mezzapesa A. Benabou E. Haas M.E. Bonardo B. Grino M. Brunel J.-M. Desbois-Mouthon C. Biddinger S.B. Govers R. Ashford M.L.J. Peiretti F. The beta secretase BACE1 regulates the expression of insulin receptor in the liver.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In agreement with this proposal, proBACE1 amount was reduced when cells were incubated in low-glucose media, an effect prevented by the addition of the HBP substrate glucosamine (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, low-glucose media or reduction of O-GlcNAcylation by inhibiting either L-glutamine-D-fructose 6-phosphate amidotransferase (the HBP rate-limiting enzyme) by DON or O-GlcNAc transferase (the enzyme that attaches a GlcNAc moiety on specific proteins) by OSMI-1 (16Ortiz-Meoz R.F. Jiang J. Lazarus M.B. Orman M. Janetzko J. Fan C. Duveau D.Y. Tan Z.-W. Thomas C.J. Walker S. A small molecule that inhibits OGT activity in cells.ACS Chem. Biol. 2015; 10: 1392-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) reduced global O-GlcNacylation and decreased the amount of proBACE1 without major alterations of the amount of mature BACE1 (Fig. 3B). These results confirm that O-GlcNacylation controls proBACE1 proteostasis. We therefore investigated the mechanisms responsible for proBACE1 degradation. proBACE1 amount was increased by treatment of cells with inhibitors of lysosome-dependent proteolysis, which increased the accumulation of the autophagosomes marker LC3II, and by inhibitors of proteasome-dependent proteolysis, which increased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 3C). Bafilomycin A1 (BAF; a V-ATPase inhibitor that increases lysosomal pH preventing lysosomal proteases activity) and MG132 (which blocks the proteolytic activity of the 26S proteasome complex) were used for the remainder of the study. Both inhibitors increased proBACE1 levels and less markedly those of mature BACE1 (Fig. 3, C and D). Comparatively, these inhibitors poorly altered the amount of precursor and mature IR (Fig. 3D). The proBACE1 stable dimer was also increased by BAF and MG132 treatment (Figs. 3, C and D). Treatment of HepG2 hepatoma cells with BAF increased the amount of endogenous proBACE1 (Fig. 3E and Fig. S4B), indicating that the regulation observed with overexpressed BACE1 is valid for endogenous BACE1. In HepG2 cells, endogenous proBACE1 was poorly expressed and its detection required its preliminary enrichment by heparin-agarose-based affinity chromatography, as previously described (17Beckman M. Holsinger R.M.D. Small D.H. Heparin activates beta-secretase (BACE1) of Alzheimer’s disease and increases autocatalysis of the enzyme.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6703-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the amount of proBACE1 contained in ESP is regulated by proteasome- and/or lysosome-dependent proteolysis, implying the involvement of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and/or ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation (ERLAD) pathways (18Fregno I. Molinari M. Proteasomal and lysosomal clearance of faulty secretory proteins: ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation (ERLAD) pathways.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Piazza F. Tesco G. BACE1 protein endocytosis and trafficking are differentially regulated by ubiquitination at lysine 501 and the Di-leucine motif in the carboxyl terminus.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 42867-42880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the involvement of this posttranslational modification (PTM) in the regulation of proBACE1 degradation. Basal expression of proBACE1 and proBACE1K501R (that cannot be ubiquitinated) were similar (Fig. 4A), and ubiquitin overexpression, which leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins that overloads the degradation systems and slows down proteolysis, greatly increased the amounts of proBACE1 and proBACE1K501R and minimally those of total BACE1 (Fig. 4A). Immunoprecipitation of BACE1 followed by ubiquitin detection confirmed the ubiquitination of BACE1 at lysine 501 by K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 4B), and immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged ubiquitin followed by the detection of proBACE1 revealed the ubiquitination of proBACE1 (Fig. 4B). Therefore, our results are in favor of a K63-linked ubiquitination of pro and mature BACE1. BACE1 lysine 501 was also shown to be a site for SUMO1 conjugation (21Bao J. Qin M. Mahaman Y.A.R. Zhang B. Huang F. Zeng K. Xia Y. Ke D. Wang Q. Liu R. Wang J.-Z. Ye K. Wang X. BACE1 SUMOylation increases its stability and escalates the protease activity in Alzheimer’s disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 3954-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, our results are not in favor of incorporation of the nondeconjugatable SUMO1Q89P into BACE1 (Fig. S3). Basal levels of pro and total BACE1 and BACE1K501R were comparable and were similarly increased by inhibition of lysosome- or proteasome-dependent proteolysis (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, IR was similarly cleaved by overexpressed BACE1 and BACE1K501R as judged by the generation of IRCTF (Fig. 4D) and the release of IRSOL (Fig. 4E). The IR cleavage was distinctly affected by treatment with BAF; indeed, the IRCTF was reduced (Fig. 4D); however, IRSOL remained unchanged (Fig. 4E). Therefore, PTM of BACE1 at lysine 501 is not involved in the regulation of proBACE1 levels by the two major types of protein degradation pathways. These results support the ubiquitin-independent degradation of proBACE1 by ER(L)AD systems. The involvement of ER(L)AD in proBACE1 proteostasis suggests that proBACE1 amount may be regulated by ER stress. In addition to increasing proBACE1 levels, inhibition of ER(L)AD systems by treatment with BAF or MG132 allowed the accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins (Fig. 5A) that can ultimately trigger ER stress. Coherently, BAF and MG132 increased mRNA levels of ER stress markers (Fig. 5B). The increase in proBACE1 levels and ubiquitin-conjugated protein accumulation triggered by BAF and MG132 were partially prevented by simultaneous treatment with OSMI-1 (Fig. 5A), which decreases O-GlcNacylation. Of interest, OSMI-1 also prevented the increase in mRNA levels of the ER stress markers GRP78 and sXBP1 induced by BAF but not by MG132 (Fig. 5B) and reduced the amount of GRP78 protein under basal and BAF-treated conditions (Fig. 5A). Remarkably, CHOP mRNA levels were not altered by OSMI-1 treatment (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that ER(L)AD (probably more specifically ERLAD), O-GlcNacylation process, ER stress, and the regulation of proBACE1 amount are somehow functionally interrelated. In favor of this interpretation, treatment of cells with the ER stress inducer A23187 (22Ding W.-X. Ni H.-M. Gao W. Hou Y.-F. Melan M.A. Chen X. Stolz D.B. Shao Z.-M. Yin X.-M.

Chem. 2007; 282: 4702-4710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) upregulated the expression of ER stress markers (Fig. 5C) and increased the amount of proBACE1 (Fig. 5D). Global protein O-GlcNacylation and ubiquitination were increased in livers of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) compared with standard-fat diet–fed mice (Fig. 6A) as well as in those from db/db mice compared with their control (db/+) littermates (Fig. 6B). ER stress was increased in livers of HFD-fed mice and db/db mice, as indicated by the increased mRNA levels of some ER stress markers (Fig. 6C) and reduced amount of GRP78 protein (Fig. 6B), respectively. Therefore, the regulatory events that control the amount of proBACE1 (O-GlcNacylation, ER(L)AD, and ER stress) are disturbed in the liver of mouse models of diabetes. As expected, the amount of proBACE1 was increased in the liver of db/db mice (Fig. 6B and Fig. S4, A and B), which is in accordance with the increased BACE1 expression (12Meakin P.J. Mezzapesa A.

To that end, luminescence generated by the previously described “IR cleavage reporter system” (12Meakin P.J. Mezzapesa A. Benabou E. Haas M.E. Bonardo B. Grino M. Brunel J.-M. Desbois-Mouthon C. Biddinger S.B. Govers R. Ashford M.L.J. Peiretti F. The beta secretase BACE1 regulates the expression of insulin receptor in the liver.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was measured on the surface of cells expressing BACE1 (Fig. S5B). The most important increase in cell surface–associated luminescence was obtained with Claramine treatment (Fig. S5C). In agreement with this result, Claramine increased the amount of IR on the surface of cells expressing BACE1 but not on the surface of cells expressing inactive BACE1D289A (Fig. 7A and Fig. S5D). In addition, Claramine reduced the generation of IRCTF (Fig. 7B) and decreased the amount of IRSOL accumulated in the conditioned media of BACE1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 7C). The small magnitude of IRSOL reduction is likely due in part to the fact that Claramine increases the BACE1-independent IR release, as observed in the conditioned media of inactive BACE1D289A-overexpressing cells (Fig. 7C). These results suggest that the inhibition of proBACE1-dependent cleavage of IR by Claramine is responsible for the increased amount of cell surface IR. Knockdown experiments previously demonstrated that endogenous IR is cleaved by endogenous BACE1 (12Meakin P.J. Mezzapesa A. Benabou E. Haas M.E. Bonardo B. Grino M. Brunel J.-M. Desbois-Mouthon C.

https://openalex.org/W3164239959,"Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in aging men are commonly attributed to bladder outlet obstruction from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) but BPH/LUTS often reflects a confluence of many factors. We performed a hierarchical cluster analysis using four objective patient characteristics (age, HTN, DM, and BMI), and five pre-operative urodynamic variables (volume at first uninhibited detrusor contraction, number of uninhibited contractions, Bladder Outlet Obstruction Index (BOOI), Bladder Contractility Index (BCI) and Bladder Power at Qmax) to identify meaningful subgroups within a cohort of 94 men undergoing surgery for BPH/LUTS. Two meaningful subgroups (clusters) were identified. Significant differences between the two clusters included Prostate Volume (95 vs 53 cc; p-value = 0.001), BOOI (mean 70 vs 49; p-value = 0.001), BCI (mean 129 vs 83; p-value <0.001), Power (689 vs 236; p-value <0.001), Qmax (8.3 vs 4.9 cc/sec; p-value <0.001) and post-void residual (106 vs 250 cc; p-value = 0.001). One cluster is distinguished by larger prostate volume, greater outlet resistance and better bladder contractility. The other is distinguished by smaller prostate volume, lower outlet resistance and worse bladder contractility. Remarkably, the second cluster exhibited greater impairment of urine flow and bladder emptying. Surgery improved flow and emptying for patients in both clusters. These findings reveal important roles for both outlet obstruction and diminished detrusor function in development of diminished urine flow and impaired bladder emptying in patients with BPH/LUTS."

https://openalex.org/W3165271081,"The human β-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) is one of enhancers for transcription of the β-like globin genes in erythroid cells. Our previous study showed that the LCR HS2 has active chromatin structure before transcriptional induction of the β-globin gene, while another enhancer LCR HS3 is activated by the induction. To compare functional difference between them, we deleted each HS (ΔHS2 and ΔHS3) from the human β-globin locus in hybrid MEL/ch11 cells. Deletion of either HS2 or HS3 dramatically diminished the β-globin transcription and disrupted locus-wide histone H3K27ac and chromatin interaction between LCR HSs and gene. Surprisingly, ΔHS2 weakened interactions between CTCF sites forming the β-globin topologically associating domain (TAD), while ΔHS3 did not. CTCF occupancy and chromatin accessibility were reduced at the CTCF sites in the ΔHS2 locus. To further characterize the HS2, we deleted the maf-recognition elements for erythroid activator NF-E2 at HS2. This deletion decreased the β-globin transcription and enhancer-promoter interaction, but did not affect interactions between CTCF sites for the TAD. In light of these results, we propose that the HS2 has a role in forming a β-globin TAD by activating neighboring CTCF sites and this role is beyond typical enhancer activity."
https://openalex.org/W3165447391,"The Forms of Self-Criticizing/Attacking and Self-Reassuring Scale (FSCRS) was designed to measure self-criticism (SC) through Inadequate Self (IS) and Hated Self (HS) factors, as well as self-reassurance (RS). However, its long and short forms have yet to be validated in the Spanish Population. The present study examines the psychometric properties of the short form (FSCRS-SF) and its clinical usefulness in a sample of 576 adult individuals, 77 with psychiatric disorders and 499 without. Non-clinical participants were split according to their previous experience with meditation (active meditators, n = 133; non-active meditators, n = 41; and non-meditators, n = 325) and differences between these subgroups were explored. Additionally, a subsample of 20 non-clinical participants took part in a mindfulness- and compassion- based intervention (MCBI) to assess the usefulness of the scale as an outcome measure. Results confirmed the original three-factorial structure, good internal consistency, acceptable test-retest reliability, and a pattern of correlations consistent with previous literature. Regarding differences between groups, the clinical subsample showed significant higher SC and lower RS levels than non-clinical participants and active meditators had significant lower IS and higher RS levels than non-meditators. Participants who participated in the MCBI showed significant RS improvement and a decrease in IS and HS levels. Moreover, a hierarchical multiple regression showed that RS made a significant predictive contribution to distress at three months' time. In conclusion, results show that the Spanish version of the FSCRS-SF is a reliable and valid measure of SC and RS in non-clinical populations and an adequate instrument to detect changes after MCBIs."
https://openalex.org/W3163984147,"The histone group added to a gene sequence must be removed during mitosis to halt transcription during the DNA replication stage of the cell cycle. However, the detailed mechanism of this transcription regulation remains unclear. In particular, it is not realistic to reconstruct all appropriate histone modifications throughout the genome from scratch after mitosis. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that there might be a type of ""bookmark"" that retains the positions of histone modifications, which can be readily restored after mitosis. We developed a novel computational approach comprising tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) to identify transcription factors (TFs) that bind to genes associated with reactivated histone modifications as candidate histone bookmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of TD-based unsupervised FE to the cell division context and phases pertaining to the cell cycle in general. The candidate TFs identified with this approach were functionally related to cell division, suggesting the suitability of this method and the potential of the identified TFs as bookmarks for histone modification during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W3164360861,"Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide whose detection is based on multiple factors, including measuring the cup to disc ratio, retinal nerve fiber layer and visual field defects. Advances in image processing and machine learning have allowed the development of automated approached for segmenting objects from fundus images. However, to build a robust system, a reliable ground truth dataset is required for proper training and validation of the model. In this study, we investigate the level of agreement in properly detecting the retinal disc in fundus images using an online portal built for such purposes. Two Doctors of Optometry independently traced the discs for 159 fundus images obtained from publicly available datasets using a purpose-built online portal. Additionally, we studied the effectiveness of ellipse fitting in handling misalignments in tracing. We measured tracing precision, interobserver variability, and average boundary distance between the results provided by ophthalmologists, and optometrist tracing. We also studied whether ellipse fitting has a positive or negative impact on properly detecting disc boundaries. The overall agreement between the optometrists in terms of locating the disc region in these images was 0.87. However, we found that there was a fair agreement on the disc border with kappa = 0.21. Disagreements were mainly in fundus images obtained from glaucomatous patients. The resulting dataset was deemed to be an acceptable ground truth dataset for training a validation of models for automatic detection of objects in fundus images."
https://openalex.org/W3165056435,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin cancer with only limited therapeutic options for advanced disease. We previously showed that oncogene ALK is frequently expressed at the RNA level in MCC and further that ALK positivity by immunohistochemistry is frequent and correlates strongly with Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) positivity. In this study, we investigated whether ALK receptor is active in MCC tumor samples and MCC cell lines, and whether ALK would be a prospective treatment target in MCC. We utilized tissue microarrays constructed from 136 primary MCC tumor samples as well as nine previously established MCC cell lines to determine the presence of ALK and phosphorylated ALK (p-ALK) via immunohistochemistry. Almost half of the analyzed MCC tumors displayed ALK phosphorylation (47.8%). Analysis of MCC tumor samples revealed that the presence of p-ALK correlated to MCPyV positivity, younger age, nonexistence of metastases at diagnosis and ultimately to better MCC-specific survival. In contrast to MCC tumor samples only two out of nine MCC cell lines showed only low ALK phosphorylation by immunohistochemistry. Our study reveals clear disparity in ALK activity between patient derived tumors and cell line samples and therefore, more advanced disease models such as xenografts are necessary to resolve whether ALK is a useful treatment target in MCC."

https://openalex.org/W3164557123,"The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is commonly used to evaluate the accuracy of a diagnostic test for classifying observations into two groups. We propose two novel tuning parameters for estimating the ROC curve via Bernstein polynomial smoothing of the empirical ROC curve. The new estimator is very easy to implement with the naturally selected tuning parameter, as illustrated by analyzing both real and simulated data sets. Empirical performance is investigated through extensive simulation studies with a variety of scenarios where the two groups are both from a single family of distributions (symmetric or right skewed) or one from a symmetric and the other from a right skewed distribution. The new estimator is uniformly more efficient than the empirical ROC estimator, and very competitive to eleven other existing smooth ROC estimators in terms of mean integrated square errors."

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of incidental findings following systematic CAC assessment in diabetic patients with high cardiovascular risk, to identify the determinants, and to assess the midterm consequences of these findings in patient care.732 consecutive asymptomatic patients (187 type 1 diabetes (TD1), 482 type 2 diabetes (TD2) and 63 type 3 diabetes (TD3)) aged 60.6±0.7 years who had a CAC assessment by Multiple Detector Computed Tomography between 2015 and 2017 were systematically included. Clinical and biological data were collected from medical electronic files.117/732 diabetic patients (16.0%) had incidental findings of which 105 (14.3%) were unknown. Incidental findings were more frequent in TD3 (23.8%) and TD2 (17.0%) than in TD1 (10.7%) (p = 0.05). 76 diabetic patients (10.4%) had lung abnormalities, mainly pulmonary nodules (31 patients, 4.2%). The other incidental finding were pericardial (1.5%), vascular (1.2%), thymic (0.7%) and digestive diseases (0.5%). 42.6% of patients with incidental findings had an additional TDM and 56.8% a specialized medical advice. In 10 patients (9.3% of incidental findings), the identification of incidental finding led to a specific treatment of the underlying disease. In multivariate analysis, microalbuminuria, type of diabetes (TD2/TD3 vs TD1) and smoking were significantly associated with incidental findings (p = 0.003; p = 0.026; p = 0.050 respectively).Incidental findings are not rare in diabetic patients upon CAC assessment. A fraction of them are accessible to specific treatment. These findings raise the question if a systematic low dose chest TDM should be conducted in TD2 or TD3 patients and in any diabetic smokers by enlarging the window used for CAC assessment."

We provide recommendations for Chinese booster immunization of meningococcal meningitis vaccine by analyzing the service status of MPV-AC and MPV-ACYW135.Reported data of routine immunization coverage from all districts of Hangzhou registered in the China Information Management System For Immunization Programming (CIMSFIP) between 2014 to 2019 were described and evaluated. Descriptive epidemiological methods were used to characterize the data. Adverse event following immunization (AEFI) were collected from Chinese national adverse event following immunization information system (CNAEFIIS) to compare the safety of MPV-AC and MPV-ACYW135.1376919 doses of booster immunization of meningococcal meningitis vaccine (MenV) in CIMSFIP were conducted in China Hangzhou from 2014 to 2019, with reported immunization coverage rates above 95%. The proportion of children using MPV-ACYW135 increased from 12.63% in 2014 to 29.45% in 2019. The incidence of AEFI of MPV-AC and MPV-ACYW135 were 49.75 per 100,000 and 45.44 per 100,000, respectively, without statistical difference.Children in Hangzhou had high booster immunization of MenV coverage. The use amount and use rate of MPV-ACYW135 increased year by year, indicating more and more parents had chosen MPV-ACYW135 as an alternative to MPV-AC at their own expense for children. The use proportions of MPV-ACYW135 were different in urban, suburban and rural areas. Both MPV-AC and MPV-ACYW135 were safe for children."
