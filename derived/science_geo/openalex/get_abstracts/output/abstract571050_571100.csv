https://openalex.org/W2519343095,"The biodiversity-productivity relationship (BPR) is foundational to our understanding of the global extinction crisis and its impacts on ecosystem functioning. Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and effective conservation of biodiversity. Using ground-sourced data from 777,126 permanent plots, spanning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in forest productivity worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial forest productivity alone-US$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our estimation-is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global conservation. This highlights the need for a worldwide reassessment of biodiversity values, forest management strategies, and conservation priorities."
https://openalex.org/W2479314579,"Rapid characterization of optical and vibrational spectra with high resolution can identify species in cluttered environments and is important for assays and early alerts. In this regard, dual-comb spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful approach to acquire nearly instantaneous Raman and optical spectra with unprecedented resolution. Spectra are generated directly in the electrical domain and avoid bulky mechanical spectrometers. Recently, a miniature soliton-based comb has emerged that can potentially transfer the dual-comb method to a chip platform. Unlike earlier microcombs, these new devices achieve high-coherence, pulsed mode locking. They generate broad, reproducible spectral envelopes, which is essential for dual-comb spectroscopy. Here, dual-comb spectroscopy is demonstrated using these devices. This work shows the potential for integrated, high signal-to-noise spectroscopy with fast acquisition rates."

Sipahigil et al. combined the quantum optical features of silicon-vacancy color centers with diamond-based photonic cavities to form a platform for integrated quantum nanophotonics (see the Perspective by Hanson). They could thus generate single photons from the color centers, optically switch light in the cavity by addressing the state of the color center, and quantum-mechanically entangle two color centers positioned in the cavity.

The Global Consortium for H5N8 and Related Influenza Viruses found that the H5 segment common to the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses readily reassorts with other influenza viruses (see the Perspective by Russell). H5 is thus a continual source of new pathogenic variants. These data also show that the H5N8 virus that recently caused serious outbreaks in European and North American poultry farms came from migrant ducks, swans, and geese that meet at their Arctic breeding grounds. Because the virus is so infectious, culling wild birds is not an effective control measure. Science , this issue p. 213 ; see also p. 174"
https://openalex.org/W2530754194,"Efficient CO2 transformation from a waste product to a carbon source for chemicals and fuels will require reaction conditions that effect its reduction. We developed a ""super-dry"" CH4 reforming reaction for enhanced CO production from CH4 and CO2 We used Ni/MgAl2O4 as a CH4-reforming catalyst, Fe2O3/MgAl2O4 as a solid oxygen carrier, and CaO/Al2O3 as a CO2 sorbent. The isothermal coupling of these three different processes resulted in higher CO production as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding back reactions with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH4 conversion to syngas over Ni and CO2 extraction and storage as CaCO3 CO2 is then used for iron reoxidation and CO production, exploiting equilibrium shifts effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier's principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO2 molecules per CH4 and offers a high CO space-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin."

https://openalex.org/W2531054429,"Antiretroviral drug therapy (ART) effectively suppresses replication of both the immunodeficiency viruses, human (HIV) and simian (SIV); however, virus rebounds soon after ART is withdrawn. SIV-infected monkeys were treated with a 90-day course of ART initiated at 5 weeks post infection followed at 9 weeks post infection by infusions of a primatized monoclonal antibody against the α4β7 integrin administered every 3 weeks until week 32. These animals subsequently maintained low to undetectable viral loads and normal CD4+ T cell counts in plasma and gastrointestinal tissues for more than 9 months, even after all treatment was withdrawn. This combination therapy allows macaques to effectively control viremia and reconstitute their immune systems without a need for further therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2531521677,"There has been a dramatic rise in the scale and scope of collaborative global health research. A number of structural and scientific factors explain this growth and there has been much discussion of these in the literature. Little, if any, attention has been paid, however, to the factors identified by scientists and other research actors as important to successful research collaboration. This is surprising given that their decisions are likely to play a key role in the sustainability and effectiveness of global health research initiatives. In this paper, we report on qualitative research with leading scientists involved in major international research collaborations about their views on good and bad collaborations and the factors that inform their decision-making about joining and participating actively in research networks. We identify and discuss eight factors that researchers see as essential in judging the merits of active participation in global health research collaborations: opportunities for active involvement in cutting-edge, interesting science; effective leadership; competence of potential partners in and commitment to good scientific practice; capacity building; respect for the needs, interests and agendas of partners; opportunities for discussion and disagreement; trust and confidence; and, justice and fairness in collaboration. Our findings suggest that the sustainability and effectiveness of global health research collaborations has an important ethical or moral dimension for the research actors involved."
https://openalex.org/W2531283659,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most rapidly growing form of liver disease and if left untreated can result in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, ultimately resulting in liver cirrhosis and failure. Biliverdin reductase A (BVRA) is a multifunctioning protein primarily responsible for the reduction of biliverdin to bilirubin. Also, BVRA functions as a kinase and transcription factor, regulating several cellular functions. We report here that liver BVRA protects against hepatic steatosis by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) by enhancing serine 9 phosphorylation, which inhibits its activity. We show that GSK3β phosphorylates serine 73 (Ser(P)73) of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), which in turn increased ubiquitination and protein turnover, as well as decreased activity. Interestingly, liver-specific BVRA KO mice had increased GSK3β activity and Ser(P)73 of PPARα, which resulted in decreased PPARα protein and activity. Furthermore, the liver-specific BVRA KO mice exhibited increased plasma glucose and insulin levels and decreased glycogen storage, which may be due to the manifestation of hepatic steatosis observed in the mice. These findings reveal a novel BVRA-GSKβ-PPARα axis that regulates hepatic lipid metabolism and may provide unique targets for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2529946706,"Apoptosis is thought to play a critical role in several pathological processes, such as neurodegenerative diseases (i.e. Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases) and various cardiovascular diseases. Despite the fact that apoptotic mechanisms are well defined, there is still no substantial therapeutic strategy to stop or even slow this process. Thus, there is an unmet need for therapeutic agents that are able to block or slow apoptosis in neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. The outer mitochondrial membrane protein voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is a convergence point for a variety of cell survival and death signals, including apoptosis. Recently, we demonstrated that VDAC1 oligomerization is involved in mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis. Thus, VDAC1 oligomerization represents a prime target for agents designed to modulate apoptosis. Here, high-throughput compound screening and medicinal chemistry were employed to develop compounds that directly interact with VDAC1 and prevent VDAC1 oligomerization, concomitant with an inhibition of apoptosis as induced by various means and in various cell lines. The compounds protected against apoptosis-associated mitochondrial dysfunction, restoring dissipated mitochondrial membrane potential, and thus cell energy and metabolism, decreasing reactive oxidative species production, and preventing detachment of hexokinase bound to mitochondria and disruption of intracellular Ca2+ levels. Thus, this study describes novel drug candidates with a defined mechanism of action that involves inhibition of VDAC1 oligomerization, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The compounds VBIT-3 and VBIT-4 offer a therapeutic strategy for treating different diseases associated with enhanced apoptosis and point to VDAC1 as a promising target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2530698099,"The contribution of metabolic factors on the severity of osteoarthritis (OA) is not fully appreciated. This study aimed to define the effects of hyper cholesterolemia on the progression of OA. A polipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE−/−) mice and rats with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia (DIHC) rats were used to explore the effects of hyper cholesterolemia on the progression of OA. Both models exhibited OA-like changes, characterized primarily by a loss of proteoglycans, collagen and aggrecan degradation, osteophyte formation, changes to subchondral bone architecture, and cartilage degradation. Surgical destabilization of the knees resulted in a dramatic increase of degradative OA symptoms in animals fed a high-cholesterol diet compared with controls. Clinically relevant doses of free cholesterol resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased expression of degenerative and hypertrophic markers in chondrocytes and breakdown of the cartilage matrix. We showed that the severity of diet-induced OA changes could be attenuated by treatment with both atorvastatin and a mitochondrial targeting antioxidant. The protective effects of the mitochondrial targeting antioxidant were associated with suppression of oxidative damage to chondrocytes and restoration of extracellular matrix homeostasis of the articular chondrocytes. In summary, our data show that hypercholesterolemia precipitates OA progression by mitochondrial dysfunction in chondrocytes, in part by increasing ROS production and apoptosis. By addressing the mitochondrial dysfunction using antioxidants, we were able attenuate the OA progression in our animal models. This approach may form the basis for novel treatment options for this OA risk group in humans.—Farnaghi, S., Prasadam, I., Cai, G., Friis, T., Du, Z., Crawford, R., Mao, X., Xiao, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2531174801,"Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate, which are critical fuel metabolites of skeletal muscle particularly during exercise. However, the physiological relevance of LDH remains poorly understood. Here we show that Ldhb expression is induced by exercise in human muscle and negatively correlated with changes in intramuscular pH levels, a marker of lactate production, during isometric exercise. We found that the expression of Ldhb is regulated by exercise-induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). Ldhb gene promoter reporter studies demonstrated that PGC-1α activates Ldhb gene expression through multiple conserved estrogen-related receptor (ERR) and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) binding sites. Transgenic mice overexpressing Ldhb in muscle (muscle creatine kinase (MCK)-Ldhb) exhibited increased exercise performance and enhanced oxygen consumption during exercise. MCK-Ldhb muscle was shown to have enhanced mitochondrial enzyme activity and increased mitochondrial gene expression, suggesting an adaptive oxidative muscle transformation. In addition, mitochondrial respiration capacity was increased and lactate production decreased in MCK-Ldhb skeletal myotubes in culture. Together, these results identified a previously unrecognized Ldhb-driven alteration in muscle mitochondrial function and suggested a mechanism for the adaptive metabolic response induced by exercise training."

https://openalex.org/W2530051463,"Background Deficits in ambulatory function progress at heterogeneous rates among individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The resulting inherent variability in ambulatory outcomes has complicated the design of drug efficacy trials and clouded the interpretation of trial results. We developed a prediction model for 1-year change in the six minute walk distance (6MWD) among DMD patients, and compared its predictive value to that of commonly used prognostic factors (age, baseline 6MWD, and steroid use). Methods Natural history data were collected from DMD patients at routine follow up visits approximately every 6 months over the course of 2–5 years. Assessments included ambulatory function and steroid use. The annualized change in 6MWD (Δ6MWD) was studied between all pairs of visits separated by 8–16 months. Prediction models were developed using multivariable regression for repeated measures, and evaluated using cross-validation. Results Among n = 191 follow-up intervals (n = 39 boys), mean starting age was 9.4 years, mean starting 6MWD was 351.8 meters, and 75% had received steroids for at least one year. Over the subsequent 8–16 months, mean Δ6MWD was -37.0 meters with a standard deviation (SD) of 93.7 meters. Predictions based on a composite of age, baseline 6MWD, and steroid use explained 28% of variation in Δ6MWD (R2 = 0.28, residual SD = 79.4 meters). A broadened prognostic model, adding timed 10-meter walk/run, 4-stair climb, and rise from supine, as well as height and weight, significantly improved prediction, explaining 59% of variation in Δ6MWD after cross-validation (R2 = 0.59, residual SD = 59.7 meters). Conclusions A prognostic model incorporating timed function tests significantly improved prediction of 1-year changes in 6MWD. Explained variation was more than doubled compared to predictions based only on age, baseline 6MWD, and steroid use. There is significant potential for composite prognostic models to inform DMD clinical trials and clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2530898742,"Photolyase is a blue-light-activated enzyme that repairs ultraviolet-induced DNA damage that occurs in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts. Previous studies on microbial photolyases have revealed an electron-tunneling pathway that is critical for the repair mechanism. In this study, we used femtosecond spectroscopy to deconvolute seven electron-transfer reactions in 10 elementary steps in all classes of CPD photolyases. We report a unified electron-transfer pathway through a conserved structural configuration that bifurcates to favor direct tunneling in prokaryotes and a two-step hopping mechanism in eukaryotes. Both bifurcation routes are operative, but their relative contributions, dictated by the reduction potentials of the flavin cofactor and the substrate, determine the overall quantum yield of repair."
https://openalex.org/W2531779082,"Hepatoblastoma (HB) is associated with aberrant activation of the β-catenin and Hippo/YAP signaling pathways. Overexpression of mutant β-catenin and YAP in mice induces HBs that express high levels of c-Myc (Myc). In light of recent observations that Myc is unnecessary for long-term hepatocyte proliferation, we have now examined its role in HB pathogenesis using the above model. Although Myc was found to be dispensable for in vivo HB initiation, it was necessary to sustain rapid tumor growth. Gene expression profiling identified key molecular differences between myc+/+ (WT) and myc−/− (KO) hepatocytes and HBs that explain these behaviors. In HBs, these included both Myc-dependent and Myc-independent increases in families of transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins, non-structural factors affecting ribosome assembly and function, and enzymes catalyzing glycolysis and lipid bio-synthesis. In contrast, transcripts encoding enzymes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation were mostly down-regulated. Myc-independent metabolic changes associated with HBs included dramatic reductions in mitochondrial mass and oxidative function, increases in ATP content and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, and marked inhibition of fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO). Myc-dependent metabolic changes included higher levels of neutral lipid and acetyl-CoA in WT tumors. The latter correlated with higher histone H3 acetylation. Collectively, our results indicate that the role of Myc in HB pathogenesis is to impose mutually dependent changes in gene expression and metabolic reprogramming that are unattainable in non-transformed cells and that cooperate to maximize tumor growth."

Given suboptimal cluster resolution achieved with 24-locus mycobacterium interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU-24) genotyping, the added value of whole genome sequencing was explored. MIRU-24 profiles of all Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture-confirmed tuberculosis cases diagnosed between 2009 and 2013 in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, were examined and clusters identified. The relatedness of cases within the largest MIRU-24 clusters was assessed using whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. Of 1841 culture-confirmed TB cases, 91.9% (1692/1841) had complete demographic and genotyping data. East-African Indian (474; 28.0%) and Beijing (470; 27.8%) lineage strains predominated. The overall rate of MIRU-24 clustering was 20.1% (340/1692) and was highest among Beijing lineage strains (35.7%; 168/470). One Beijing and three East-African Indian (EAI) clonal complexes were responsible for the majority of observed clusters. Whole genome sequencing of the 4 largest clusters (30 isolates) demonstrated diverse single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within identified clusters. All sequenced EAI strains and 70% of Beijing lineage strains clustered by MIRU-24 typing demonstrated distinct SNP profiles. The superior resolution provided by whole genome sequencing demonstrated limited M. tuberculosis transmission within NSW, even within identified MIRU-24 clusters. Routine whole genome sequencing could provide valuable public health guidance in low burden settings."

https://openalex.org/W2530644266,"Endometrial cancer is one of the most common malignancies of the reproductive female tract, with endometrioid endometrial cancer being the most frequent type. Despite the relatively favourable prognosis in cases of endometrial cancer, there is a necessity to evaluate clinical and prognostic utility of new molecular markers. MiRNAs are small, non-coding RNA molecules that take part in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Altered expression of miRNAs may be associated with cancer initiation, progression and metastatic capabilities. MiRNA-205 seems to be one of the key regulators of gene expression in endometrial cancer. In this study, we investigated clinical and prognostic role of miRNA-205 in endometrioid endometrial cancer. After total RNA extraction from 100 archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to define miRNA-205 expression levels. The aim of the study was to evaluate miRNA-205 expression levels in regard to patients' clinical and histopathological features, such as: survival rate, recurrence rate, staging, myometrial invasion, grading and lymph nodes involvement. Higher levels of miRNA-205 expression were observed in tumours with less than half of myometrial invasion and non-advanced cancers. Kaplan-Maier analysis revealed that higher levels of miRNA-205 were associated with better overall survival (p = 0,034). These results indicate potential clinical utility of miRNA-205 as a prognostic marker."
https://openalex.org/W2530980152,"We used genetic parentage analysis of 6200 potential parents and 5497 juvenile offspring to evaluate the relative reproductive success of hatchery and natural steelhead (Onchorhynchus mykiss) when spawning in the wild between 2008 and 2011 in the Wenatchee River, Washington. Hatchery fish originating from two prior generation hatchery parents had <20% of the reproductive success of natural origin spawners. In contrast, hatchery females originating from a cross between two natural origin parents of the prior generation had equivalent or better reproductive success than natural origin females. Males originating from such a cross had reproductive success of 26–93% that of natural males. The reproductive success of hatchery females and males from crosses consisting of one natural origin fish and one hatchery origin fish was 24–54% that of natural fish. The strong influence of hatchery broodstock origin on reproductive success confirms similar results from a previous study of a different population of the same species and suggests a genetic basis for the low reproductive success of hatchery steelhead, although environmental factors cannot be entirely ruled out. In addition to broodstock origin, fish size, return time, age, and spawning location were significant predictors of reproductive success. Our results indicate that incorporating natural fish into hatchery broodstock is clearly beneficial for improving subsequent natural spawning success, even in a population that has a decades-long history of hatchery releases, as is the case in the Wenatchee River."
https://openalex.org/W2531348745,"Objective The increasing incidence of thyroid nodules demands identification of risk factors for malignant disease. Several studies suggested the association of higher TSH levels with cancer, but influence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) is controversial. This study aimed to identify the relationship of thyroid cancer with higher TSH levels and hypovitaminosis D and to evaluate their influence on prognostic characteristics of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). Methods We retrospectively evaluated 433 patients submitted to thyroidectomy for thyroid nodules. Patients were categorized according to quartiles of TSH and 25OHD levels. Clinicopathological features were analyzed. Results Subjects with thyroid carcinomas were more frequently male and younger compared to those with benign disease. Their median TSH levels were higher and adjusted odds-ratio (OR) for cancer in the highest-quartile of TSH (> 2.4 mUI/mL) was 2.36 (1.36–4.09). Although vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was prevalent in our cohort (84%), no significant differences in 25OHD levels or quartile distribution were observed between benign and malignant cases. Among 187 patients with PTC, analyses of prognostic features revealed increased risk of lymph nodes metastases for subjects with highest-quartile TSH levels (OR = 3.7, p = 0.029). Decreased 25OHD levels were not overtly associated with poor prognosis in PTC. Conclusions In this cross-sectional cohort, higher TSH levels increased the risk of cancer in thyroid nodules and influenced its prognosis, particularly favoring lymph nodes metastases. On the other hand, no association was found between 25OHD levels and thyroid carcinoma risk or prognosis, suggesting that serum 25OHD determination may not contribute to risk assessment workup of thyroid nodules."

Additional structures of the complex with malate and of the apo form of GlcB supported that hypothesis. Comparative analysis of GlcB structures in complex with 18 fragments allowed us to characterize the preferred chemotypes and their binding modes.

GlcB knockdown and knock-out studies show that loss of malate synthase function results in clearing of M. tuberculosis in a mouse model of infection. 4S. Puckett, C. Trujillo, Z. Wang, H. Eoh, T. Ioerger, I. Krieger, J. Sacchettini, D. Schnappinger, K. Y. Rhee, and S. Ehrt, manuscript submitted for publication. GlcB generates malate and coenzyme A (CoA) from glyoxylate and acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) following the conversion of isocitrate to succinate and glyoxylate by ICL. Because of the essentiality of the glyoxylate shunt in infection and the absence of it in humans (19.Koonin E.V. Landweber L.F. Lipman D.J. Evolution of glyoxylate cycle enzymes in Metazoa: evidence of multiple horizontal transfer events and pseudogene formation.Biol. Direct. 2006; 1: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), both ICL and GlcB are attractive targets for drug discovery. Crystal structures of both glyoxylate-bound and product-bound GlcB show that there is no change between these two states either in the overall protein structure or in the active site (20.Smith C.V. Huang C.C. Miczak A. Russell D.G. Sacchettini J.C. Höner zu Bentrup K. Biochemical and structural studies of malate synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol.

Despite a well-defined active site, multiple efforts in virtual screening have failed to produce hits with reasonable activity (21Karumudi, B., Abdelkarim, H., Wan, B., Kim, M., Gutka, H., Mendonca, E., Brunsteiner, M., Franzblau, S. G., and Petukhov, P.

All known structures of GlcB to date have been obtained in complex with high affinity ligands (substrate, products, and PDKA inhibitors). This tends to stabilize a preferred protein conformation, limiting any computational docking or design to one defined state. To advance our lead development efforts on M. tuberculosis GlcB, we used a fragment-based approach resulting in the discovery of diverse binding chemotypes; we incorporated one novel interaction observed between the indole-containing fragments and GlcB into the existing PDKA series of inhibitors. The resulting molecule was 100 times more potent than the parent PDKA and was shown to make the predicted interactions as well as induce the same movement in the active site as the parent fragment. Unexpectedly, the structures of malate synthase with this group of fragments captured previously unobserved conformations of the enzyme. These structures revealed a second portal to the buried active site that we hypothesized is used for substrate/product exchange. It prompted us to solve additional structures of the enzyme at various stages of product formation and dissociation as well as an apo enzyme structure. As a result, we propose a mechanism driving substrate/product exchange during catalysis. Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) (22.Niesen F.H. Berglund H. Vedadi M.

The library consisted of 757 compounds from the Maybridge MB RO3 fragment library extended by Chris Abell (Cambridge, UK) with a number of fragments with under-represented bioactive scaffolds and ring systems. It also contained 823 compounds from the Enamine Building Blocks collection picked based on the lead-like set from the ZINC 8 database (36.Irwin J.J. Shoichet B.K. ZINC—a free database of commercially available compounds for virtual screening.J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2005; 45: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). The fragments were filtered by molecular weight (<300), Tanimoto similarity (23.Butina D.

Sci. 1999; 39: 747-750Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and intrinsic reactivity. The final set of 1580 fragments had a Tanimoto similarity threshold of 0.46. Binding was determined by analyzing the shift in the melting temperature (Tm) of GlcB after incubation with fragments. Free GlcB unfolds at 50–55 °C, and the addition of substrates acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate resulted in ΔTm values of 2.5 and 4 °C, respectively. A known inhibitor, 2-bromo-PDKA (11.Krieger I.V.

The ΔTm from the screen ranged between −3.2 and 8.6 °C. 65 fragments were selected as “hits” based on a ΔTm of greater than 3 °C (Table 1 shows hits that resulted in GlcB complex crystal structures, and the rest of the hits are listed in supplemental Table S1). Examination of the chemical structures of the hits showed that all had at least one substituted aromatic ring, which included five-membered rings such as pyrrole, thiophene, and furan; six-membered rings such as benzene, pyridine, and pyrimidine; and fused ring systems such as naphthalene, indole, and thienopyrrole. In fact, more than half were substituted diaryl or triaryl compounds. The rings contained a wide variety of substituents including halogens, hydroxyls, alkyl groups, nitrile groups, acyl groups, and amine groups. Compared with the library, the hits were enriched for compounds with highly conjugated ring systems appended with carboxylate substitutions.TABLE 1Chemical structure and ΔTm for fragments with GlcB-complexed crystal structures Open table in a new tab We attempted to determine the crystal structures for all 65 hits complexed with GlcB using both co-crystallization and soaking, however, only 18 fragments resulted in structures. The chemical structures and ΔTm values of these 18 fragments are shown in Table 1. All 18 structures were determined to relatively high resolution (1.8–2.5 Å) and had clear density for the ligand (example in Fig. 1; omit Fo − Fc difference electron density maps for each fragment shown in supplemental Fig. S1 and Fig. 2). Fragment 10 has an extra electron density peak (∼2.4 σ on the 2Fo − Fc map) within covalent bond distance of carboxylate Cα (supplemental Fig. S2E). The extra density likely arises from an alternative conformation of the carboxylate, but there was insufficient information in the data to build it. In all other cases, observed electron density agreed with the chemical structures of the fragments.FIGURE 2.A, a close-up of the active site with a superposition of GlcB crystal structures complexed with PDKA (white) and fragment 11 (cyan) displaying protein surface. The black arrows indicate changes upon binding of the Group 2 fragments: the widening of the cavity behind the active site Mg2+, the narrowing mouth of the main tunnel caused by the movement of the CoA binding loop (details are shown in B), and an additional portal to the solvent with the active site lid opening (details are shown in C).

Domain I is an 8α/8β TIM barrel (residues 115–134 and 266–557), domain II is formed at the C terminus (residues 591–727) and contains mostly helices, and domain III is rich in β-strands and inserted between α1 and β2 of the TIM barrel (residues 135–265). The active site is an ∼20 Å-long tunnel located at the interface of the TIM barrel and a loop comprising residues 616–633 of domain II. A Mg2+ ion required for activity is bound at the bottom of the active site tunnel in an octahedral coordination by one oxygen each from the carboxylate side chains of Glu-434 and Asp-462, two water molecules, and two oxygens of glyoxylate. All 18 fragments bind in the active site in positions overlapping with the positions of glyoxylate, malate, and CoA and utilizing many of the interactions responsible for substrate recognition. The major difference common to all fragment:GlcB complex structures compared with substrate- and inhibitor-complexed is the conformational change in the CoA binding loop (residues 619–633). The CoA binding loop moves “in,” narrowing the active site tunnel by ∼2.5 Å (2.5–2.7 Å measured at the Glu-632 Cα across all fragment complex structures compared to glyoxylate bond structure). Fragment-bound structures display a slight widening of the cavity behind the active site Mg2+ ion compared with the GlcB-glyoxylate, GlcB-malate-CoA, and GlcB-PDKA structures. This is caused by the movements of the Glu-434 and Asp-462 side chain carboxylates (0.4–0.5 Å measured at coordinating oxygen atoms) away from the Mg2+ ion. Fig. 2 shows a comparison between the “in,” or narrow, and “out” substrate/inhibitor-bound conformations in the GlcB crystal structures. Although all of the fragment-bound GlcB structures share the “in” CoA binding loop conformation, they show two distinct conformations for the region made by residues 458–462. Five of the hits (Fragments 1–5) show this region in a conformation very similar to the substrate/inhibitor-bound structures. In the other 13 fragment structures, this region, which we now refer to as the active site lid, undergoes a major conformational change. The lid is located at the end of the α-helix corresponding to αH in the Escherichia coli MSG structure (Protein Data Bank code 1D8C (25.Howard B.R. Endrizzi J.A. Remington S.J. Crystal structure of Escherichia coli malate synthase G complexed with magnesium and glyoxylate at 2.0 Å resolution: mechanistic implications.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3156-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)). It is part of the active site cleft and is in close proximity to the Mg2+ ion with one oxygen of the carboxylate of Asp-462 participating in Mg2+ coordination. The observed conformational change between closed and open requires the last residue of the αH α-helix (Phe-460) to unwind to a coiled conformation. The backbone carbonyl of Thr-458 moves about 1 Å toward the new opening and swings up 60° toward the Mg2+ ion followed by the largest transition in the next two residues, 459 and 460. The Gly-459 backbone rotates ∼70° and moves 3 Å away from the Mg2+ ion, and the Phe-460 backbone moves 2.5 Å (measured at the carbonyl oxygen), and its side chain flips by 4 Å (measured at Cγ). The large conformational change of the active site lid ultimately creates a solvent-accessible portal that is ∼7 Å in diameter, distal to the CoA binding tunnel entrance, and very close to the Mg2+ ion as shown in Fig. 2. We divided 18 fragments into two main groups based on the conformation of the enzyme to which they bind. Group 1 (fragments 1–5) bound GlcB structures retain a closed active site lid conformation, and Group 2 (fragments 6–18) induces an open lid conformation. Group-specific interactions with the active site are shown in Fig. 3. Interactions made by each individual fragment can be examined in supplemental Figs. S3 and S4. All fragments share one prominent interaction with the GlcB active site: aromatic rings bind to a hydrophobic pocket between the side chains of Met-515 and Met-631, in the same manner as the phenyl ring of the PDKA inhibitor. The observation that PDKA with the benzyl ring replaced by cyclohexyl loses its inhibitory activity underlines the importance of these interactions. This part of the active site accommodates a pantothenate group of CoA in the product-bound structures. The rings of most of the fragments in the set contain groups that could interact with the Mg2+ such as carboxylates and hydroxyls, but only five fragments (1–4 and 18) were observed to directly interact with the Mg2+ ion. Although no obvious chemical features distinguish the fragments of Group 1 from Group 2, patterns of protein interactions discriminate between the two groups. Most Group 1 fragments contribute either one or two oxygens to the coordination of Mg2+ much like we observed for glyoxylate and the PDKA inhibitors (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3, A–D). Fragment 5 is the only one in this group that does not directly coordinate Mg2+; instead, its carboxylate oxygens hydrogen bond with two water molecules from the Mg2+ coordination sphere (supplemental Fig. S3E). Group 1 fragments interact with the side chains of the catalytic residues Asp-633 and Arg-339, which in turn contribute hydrogen bonds to maintain the Mg2+ coordination sphere in a second and first order interaction, respectively. With fragments 3, 4, and 5, the distance to Asp-633 Oδ is 2.5–2.9 Å, fragment 2 interacts with the backbone nitrogen of Asp-633 at dO-N = 3.0 Å, fragment 1 makes van der Waals contact with Oδ at dO-C = 3.2 Å, and the distance from the fragments of this group to Arg-339 is dO-Nω =2.7–2.9 Å. In addition, all Group 1 fragments interact with the amino acids of the active site lid, further stabilizing the closed conformation. Fragments 2 and 3 directly interact through hydrogen bonds with the backbone nitrogens of Leu-461 and Asp-462 at dO-N = 2.9 and 3.0 Å for both fragments. The rest of the group (fragments 1, 4, and 5) hydrogen bond with these residues via ordered water molecules. Although the Group 2 fragments also maintain their aromatic rings in the hydrophobic pocket, in contrast to Group 1, none of the 13 fragments of Group 2 coordinate Mg2+. Fragment 18 binds Mg2+ with its acid moiety in a bidentate manner. The distances between the oxygens and the metal longer than optimal for coordinating (2.4 and 2.42 Å). In addition, most of the Group 2 fragments do not hydrogen bond with catalytic residues Asp-633 and Arg-399. Moreover, the majority of Group 2 have no direct interactions with the residues of the active site lid. Instead, ring substituents from this group hydrogen bond primarily with ordered water molecules that gained access through the opening and were not observed in the closed lid conformation of the enzyme. This water-mediated extensive hydrogen bond network appears to stabilize the open lid conformation as shown in Fig. 3, B and C. For example, the carboxylate oxygen of fragment 7 interacts with a water molecule (hydrogen bond distance, 2.6 Å), which in turn hydrogen bonds to the backbone nitrogens of Phe-460 and Leu-461 (at distances of 3.1 and 2.9 Å) (supplemental Fig. S4B). The interactions discussed above allowed us to specify which structural features distinguish the two groups of fragments. Most Group 1 fragments have a linker of four to five atoms between the aromatic ring and the Mg2+ binding group similar to PDKA inhibitors, which have a four-carbon linker. Given that the hydrophobic interactions with the Met-631 and Met-515 side chains position the aromatic rings of all the ligands in approximately the same part of the active site, the distance between Mg2+ and the closest carbon of the fragment ring ranges between 6.3 and 8.4 Å. The four- to five-atom linkers in fragments 1–4 allowed them to successfully span this distance. Although Group 2 fragments contain carboxylate, nitrile, hydroxyl, and diazole groups, all of which could bind to Mg2+, these substituents are spaced closer to the aromatic ring than in Group 1. For seven of the 13 Group 2 fragments (6–8, 11, 13, 14, and 17), it is only one carbon away from the aromatic ring. Hence, it appears that the spacing and positioning of potential hydrogen-bonding and/or Mg2+-coordinating substituents on the aromatic moiety of the ligand and not their nature define their preference for a particular enzyme conformation. Halogen substituents on the aromatic ring appear to be beneficial for binding affinity. For example, benzoic acid with three halogen substituents (5.Howard N. Abell C. Blakemore W. Chessari G. Congreve M. Howard S. Jhoti H. Murray C.W. Seavers L.C. van Montfort R.L. Application of fragment screening and fragment linking to the discovery of novel thrombin inhibitors.J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) gives a 3.3 °C shift in melting temperature, whereas neither single fluorine-substituted nor doubly chlorine- and methyl group-substituted benzoic acid binds. Another feature enhancing the interaction of the aromatic moiety with this hydrophobic pocket is the hydrogen bond donor included in the ring or ring system. Seven of 13 fragments in Group 2 were separated into subgroup 2.1 as they all make a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Met-631 (dN-O = 2.6–3.2 Å; Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S4, A–G), resulting in a relatively high ΔTm ranging between 4.6 and 8.6 °C. Interestingly, the crystal structure of GlcB in complex with 14 indicated two molecules of the fragment bound to the active site (supplemental Fig. S4I). Fragment 14 is a trisubstituted phenyl moiety with nitrile, hydroxyl, and chloro substitutions at the 1-, 2-, and 5-positions, respectively. One molecule of 14 binds in the hydrophobic pocket of the active site similarly to the other fragments, forming hydrogen bonds with three ordered water molecules via its hydroxyl oxygen and a fourth water molecule with its nitrile nitrogen (hydrogen bond distances, 2.7–3.0 Å). The other fragment binds 4.1 Å away near the entrance of the tunnel in the hydrophobic pocket formed by Pro-120, Phe-126, and Met-631 and interacts with one water molecule via a hydrogen bond to its hydroxyl oxygen (2.8 Å). This is the only molecule from the set which binds far from the Mg2+, to the active site tunnel entrance where the adenine ring of acetyl-CoA binds. The information about interactions can be used for extending inhibitors into that part of the active site in the future. Fragment 15 also presents interactions along the path the CoA pantetheinyl moiety follows in the active site. The fragment is phenyl-substituted with a thioacrylate tail, which provides a linker long enough to reach from the hydrophobic pocket to the Mg2+. It is similar to fragment 1 without the chlorine on the ring and with a double bond in the linker. However, the crystal structure of the 15-bound GlcB (supplemental Fig. S4J) shows that the thioacrylate tail actually points in the opposite direction from the Mg2+ with one of the carboxylate oxygens forming a hydrogen bond with a water molecule and both carboxylate oxygens forming van der Waals interactions with the backbone carbonyls of Pro-543 and Met-631 (2.6 and 3.0 Å, respectively). The relatively large and hydrophobic sulfur atom and the double bond in the linker is the likely cause of this positioning in the active site; it favors the hydrophobic side of the tunnel over the highly polar Mg2+ surroundings. Fragment 18 belongs to Group 2 because it binds to the open lid form, but it has the full set of interactions characteristic of Group 1. It interacts with both catalytic residues, Asp-633 and Arg-339: the nitrogen and two carbons of the thiazolidine ring engage the carboxylate oxygen of the Asp-633 side chain via hydrogen bond (dN-O = 3.1 Å) and forms van der Waals interactions (dC-O = 3.1 Å), and one of its carboxylate oxygens forms a hydrogen bond with one of the Arg-339 side chain nitrogens (dO-N = 2.7 Å). Moreover, its two carboxylate oxygens interact with Mg2+"

Antisera specific for the C-terminal end of the human and mouse VGF proteins, respectively, were used in immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while gel chromatography and HPLC/ESI-MS/MS were used to identify the VGF peptides present. Immunoreactive VGF C-terminus peptides were reduced in both fibroblast and plasma samples from ALS patients in an advanced stage of the disease. In the G93A-SOD1 mice, the same VGF peptides were also decreased in plasma in the late-symptomatic stage, while showing an earlier down-regulation in the spinal cord. In immunohistochemistry, a large number of gray matter structures were VGF C-terminus immunoreactive in control mice (including nerve terminals, axons and a few perikarya identified as motoneurons), with a striking reduction already in the pre-symptomatic stage. Through gel chromatography and spectrometry analysis, we identified one form likely to be the VGF precursor as well as peptides containing the NAPP- sequence in all tissues studied, while in the mice and fibroblasts, we revealed also AQEE- and TLQP- peptides. Taken together, selective VGF fragment depletion may participate in disease onset and/or progression of ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2530974147,"Hyperinsulinemia, which is associated with aging and metabolic disease, may lead to defective protein homeostasis (proteostasis) due to hyperactivation of insulin-sensitive pathways such as protein synthesis. We investigated the effect of chronic hyperinsulinemia on proteostasis by generating a time-resolved map of insulin-regulated protein turnover in adipocytes using metabolic pulse-chase labeling and high resolution mass spectrometry. Hyperinsulinemia increased the synthesis of nearly half of all detected proteins and did not affect protein degradation despite suppressing autophagy. Unexpectedly, this marked elevation in protein synthesis was accompanied by enhanced protein stability and folding and not by markers of proteostasis stress such as protein carbonylation and aggregation. The improvement in proteostasis was attributed to a coordinate up-regulation of proteins in the global proteostasis network, including ribosomal, proteasomal, chaperone, and endoplasmic reticulum/mitochondrial unfolded protein response proteins. We conclude that defects associated with hyperactivation of the insulin signaling pathway are unlikely attributed to defective proteostasis because up-regulation of protein synthesis by insulin is accompanied by up-regulation of proteostatic machinery."

https://openalex.org/W2530074766,"Iron overload cardiomyopathy remains the major cause of death in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. Cardiac T2* magnetic resonance imaging is costly yet effective in detecting cardiac iron accumulation in the heart. Heart rate variability (HRV) has been used to evaluate cardiac autonomic function and is depressed in cases of thalassemia. We evaluated whether HRV could be used as an indicator for early identification of cardiac iron deposition.One hundred and one patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia were enrolled in this study. The correlation between recorded HRV and hemoglobin, non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI), serum ferritin and cardiac T2* were evaluated.The median age was 18 years (range 8-59 years). The patient group with a 5-year mean serum ferritin >5,000 ng/mL included significantly more homozygous β-thalassemia and splenectomized patients, had lower hemoglobin levels, and had more cardiac iron deposit than all other groups. Anemia strongly influenced all domains of HRV. After adjusting for anemia, neither serum ferritin nor NTBI impacted the HRV. However cardiac T2* was an independent predictor of HRV, even after adjusting for anemia. For receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of cardiac T2* ≤20 ms, only mean ferritin in the last 12 months and the average of the standard deviation of all R-R intervals for all five-minute segments in the 24-hour recording were predictors for cardiac T2* ≤20 ms, with area under the ROC curve of 0.961 (p<0.0001) and 0.701 (p = 0.05), respectively.Hemoglobin and cardiac T2* as significant predictors for HRV indicate that anemia and cardiac iron deposition result in cardiac autonomic imbalance. The mean ferritin in the last 12 months could be useful as the best indicator for further evaluation of cardiac risk. The ability of serum ferritin to predict cardiac risk is stronger than observed in other thalassemia cohorts. HRV might be a stronger predictor of cardiac iron in study populations with lower somatic iron burdens and greater prevalence of cardiac iron deposition."

https://openalex.org/W2531780604,"The ubiquitous second messenger cAMP mediates signal transduction processes in the malarial parasite that regulate host erythrocyte invasion and the proliferation of merozoites. In Plasmodium falciparum, the central receptor for cAMP is the single regulatory subunit (R) of protein kinase A (PKA). To aid the development of compounds that can selectively dysregulate parasite PKA signaling, we solved the structure of the PKA regulatory subunit in complex with cAMP and a related analogue that displays antimalarial activity, (Sp)-2-Cl-cAMPS. Prior to signaling, PKA-R holds the kinase's catalytic subunit (C) in an inactive state by exerting an allosteric inhibitory effect. When two cAMP molecules bind to PKA-R, they stabilize a structural conformation that facilitates its dissociation, freeing PKA-C to phosphorylate downstream substrates such as apical membrane antigen 1. Although PKA activity was known to be necessary for erythrocytic proliferation, we show that uncontrolled induction of PKA activity using membrane-permeable agonists is equally disruptive to growth."
https://openalex.org/W2536375018,"As pathogenic bacteria become resistant to traditional antibiotics, alternate approaches such as designing and testing new potent selective antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are increasingly attractive. However, whereas much is known regarding the relationship between the AMP sequence and potency, less research has focused on developing links between AMP properties, such as design and structure, with mechanisms. Here we use four natural AMPs of varying known secondary structures and mechanisms of lipid bilayer disruption as controls to determine the mechanisms of four rationally designed AMPs with similar secondary structures and rearranged amino acid sequences. Using a Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation, we were able to differentiate between molecular models of AMP actions such as barrel-stave pore formation, toroidal pore formation, and peptide insertion mechanisms by quantifying differential frequencies throughout an oscillating supported lipid bilayer. Barrel-stave pores were identified by uniform frequency modulation, whereas toroidal pores possessed characteristic changes in oscillation frequency throughout the bilayer. The resulting modes of action demonstrate that rearrangement of an amino acid sequence of the AMP resulted in identical overall mechanisms, and that a given secondary structure did not necessarily predict mechanism. Also, increased mass addition to Gram-positive mimetic membranes from AMP disruption corresponded with lower minimum inhibitory concentrations against the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus."
https://openalex.org/W2512277447,"Previous studies suggest a significant role of language in the court room, yet none has identified a definitive correlation between vocal characteristics and court outcomes. This paper demonstrates that voice-based snap judgments based solely on the introductory sentence of lawyers arguing in front of the Supreme Court of the United States predict outcomes in the Court. In this study, participants rated the opening statement of male advocates arguing before the Supreme Court between 1998 and 2012 in terms of masculinity, attractiveness, confidence, intelligence, trustworthiness, and aggressiveness. We found significant correlation between vocal characteristics and court outcomes and the correlation is specific to perceived masculinity even when judgment of masculinity is based only on less than three seconds of exposure to a lawyer's speech sample. Specifically, male advocates are more likely to win when they are perceived as less masculine. No other personality dimension predicts court outcomes. While this study does not aim to establish any causal connections, our findings suggest that vocal characteristics may be relevant in even as solemn a setting as the Supreme Court of the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2530845791,"The effects of tobacco smoke, mild/moderate COPD disease and their combined effect on health status (HS), body composition (BC), and exercise capacity (EC) impairment are still unclear. We hypothesized that smoking and early COPD have a joint negative influence on these outcomes. We evaluated 32 smokers (smoking history >10 pack/years), 32 mild/moderate COPD (current smokers or former smokers), and 32 never smokers. All individuals underwent medical and smoking status evaluations, pre and post-bronchodilator spirometry, BC [fat-free mass (FFM) and FFM index (FFMI)], EC [six-minute walk distance (6MWD)] and HS [Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)]. FFM (p = 0.02) and FFMI (p = 0.008) were lower in COPD than never smokers. 6MWT, as a percentage of reference values for the Brazilian population, was lower in COPD and smokers than never smokers (p = 0.01). Smokers showed worse SF-36 score for functional capacity than never smokers (p<0.001). SF-36 score for physical functioning (p<0.001) and role-emotional (p<0.001) were impaired in COPD patients than smokers. SF-36 scores for physical functioning (p<0.001), role-physical (p = 0.01), bodily pain (p = 0.01), vitality (p = 0.04) and role-emotional (p<0.001) were lower in COPD than never smokers. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that both COPD diagnosis and smoking were inversely associated with FFMI, 6MWD and HS. Smoking and early COPD have a joint negative influence on body composition, exercise capacity and health status."
https://openalex.org/W2530845805,"Fossil fuel combustion and fertilizer use has increased the amount of biologically available N entering terrestrial ecosystems. Nonetheless, our understanding of how anthropogenic N may alter the physiological mechanisms by which soil microorganisms cycle N in soil is still developing. Here, we applied shotgun metagenomics to a replicated long-term field experiment to determine how two decades of experimental N deposition, at a rate expected by mid-century, has affected the genetic potential of the soil microbial community to cycle N in soils. Experimental N deposition lead to a significant and persistent increase in functional assemblages mediating N cycle transformations associated with ecosystem N loss (i.e., denitrification and nitrification), whereas functional assemblages associated with N input and retention (i.e., N fixation and microbial N assimilation) were less positively affected. Furthermore, the abundance and composition of microbial taxa, as well as functional assemblages involved in housekeeping functions (i.e., DNA replication) were unaffected by experimental N deposition. Taken together, our results suggest that functional genes and gene pathways associated with ecosystem N loss have been favored by experimental N deposition, which may represent a genetic mechanism fostering increased N loss as anthropogenic N deposition increases in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2531680287,"Glycan biosynthesis occurs mainly in Golgi. Molecular organization and functional regulation of this process are not well understood. We evaluated the extrinsic effect of lectin domains (β-trefoil fold) of polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (ppGalNAc-Ts) on catalytic activity of glycosyltransferases during O-GalNAc glycan biosynthesis. The presence of lectin domain T3lec or T4lec during ppGalNAc-T2 and ppGalNAc-T3 catalytic reaction had a clear inhibitory effect on GalNAc-T activity. Interaction of T3lec or T4lec with ppGalNAc-T2 catalytic domain was not mediated by carbohydrate. T3lec, but not T2lec and T4lec, had a clear activating effect on Drosophila melanogaster core 1 galactosyltransferase enzyme activity and a predominant inhibitory effect on in vivo human core 1 glycan biosynthesis. The regulatory role of the β-trefoil fold of ppGalNAc-Ts in enzymatic activity of glycosyltransferases involved in the O-glycan biosynthesis pathway, described here for the first time, helps clarify the mechanism of biosynthesis of complex biopolymers (such as glycans) that is not template-driven."

https://openalex.org/W2531069716,"Insect outbreaks often occur synchronously across large spatial scales, but the long-term temporal stability of the phenomenon and the mechanisms behind it are not well understood. In this study, I use a widespread lepidopteran defoliator native to western North America-the western spruce budworm-as a case study to explore patterns of and potential causes for synchronous population fluctuations. Analyses of synchrony are typically severely limited by the short historical records available for many species. To overcome this limitation, I compiled multi-century dendrochronological reconstructions of western spruce budworm outbreaks from across much of the species' range. This allowed me to analyze synchrony at a sub-continental spatial scale over the last three centuries. I found statistically significant synchrony among regional outbreak records up to 2,000 km apart and identified numerous outbreak periods that occurred synchronously across much of the species' range. I quantified spatial and temporal associations between climate and synchronous outbreak periods using paleoclimate reconstructions. The spatial patterns of outbreak histories and climate records were remarkably similar, with higher similarity in outbreak histories apparent between regions with more similar climate conditions. Synchronous outbreaks typically occurred during periods of average or above average moisture availability preceded by periods of low moisture availability. My results suggest that climatic variability has played a key role in synchronizing western spruce budworm population fluctuations in disjunct forests across western North America for at least the last three centuries. Widespread synchrony appears to be a natural part of this species' population dynamics, though synchronous outbreaks have occurred more frequently during the 20th century than during prior centuries. This study uses a novel combination of statistical methods and dendrochronological data to provide analyses of this species' population dynamics with an unprecedented combination of spatial extent and temporal depth."
https://openalex.org/W2531570648,"Background Integrated care for older persons with complex care needs is widely advocated. Particularly professionals and policy makers have positive expectations. Care outcome results are ambiguous. Receiver and provider satisfaction is relevant but still poorly understood. Methods During implementation of integrated care in residential homes (The MOVIT project), we compared general satisfaction and satisfaction with specific aspects of General Practitioner (GP) care in older persons and GPs before (cohort I) and after at least 12 months of implementation (cohort II). Results The general satisfaction score for GP care given by older persons does not change (Cohort I (n = 762) mean score 8.0 (IQR:7.0–9.0) vs. Cohort II (n = 505) mean score 8.0 (IQR:7.0–8.0);P = 0.01). Expressions of general satisfaction in GPs do not show consistent change (Cohort I (n = 87) vs Cohort II (n = 66), percentage satisfied about; role as GP, 56% vs 67%;P = 0.194, ability to provide personal care, 60% vs 67%;P = 0.038, quality of care, 54% vs 62%;P = 0.316). Satisfaction in older persons about some specific aspects of care do show change; GP-patient relationship, points 61.6 vs 63.3;P = 0.001, willingness to talk about mistakes, score 3.47 vs 3.73;P = 0.001, information received about drugs, score 2.79 vs 2.46;P = 0.002. GPs also report changes in specific aspects: percentage satisfied about multidisciplinary meetings; occurrence, 21% vs 53%;P = <0.001, GP presence, 12% vs 41%;P = <0.001, and participation, 29% vs.51%;P = 0.046. Conclusion General satisfaction about care received and provided shows no consistent change in older persons and GPs during the implementation of integrated care. Specific changes in satisfaction are found. These show an emphasis on inter-personal aspects in older persons and organizational aspects in GPs."

https://openalex.org/W2531264409,"Members of the calcitonin peptide family—calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), adrenomedullin (AM), and adrenomedullin2/intermedin (IMD)–exert modulatory effects upon monocytes and macrophages of various extrapulmonary origins. Utilizing the rat alveolar macrophage (AMφ) cell line NR8383, we here set out to determine to which extent these three peptides and their receptors are differentially regulated in AMφ and what specific effects they have on AMφ key functions. LPS treatment differentially up-regulated expression of the peptides and receptors. Among the three peptides, IMD mRNA content was lowest both in primary rat AMφ and NR8383 cells, whereas IMD peptide dominated in basal and LPS-stimulated secretion from NR8383 cells. Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis and TNF-α production were inhibited by AM, IMD, and CGRP, whereas pro-IL-1β mRNA was slightly down-regulated exclusively by CGRP. Neither of these peptides affected IL-6 or IL-10 production. None increased intracellular calcium concentration, but AM significantly inhibited store-operated calcium entry. In conclusion, the rat AMφ cell line NR8383 is both a source and a target of the calcitonin peptide family members AM, IMD, and CGRP. Despite sharing proteins of the receptor complexes, AM, IMD, and CGRP each showed a characteristic pattern of effects and regulation, suggesting that these closely related peptides are not just redundant members of one common signaling pathway but act in concert by addressing parallel signaling cascades. Since peptide and receptor expression are up-regulated by LPS, these signaling pathways might act as inhibitory feedback mechanisms in pulmonary bacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W2530491646,"Restoring all facility operations after the 2001 Amerithrax attacks took years to complete, highlighting the need to reduce remediation time. Some of the most time intensive tasks were environmental sampling and sample analyses. Composite sampling allows disparate samples to be combined, with only a single analysis needed, making it a promising method to reduce response times. We developed a statistical experimental design to test three different composite sampling methods: 1) single medium single pass composite (SM-SPC): a single cellulose sponge samples multiple coupons with a single pass across each coupon; 2) single medium multi-pass composite: a single cellulose sponge samples multiple coupons with multiple passes across each coupon (SM-MPC); and 3) multi-medium post-sample composite (MM-MPC): a single cellulose sponge samples a single surface, and then multiple sponges are combined during sample extraction. Five spore concentrations of Bacillus atrophaeus Nakamura spores were tested; concentrations ranged from 5 to 100 CFU/coupon (0.00775 to 0.155 CFU/cm2). Study variables included four clean surface materials (stainless steel, vinyl tile, ceramic tile, and painted dry wallboard) and three grime coated/dirty materials (stainless steel, vinyl tile, and ceramic tile). Analysis of variance for the clean study showed two significant factors: composite method (p< 0.0001) and coupon material (p = 0.0006). Recovery efficiency (RE) was higher overall using the MM-MPC method compared to the SM-SPC and SM-MPC methods. RE with the MM-MPC method for concentrations tested (10 to 100 CFU/coupon) was similar for ceramic tile, dry wall, and stainless steel for clean materials. RE was lowest for vinyl tile with both composite methods. Statistical tests for the dirty study showed RE was significantly higher for vinyl and stainless steel materials, but lower for ceramic tile. These results suggest post-sample compositing can be used to reduce sample analysis time when responding to a Bacillus anthracis contamination event of clean or dirty surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2531458898,"Nilotinib and imatinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). In vitro, imatinib and nilotinib inhibit osteoclastogenesis, and in patients they reduce levels of bone resorption. One of the mechanisms that might underlie these effects is an increase in the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG). In the current work we report that platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) signaling regulates OPG production in vitro. In addition, we have shown that TKIs have effects on RANKL signaling through inhibition of the PDGFRβ and other target receptors. These findings have implications for our understanding of the mechanisms by which TKIs affect osteoclastogenesis, and the role of PDGFRβ signaling in regulating osteoclastogenesis. Further studies are indicated to confirm the clinical effects of PDGFRβ-inhibitors and to elaborate the intracellular pathways that underpin these effects."
