https://openalex.org/W1966833017,Hydroxyurea has a differential lethal effect on cultured Chinesehamster cells that are at different stages in their cell cycle. Cells synthesizing DNA at the time of exposure to the drug are lethally damaged. Cells in the phase of growth preceding DNA synthesis (G(1)) survive but are prevented from beginning DNA synthesis. Cells in the phase after DNA synthesis (G(2)) survive and appear to progress until just before the beginning of the next period of DNA synthesis. This differential lethal and inhibitory effect of hydroxyurea may be useful for synchronizing asynchronous cell populations and explaining effects of the drug in human therapy.
https://openalex.org/W1995688803,"The maximum velocities of microsaccades (flicks) are an increasing function of amplitude of movement. Measured velocities fall on the extrapolation of the curve of maximum velocity versus amplitude for voluntary saccades and involuntary corrective saccades. Hence all these movements are produced by a common physiological system, or the characteristics of the movements are determined by a single dynamically limiting element."
https://openalex.org/W2059408557,"Rats were deprived of paradoxical (radid eye movement or REM) sleep for a 6-day period but were allowed substantial non-REM (slow wave) sleep. Thresholds for electroconvulsive shock dropped significantly after deprivation in all these animals, but thresholds in control animals treated in a similar manner, but allowed REM sleep exhibited no change. Deprivation seems to heighten neural excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2061012292,"Eight young male subjects were permitted to sleep only 3 hours out of each 24 for 8 days. Electroencephalographic recordings were made during the 3-hour period of sleep. There was an increase in the amount of deep sleep (stage 4) during this period. On a recovery night, the first 6 hours revealed a significant increase in deep sleep, and beyond this period there was a sharp increase in stage 1-rapid eye movement sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2035944696,"Stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus, which induces eating, resembles hunger in that it motivates rats to learn, for food reward, a response of pressing a bar. The response is discriminatively confined to only a bar that delivers food on either a 100-percent or a partial schedule of reinforceinent. This discriminative responding can be transferred to hunger that is normally induced by deprivation of food."

https://openalex.org/W2003896339,Two isolated dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were provided with an electronic acoustic link during alternate periods of approximately 2 minutes. The dolphins repeatedly communicated in a tight sequence when the acoustic link was connected. Their responses varied as the experiment progressed. Some information regarding possible meaning of the whistles was obtained.

https://openalex.org/W2013723604,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase specific to the erythrocytes of each of two wild hares found in Europe was discerned by starch-gel electrophoresis at pH 7.0 and pH 8.6. The single, sharp band of the dehydrogenase of Lepus europaeus was faster than that of L. timidus, at both pH levels. The sex-linkage of this enzyme was tested through reciprocal hybrids between the two species. Each male hybrid had a single band of enzyme identical with that of its mother, while both parental types of this enzyme coexisted in female hybrids. Thus, sex-linkage of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase has been suggested not only in man and in the family Equidae, but now in the family Leporidae of placental mammals as well."
https://openalex.org/W2051651481,"Cooling with a thermoelectric cold probe, well localized in the region of the cochlea, produces a rapid, reversible decrease in the amplitude and increase in the latency of the action potential induced by clicks. These changes closely resemble those produced by reducing click intensity. Temperature also affects the amplitude of the cochlear microphonic, but the amount of change is considerably less than, and is poorly correlated with, the amplitlude change of the action potential. It is speculated that temperature may act on a hypothetical "" excitatory process"" in the cochlea, which comes after the cochlear microphonic in the sequence leading to production of the action potential of the auditory nerve."
https://openalex.org/W2024989579,"Analysis of the edible portion of vegetables and samples of green leaf tobacco failed to show polonium-210. The cured samples of leaf tobacco and the soils that were analyzed all contained small quantities of the element. Muck soils contained three times as much Po(210) as did mineral soils. Solutions used commonly to extract ""available"" forms of many mineral elements failed to extract a detectable amount of Po(2l0). Indications are that Po(210) or its radioactive precursors are not taken up from the soil directly by plant roots but rather by sorption in dead, moist plant materials at the atmosphere-plant interface."
https://openalex.org/W2056229898,"Human platelets and bovine lens fibers contain lactate dehydrogenase-3 (LDH-3) as the predominant isozyme but only very faint traces of LDH-5. Since the platelets and lens fibers, like mature human erythrocytes, lack a nucleus, the results strengthen the case for a previously developed association between LDH-5 and the cell nucleus. These three cell types are mainly anaerobic, and therefore their isozyme patterns are incompatible with the theory that anaerobic tissues exhibit predominantly LDH-5 and aerobic tissues mainly LDH-1."

https://openalex.org/W2070411981,"When succinate is used to protect rats against the toxicity of oxygen at high pressure, 100 percent survive, with normal or above normal concentrations of adenosine triphosphate being present in the cerebral hemisphere, liver, and kidney. In contrast, 90 percent of the nonprotected animals died during exposure. In corresponding tissues of surviving nonprotected animals adenosine triphosphate concentrations are markedly reduced."
https://openalex.org/W1989768566,"Parabiont rat pairs with a skin-vascular anastomosis were used to test for a radiation-induced transferable humoral factor which would motivate aversive conditioning in a nonirradiated (shielded) recipient. The shielded partner, by tasting saccharinflavored fluid shortly after its partner was x-irradiated (360 roentgens), was aversively conditioned to saccharin. This was interpreted as evidence for a humoral motivating factor."
https://openalex.org/W1963877913,"Antelope ground squirrels (Citellus leucurus) were able, after conditioning, to respond correctly to a port illuminated with light at a wavelength of 460 nanometers. This color randomly presented at one of two positions, was correctly selected in reference to a second port illuminated with light at 500, 520, 569, and 600 nanometers, or with white light of varying intensity. Luminosity was not a factor in the discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2127660341,The mosquito Anopheles balabacensis balabacensis has been identified as a natural vector of at least two species of simian malaria in the monsoon forests of the northern Malay States. This mosquito is also a serious vector of human malaria from Viet Nam to northern Malaya. This is the first report of a mosquito which transmits both human and simian malaria in nature.
https://openalex.org/W2070451778,A captive vea lion (Zalophus californianus) which had never before produced clicking sounds in the laboratory was first conditioned to vocalize in air and subsequently learned to emit underwater clicks. clicking was brought under control by differential reinforcement procedures. Vocalization as an indicator response may be useful in the comparative study of discriminative behavior.
https://openalex.org/W2077904400,"Lowering of pH from 7.40 to 6.60 significantly decreased the rate of glycerol formation in fat cells incubated with either 1-norepinephrine or theophylline. When these cells were incubated with both 1-norepinephrine and theophylline, the glycerol formation proceeded at maximal rate and was quite similar at pH 7.40 and 6.60. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of acidosis on the lipolytic action of 1-norepinephrine is exerted on the process which activates lipase."

Thus, certain medicinally important secondary plant metabolites may be produced in appreciable amounts by plant tissue cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2029380729,The equations of electrostatics are applied to the adsorption of gases on molecular sieves; separations on sieves are caused not by the size of molecules but by electrostatic forces between the gases and the strong electric fields of the sieves. Electrostatic interactions can also explain the phenomenon of general anesthesia.

Fourteen specimens of the genera Mormyrops, Gnathonemus, and Marcusenius were classically conditioned to increase briefly their discharge frequency. The unconditioned stimulus was electric shock and the conditioned stimulus was light. These results are novel in that the overt conditioned response involves neither secretion nor movement."
