https://openalex.org/W1972331313,"Behavioral data on a large patient group were collected by investigators from nine countries in the International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia, sponsored by the World Health Organization. The data on half the group were analyzed to derive a system of 12 signs and symptoms for the identification of schizophrenia, as this disorder is diagnosed in many centers throughout the world. The findings were replicated with the other half of the patient group. The criteria constitute an operational method for identifying patients who would be commonly considered schizophrenic in many centers."

The biosynthetic capacity started in the kidney of amphibians, resided in the kidney of reptiles, became transferred to the liver of mammals, and finally disappeared from the guinea pig, the flying mammals, monkey, and man. A similar transition in the biosynthetic ability was observed in the branched evolution of the birds."

https://openalex.org/W1567446278,"Abstract In the physiological range of the adenylate energy charge in liver (0.7 to 0.9) the rate of deamination of AMP catalyzed by rat liver adenylate deaminase (EC 3.5.4.6) increases sharply with decreasing energy charge. It is suggested that this response serves to protect against sharp transient decreases in energy charge: when the charge decreases the resulting removal of AMP by deamination will oppose the decrease in charge (the mole fraction of ATP plus half the mole fraction of ADP). The activity of the enzyme decreases sharply as the size of the adenine nucleotide pool decreases in and below the physiological range. This effect may be a self-limiting response to prevent excessive depletion of the pool. These suggestions, based on the properties of the enzyme observed in vitro, are consistent with the results of experiments on liver in vivo reported by other workers."
https://openalex.org/W1534004384,"Abstract The concentration of translatable ovalbumin messenger RNA in the tubular gland cells of the chicken oviduct was determined from estimates of relative rate of ovalbumin synthesis, polysome concentration, size of ovalbumin-synthesizing polysomes, DNA concentration, and percentage of tubular gland cells in the oviduct. During secondary stimulation with estrogen, the concentration of ovalbumin messenger RNA rose from undetectable levels to approximately 70,000 molecules per tubular gland cell after 5 days when a steady state was reached. The initial rate of ovalbumin messenger RNA accumulation was about 22 molecules per min per tubular gland cell. Nearly all the translatable ovalbumin messenger RNA was localized in polysomes, even at very early times after hormonal stimulation, suggesting that there is no free pool of untranslated messenger. The half-life of ovalbumin messenger RNA was estimated to be about 24 hours by labeling the RNA in vivo followed by subsequent purification and determination of its specific activity. Two other potential approaches for determining messenger half-life were shown to be unsuitable. Using the half-life value of 24 hours, the steady state rate of ovalbumin messenger RNA synthesis was about 34 molecules per min per tubular gland cell. Based on theoretical values for the maximum rate of messenger RNA transcription in eukaryotes, one ovalbumin gene per haploid genome is sufficient to maintain the observed rate of ovalbumin messenger RNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1489595475,Abstract A method is described for the preparation of [γ-32P]ATP with specific activity of approximately 1 Ci per µmole. The procedure involves the substrate level phosphorylation of ADP during the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate by enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. A simplified procedure also is described which allows rapid purification of the labeled triphosphate.

((1965) J. Biol. Chem. 240, 3766). The glycosylceramidase activity corresponds to phlorizin hydrolase rather than to lactase. The physiological substrates of small intestinal phlorizin hydrolase (the activity of which is high at birth and declines at the time of weaning) are most probably glucosylceramides and lactosylceramides, both of which are components of the fat globules in milk."
https://openalex.org/W1553479965,"Chaotropic salts were examined with a view to their use as protein-dissociating agents. The rank order of their ability to dissociate proteins followed the Hofmeister series for proteins which self-interact mainly via the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds (β-lactoglobulin A, hemoglobin). For hydrophobic associations (β-casein, concanavalin A, chymotrypsin), misplacements in the Hofmeister series were noted. Chaotropic salts do not necessarily bring about complete dissociation of protein polymer to protein monomer. However, dissociation was induced at salt concentrations which did not cause major shifts in protein conformation. Thus, chaotropic salts should prove most useful in dissociating multienzyme complexes and in improving the solubility of membrane-bound proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1517725313,"Abstract Acrosin, a proteolytic enzyme located in the acrosome of sperm, exhibits amidase, esterase, and proteinase activity on synthetic and natural substrates containing arginyl and lysyl residues. Highly purified acrosin preparations from boar acrosomes have endopeptidase activity cleaving only the carboxyl bonds of arginine and lysine with a strong preference for arginine bonds. The Michaelis constant for hydrolysis of benzoyl arginine ethyl ester at pH 8.0 is 5 x 10-5 m. The enzyme is inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate and tosyl lysine chloromethyl ketone, indicating that serine and histidine residues may be present in the active site. Acrosin is inhibited by several natural proteinase inhibitors and appears to be unique in that its amidase and esterase activities are competitively inhibited by free arginine with an apparent Ki of 3 mm. The unusual specificity of acrosin may have implications in its biological role of sperm penetration of the zona pellucida of the ovum."
https://openalex.org/W1519674605,"Abstract The free carnitine content of bovine epididymal spermatozoa taken from the distal caput, midpiece, and proximal and distal cauda was measured and the average values were 0.07, 0.28, 0.49, and 1.0 µmole/109 cells, respectively. Carnitine was not detected in testicular spermatozoa. Acetyl-carnitine was detected only in caudal sperm and amounted to 10 to 20% of the total HClO4-soluble carnitine. This amount was increased to 67% by incubation of caudal cells in fructose. Caput spermatozoa incubated in [methyl-14C]carnitine took up radioactivity but caudal cells did not. The rate of carnitine uptake was related to concentration, maximal rates (1.7 nmoles per hour per 109 cells) were observed in 1 mm l-carnitine. The rate was linear with time for 2 hours and with cell number from 1 x 108 to 2 x 109. The relationship between spermatozoal carnitine levels and epididymal function is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1582278284,"Abstract The phospholipase A1 solubilized by heparin from the plasma membranes of rat liver can catalyze the hydrolysis of monoglyceride, diglyceride, and monoacylglycerophosphorylethanolamine in addition to phosphatidylethanolamine. Furthermore, the enzyme catalyzes the transacylation of the acyl group from position 1 of these glycerides to an acceptor monoglyceride to form diglyceride. Triton X-100 which disperses the lipids reduces transacylation and favors the utilization of water as the acyl acceptor (hydrolysis). Since free fatty acid is not incorporated, the transacylation appears to be direct rather than the combination of hydrolysis and reacylation. The influence of Ca2+ on transacylation and hydrolysis was dependent upon the mixtures of lipids used as substrates. Co-elution of the hydrolytic and transacylation activities from a column of Sephadex G-200 and heat inactivation of all activities indicate that a single enzyme catalyzes both reactions. It is tentatively suggested this enzyme be more appropriately named monoglyceride acyltransferase since monoglyceride is the preferred substrate and transacylation is the predominating reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1520125740,"Abstract 1. Human intestinal maltase and sucrase contain 30 to 40% carbohydrate by weight and are resistant to proteolytic digestion by papain. The major carbohydrates associated with these enzymes are fucose, galactose, and hexosamines. 2. The purified disaccharidases demonstrate blood group antigenicity of great potency, as little as 8 x 10-9 to 1.5 x 10-7 m inhibiting red cell agglutination. 3. The blood group reactivity is not the result of contamination by blood group substance because: (a) type specific antibody causes a shift of enzyme activity on sucrose gradients; (b) antibody changes the Rf of the enzyme band on acrylamide electrophoresis; and (c) enzyme activity is selectively retained by type-specific antibody bound to Sepharose. 4. Rat intestinal disaccharidases contain 15 to 20% carbohydrate and do not have blood group reactivity, yet are papain-resistant. 5. Alkali treatment in the presence of sodium borohydride produces heterogeneous protein fragments without carbohydrate (18,000 to 25,000 mol wt) and a carbohydrate fragment with a molecular weight of about 1,800. 6. We conclude that human intestinal disaccharidases are glycoproteins and that blood group reactivity is contained in the oligosaccharide side chain covalently linked to the enzyme. This is the first demonstration of blood group antigenicity associated with a functioning protein molecule. The disaccharidases may account for some of the insoluble blood group reactivity found in intestinal tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1664438812,"The oxidation-reduction potentials of a variety of riboflavin derivatives substituted at the 8α position have been determined by anaerobic titration with dithionite in the presence of suitable dyes and spectrophotometric determination of the ratio of oxidized to reduced flavin. The potentials of 8α-substituted flavins, including the histidyl-8α-riboflavin component of succinate dehydrogenase and the cysteinyl-8α-riboflavin component of monoamine oxidase, were found to be 0.02 to 0.03 volt higher than the potential of riboflavin. In accord with this, the affinity of the 8α-substituted flavins for sulfite was 10 to 20 times higher than that of riboflavin. Reduction by dithionite to the flavin hydroquinone proceeded with a 2 electron uptake and was completely reversible on admission of O2 in each case, except for the 8α-S-cysteinyl-sulfone of riboflavin. On reduction of the latter by equimolar dithionite, cysteinesulfinate was spontaneously eliminated and riboflavin was formed. This process follows first order kinetics with a pH optimum of 6.0 at 25°."

https://openalex.org/W1524920697,"Abstract In vitro kinetic studies with adenosine monophosphate nucleosidase (AMP nucleosidase, which catalyzes the reaction: AMP MgATP2-/→ adenine + ribose 5-phosphate) and in vivo metabolic studies with intact Azotobacter vinelandii suggest that AMP nucleosidase may be involved in removing AMP from the cellular adenylate pool under conditions where the adenylate energy charge decreases. Kinetic studies with the purified enzyme show a decrease in activity with increasing physiological levels of adenylate energy charge. In addition, millimolar levels of inorganic phosphate cause marked inhibition of AMP nucleosidase over the entire range of adenylate charge with a total adenylate pool of 2 mm. When growing cultures of A. vinelandii with 14C-labeled adenylate pools were subjected to anaerobic conditions, the ATP levels decreased rapidly with a concomitant rise in AMP, followed by a rise in hypoxanthine. These observations are consistent with the increased levels of intracellular AMP being removed by AMP nucleosidase. The resultant adenine can then be converted to hypoxanthine by adenase."

https://openalex.org/W2419426781,"Carbamylation of the NH2-terminal valine residues of hemoglobin by cyanate in vitro is about 2½ times as extensive in partially deoxygenated whole blood (40 to 50% oxygen saturation) as in fully oxygenated whole blood. When the carbamylated α and β chains of deoxyhemoglobin are separated, analyses show that the ratio of carbamylation is about 1.7:1 in favor of the α chain, whereas in fully oxygenated hemoglobin the ration is 1:1. The distribution of carbamyl groups on the hemoglobin chains prepared from the blood of patients on oral cyanate therapy suggests that carbamylation in vivo takes place predominantly with the deoxygenated protein."
https://openalex.org/W150843002,"To evaluate the influence of oxygenation on the reactivity of hemoglobin to cyanate, oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin were carbamylatedwith a low (2.5 mM) concentration of [14C]-cyanate for up to 100 min. The radioactivity of the isolated tryptic peptides of purified carbamylated globin chains (αc and βc) was determined. Under these reaction conditions, 97% or more of the cyanate was bound to the NH2-terminal peptides of the α and β chains in oxy- as well as in deoxyhemoglobin. A modification of the ρ-chloromercuribenzoate method for chain separation was used to measure the rate of the reaction with cyanate of both types of chians in tetrameric hemoglobin. The reaction of hemoglobin with cyanate was strongly oxygen linked. the α chains were carbamylated twice as rapidly in deoxy- as compared to oxyhemoglobin in both phosphate and bis-tris buffers. The β chain carbamylation was less dependent upon oxygenation of hemoglobin in bis-tris buffer, and did not vary at all with oxygenation in phosphate buffer. Organic Polyphosphates (2,3-diphosphoglycerate and inositol hexaphosphate) inhibited β chain carbamylation selectively. The effect of pH on the carbamylation of α and β chains in deoxyhemoglobin was studied. At a fixed pH, CO2 decreased the reaction rate of α and β chain NH2 termini to the same extent."

https://openalex.org/W1552304315,"Abstract The sexual agglutination factor released from Hansenula wingei type 5 haploid yeast cells by subtilisin digestion is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 9.6 x 105, which is composed of 85% carbohydrate, 10% protein, and 5% phosphate. The protein part contains 55% serine and 6 to 8% threonine. About 85% of these 2 residues is destroyed on treatment of 5-agglutinin with alkali under conditions which cause β elimination, and 90% of the carbohydrate attached to the agglutinin is released as oligosaccharides composed entirely of mannose which vary in size from 1 to 15 sugar units in length. Thus, the 5-agglutinin is an unusual glycoprotein in which almost two-thirds of the protein is composed of hydroxy amino acids, and of these about 85% are substituted by mannose or mannooligosaccharides. As a result, half of the amino acid residues in the protein carry carbohydrate substituents. The ability of 5-agglutinin to agglutinate 21 cells is destroyed by digestion with pronase or with a bacterial exo-α-mannanase. Thus, both the protein and carbohydrate components contribute to the recognition and binding activities of the factor."

Near the posterior pole of the eye, the upward and downward extensional strains on the retina should be reasonably balanced. In the horizontal meridian an asymmetry is introduced because of the nasal location of the optic nerve head. Observers were asked to bisect the space between two parallel lines while fixating a movable line lying near the midpoint of the two lines. The test was conducted with the target far from and near the subject, in the horizontal and vertical meridians, and was repeated with accommodation paralyzed by a cycloplegic agent. Marked accommodation induced significant spatial distortions in the horizontal meridian. The effect is largely retinal."
https://openalex.org/W2149225428,"Abstract N-Bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate, prepared by the bromoacetylation of ethanolamine phosphate, has been tested as an active site-specific reagent for rabbit and rat muscle fructose diphosphate aldolases. The reagent inactivates both enzymes, and inactivation is prevented by substrates or competitive inhibitors. Loss of activity is pseudo-first order until the later stages of inactivation, and a rate-saturation effect is observed as the reagent concentration is increased. The stoichiometry of the reaction has been determined with 14C-labeled reagent. Inactivated enzyme contains 2 to 2.5 molar eq of reagent per mole of aldolase subunit, whereas the enzyme modified in the presence of a competitive inhibitor contains only 1 to 1.5 eq of reagent. Thus, alterations in the catalytic properties of aldolase that accompany its modification apparently reflect the alkylation of a single, essential residue. Characterization of the protein derivatives reveals that the preservation of enzymatic activity is due primarily to the protection of a histidyl residue. This observation supports earlier evidence for the involvement of a histidyl residue in aldolase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1588404779,"Abstract Incubation of HeLa cells with dimethylsulfoxide results in a partial or complete inhibition of protein synthesis. At a concentration of 12% dimethylsulfoxide, a complete inhibition of protein synthesis occurs within 3 to 4 min. This inhibition is reversible; on removal of dimethylsulfoxide, cells resume their normal rate of protein synthesis. Inhibition of protein synthesis by dimethylsulfoxide is accompanied by a complete breakdown of polyribosomes and release of nascent polypeptides. The breakdown of polyribosomes can be prevented by preincubating cells either with cycloheximide or anisomycin. These studies suggest that dimethylsulfoxide may be a useful tool to synchronize chain initiation in cultured cells."
https://openalex.org/W1983370248,"WE have used cells that were derived from individuals with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and are defective in excision repair1 to demonstrate the appearance of ultraviolet lesions in the DNA made after ultraviolet irradiation. Normal human and XP cells were irradiated and labelled with either 3H-thymidine or 32PO4 for 6–8 h, the label was removed, and the cells were further incubated for 18 h to allow for DNA chain elongation and joining of the short DNA segments synthesised after irradiation. The cells were then osmotically shocked, treated with a repair endonuclease contained in Micrococcus luteus extract for 5 min at 37° C and pH 8.0, and sedimented in 5–20% alkaline sucrose gradients. The enzymatic assay2 and the sedimentation procedure3 have been described elsewhere. Figure 1 shows that daughter DNA from irradiated and non-irradiated normal human cells contains no repair endonuclease-sensitive sites. This is expected because normal human cells excise and repair most of the pyrimidine dinners formed after ultraviolet irradiation4. Figure 2 shows that DNA synthesised by irradiated XP cells does contain repair endonuclease-sensitive sites, although the number appears to be small. Under our experimental conditions there is approximately one sensitive site for every fifteen to thirty-five dimers in the parental DNA5."
https://openalex.org/W1512943831,"Abstract The origin of the methyl group on carbon atom 1 of Ring A of the corrin ring of vitamin B12 was investigated by 13C and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Recently we found by the same technique that this methyl group does not originate from the 5-carbon atom of δ-aminolevulinic acid. This was of considerable interest, for it has been considered that in the fusion of Rings A and D the potential δ-methine bridge found in porphyrins, which does arise from δ-aminolevulinic acid, is converted to the methyl group found on carbon atom 1 of the corrin ring. Since the methyl group of methionine was previously found to be the source of at least six other methyl groups on the corrin ring, methionine was tested as a possible precursor of the methyl group on carbon atom 1. l-[methyl]-13C]Methionine was added to a growing culture of Propionibacterium shermanii and vitamin B12 was isolated. The 13C magnetic resonance spectra of the vitamin B12 in H2O, in 0.1 m KCN, and in aqueous HCl (pH l 1) showed seven methyl-13C resonances. Single frequency decoupling experiments enabled us to assign a 13C resonance to the C-1 methyl group. It appears, therefore, that in the synthesis of the corrin ring the aminomethyl group on Ring A or Ring D, which is the potential δ-methine bridge carbon atom found in the porphyrin ring, is eliminated and that carbon atom 1 (C-1) of the corrin ring accepts a methyl group provided by l-methionine. This finding should aid in the elucidation of the mechanism of synthesis of the functional isomers of vitamin B12 and of porphyrins. Analysis of our spectra also enabled us to make other resonance assignments and to differentiate between the relative positions in space of the two geminal methyl groups on carbon atom 12 of the corrin ring which arise by different mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W1501329774,"A particulate fraction was prepared from kidneys, lyophilized, and coated with ceramide. After incubation with UDP-[14C]Gal and appropriate cofactors, the major radioactive component in the lipid fraction was galactosylceramide (Gal-Cer). If UDP-Glc was substituted for UDP-Gal, the product was glucosylceramide (Glc-Cer). Specific activity for Gal-Cer synthesis was present at comparable levels in kidney preparations from males or females at early ages. However, between 20 and 30 days of age there was a 5-fold increase in activity in preparations from male kidney, followed by a slight decline. In contrast, Gal-Cer synthesis in kidney preparations from female mice decreased slowly from 10 to 70 days of age. Despite the low levels of Gal-Cer in kidney, enzymatic activity for its synthesis was high, 0.8 nmole per mg of protein per hour in 30-day-old males. This was 40% of the specific activity for Gal-Cer synthesis in brains of the same animals. Glc-Cer synthesis by kidney followed a developmental pattern markedly different from that for Gal-Cer formation. There was an increase in activity throughout the time period studied (10 to 64 days of age), but activity was most rapid between 30 and 40 days of age. Activity in preparations of female kidney followed a similar pattern but was lower than that of preparations from males at 10 days of age and increased less rapidly. In kidneys of mature male animals, the specific activity for Glc-Cer synthesis was twice that of the females."
https://openalex.org/W1604364418,"Abstract Rat liver glutamine transaminase acts on γ-glutamyl hydrazones of α-keto acids to yield the corresponding l-amino acids and 3-hydroxy-tetrahydro-6-pyridazinone-3-carboxylic acid; the latter compound undergoes nonenzymatic dehydration in acid to yield 1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-pyridazinone-3-carboxylic acid. l-Amino acid oxidase (snake venom) also catalyzes the formation of 3-hydroxy-tetrahydro-6-pyridazinone-3-carboxylic acid (and ammonia) from γ-glutamyl hydrazide. In the transaminase-catalyzed reaction in which glycine is formed from the γ-glutamyl hydrazone of glyoxylate, no evidence was obtained for the formation of free glyoxylate during the reaction, nor did added free glyoxylate equilibrate with γ-glutamyl hydrazone-bound glyoxylate. The relative rates of reaction observed with a series of γ-glutamyl α-keto acid hydrazones were similar to those of the corresponding glutamine-α-keto acid transamination reactions; in general, the rates with the γ-glutamyl α-keto acid hydrazones were greater than those of the corresponding glutamine-α-keto acid transamination reactions. Possible reaction pathways for the enzymatic transformation of the γ-glutamyl α-keto acid hydrazones have been deduced. Albizziin (l-α-amino-β-ureidoproprionic) acid was found to effectively replace glutamine in the glutamine-α-keto acid transamination reaction; the high ultraviolet absorbance of the dehydrated product of the α-keto acid analog of albizziin was used as the basis for a highly sensitive assay for liver glutamine transaminase activity. Studies of the albizziinglyoxylate transamination reaction indicated that the enzyme exhibits ping-pong kinetics. The data suggest that the enzyme has binding sites for glutamine and α-keto acids which overlap. The action of the enzyme on γ-glutamyl-α-keto acid hydrazones appears to involve initial binding of the glutamyl moiety at the glutamine site of the enzyme followed by transformations which are associated with movement of the attached α-keto acid moiety into the active site. The preparation and properties of the l-γ-glutamyl hydrazones of a number of α-keto acids are described."

By contrast a high percentage of all the nonsmoking blood donors breathing city air had carboxyhemoglobin saturations greater than 1.5 percent, which indicated that exposure to carbon monoxide in excess of that permitted by the quality standards of the Clean Air Act of 1971 was widespread and occurring regularly."
https://openalex.org/W1536853559,"The nitration of glucagon (1%) with tetranitromethane (1 mole excess per mole of tyrosyl residue) proceeded rapidly at pH 8 and 0°, conditions wherein the reactants were almost completely insoluble. Under these conditions few polymeric and oxidative side reactions occurred, and tyrosyl residue 13 reacted much more rapidly than tyrosyl residue 10. The products of nitration were purified by gel filtration and chromatography with DEAE-cellulose and were characterized by electrophoresis, amino acid analysis, enzymatic hydrolysis, partial structural analysis, and biological and immunological assays. Mononitroglucagon, containing 3-NO2 tyrosine at residue 13, was twice as active as glucagon in elevating blood glucose, but it stimulated rat liver adenylate cyclase no better than glucagon and was poorly (20%) recognized immunologically. Nitration of tyrosyl residue 10 in addition to residue 13 depressed biological and immunological activity, although dinitroglucagon was still more active than glucagon as measured by hyperglycemia. Reduction of mononitroglucagon with Na2S2O7 gave monoaminoglucagon, which was about half as active as glucagon by all assays. We found diaminoglucagon to be nearly half the potency of the monoamino derivative. Among possible explanations for our results are alterations in phenolic pK, enhanced binding to receptor, protection of the hormone from proteolysis, or combinations of these factors. Whatever the explanation, our results clearly implicate the tyrosyl residues of glucagon in the biological and immunological reactivity of the hormone."
