https://openalex.org/W2054684040,"A cloned library of large, random embryonic human DNA fragments was constructed and screened for beta-globin sequences using the cloned human beta-globin cDNA plasmid pJW102 (Wilson et al., 1978) as a hybridization probe. Two independent clones were obtained and then characterized by restriction endonuclease cleavage analysis, hybridization experiments and partial DNA sequencing. Each of the clones carries both the adult delta- and beta-globin genes. The two genes are separated by approximately 5.4 kilobases (kb) of DNA and their orientation with respect to the direction of transcription is 5'-delta--beta-3'. Both the delta- and beta-globin genes contain a large noncoding intervening sequence (950 and 900 bp, respectively) located between the codons for amino acids 104 (arginine) and 105 (leucine). Although the location of the large intervening sequence within the coding regions of the two genes is identical, the two noncoding sequences bear little sequence homology. A second, smaller intervening sequence similar to that found in other mammalian beta-globin genes was detected near the 5' end of the human beta-globin gene. The two independently isolated beta-globin clones differ from each other by the presence of a Pst I restriction enzyme cleavage site within the large intervening sequence of the delta-globin gene of one of the clones. This suggests that the human DNA carried in the two clones was derived from two homologous chromosomes which were heterozygous for the Pst I restriction enzyme recognition sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2091464294,"Collagen phenotypes were determined for rabbit articular chondrocytes in cartilage slices and first through fifth monolayer cultures. During the first 24 hr of slice culture, chondrocytes exhibited the following collagen phenotype: 96% type II, 3% X2Y and 1% type III. In primary monolayer culture, no other types of collagen were added to this differentiated chondrocyte phenotype; however, the synthesis per cell of each of the expressed collagens was stimulated. By the fifth day of primary culture, X2Y synthesis increased 10 fold, and by the eighth day, a further 4 fold. In contrast, the synthesis of collagen types II and III showed no change by the fifth day, but increased 7 fold by the eighth day. These results suggest independent regulation of X2Y in this situation. In a separate experiment, first through fifth cultures were studied. The synthesis per cell of type II collagen declined steadily and essentially ceased by the fifth culture, indicating the loss of differentiated function by these chondrocyte progeny. The loss of type II synthesis was not quantitatively replaced by the synthesis of type I trimer and type I collagen which was first detected in the third culture. While these qualitative changes in phenotype occurred, the stimulated rate of type III collagen synthesis did not change and that of X2Y declined only slightly. Thus the termination of type II synthesis did not significantly alter the synthesis of the other collagens produced by differentiated chondrocytes. The final “de-differentiated” phenotype was 41% type I, 25% X2Y, 20% type I trimer, 13% type III and 1% type II."

In mixtures of monomeric and filamentous actin, only the monomeric form is measured as DNAase inhibitor. The total amount of actin in a sample can be determined after depolymerization of F actin with guanidine hydrochloride. The assay is rapid enough to detect changes in the polymerization state of actin in vitro over time intervals as short as 3 min. Data characterizing unpolymerized and filamentous actin pools in extracts of human platelets, lymphocytes and HeLa cells are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2094362923,"L6E9 rat myoblasts derived from the L6 cell line can be induced to differentiate to a very high percentage by manipulating the culture conditions. Under standard differentiating conditions, L6E9 cells divide an average of 2.5 times before differentiating and >99% of them incorporate 3H-TdR before fusing. By inhibiting DNA replication by a variety of means, data have been obtained which demonstrate that this DNa synthesis is not required to switch from growth to differentiation. After every cell division, L6E9 cells have the option either to fuse or to proliferate without intervening DNA synthesis. Cell cloning and DNA labeling experiments show a direct correlation between the time of culture in differentiating medium and a progressive loss of proliferative capacity of mononucleated L6E9 cells, demonstrating that these cells become irreversibly committed to differentiation and withdraw from the cell cycle prior to and not as a consequence of cell fusion. The commitment step occurs during the G1 phase prior to fusion. This G1 phase has a latent period during which no irreversible step toward differentiation occurs and the cells remain ambivalent toward growth or differentiation. Under proper conditions, this period is followed by an irreversible commitment toward differentiation and a loss of proliferative capacity. The kinetics of this commitment step strongly suggest that L6E9 cells become irreversibly committed in a stochastic manner. Once the cells have become committed, with or without DNA synthesis, they will fuse to form myotubes and biochemically differentiate in a deterministic fashion. The data presented are consistent with a stochastic model of differentiation for L6E9 cells and demonstrate that the switch from a proliferating to a differentiating genetic program can occur in the absence of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1982225512,"The conservation of nuclear Ad2 sequences during nucleocytoplasmic transport has been estimated from the accumulation of 3H-uridine in nuclear and cytoplasmic Ad2-specific RNA from the major late transcription unit. From 10–28% is conserved of the total Ad2 nuclear RNA synthesized from each of five regions of the genome that specify groups of 3′ co-terminal mRNAs. The sum of the conservation of all the regions was equivalent to 100%, signifying the conservation of at least a part of each transcript or all of about one fifth to one sixth of the transcripts. The conservation of poly(A)+ Ad2 nuclear RNA is about 4 times greater than of total Ad2 nuclear RNA, approaching 100% conservation of poly(A)+ nuclear sequences. Since each mRNA contains three “spliced” sequences that are probably encoded only once per transcript, these data on conservation of the Ad2 sequences suggest that each transcriptional event from the 16–99 transcription unit gives rise to one of a possible 13–14 mRNA molecules with destruction of the remainder of the transcribed RNA. The portion which is conserved resides next to the region to which poly(A) is added. Three models for the choice of poly(A) sites were considered: termination at the poly(A) site, cleavage shortly after synthesis of one of the sites before transcription was complete, and cleavage after completion of transcription. The first model was ruled out by the demonstration of equimolar synthesis over the region. The second model Is strongly supported because 3H-urldine label appears equally rapidly in the time range 2–10 min in each of the five 3′ poly(A) addition sites, whereas chain completion before cleavage would lead to a faster appearance of label in the most promoter-distal site. Furthermore, briefly labeled RNA molecules extending from 16 to each of several poly(A) addition sites were the first poly(A)- terminated 3H-uridine-labeled molecules detected, demonstrating that poly(A) addition precedes splicing. The choice of which mRNA emerges from each transcriptional event would appear to depend upon first choosing one of five 3′ mRNA ends followed by a 5′ splicing event."

Long-term administration of some related drugs which lack antidepressant efficacy failed to induce such a change. The enhanced response to serotonin induced by the clinically active tricyclic drugs took 1 to 2 weeks to develop, a time course which correlates with the delayed onset of therapeutic effects in humans."

Late mRNAs processed from these transcripts contain a common spliced tripartite leader ( Berget et al., 1977 Berget S.M. Moore C. Sharp P.A.

This report maps the late promoter and the capped 5′ end of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs from this transcription unit, and analyzes their structures. We show that nascent RNA chains pulse-labeled in vivo are initiated at coordinate 16.5 ± 0.5 and contain the sequences intervening between the leader segments. We map the capped 5′ terminus of late nuclear transcripts at a site between 16.4 and 16.6 by aligning T1 RNAase oligonucleotides from nuclear RNA with the DNA sequence of the promoter region. The structure of the first eleven residues of the capped 5′ terminus of late mRNA was determined by direct RNA sequencing. This structure corresponds exactly to a DNA sequence at coordinate 16.4 and precisely positions the mRNA cap template within the promoter region. These results suggest that the promoter and the cap template sites are coincident, and that the initiating residues of the primary transcript are precursors of the capped 5′ end of mRNA. Residues removed from transcripts by splicing were identified. These plus caps were detected in large polyadenylated nuclear RNA, indicating that capping and polyadenylation can occur on unspliced molecules. Residues retained in the mRNA first leader contain a nine residue sequence adjacent to the cap which is complementary to the 3′ end of 18S rRNA, suggesting that the first leader functions in ribosome binding. Nucleotide sequences from the promoter region are compared with cellular counterparts. Strong homologies at cap sites and splice points suggest that for the noted cases, the virus and cell share closely related mechanisms for mRNA 5′ end synthesis and splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2030929667,"A non-self-replicating segment (1370 base pairs) of plasmid R6K was cloned in E. coli and shown to trans-complement temperature-sensitive replication mutants of this plasmid. This segment contains the gene which codes for a protein required for initiation of replication of the plasmid, and was used as a helper in a functional assay for an origin of replication in R6K derivatives. A 420 bp fragment, derived from R6K DNA, was shown to carry a functional origin since it was capable of replicating as a plasmid in E. coli cells carrying the helper segment either on the host chromosome or on a plasmid Col E1 derivative. The copy number of the origin fragment in cells carrying the helper segment on the chromosome is essentially the same as the copy number of R6K. A model for the positive regulation of plasmid R6K replication is presented."

https://openalex.org/W2074371275,"Abstract It has recently been suggested that stem cells may invariably keep, from one division to the next, the daughter DNA molecules that contain the older of the two parental strands—that is, they may retain a complete set of strands, through successive cell divisions (Cairns, 1975). We can test this hypothesis by labeling either the old immortal strands at the time the stem cells are created or the newly synthesized strands during subsequent divisions of the stem cells. In the former case, the stem cells should become permanently labeled; in the latter case, they should eliminate their label on their second division. Experiments of this sort have been conducted with the tongue papilla under steady state conditions and with the regenerating small intestinal crypts. The results clearly show that by far most of the multiplying cells in tongue and intestinal epithelium segregate their DNA randomly at mitosis. Nevertheless, the results, though far from conclusive, suggest that there are a small number of cells (1–5 in the stem cell region of each crypt and one at the base of each column of cells in the tongue) that selectively segregate their old and new DNA strands in the expected way. Thus in the immortal strand labeling experiments, there are a few labeled cells that retain their label for up to 4 weeks; conversely, in the new strand labeling experiments, a few cells appear to rid themselves of label after intervals equivalent to approximately two cell cycles."

https://openalex.org/W1968697334,"The DNA sequence of two cloned segments of the histone gene repeat unit of the sea urchin S. purpuratus has been determined. One sequence contains the contiguous H2B and H3 genes and their interdigitated spacer regions; the other comprises the H2A gene and flanking spacer sequences. Analysis of the coding regions reveals a methionine residue within the H2A protein. H2A, which generally lacks this amino acid, contains methionine only in a protein variant which is synthesized in early sea urchin embryogenesis. We thus conclude that the cloned DNA represents a set of genes which is active early in development. Codon selection is markedly skewed and similar for each of the three genes. The DNA sequences are co-linear with known histone protein sequences and-unlike several other eucaryotic genes-do not show any insertions in the coding regions. The spacer regions are relatively AT-rich although GC cluster are scattered throughout. Several short stretches of homology are found in regions both upstream and downstream from the protein coding segments. The conservation of these sequences and their location at analogous sites suggest that they are involved in gene transcription or in mRNA translation. No tandem or dispersed repeats were found, with the exception of the remarkable sequence having the structure located in the spacer between the H2A and H1 genes."
https://openalex.org/W1978851868,"The Southern gel filter transfer technique has been used to characterize the integrated genome of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) and the genomes of the endogenous viruses of the mouse. Study of 10 clones of rat cell independently infected by M-MuLV indicates a minimum of 15 integration sites into which the M-MuLV provirus can be inserted. No common integration site is observed among these clones. Clones productively infected by M-MuLV acquire multiple proviruses, whereas infected cells unable to produce virus contain only one M-MuLV provirus. Once established, the integrated genomes are stable for at least two years after initial infection. The use of M-MuLV probe allows detection of a spectrum of Eco RI-cleaved mouse DNA fragments containing endogenous MuLV genomes. DNAs of different inbred laboratory mouse strains yield similar patterns of provirus with each strain showing minor characteristic differences. In some instances, mouse cells infected by M-MuLV reveal additional proviruses beyond those seen in the uninfected cell. DNAs from three different M-MuLV-induced thymomas indicate, as in rat cells, multiple possible integration sites."

https://openalex.org/W1979790421,"Extraction of glycerinated chicken skeletal muscle with 0.6 M potassium iodide leaves a framework of insoluble components within each muscle fiber. This framework is composed primarily of planes of in-register Z discs that have been thickened by the accumulation of material on both sides of each disc during extraction. Membrane vesicles, presumably remnants of the T system, remain surrounding the Z discs. When the framework is sheared in a blender, it is preferentially cleaved between Z planes, resulting in the formation of large sheets of interconnected, closely packed Z discs in a honeycomb-like array. Cleavage occurs in regions formerly occupied by the A bands, which have been weakened by the removal of myosin. The existence and stability of these planar Z disc arrays demonstrate the presence and strength of connections between adjacent myofibrils. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals that this framework consists primarily of actin and desmin, with lesser amounts of a few proteins including α-actinin, myosin and tropomyosin. Z disc sheets and KI-extracted myofibrils provide a distinct face-on view and side view, respectively, of the Z disc. In indirect immunofluorescence, these two views have revealed that desmin is present at the periphery of each Z disc, forming a network of proteinaceous collars within the Z plane. α-Actinin is localized within each disc, giving a face-on fluorescence pattern that is complementary to that of desmin. Actin is present throughout the thickened Z plane, while myosin and tropomyosin exist only in the insoluble residue that coalesces on both faces of each disc. We conclude that desmin, perhaps in conjunction with actin, is responsible for interlinking Z discs of adjacent myofibrils, and may thus serve as a mechanical and structural integrator of muscle fibers. Its hydrophobic nature and coincident distribution with the T system suggest that it may also be responsible for mediating filament-membrane interactions and anchoring the triad to the Z disc. Its collar-like distribution suggests that it may aid in maintaining the structural integrity of the Z disc and the actin filaments inserted into it."
https://openalex.org/W3207591370,"We have examined the hypothesis that diploid cells grown in vitro age, and propose that only proliferative potential and not life-span is telescoped. We suggest that explanted or transplanted diploid cells are driven to divide by the process of subculturing in vitro or in vivo and, in response to this pressure, also complete their differentiation and become refractory to further mitotic stimulation. We conclude that differentiation rather than ""mortality"" distinguishes diploid from transformed cells and that the former may not age in vitro, but are lost because culture methods are selective for cycling cells."

Thermal stability was measured by hydroxyapatite thermal chromatography, S1 nuclease resistance after heating in a solvent which neutralizes the effect of DNA base composition, and spectrophotometric melting. One pair of individuals appear to differ from each other in about 4% of the nucleotide pairs of their single-copy DNA sequence.

https://openalex.org/W1986776706,"Plasmid M6 has been shown to contain sequences complementary to two related abundant mRNA species which differ in length by 100 nucleotides and code for Dictyostelium actin. M6 complementary RNA was isolated by hybridization to immobilized M6 DNA and translated in vitro. The product is identical to major forms of in vivo labeled actin in both mobility on two-dimensional gels and two-dimensional fingerprints of tryptic peptides. Both plasmid M6 and a second plasmid complementary to the actin mRNA complementary region in M6, pDd actin 2 (McKeown et al., 1978), direct the synthesis in minicells of a number of similar polypeptides that are not seen in minicells containing other recombinant plasmids. Three of these polypeptides are similar in two-dimensional gel mobility to Dictyostelium actin and bind to DNAse I agarose. The repetition frequency of isolated restriction fragments from actin mRNA complementary plasmid M6 has been examined. The data from two different experimental approaches (DNA excess hybridizations using plasmid DNA as probe, and hybridization of plasmid probe to DNA blot filters of restriction enzyme-digested Dictyostelium DNA) indicate that the mRNA complementary region is reiterated 15--20 times. When an actin cDNA probe is used in the same experiments, the results suggest that the entire coding region is reiterated. When the two major actin mRNA species are separated and independently translated, each appears to code for one of the two major actin species. The results suggest that there are at least two different functional genes, and possibly more, for Dictyostelium actin."
https://openalex.org/W1983287668,"Mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells, the dimorphic photosynthetic cell types in the C4 plant Zea mays, differ in protein composition. In particular, the large subunit of the chloroplast enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39) is found entirely or almost exclusively in bundle sheath cells. The DNA sequence coding for this polypeptide is contained in the chloroplast DNA of both mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells. RNA complementary to this coding sequence has been detected in RNA from bundle sheath cells, but is almost or entirely absent from mesophyll cells. Similarly, translatable mRNA for this polypeptide has been detected in RNA from bundle sheath cells, but not from mesophyll cells. Portions of the 4200 base pair maize plastid DNA sequence Bam 9 outside the large subunit gene region appear to be transcribed in mesophyll cells. Thus differential gene expression at the mRNA level has been directly demonstrated to occur in these two cell types."

Cunningham D.D. Cell surface action of thrombin is sufficient to initiate division of chick cells. Cell. 1978; 14: 811-823 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar ). This prompted the present binding experiments with 125I-thrombin which led to the Identification of a thrombin receptor on the surface of mouse embryo cells. Scatchard plots of binding data at 4, 22 and 37°C were linear over a broad range of thrombin concentrations, indicating a single affinity class of receptors. The association constant was about 1 × 109 M−1 and there were approximately 2 × 105 receptors per cell. Neither insulin, epidermal growth factor nor prothrombin competed for thrombin binding to its receptor, indicating that It was unique for thrombin. Comparisons of thrombin binding and the amount of cell division produced by various concentrations of thrombin indicated that there was a relationship between receptor occupancy and increase in cell number. Low concentrations of serum (0.1%) inhibited both the mitogenic action of thrombin and the specific binding of thrombin to its receptor. It did not, however, inhibit nonspecific association of 125I-thrombin with the cells. Experiments showed that this inhibition by serum resulted from a masking of thrombin receptors on the cells and not from binding of thrombin by serum factors. Together these studies suggest that thrombin must bind to Its surface receptor to stimulate cell division."

https://openalex.org/W2089893897,"The messenger RNAs coding for alpha- and beta-tubulin have been isolated from embryonic chick brain. Although the mRNAs for the two tubulin subunits have been resolved on native gels, they are very similar in molecular weight (650,000 daltons) as judged by mobility on denaturing gels containing methy mercury. The mRNAs for beta- and gamma-actin have also been resolved on native gels, but migrate as an unresolved peak (molecular weight 6500,000-700,000 daltons) under denaturing conditions. Since the nonmuscle actins are substantially smaller proteins than alpha- and beta-tubulin, the large size of chick nonmuscle actin mRNAs suggests an unusually long untranslated region. Since tubulin and actin polypeptides are internal structural proteins, one would expect them to be synthesized only on free polysomes. Translation of mRNA derived directly from a purified membrane fraction or by puromycin release from that fraction, however, showed the synthesis of a small proportion of these proteins on polysomes that are membrane-associated. Peptide mapping has in all cases confirmed the identity of the products of cell-free synthesis with authentic alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin and actin. Approximately 67% of the alpha- and 13% of the beta-tubulin chains produced by in vitro translation are competent for co-assembly into microtubules with added carrier microtubule protein."

https://openalex.org/W2041332023,"We have used an actin gene-containing restriction fragment of plasmid M6 (Kindle and Firtel, 1978) to select a second actin gene-containing plasmid which we have named pDd actin 2. This plasmid has been shown to contain two actin genes separated by 350 bp of nonactin DNA. When heteroduplexes are formed between any two of the three actin genes present in chimeric plasmids, the region of homology is 1100 +/- 100 bp. This is close to the minimum length required to code for actin protein. The 1100 bp region of intergene homology corresponds to the 1100 bp homology observed between M6 and the two actin cDNA plasmids pcDd actin B1 and pcDd actin A1 (Bender et al., 1978). We have no evidence for additional sequences common to either the 3' or 5' ends of the 1100 +/- 100 bp region of intergene homology.

The distribution of cell surface LETS protein in a series of cell lines was examined by both specific immunofluorescent staining and by gel electrophoresis of lactoperoxidase-catalyzed, iodinated cell surface proteins. The tumorigenicity of these cell lines was assayed in nude mice. Although the series of cell lines studied provided a broad spectrum of LETS protein expression, both quantitatively and qualitatively, there does not appear to be a correlation between tumorigenicity and decreased expression of the LETS protein. In a series of transformed, nontumorigenic hybrids, the LETS protein expression was found to be altered with respect to both decreased organizational complexity and decreased content. These hybrids continue to express a number of other transformed phenotypes. Conversely, a number of tumorigenic hybrids continue to express relatively high levels of LETS protein when compared with nontumorigenic hybrids. Thus an alteration in LETS protein expression by itself, or in concert with a spectrum of other transformation properties, does not appear to be a sufficient requirement for tumorigenicity and lends further support to an apparent separate control of the transformed versus tumorigenic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2056789103,"We have studied the structural changes within the body-wall muscle cells of Caenorhabditis elegans during postmitotic development. In wildtype, the number of sarcomeres progressively increases, and each sarcomere appears to grow in length and depth continuously during this period. In mature wild-type cells, the anterior-most body-wall muscle cells have 6--7 sarcomeres; the rest have 9--10 sarcomeres per cell. Twelve mutants in the unc-52 II gene exhibit markedly retarded sarcomere construction and progressive paralysis. Several unc-52 mutants, such as the severely paralyzed SU200, produced only 2--3 sarcomeres per body-wall muscle cell, while the other mildly paralyzed unc-52 mutants, such as SU250, build 3--4 sarcomeres per muscle cell. Other structures such as the pharynx and even the noncontractile organelles of the body-wall muscle cells do not appear to be structurally or functionally altered. The unc-52 body-wall sarcomeres become moderately disorganized as they are outstripped by cell growth; sufficient order is preserved, however, so that the majority of thick and thin filaments still interdigitate. The myosin heavy chains of SU200 body-wall muscle fail to accumulate normally, while the pharyngeal myosin heavy chains do not appear to be specifically affected. This biochemical result correlates well with the specificity of morphological changes in the mutant. A model is discussed in which the biochemical and morphological deficits are explained by a simple regulatory mechanism."

Pulse labeling of DNA and analysis of the products on alkaline sucrose gradients showed that synthesis of primary replication units (which will also be referred to as ""Okazaki"" fragments) occurred throughout the S period. Pulse and pulse-chase experiments revealed a distinct pattern of size maturation. An apparently linear increase in molecular weight of progeny DNA molecules during the first hour of the S phase occurred at a rate of approximately 4-5 X 10(5) daltons per min at 26 degrees C, corresponding to the joining of 6-8 Okazaki fragments. The resulting 35-45S (1.1-2.2 X 10(7) daltons) DNA molecules may correspond to the Physarum ""replicon."" The further size increases of the newly made DNA appear to occur in steps, possibly reflecting a clustering of isochronous replicons along the chromatide. These observations are discussed with regard to mechanisms of DNA replication and size maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2059124413,"DNA was extracted from Paracentrotus lividus embryos at the third S phase afer fertilization and analyzed with the electron microscope. The most relevant structures observed in this actively replicating DNA are clusters of short, closely spaced microbubbles (about 0.1 micron long on the average), partially or entirely single-stranded molecules and few linear forks. Unexpectedly, no long eye forms were observed. The analysis of DNA purified from gastrulae and from adult somatic tissues has revealed the same structures, although at a low frequency. A quantitative analysis has been carried out to determine the size distribution and spacing of microbubbles. A number of control experiments have been performed to characterize these structures better. Various possiblities are discussed to account for the presence of the observed forms and the absence of larger eyes."
https://openalex.org/W1981808768,"Evidence suggests that alloxan reacts with membrane-bound glucoreceptors and that it competes with glucose molecules for these sites. We therefore administered small quantities of alloxan into the cerebrospinal fluid of rats to determine what effect this might have on their ability to react to changes of glucose concentration. Rats treated in this manner did not eat as much as controls in response to the intraperitoneal administration of 2-deoxyglucose or to a 24-hour fast, and they became hypoglycemic significantly sooner than controls when fasted. The data suggest that the function of brain glucoreceptors is to protect the body from sudden decreases of glucose and that these glucoreceptors play little if any role in the normal regulation or maintenance of feeding, body weight, or blood glucose concentrations."

The results indicated that the stem cell number decreased exponentially with age."
