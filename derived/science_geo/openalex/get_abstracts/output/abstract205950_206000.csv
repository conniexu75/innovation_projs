https://openalex.org/W2065606227,THE requirement for vitamin E is largely represented by a need for a biologically active lipid antioxidant. Vitamin E-deficient animals show in vivo lipid peroxidation and a wide variety of metabolic changes1. How metabolic changes are related to lipid peroxidation is a major problem.

https://openalex.org/W1976336990,Fertilized eggs have been obtained from queen honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) inseminated with sperm that had been stored in vitro at above-freezing temperatures for up to 68 days. The effects of various experimental storage treatments on semen are described. Semen shipped by ordinary mail has been successfully used for artificial insemination.

https://openalex.org/W2023070116,"SLOW-action potentials have been found in various sensory receptors in response to adequate stimuli. They were first found in the olfactory epithelium of a dog by Hosoya and Yoshida1. Recently, Ottoson2 studied them extensively in the olfactory epithelium of a frog. He showed that the action potential is of a triangular shape, having a steeply rising limb, a round summit and a gradually falling limb in an exponential curve. When the duration of the olfactory stimulus is long, a plateau appears in the middle of the falling limb and continues as long as the stimulation. It is succeeded by an exponentially falling limb at the cessation of stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W2094582636,"IN the olfactory bulb of the hedgehog and the rabbit, Adrian1,2 found that the potential waves evoked by olfactory stimulation take shapes of potential oscillation. It was presumed that the waves were developed by synchronized activity in the dendritic region of the bulb. Later, he3 recorded the similar potential in the olfactory epithelium of the rabbit, and found that the potential pattern in the epithelium has all the features of that appearing in the bulb. In the experiment, Adrian3 did not record the potentials in the epithelium and the bulb simultaneously; but from the similarity he presumed that the mechanism which produces the potential oscillation in the bulb originates in the olfactory epithelium. In the olfactory epithelium of the frog, Ottoson4 found that rhythmic waves sometimes superimpose on the crest of the slow potentials produced by odour stimulation. He presumed that they are identical to the potential oscillations found by Adrian1–3."

https://openalex.org/W1977655513,"ALTHOUGH it has been well known that the administration of posterior lobe hormones induces premature oviposit ion in the hen, Gallus domesticus
1,2, as in other fowls3, it remains undetermined whether the hormone(s) plays an essential part in normal oviposition. The results presented here may throw light on the mechanism of oviposition in the domestic fowl."

This additional increase is probably a carbon-14 equivalent to the spring peaks in strontium-90 fallout in the North Temperate Zone in the same years, and suggests latitudinal variations in carbon-14 contamination."
https://openalex.org/W1502968199,"IT is known that certain plant tissues can convert 3-indolylacetonitrile to the highly active plant growth substance 3-indolylacetic acid1–3 and we have shown that other plant tissues are able to bring about an α-oxidation of 3-indolylacetonitrile to yield 3-indolylcarboxylic acid which is inactive3,4. A recent publication by Thimann and Mahadevan5 describing the extraction of what is believed to be a hydrolytic enzyme from the stems and leaves of certain monocotyledons (Gramineae), which is capable of converting 3-indolylacetonitrile to 3-indolylacetic acid, prompts us to report upon experiments using a cell-free extract of etiolated stems of a dicotyledon (Pisum). A clear demonstration of the α-oxidation of 3-indolylacetonitrile to 3-indolylcarboxylic acid is given by this extract."

https://openalex.org/W2089707779,The conductivity and reducing-sugar content of water extracts of seeds were found to be correlated with stands produced under conditions favoring pre-emergence damping-off. Conductivity proved to be a rapid method of predicting relative differences in cold-test stands from lots of seed of the same variety.

https://openalex.org/W2036509301,"THE finding that a transamination process is operative in metaphyseal cartilage of growing animals1 led to drawn some relationship between protein metabolism and mineralization2. Moreover, the observation that cortisone treatment which is known to inhibit skeletal development3 probably through a blocking activity on sulphate incorporation in the mucopolysaccharides4 of the organic matrix, also decreases the activity of glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase in metaphyseal cartilage5, suggests an active participation of transamination to osteogenesis, or at least in one of the metabolic processes leading to mineralization."

The rates of dialysis of these two sugars are influenced by 0.01 and 0.1N solutions of sodium and potassium hydroxide. The rate of dialysis of sucrose is not influenced by the solutions employed."

The relation between gross gamma activity and soil depth for a particular soil (Miami silt loam) is presented, together with a discussion of the contribution of K(40) and the uranium and thorium series and of the effects of fallout from bomb tests in increasing the radioactivity of a thin layer of surface soil."

Galbraith has repeated the experiment; but hitherto, attempts to recover adults of A. lescherae from dried material have failed. A detailed description of these experiments has already been given2,3 and the behaviour of developing Amoebae of the proteus-type4 fully portrayed. This communication announces the successful recovery of adult A. lescherae by the following method."
