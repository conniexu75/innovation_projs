https://openalex.org/W2117239687,"This paper - first published on-line in November 2008 - draws on data from an early version of the Google Flu Trends search engine to estimate the levels of flu in a population. It introduces a computational model that converts raw search query data into a region-by-region real-time surveillance system that accurately estimates influenza activity with a lag of about one day - one to two weeks faster than the conventional reports published by the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control. This report introduces a computational model based on internet search queries for real-time surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI), which reproduces the patterns observed in ILI data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seasonal influenza epidemics are a major public health concern, causing tens of millions of respiratory illnesses and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year1. In addition to seasonal influenza, a new strain of influenza virus against which no previous immunity exists and that demonstrates human-to-human transmission could result in a pandemic with millions of fatalities2. Early detection of disease activity, when followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of both seasonal and pandemic influenza3,4. One way to improve early detection is to monitor health-seeking behaviour in the form of queries to online search engines, which are submitted by millions of users around the world each day. Here we present a method of analysing large numbers of Google search queries to track influenza-like illness in a population. Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with influenza-like symptoms, we can accurately estimate the current level of weekly influenza activity in each region of the United States, with a reporting lag of about one day. This approach may make it possible to use search queries to detect influenza epidemics in areas with a large population of web search users."

https://openalex.org/W2141523934,"Semiconducting nanowires offer the possibility of nearly unlimited complex bottom-up design, which allows for new device concepts. However, essential parameters that determine the electronic quality of the wires, and which have not been controlled yet for the III-V compound semiconductors, are the wire crystal structure and the stacking fault density. In addition, a significant feature would be to have a constant spacing between rotational twins in the wires such that a twinning superlattice is formed, as this is predicted to induce a direct bandgap in normally indirect bandgap semiconductors, such as silicon and gallium phosphide. Optically active versions of these technologically relevant semiconductors could have a significant impact on the electronics and optics industry. Here we show first that we can control the crystal structure of indium phosphide (InP) nanowires by using impurity dopants. We have found that zinc decreases the activation barrier for two-dimensional nucleation growth of zinc-blende InP and therefore promotes crystallization of the InP nanowires in the zinc-blende, instead of the commonly found wurtzite, crystal structure. More importantly, we then demonstrate that we can, once we have enforced the zinc-blende crystal structure, induce twinning superlattices with long-range order in InP nanowires. We can tune the spacing of the superlattices by changing the wire diameter and the zinc concentration, and we present a model based on the distortion of the catalyst droplet in response to the evolution of the cross-sectional shape of the nanowires to quantitatively explain the formation of the periodic twinning."
https://openalex.org/W2007268662,"It is know that there is a link between some types of chronic inflammation and certain cancers. Now a genetic study of liver tumour tissues has identified gain-of-function mutations in the IL6ST gene, part of an inflammatory signalling pathway that codes for the interleukin-6 co-receptor gp130, as a possible early step on the development of benign liver tumours. This mutation in IL6ST was frequently found together with mutations in β-catenin, suggesting that they may cooperate in promoting tumorigenesis. Inflammatory heptocellular adenomas (IHCAs) show activation of an acute-phase inflammatory response signalling pathways, and it is found that this is due to gain-of function mutations in the IL6ST gene encoding gp130, a coreceptor for IL-6 and other cytokines that activate inflammatory signalling pathways. These mutations lead to constitutive activation of STAT3 signalling, contributing to the inflammatory phenotype of IHACs. Inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas are benign liver tumours defined by the presence of inflammatory infiltrates and by the increased expression of inflammatory proteins in tumour hepatocytes1,2. Here we show a marked activation of the interleukin (IL)-6 signalling pathway in this tumour type; sequencing candidate genes pinpointed this response to somatic gain-of-function mutations in the IL6ST gene, which encodes the signalling co-receptor gp130. Indeed, 60% of inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas harbour small in-frame deletions that target the binding site of gp130 for IL-6, and expression of four different gp130 mutants in hepatocellular cells activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the absence of ligand. Furthermore, analysis of hepatocellular carcinomas revealed that rare gp130 alterations are always accompanied by β-catenin-activating mutations, suggesting a cooperative effect of these signalling pathways in the malignant conversion of hepatocytes. The recurrent gain-of-function gp130 mutations in these human hepatocellular adenomas fully explains activation of the acute inflammatory phase observed in tumourous hepatocytes, and suggests that similar alterations may occur in other inflammatory epithelial tumours with STAT3 activation."

https://openalex.org/W2031182614,"Background Malignant gliomas rank among the most lethal cancers. Gliomas display a striking cellular heterogeneity with a hierarchy of differentiation states. Recent studies support the existence of cancer stem cells in gliomas that are functionally defined by their capacity for extensive self-renewal and formation of secondary tumors that phenocopy the original tumors. As the c-Myc oncoprotein has recognized roles in normal stem cell biology, we hypothesized that c-Myc may contribute to cancer stem cell biology as these cells share characteristics with normal stem cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on previous methods that we and others have employed, tumor cell populations were enriched or depleted for cancer stem cells using the stem cell marker CD133 (Prominin-1). We characterized c-Myc expression in matched tumor cell populations using real time PCR, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Here we report that c-Myc is highly expressed in glioma cancer stem cells relative to non-stem glioma cells. To interrogate the significance of c-Myc expression in glioma cancer stem cells, we targeted its expression using lentivirally transduced short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Knockdown of c-Myc in glioma cancer stem cells reduced proliferation with concomitant cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and increased apoptosis. Non-stem glioma cells displayed limited dependence on c-Myc expression for survival and proliferation. Further, glioma cancer stem cells with decreased c-Myc levels failed to form neurospheres in vitro or tumors when xenotransplanted into the brains of immunocompromised mice. Conclusions/Significance These findings support a central role of c-Myc in regulating proliferation and survival of glioma cancer stem cells. Targeting core stem cell pathways may offer improved therapeutic approaches for advanced cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2023025638,"Ancient DNA isolated from fossils and tissue preserved in permafrost has long held a fascination. Though broken up into small scraps and all-but swamped by modern microbial DNA, its sequences have provided glimpses of extinct life forms. Now the same massively parallel synthetic DNA sequencing technologies that are bringing the personal genomics revolution have revolutionized the field of ancient DNA too. The first report of the sequencing of the nearly complete nuclear genome of an extinct animal — the woolly mammoth — appears in this issue. Comparison of the woolly mammoth genome with that of the African elephant show that unexpectedly, both genomes are likely to be at least 40% larger than those of the fully sequence placental mammals. The recent PNAS paper on the cloning of mice from bodies stored in a freezer for 16 years prompted news reports that the cloning of mammoths was imminent. How likely is that? Henry Nicholls asks the question and concludes that for now, it is still fantasy. But that is what cloning mammals was just 15 years ago. Watch this space, but be patient. This is the first report of the sequencing of the nearly complete nuclear genome of an extinct animal, the woolly mammoth. 4.1 billion bases of high quality sequence from several mammoth species are reported, including 3.3 billion bases from the woolly mammoth. Nuclear-genome sequencing of extinct species and its comparison with the extant relatives (in this case African elephant) provide insights into elephantid evolution and population differences. In 1994, two independent groups extracted DNA from several Pleistocene epoch mammoths and noted differences among individual specimens1,2. Subsequently, DNA sequences have been published for a number of extinct species. However, such ancient DNA is often fragmented and damaged3, and studies to date have typically focused on short mitochondrial sequences, never yielding more than a fraction of a per cent of any nuclear genome. Here we describe 4.17 billion bases (Gb) of sequence from several mammoth specimens, 3.3 billion (80%) of which are from the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) genome and thus comprise an extensive set of genome-wide sequence from an extinct species. Our data support earlier reports4 that elephantid genomes exceed 4 Gb. The estimated divergence rate between mammoth and African elephant is half of that between human and chimpanzee. The observed number of nucleotide differences between two particular mammoths was approximately one-eighth of that between one of them and the African elephant, corresponding to a separation between the mammoths of 1.5–2.0 Myr. The estimated probability that orthologous elephant and mammoth amino acids differ is 0.002, corresponding to about one residue per protein. Differences were discovered between mammoth and African elephant in amino-acid positions that are otherwise invariant over several billion years of combined mammalian evolution. This study shows that nuclear genome sequencing of extinct species can reveal population differences not evident from the fossil record, and perhaps even discover genetic factors that affect extinction."

https://openalex.org/W2035277980,"The simplest animal eyes are eyespots composed of two cells only: a photoreceptor and a shading pigment cell. They resemble Darwin’s ‘proto-eyes’, considered to be the first eyes to appear in animal evolution1,2,3,4. Eyespots cannot form images but enable the animal to sense the direction of light. They are characteristic for the zooplankton larvae of marine invertebrates and are thought to mediate larval swimming towards the light. Phototaxis of invertebrate larvae contributes to the vertical migration of marine plankton5, which is thought to represent the biggest biomass transport on Earth6,7. Yet, despite its ecological and evolutionary importance, the mechanism by which eyespots regulate phototaxis is poorly understood. Here we show how simple eyespots in marine zooplankton mediate phototactic swimming, using the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii as a model8. We find that the selective illumination of one eyespot changes the beating of adjacent cilia by direct cholinergic innervation resulting in locally reduced water flow. Computer simulations of larval swimming show that these local effects are sufficient to direct the helical swimming trajectories towards the light. The computer model also shows that axial rotation of the larval body is essential for phototaxis and that helical swimming increases the precision of navigation. These results provide, to our knowledge, the first mechanistic understanding of phototaxis in a marine zooplankton larva and show how simple eyespots regulate it. We propose that the underlying direct coupling of light sensing and ciliary locomotor control was a principal feature of the proto-eye and an important landmark in the evolution of animal eyes."

https://openalex.org/W2072139304,"Replication forks are impeded by DNA damage and protein-nucleic acid complexes such as transcribing RNA polymerase. For example, head-on collision of the replisome with RNA polymerase results in replication fork arrest. However, co-directional collision of the replisome with RNA polymerase has little or no effect on fork progression. Here we examine co-directional collisions between a replisome and RNA polymerase in vitro. We show that the Escherichia coli replisome uses the RNA transcript as a primer to continue leading-strand synthesis after the collision with RNA polymerase that is displaced from the DNA. This action results in a discontinuity in the leading strand, yet the replisome remains intact and bound to DNA during the entire process. These findings underscore the notable plasticity by which the replisome operates to circumvent obstacles in its path and may explain why the leading strand is synthesized discontinuously in vivo."

Despite a high sequence similarity (>65%) and analogous sequence-based domain architectures, STIM1 and STIM2 differentially influence these phenomena. Among all eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum luminal portion of STIM proteins minimally encode EF-hand and sterile α-motif (SAM) domains (EF-SAM), which are responsible for sensing changes in Ca2+ levels and initiating oligomerization. STIM oligomerization is a key induction step in the activation of Ca2+-permeable channels on the plasma membrane.

Calcium is an essential signaling messenger in every eukaryotic cell, regulating diverse and kinetically distinct cellular phenomena (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cytoplasmic Ca2+ entry occurs in these cells via two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms with distinguishable spatio-temporal characteristics; 1) transient elevation takes place via Ca2+ efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 4The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; STIM, stromal interaction molecule; SOCE, store-operated Ca2+ entry; SOC, store-operated Ca2+; SAM, sterile α-motif; PM, plasma membrane; SLS, static light scattering; DLS, dynamic light scattering.4The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; STIM, stromal interaction molecule; SOCE, store-operated Ca2+ entry; SOC, store-operated Ca2+; SAM, sterile α-motif; PM, plasma membrane; SLS, static light scattering; DLS, dynamic light scattering. luminal stores, and 2) sustained Ca2+ influx ensues from the extracellular space. The link between these processes is termed store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and is a major Ca2+ entry pathway in eukaryotic cells (2Putney Jr., J.W.

Receptor-stimulated inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate production induces ER Ca2+ store depletion, which signals activation of highly Ca2+-selective channels on the plasma membrane (PM), providing the sustained influx to the cytoplasm. SOCE is crucial to modulating a litany of regulatory processes including gene expression, protein folding, and initiation of cell death pathways (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Urea-induced unfolding was monitored by changes in intrinsic fluorescence emission at 330 nm induced by excitation light at 280 nm on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC fluorometer (Shimadzu Corp.). Samples were in 1-ml (1-cm path length) ES quartz cuvettes. Excitation and emission slit widths were 1.5 and 10 mm, respectively. Integration time was set to 0.25 s over the 300-s time course. Kinetics were non-linearly fit to a single exponential decay with a sloping baseline, y=Aexp(-kx)+mx+b(Eq. 1) where y is the fluorescence signal, A is the absolute change in fluorescence, k is the unfolding rate constant (kunf), m is the slope of the unfolded baseline, b is the intercept of the unfolded baseline, and x is time. Static and Dynamic Light Scattering (SLS/DLS)—Light scattering measurements were made with a Dynapro DLS module (Wyatt Technologies, Inc.) using a scattering angle of 90° and incident laser light of 825 nm. Samples (0.2-ml) were in 0.3-cm ES quartz cuvettes or 1.0-cm UVettes (Eppendorf AG). SLS intensity was collected every 3–10 s (3–10-s averaging time) over each time course. The average of the first and last 10 consecutive correlation functions (10 s of averaging time each) for the t =∼0 and t =∼5000 s distribution of hydrodynamic radii, respectively, was employed for deconvolution using the accompanying DYNAMICS software (Wyatt Technologies, Inc.). EF-SAM undergoes Ca2+ depletion-dependent oligomerization (27Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y. Plevin M.J. Ames J.B. Ikura M. J. Biol.

Commun. 2008; 369: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), where the stability of the EF-hand-SAM intramolecular interaction is fundamental to this Ca2+-sensing mechanism (12Stathopulos P.B. Zheng L. Li G.Y. Plevin M.J. Ikura M. Cell. 2008; 135: 110-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Because the EF-hand and SAM domains are minimally conserved among all species-specific STIM proteins (29Cai X. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e609Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), investigating the aggregation characteristics of EF-SAM isoforms may shed light on the basis for differences in STIM function. Here, we assessed the EF-SAM oligomerization kinetics in a Ca2+-free context to gain further insight into the functional disparities between STIM1 and STIM2. STIM1 EF-SAM Unfolds Faster than STIM2—Oligomerization of EF-SAM is coupled with partial unfolding as a loss in α-helicity is observed concomitant with an increase in random coil and aggregation upon Ca2+ depletion (27Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y. Plevin M.J. Ames J.B. Ikura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35855-35862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The time-dependent loss in helical structure was used as a kinetic probe to oligomerization by monitoring far-UV CD at 225 nm. Ca2+-depleted STIM1 EF-SAM shows no time dependence on the loss in α-helicity as the CD signal is unchanged at high and low protein concentrations (Fig. 1B). In contrast, STIM2 EF-SAM undergoes a much slower change from a highly α-helical state to a conformation that resembles STIM1 EF-SAM (low α-helicity). The kinetics for STIM2 EF-SAM exhibits a protein concentration dependence with the highest concentration undergoing the fastest transformation (Fig. 1B). To assess whether the oligomerization-coupled partial unfolding rates are consistent with the inherent unfolding ability of these isoforms, we measured the denaturant-induced unfolding kinetics using intrinsic fluorescence. The urea-induced unfolding curves were well fit to a single exponential (Fig. 1C); the apparent single phase is consistent with the two-state equilibrium data previously reported for EF-SAM and the folding of EF-SAM as a single structural entity (27Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y. Plevin M.J. Ames J.B. Ikura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35855-35862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The unfolding rate of STIM1 EF-SAM was ∼3.5–4-fold faster than STIM2 over the range of urea concentrations tested (2.25–3.25 m) (Fig. 1C, inset). The faster rate of unfolding implies that STIM1 EF-SAM more readily accesses the aggregation-coupled partially unfolded state than STIM2 and is coherent with the markedly quicker oligomerization-coupled unfolding observed in Fig. 1B. STIM2 EF-SAM Aggregates Show a Distribution of Hydrodynamic Radii Similar to STIM1—DLS was employed to assess the distribution of hydrodynamic radii for the EF-SAM isoforms as a function of time. The inherently oligomeric distribution of radii centered at ∼7–10 nm does not change with time for STIM1 (Fig. 2A), whereas STIM2 EF-SAM solutions evolve from monomers of ∼2 nm to oligomers of ∼5–10 nm resembling STIM1 (Fig. 2B). STIM2 EF-SAM aggregation kinetics is protein concentration-dependent (Fig. 2D) as observed for the coupled unfolding (Fig. 1B), whereas STIM1 is aggregated independent of protein concentration (Fig. 2C). The SLS intensity of aggregated STIM2 EF-SAM is greater than STIM1 at the highest protein concentration, indicating that although the bulk of the oligomers have similar hydrodynamic radii (Fig. 2, A and B), STIM2 forms a greater percentage of larger aggregates, which contributes the majority of the SLS intensity. The non-linearity in SLS intensity versus size precludes the fitting of meaningful rate constants. To confirm that the Ca2+-free aggregation propensities are retained under more physiological circumstances, we reassessed the kinetics starting from a Ca2+-loaded monomeric state at 37 °C. Upon the addition of 50 mm EDTA to EF-SAM in 5 mm CaCl2, the SLS intensity abruptly began to increase for STIM1 indicative of oligomerization (supplemental Fig. 1A); STIM2 demonstrated a much slower aggregation response to Ca2+ depletion (supplemental Fig. 1B). Adjacent EF-SAM-flanking Residues Contribute to the N-terminal Stability of STIM Proteins—We investigated the effect of including all luminal residues on the stability of the constructs. Inclusion of residues 1–57 in the STIM1 EF-SAM construct (residues 58–201) yielded little recoverable protein, likely due to the hydrophobic nature of the ER signal peptide (residues 1–22); however, expression and purification of a construct encoding residues 23–213 was feasible. A STIM2 construct encompassing similar residue boundaries was susceptible to C-terminal degradation. Consequently, the long-N STIM2 construct was truncated at the C terminus (residues 15–205) to avoid the degradation issues. The CD spectra of long-N STIM proteins (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B) display very similar spectral bands as the Ca2+-loaded EF-SAM counterparts (27Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y. Plevin M.J. Ames J.B. Ikura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35855-35862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 28Zheng L. Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y. Ikura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). An important distinction is the intensity of the negative bands, where the long-N proteins yield less signal than EF-SAM normalized on a per residue basis (mean residue ellipticity); this difference implies that residues 23–57 for STIM1 and 15–61 for STIM2 adopt a considerable random coil character. Upon Ca2+ depletion of long-N STIM1, the intensity of the 222 nm band decreases markedly, whereas the 208 nm band decreases and is coupled with a shift to shorter wavelengths, indicative of increased overall random coil (supplemental Fig. 2A). The Ca2+ depletion-induced spectral changes for STIM2 are much more modest with only a small reduction in band intensity at both 208 nm and 222 nm (supplemental Fig. 2B). The Ca2+-dependent conformational changes of the long-N constructs mimic those of the EF-SAM constructs (27Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y. Plevin M.J. Ames J.B. Ikura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35855-35862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 28Zheng L. Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y. Ikura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The stability of the long-N STIM constructs was assessed by monitoring changes in the CD signal at 225 nm as a function of temperature. The midpoint of the heat-induced loss in structure (Tmid) was ∼59.5 °C in the presence of Ca2+ and ∼37.5 °C in the Ca2+-depleted state for STIM1 (supplemental Fig. 2C). These Tmid values for long-N STIM1 are ∼14.5 and 16.5 °C higher than measured for Ca2+-depleted and -loaded EF-SAM, respectively (27Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y. Plevin M.J. Ames J.B. Ikura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35855-35862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 28Zheng L. Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y. Ikura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Tmid of long-N STIM2 in the absence and presence of Ca2+ was augmented by ∼14.5 and 13.5 °C (supplemental Fig. 2D), respectively, when compared with the EF-SAM constructs (28Zheng L. Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y. Ikura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These data indicate that residues 23–57 for STIM1 and 15–61 for STIM2 have a marked stabilizing effect on the N-terminal of STIM proteins. The role of STIM1 as an ER Ca2+ sensor that signals opening of Orai1-composed PM SOC channels is well established (4Roos J. DiGregorio P.J. Yeromin A.V. Ohlsen K. Lioudyno M. Zhang S. Safrina O.

Kinet J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The function of STIM2 is more capricious; initial screening identified both STIM1 and STIM2 as positive regulators of SOCE (5Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1235-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). Follow-up studies indicated that STIM2 is an inhibitor of STIM1 punctae formation and SOCE (13Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. Hewavitharana T. He L.P. Xu W. Johnstone L.S. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1465-1470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that STIM2-Orai1 co-overexpression constitutively activates SOCE (24Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. Tang X.D. Hewavitharana T. Xu W. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20661-20665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Both Ca2+-independent as well as Ca2+-sensing roles in SOCE activation were described, linking calmodulin as a subregulator of STIM2 function (25Parvez S. Beck A. Peinelt C. Soboloff J. Lis A. Monteilh-Zoller M. Gill D.L. Fleig A. Penner R. FASEB J. 2007; 22: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). More recently, STIM2 was reported as a regulator of basal cytoplasmic, and luminal Ca2+ levels via the Orai1 channel, where STIM2 Ca2+ sensing (i.e. Ca2+ depletion, oligomerization and ER-PM translocation) occurs at higher luminal Ca2+ levels than STIM1; moreover, depending on time and levels of expression, activating and inhibiting roles for STIM2 in SOCE were observed (26Brandman O. Liou J. Park W.S. Meyer T. Cell. 2007; 131: 1327-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Our STIM1 EF-SAM solution structure afforded new insight into the basis for Ca2+ sensing by this luminal region; due to the high sequence similarity (i.e. >85%), an analogous structure can be inferred for STIM2 EF-SAM (12Stathopulos P.B. Zheng L. Li G.Y. Plevin M.J. Ikura M. Cell. 2008; 135: 110-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Despite the probable gross structural mechanistic similarity between EF-SAM entities, here we reveal isoform distinctions at the kinetic level. STIM2 EF-SAM exhibits markedly decreased rates of oligomerization relative to STIM1. The observable concentration dependence in the CD and light scattering for STIM2 is consistent with this slower change in molecularity. Ca2+-free STIM1 EF-SAM is directly unstructured and oligomeric, whereas STIM2 initially retains a well folded structure marginally different from the Ca2+-loaded state. The presence of this stably folded state for STIM2 but not STIM1 (28Zheng L. Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y. Ikura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) is the basis for the difference in the EF-SAM oligomerization dynamics. STIM1 EF-SAM undergoes rapid kinetic partial unfolding coupled with aggregation, whereas STIM2 exhibits markedly reduced, albeit concentration-dependent, rates of aggregation coupled to partial unfolding. The slower aggregation kinetics and increased stability of STIM2 EF-SAM versus STIM1 may have contributed to the inconsistencies observed in cell culture (see above). The moderate stability of Ca2+-depleted long-N STIM2 (Tmid ∼50.5 °C) may allow oligomerization to be influenced by the relative membrane-tethered concentration, temperature, pH, pressure, and/or osmolytes; destabilizing factors could facilitate an oligomeric fate, whereas stabilizing phenomena could curtail STIM2-mediated SOCE initiation. Concentration, due to differing cell type or approaches in manipulating expression (i.e. transient, stable, or knockdown), and temperature (i.e. uncontrolled ambient) are examples of variable factors among the published STIM2 studies; relatively high concentrations and temperatures may promote SOCE, whereas lower levels and the potential ability of STIM2 to interact with STIM1 (see below) may inhibit SOCE (24Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. Tang X.D. Hewavitharana T. Xu W. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20661-20665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The marginal stability of Ca2+-depleted long-N STIM1 (Tmid ∼human physiological temperature) may render the oligomerization fate undeviating if the magnitude of stabilizing phenomena cannot overcome the degree of Ca2+ depletion-induced destabilization. The long-N construct data reveal that the entire luminal sequence of STIM proteins influences the stability of the EF-hand-SAM domain interaction critical to Ca2+ sensing (12Stathopulos P.B. Zheng L. Li G.Y. Plevin M.J. Ikura M. Cell. 2008; 135: 110-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). There is large interspecies sequence variability beyond the EF-SAM entities (Fig. 1A); fine-tuning of STIM sensory function may be encoded in these extraneous N-terminal residues. For example, STIM1 from Drosophila melanogaster, Gallus gallus, and Caenorhabditis elegans all encode vastly different luminal portions beyond EF-SAM. The STIM luminal portion of D. melanogaster is extensively longer than both human isoforms, C. elegans encodes only the basic EF-SAM entity with 14 adjacent residues, and G. gallus is truncated to the canonical EF-hand loop (non-confirmed). These distinctions may contribute to hypothetical differences in sensory characteristics between all isoforms, as observed for STIM1 versus STIM2 (see above) and C. elegans STIM1 versus mammalian STIM1 (31Gao, S., Fan, Y., Chen, L., Lu, J., Xu, T., and Xu, P. (2008) Cell Calcium, in pressGoogle Scholar). The evolution of STIM1 to rapidly oligomerize via EF-SAM facilitates a prompt conversion from a quiescent to a signaling state. A decreased Ca2+ sensitivity has been proposed for STIM2; even a slightly lower Ca2+ affinity in STIM2 when compared with STIM1 would promote considerably higher fractions of unbound STIM2 at resting ER Ca2+ levels (i.e. ∼400 μm) (26Brandman O. Liou J. Park W.S. Meyer T. Cell. 2007; 131: 1327-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The persistent signaling of a low percentage of SOC channels would render the slower kinetics of EF-SAM oligomerization negligible and is consistent with a role for STIM2 in basal Ca2+ regulation (26Brandman O. Liou J. Park W.S. Meyer T. Cell. 2007; 131: 1327-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). We propose that distinct dynamics of oligomerization (reported herein) have evolved in EF-SAM isoforms to foster discrete, yet harmonizing, signals. STIM1 (marginal stability/rapid oligomerization) delivers a quick SOCE regulatory signal, relatively large in magnitude and insusceptible to local factors that affect stability; STIM2 (moderate stability/protracted oligomerization) provides persistent SOC channel activation and a lower scale SOCE signal, which is responsive to local environmental influences. Recent work on T-cells from STIM knock-out mice supports the notion of a requisite role for both mammalian isoforms in SOCE despite considerably lower levels of STIM2 expression than STIM1 in the same cells (32Oh-hora M. Yamashita M. Hogan P.G. Sharma A. Lamperti E. Chung W. Prakriya M. Feske S. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 432-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Ablation of STIM2 expression in these T-cells did not severely impair SOCE as observed for STIM1; nonetheless, a marked loss in cytokine production and decrease in nuclear factor of activated T-cells translocation demonstrated an essential role for STIM2 in these SOCE signaling events (32Oh-hora M. Yamashita M. Hogan P.G. Sharma A. Lamperti E. Chung W. Prakriya M. Feske S. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 432-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). There are limited data on cross-talk between STIM isoforms (11Williams R.T. Manji S.S. Parker N.J. Hancock M.S. Van Stekelenburg L. Eid J.P. Senior P.V. Kazenwadel J.S. Shandala T. Saint R.

Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1465-1470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it is interesting to speculate that STIM1-STIM2 associations could provide additional regulatory control over SOCE and influence ER stress-related phenomena dependent on luminal Ca2+ depletion such as the unfolded protein response (33Chen L.H. Jiang C.C. Kiejda K.A. Wang Y.F. Thorne R.F. Zhang X.D. Hersey P. Carcinogenesis. 2007; 28: 2328-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Yan X. Xing J. Lorin-Nebel C. Estevez A.Y. Nehrke K. Lamitina T. Strange K. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 443-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). STIM2 would presumably stimulate the unfolded protein response to a lesser extent than STIM1 due to the higher EF-SAM stability and could co-stabilize STIM1 through potential heterotypic interactions. Additional studies are needed to further establish the functional roles of all STIM isoforms in SOCE and other cellular processes. Download .pdf (.22 MB) Help with pdf files"

Moreover, induction of endotoxemia, acute pancreatitis, hemorrhagic shock, pulmonary hypoxic hypertension, and diabetes mellitus in animals is associated with increased H2S production due to up-regulated CSE production (1Szabo C. Nat. Rev... 2007; 6: 917-935Google Scholar, 2Li L. Bhatia M. Moore P.K. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol... 2006; 6: 125-129Google Scholar). Further, work using several of these animal disease models have revealed that either pre- or post-treatment of animals with inhibitors of CSE, such as dl-propargylglycine (PAG) or β-cyanoalanine, not only inhibit tissue H2S production but also reduce the severity of the disease state. Albeit carried out in animals, these studies serve to highlight the potential importance of CSE-mediated production of H2S in regulating a number of physiological processes in humans. Steegborn et al. (27Steegborn C. Clausen T. Sondermann P. Jacob U. Worbs M. Marinkovic S. Huber R. Wahl M.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 12675-12684Google Scholar) studied the kinetics of hCSE and reported the activity of this enzyme toward l-cystathionine, l-cystine, and l-cysteine, and several inhibition studies were performed with CSE inhibitors, including PAG. Structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of hCSE revealed insights into the enzymatic specificity among the different family members (9Messerschmidt A. Worbs M. Steegborn C. Wahl M.C. Huber R. Laber B. Clausen T. Biol. Chem... 2003; 384: 373-386Google Scholar). Recently, Yang et al. (34Yang G. Wu L. Jiang B. Yang W. Qi J. Cao K. Meng Q. Mustafa A.K. Mu W. Zhang S. Snyden S.H. Wang R. Science.. 2008; 322: 587-590Google Scholar) showed that H2S is physiologically generated by CSE and that genetic deletion of CSE in mice markedly reduces H2S levels in the serum, heart, aorta, and other tissues. Mutant mice lacking CSE display significant hypertension and reduced endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and provide direct evidence that H2S is a physiologic vasodilator and regulator of blood pressure. We report here crystal structures of human cystathionine γ-lyase in the apo form (apo-hCSE), complexed with PLP (hCSE·PLP) and with the inhibitor PAG (hCSE·PLP·PAG) at 2.4, 2.6, and 2.0 Å resolutions, respectively. This is the first report of any crystal structure of a PLP-dependent enzyme in an open conformation that does not have PLP (or a PLP derivative) bound in the active site. In addition, when compared with other PAG complexes, the PAG in hCSE reveals a unique inhibition mechanism, in which PAG does not bind to PLP but adopts a new position in the active site and highlights the singular importance of Tyr114 in hCSE. Further, the crystal structures together with the biochemical and biophysical characterizations provide deeper understanding of the mechanism of hCSE catalysis. We believe that these findings will assist the development of novel inhibitors of hCSE that may be of clinical use in the treatment of a range of disease states resulting from overproduction of H2S. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The hCSE gene was cloned into a pET-28-based expression vector incorporating a tobacco etch virus-cleavable N-terminal His tag fusion (pNIC-Bsa4). The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL-21(DE3) and grown in a potassium phosphate-buffered Terrific Broth medium. Expression of hCSE was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and the culture was grown overnight at 18 °C. Cells were harvested and sonicated in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). hCSE was purified on a Hi-Trap chelating nickel column (elution buffer: 50 mm sodium phosphate, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 300 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, pH 7.5), followed by a Superdex 200 gel filtration column on the Äkta Express (GE Healthcare) using the gel filtration buffer (20 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, pH 7.5). The N-terminal hexahistidine tag was removed by incubating hCSE protein with His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease at a ratio of 30:1 and passing the cleavage reaction through a HisTrap FF crude column in gel filtration buffer supplemented with 10 mm imidazole. Eluted hCSE was concentrated to 12.2 mg/ml. At the same time, hCSE cDNA was cloned into pGEX4T-3 to create an N-terminal GST fusion. The expression vector was transformed into E. coli BL21 and induced at 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C overnight. Cells were harvested, sonicated, and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). hCSE protein was cleaved in the GST beads with thrombin and eluted from the beads with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 units of thrombin (Sigma). The eluted protein was further passed through a Superdex 200 gel filtration column using an ÄKTA FPLC UPC-900 system (GE Healthcare) and was concentrated to 5 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. It has to be noted that this work was initially started independently by two different research groups using two different expression systems. Crystallization and Data Collection—Initial crystallization conditions were identified from the JCSG+ and Nextal crystal screens (Qiagen) using sitting drop and hanging drop vapor diffusion methods at room temperature. Crystals were grown by mixing equal amounts of protein solution (10 mg/ml hCSE·PLP complex; 5 mg/ml apo-hCSE in the presence of 10 mm l-cysteine) and reservoir solution containing 15% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mm ammonium citrate, pH 5.6, for hCSE·PLP complex and 20% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 1000, 0.2 m lithium sulfate, 0.1 m phosphate-citrate, pH 4.2, for the apo-hCSE. All tags were removed prior to crystallization. Regardless of their fusion tags, the proteins used for crystallization experiments were equivalent and showed the characteristic absorption for the PLP-lysine internal aldimine bond. However, the bound PLP of the GST-tagged purified hCSE was most likely lost during crystallization. For the apo-hCSE, rod-shaped crystals with the smallest dimension measuring ∼30 μm were obtained after 3 days. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline X12C (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory) using a Q315 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp., Poway, CA). Plate like crystals of hCSE·PLP appeared after 1 day and continued to grow for 1 week. The hCSE·PLP·PAG complex was obtained by soaking crystals of hCSE·PLP in mother liquid supplemented with 10 mm PAG, incubating for 55 min. Diffraction data for hCSE·PLP was collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID29 (Grenoble, France) on a Q315 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp., Poway, CA). For the hCSE·PLP·PAG complex, diffraction data were collected at Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung (BESSY) beamline BL 14.1 (Berlin, Germany) on a MarCCD detector. 20–25% (v/v) glycerol was supplemented with crystallization condition as the cryoprotectant for all crystals used in the experiments.

Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr... 1997; 30: 1022-1025Google Scholar) with the coordinates of S. cerevisiae CSE (9Messerschmidt A. Worbs M. Steegborn C. Wahl M.C. Huber R. Laber B. Clausen T. Biol. Chem... 2003; 384: 373-386Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1N8P) as the search model. All four molecules of the asymmetric unit were identified. The resulting model with the electron density map was examined in the program COOT (10Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr... 2004; 60: 2126-2132Google Scholar), and the necessary manual model building was carried out. Several cycles of map fitting and refinement using the program Refmac5 (11Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr... 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar) led to convergence. Translation/libration/screw (TLS) refinement using three TLS groups per monomer were used in the refinement process (12Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr... 2006; 39: 109-111Google Scholar). The TLS groups were selected using the tlsmd server (available on the World Wide Web). Data in the interval 19.9–2.6 Å resolution were used, and at the end of the refinement the R value was 0.180 (Rfree = 0.245) for all reflections. Similarly, the hCSE·PLP coordinates were used to determine the structure of apo-hCSE by molecular replacement using MolRep (8Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr... 1997; 30: 1022-1025Google Scholar). Four molecules of the asymmetric unit were identified. The model building and refinement were carried out using the programs COOT (10Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr... 2004; 60: 2126-2132Google Scholar) and CNS (13Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Crystallogr... 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar), which led to the convergence of R factor to 0.221 (Rfree = 0.236) for reflections with I > σI up to 2.4 Å resolution. For the hCSE·PLP·PAG complex, the coordinates for hCSE·PLP were used to obtain initial phases using MolRep (8Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr... 1997; 30: 1022-1025Google Scholar). Four molecules were present in the asymmetric unit. Data in the interval 19.9–2.0 Å resolution were used, and at the end of the refinement, the R value was 0.158 (Rfree = 0.204) for all reflections. For both hCSE·PLP and hCSE·PLP·PAG complexes and apo-hCSE, noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied throughout the refinement. Size Exclusion Analysis of hCSE—Purified hCSE was maintained in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.8) at a concentration of 6 mg/ml. hCSE was then diluted with either buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8) or buffer B (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.0, 10 mm cysteine) to 0.5 mg/ml and incubated at 4 °C overnight. These two samples were then loaded on 16/60 Superdex 200 column and run with buffer A or B, respectively. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Experiment—The oligomeric state of hCSE was investigated by using a Beckman-Coulter XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge fitted with an eight-hole AN-50 Ti rotor and double-sector centerpieces. Samples used for these experiments were 0.4 ml in volume and a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in buffer A or buffer B, and the same buffer of 0.44 ml in volume was loaded in the reference sector. The sedimentation velocity profiles were collected by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm as the samples were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm at 20 °C. Multiple scans at different time points were fitted to a continuous size distribution by using the SEDFIT program (14Schuck P. Biophys. J... 2000; 78: 1606-1619Google Scholar). Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Ion mobility mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a Synapt HDMS mass spectrometer with 8K quadrupole (Waters, Manchester, UK). The spectra were displayed in Masslynx, and IMS ToF data were displayed in DriftScope. Samples of PLP-bound hCSE and apo-hCSE (∼2 μm) in buffer A and buffer B were buffer-exchanged into 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.5, and injected using a nanospray source. Assay of H2S Production—Kinetics studies were performed using a spectrophotometric assay as described by Stipanuk and Beck (15Stipanuk M.H. Beck P.W. Biochem. J... 1982; 206: 267-277Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Each test consisted of 5 μg of the purified hCSE enzyme, 2 mm PLP, and l-cysteine (0.75–3.5 mm) in 1.5-ml cryovial tubes. After incubation at 37 °C, 1% (w/v) zinc acetate was added to trap the evolved H2S gas, and the enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. 20 mm N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride dye and 30 mm FeCl3 were then added, and the absorbance at 670 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Tecan Systems Inc.). Controls were prepared by adding 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid before the addition of cysteine to stop all enzymatic reactions. The amount of H2S produced was determined every 3 min over 30 min and calculated against a calibration curve of sodium hydrosulfide. The initial reaction velocity, V0 (units/mg hCSE, where 1 unit = 1 μmol of H2S produced/min) was then plotted against the cysteine substrate concentration, [S], and fitted against the Hill equation, V0=Vmax[S]hK0.5+[S]h(Eq. 1) The Hill coefficient, h, was determined from the gradient of the logarithmic plot of the Hill equation, log (V0Vmax−V0)=hlog [S]+constant(Eq. 2) All curve fitting and regression analysis were performed using the graphics software SigmaPlot (Systat). IC50 Analysis on PAG—Inhibition of hCSE-dependent H2S production was determined by performing the assay with varying concentrations of PAG. Each measurement was assayed in triplicates. Purified hCSE was first preincubated with 2 mm PLP and varying amounts of the inhibitor (PAG 0–4 mm) on ice for 30 min. This was followed by the addition of 5 mm l-cysteine and incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The IC50 value was then estimated from a plot of percentage inhibition against PAG concentration. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—hCSE protein was concentrated to 41 μm in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8. PAG was prepared at 600 μm using the same buffer. PAG is loaded into the syringe and titrated against hCSE·PLP in a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (ITC 200; Microcal) performed under identical conditions. The dissociation constants were determined by least squares method, and the binding isotherm was fitted using Origin version 7.0 (Microcal), assuming a one-site binding model. Heat-released Q(i), from the ith injection is as follows. ΔQ(i)=Q(i)+dVVo(Q(i)+Q(i−1)2)−Q(i−1)(Eq. 3) All measurements were repeated at least twice for verification. Overall Structures—The structures of apo-hCSE, hCSE·PLP, and hCSE·PLP·PAG complexes were solved and refined to 2.4, 2.6, and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively (Table 1). The resolution of the hCSE·PLP·PAG complex significantly increased, most likely due to the improved quality and size of the crystal. hCSE exists entirely as a tetramer in the PLP-bound states (hCSE·PLP and hCSE·PLP·PAG complexes) and predominantly as tetramers in the apo state in solution as determined by gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments (supplemental Fig. 1). We also report the observation of a tetramer in the asymmetric unit of the hCSE·PLP complex and hCSE·PLP·PAG complex structures. In the case of apo-hCSE, two dimers in the asymmetric unit form tetramers with symmetry-related dimers. Close contact between monomers of the tetramer are maintained by several hydrogen bonds and extensive hydrophobic interactions. Structures of the individual monomers of apo-hCSE, hCSE·PLP, and hCSE·PLP·PAG are very similar (root mean square deviation for apo-hCSE versus hCSE·PLP is 1.5 Å for 336 Cα atoms; apo-hCSE versus hCSE·PAG·PLP is 1.6 Å for 336 Cα atoms; hCSE·PLP versus hCSE·PLP·PAG is 0.3 Å for 390 Cα atoms) except for two loops near the active site region and a disordered loop at the monomer interface of the dimer in the apo-hCSE. Each hCSE monomer consists of two domains: 1) a larger PLP-binding domain (residues Ala9–His263) and 2) a smaller domain (residues Val264–Ser401) (Fig. 1a). The PLP binding domain consists of an α/β/α fold, a seven-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked on three sides by a total of eight α-helices. This central β-sheet consists of seven, mostly parallel, β-strands (β1↑β7↓β6↑β5↑β4↑β2↑β3↑) with only strand β7 being antiparallel to the rest. The small domain consists of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β8↓β9↑β11↓β10↑) and three helices on one side of the β-sheet. Sequence and Structural Similarity—CSE from various organisms forms a conserved group of PLP-dependent enzymes belonging to the family of cystathionine synthase-like proteins. In mammals, highest sequence similarities (80% sequence similarities among the 26 mammalian sequences compared) were obtained from CSE, hypothetical CSE, or CSE homologs. A search for structurally similar proteins was carried out with DALI (16Holm L. Park J. Bioinformatics (Oxford).. 2000; 16: 566-567Google Scholar) and BioXGEM (17Yang J.M. Tung C.H. Nucleic Acids Res... 2006; 34: 3646-3659Google Scholar, 18Tung C.H. Huang J.W. Yang J.M. Genome Biol... 2007; 8: R31Google Scholar). Most of the structural similarity was found around the active site region of CSE and the corresponding region in several PLP-dependent enzymes (supplemental Fig. 2). Active Site—The PLP binding site of hCSE is formed mainly by residues from the central seven-stranded β-sheet as well as α-helices that pack against one face of this sheet (Fig. 1a). PLP is anchored by strong hydrogen bonding between the phosphate moiety and residues contributed by neighboring subunits A (Gly90, Leu91, Ser209, and Thr211) and B (Tyr60 and Arg62) (supplemental Fig. 3). In addition, there are two other hydrogen bonding interactions (by Asp187 and Lys212) with PLP. Lys212 binds PLP, and Tyr114 exhibits aromatic π-stacking interactions to the pyridine ring of PLP (red color in Fig. 1, b and c). Such interactions have also been reported in a number of other PLP enzyme complexes. Fig. 1d shows the omit maps of PLP from the hCSE·PLP structure. Several CSE mutations are associated with cystathioninuria, two of which (T67I and Q240E) have recently been characterized (6Zhu W. Lin A. Banerjee R. Biochemistry.. 2008; 47: 6226-6232Google Scholar). Both mutants have been reported to have greatly reduced enzymatic activities relative to the wild-type enzyme. This reduction in activity has been attributed to lower affinity of PLP with the mutant enzymes. However, in our structure, the importance of these residues in PLP binding is not readily apparent, since they are not directly in contact with PLP. Open and Closed Conformations of the Active Site—When the structures of apo-hCSE and the hCSE·PLP/hCSE·PLP·PAG complex are superimposed, we observed that the active site is significantly open in the apoenzyme (Fig. 1, e and f). Detailed comparisons of structures of apo-hCSE with hCSE·PLP, hCSE·PLP·PAG, and other PLP-dependent enzymes reveal the magnitude of conformational changes between PLP-bound and apo forms of the enzyme. Distances between the equivalent atoms after superimposition of the molecules show that significant differences occur within the two loop regions Met110–Asn118 and Thr210–Met216. Both loops form walls on either side of the PLP binding cleft. When PLP is bound, these two loops fold back on the cofactor, thereby establishing effective interactions. This motion shifts the main chain of the central part of both loops at Tyr114 and Lys212 by as much as 8.6 and 7.0 Å, respectively. The largest displacements are those of the side chains of Tyr114 and Lys212, the tips of which move over 19.3 and 10.6 Å, respectively, with a simultaneous large movement of nearby side chains (supplemental movie 1). In the hCSE·PLP complex, there is a two-turn helix (residues Gly115–Tyr120) near Tyr114 that unwinds and becomes a loop in the apo-hCSE (Fig. 1b). The distance between the two loops in the open form is 22.7 Å, whereas the same distance in the closed form is 12.7 Å. In the hCSE·PLP complex, Lys212 is covalently bonded to the PLP cofactor through the formation of a Schiff base between the carbonyl group of PLP and the amino group of the Lys212 side chain (Fig. 1c). However, in the apo structure, Lys212 was found to have moved away from the PLP binding site. In the superimposed model of the structures, the distance between PLP of the hCSE·PLP complex and Lys212 of the apo structure is too large (11 Å apart) for nucleophilic attack and subsequent formation of the Schiff base. Previously, crystal structures of another PLP-dependent enzyme, namely threonine synthase from A. thaliana, were reported in the PLP-bound and PLP-free states, but no main chain conformational changes were observed in the active site region (19Thomazeau K. Curien G. Dumas R. Biou V. Protein Sci... 2001; 10: 638-648Google Scholar, 20Mas-Droux C. Biou V. Dumas R. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 5188-5196Google Scholar). Similarly, in the hCSE·PLP complex, one of the four monomers of the asymmetric unit is found in the closed conformation without PLP. This indicates that the PLP-free enzyme is highly dynamic and exists as an ensemble of multiple conformational states. In the hCSE·PLP structure, the N-terminal domain extends to the adjacent monomer and forms part of the neighboring PLP binding site. Residues Tyr60 and Arg62 electrostatically interact with the phosphate group of PLP (supplemental Fig. 3). However, in the apo-hCSE structure, the electron density map corresponding to this region (Asp28–Ser63) is disordered and indicates the flexibility of this segment due to the absence of PLP. Another missing region in apo-hCSE is from Thr355 to Val366; in the hCSE·PLP complex, this region does not directly interact with PLP, but it could stabilize one side of the PLP binding pocket. In the apo-hCSE, the Met110–Asn118 loop region occupies the Thr355–Val366 region of the hCSE·PLP complex. This is one possible reason why Thr355–Val366 of apo-hCSE is shifted further away from the PLP binding site and hence is disordered. l-cysteine needs to bind with PLP to eliminate the β-sulfhydryl group to produce H2S; therefore, without PLP, hCSE is unable to produce H2S. Oligomeric States of hCSE—In order to analyze the oligomeric states of apo- and PLP-bound hCSE, we performed size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. To best mimic the apo and PLP complex, two buffer conditions were chosen. In buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8), which favors the PLP-bound state, hCSE eluted predominantly as a tetramer. In contrast, hCSE exists as a mixture of tetramer and monomeric states in buffer B (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.0, and 10 mm l-cysteine), which favored the apo state of hCSE. This suggests that pH 4.0 and the presence of l-cysteine weakens interactions between ind"
https://openalex.org/W2032652036,"Calpains are cysteine proteases involved in remodelling protein structures needed for cell movement and division, in response to the release of calcium ions. They regulate cell migration, cell death, insulin secretion, synaptic function and muscle homeostasis. Their endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin, consists of four inhibitory repeats, each of which neutralizes an activated calpain with exquisite specificity and potency. Two papers in this issue present a complete picture of how calpastatin shuts down calpain activity. Moldoveanu et al. determined the crystal structure of calcium-bound m-calpain in complex with the first calpastatin repeat, CID-1. Hanna et al. present the structure of the Ca2+-bound calpain 2 heterodimer bound to one of the other inhibitory domains of calpastatin, CID-IV. This study shows how the inhibitor binds and inhibits calpain only in the presence of calcium. More importantly, since calpastatin is itself a protein, we show the novel way in which calpastatin avoids being cut and destroyed by calpain. The 3.0 Å structure of Ca2+-bound m-calpain in complex with the first calpastatin repeat is solved, revealing the mechanism of the exclusive specificity. The structure highlights the complexity of calpain activation by Ca2+, illustrating key residues in a peripheral domain that serve to stabilize the protease core after Ca2+-binding. The Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases, calpains, regulate cell migration1, cell death2, insulin secretion3, synaptic function4 and muscle homeostasis5. Their endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin, consists of four inhibitory repeats, each of which neutralizes an activated calpain with exquisite specificity and potency6. Despite the physiological importance of this interaction, the structural basis of calpain inhibition by calpastatin is unknown7. Here we report the 3.0 Å structure of Ca2+-bound m-calpain in complex with the first calpastatin repeat, both from rat, revealing the mechanism of exclusive specificity. The structure highlights the complexity of calpain activation by Ca2+, illustrating key residues in a peripheral domain that serve to stabilize the protease core on Ca2+ binding. Fully activated calpain binds ten Ca2+ atoms, resulting in several conformational changes allowing recognition by calpastatin. Calpain inhibition is mediated by the intimate contact with three critical regions of calpastatin. Two regions target the penta-EF-hand domains of calpain and the third occupies the substrate-binding cleft, projecting a loop around the active site thiol to evade proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2088669151,"Cold temperatures robustly activate a small cohort of somatosensory nerves, yet during a prolonged cold stimulus their activity will decrease, or adapt, over time. This process allows for the discrimination of subtle changes in temperature. At the molecular level, cold is detected by transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8), a nonselective cation channel expressed on a subset of peripheral afferent fibers. We and others have reported that TRPM8 channels also adapt in a calcium-dependent manner when activated by the cooling compound menthol. Additionally, TRPM8 activity is sensitive to the phospholipid phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a substrate for the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC). These results suggest an adaptation model whereby TRPM8-mediated Ca2+ influx activates PLC, thereby decreasing PIP2 levels and resulting in reduced TRPM8 activity. Here we tested this model using pharmacological activation of PLC and by manipulating PIP2 levels independent of both PLC and Ca2+. PLC activation leads to adaptation-like reductions in cold- or menthol-evoked TRPM8 currents in both heterologous and native cells. Moreover, PLC-independent reductions in PIP2 had a similar effect on cold- and menthol-evoked currents. Mechanistically, either form of adaptation does not alter temperature sensitivity of TRPM8 but does lead to a change in channel gating. Our results show that adaptation is a shift in voltage dependence toward more positive potentials, reversing the trend toward negative potentials caused by agonist. These data suggest that PLC activity not only mediates adaptation to thermal stimuli, but likely underlies a more general mechanism that establishes the temperature sensitivity of somatosensory neurons. Cold temperatures robustly activate a small cohort of somatosensory nerves, yet during a prolonged cold stimulus their activity will decrease, or adapt, over time.

The detection of temperature is a fundamental task of the nervous system.

Subpopulations of these afferents respond to distinct sub-modalities of thermal stimuli, including noxious heat, innocuous cooling and warmth, and painfully cold temperatures. Each carries thermal information to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, synapsing with neurons that project centrally (1Julius D. Basbaum A.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar, 3Han Z.S. Zhang E.T. Craig A.D. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The discovery of thermosensitive ion channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family demonstrated an underlying molecular mechanism for temperature detection (4Jordt S.E. McKemy D.D. Julius D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Cold temperature sensation is largely mediated by TRPM8, a nonselective cation channel expressed on a small subset of neurons (5Daniels R.L. McKemy D.D. Mol. Pain. 2007; 3: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Takashima Y. Daniels R.L. Knowlton W. Teng J. Liman E.R. McKemy D.D. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14147-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). TRPM8 is activated by cooling compounds, such as menthol, as well as cold temperatures below ∼28 °C, in vitro (7McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar, 8Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I. McIntyre P. Bevan S.

Recent reports on the behavioral phenotype of TRPM8-null mice suggest that this lone channel is required for the majority of cold sensing in vivo (5Daniels R.L. McKemy D.D. Mol.

These and other data strongly implicate TRPM8 in not only the detection of both innocuous cool and some aspects of noxious cold but also injury-induced hypersensitivity to cold and, paradoxically, cooling-mediated analgesia (11Dhaka A.

Thus, understanding regulatory mechanisms that alter TRPM8 activity will provide keen insights into temperature sensation, nociception, and analgesia. One fundamental property of cold-sensitive neurons is an intrinsic ability to adapt to prolonged cold stimuli, a mechanism that is likely critical for discrimination of changing environmental conditions (13Campero M. Serra J. Bostock H. Ochoa J.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 535: 855-865Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Darian-Smith I. Johnson K.O. Dykes R. J. Neurophysiol. 1973; 36: 325-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that cold-sensitive neurons adapt to cold and menthol over time in vitro (6Takashima Y. Daniels R.L. Knowlton W. Teng J. Liman E.R. McKemy D.D. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14147-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 15Reid G. Flonta M.L. Nature. 2001; 413: 480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), a phenomenon also observed with recombinant TRPM8 channels activated by menthol (7McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar). During sustained exposure to menthol, TRPM8 currents adapt in a manner that is dependent upon the presence of external calcium (7McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cold- and menthol-evoked currents are highly sensitive to cellular manipulation. In heterologous cells, TRPM8 currents quickly decrease or run down upon membrane patch excision (16Liu B. Qin F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1674-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Moreover, in membrane patches excised from cold- and menthol-sensitive DRG neurons, cold thresholds for current activation exhibit a shift of ∼10 °C to colder temperatures in comparison with thresholds recorded in intact cells (18Reid G. Babes A. Pluteanu F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 545: 595-614Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is a membrane phospholipid that accounts for ∼1% of all lipids in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and is known to regulate a variety of ion channels, including TRPM8 (16Liu B. Qin F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1674-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). When applied to the cytoplasmic face of excised membrane patches containing TRPM8 channels, PIP2 can recover menthol-evoked currents to near pre-rundown levels (16Liu B. Qin F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1674-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). PIP2 is proposed to interact with channels either through electrostatic interactions or by binding to target proteins at specific phosphoinositide-binding sites (19Rohacs T. Pfluegers Arch. 2007; 453: 753-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Rohacs T. Nilius B. Pfluegers Arch. 2007; 455: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Membrane PIP2 levels are a product of enzymatic activity, such as phosphoinositide kinases that synthesize PIP2 from membrane precursors and phospholipase C (PLC) that hydrolyzes it, creating membrane-bound diacylglycerol (DAG) and cytosolic inositol trisphosphate (IP3), both of which function as second messengers. Of the three different PLC isotypes, PLCδ isoforms are modulated by increases in intracellular calcium (21Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). When taken in context with the sensitivity of TRPM8 currents to PIP2 levels, a model has been proposed whereby adaption is a result of channel-mediated Ca2+ influx activating one or more PLCδ isoforms (16Liu B. Qin F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1674-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The subsequent reductions in PIP2 levels then promote reduced or adapted TRPM8 currents. However, this hypothesis has not been conclusively shown in intact heterologous cells or in somatosensory neurons expressing TRPM8. Moreover, other alternative hypotheses for TRPM8 adaptation have been proposed, including Ca2+-dependent kinase activity mediated by protein kinase C (22Abe J. Hosokawa H. Sawada Y. Matsumura K. Kobayashi S. Neurosci. Lett. 2006; 397: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23Premkumar L.S. Raisinghani M. Pingle S.C. Long C. Pimentel F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11322-11329Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, the cellular and molecular mechanisms for Ca2+-mediated TRPM8 adaptation are unclear. Here we show, in both heterologous cells and native TRPM8-expressing neurons, that Ca2+-independent activation of PLC results in adapted TRPM8 currents. Moreover, PLC- and Ca2+-independent PIP2 depletion in heterologous cells produces similar effects on TRPM8 activity, again reducing both cold- and menthol-evoked currents. Mechanistically, we find that all such manipulations do not alter the temperature sensitivity of the channel but do lead to a shift in the voltage dependence of TRPM8 channel gating. Oocyte Electrophysiology—Complementary RNA transcripts were injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes as described (7McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar). Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed 2–7 days after injection. Temperature ramps were generated by heating (35 °C) or cooling (4 °C) the perfusate in a Harvard coil and monitoring temperature changes with a thermistor placed near the oocyte. Heterologous Expression—EGFP-Lyn-PH-PP was a kind gift from Tobias Meyer (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA) and Mark S. Shapiro (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio). PLCδ1-PH-RFP, PLCδ1-PH-YFP, and the components for inducible phosphatase translocation (FKBP-Inp54p and Lyn11-FRB) were kind gifts from Bertil Hille and Ken Mackie (University of Washington, Seattle) and Emily Liman (University of Southern California, Los Angeles). cDNA of TRPM8 clones and other molecules was transfected into the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK293T) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), as described (7McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar) and following the manufacturer's instructions. Mammalian Cell Electrophysiology—Voltage clamp recordings in neuronal and non-neuronal cells were performed as described (6Takashima Y. Daniels R.L. Knowlton W. Teng J. Liman E.R. McKemy D.D. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14147-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 7McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar, 24Liu D. Liman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15160-15165Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Standard bath solution for whole-cell recordings contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, and pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH). Pipette solution for whole-cell recordings contained (in mm) 140 CsCl, 0.5–5 EGTA, 2 MgATP, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (adjusted with CsOH). Nominally Ca2+-free bath solutions contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. In some experiments 0.5 mm EGTA was added to this buffer. Recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and Digidata 1320 data acquisition board (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnydale, CA) with pCLAMP 9.2 software (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Solutions were exchanged by gravity fed tubes connected to an 8-channel perfusion valve solution controller (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and fed into a recording chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). The temperature of the perfusate was controlled by a Perfusion Temperature Controller RDTC-1 (Bioscience Tools, San Diego, CA). Bath temperature was recorded by a small thermocouple located in the recording chamber. Rapid solution exchange was performed as described (24Liu D. Liman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15160-15165Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Briefly, in magnesium and calcium block experiments, rapid bath solution exchange was achieved by placing the cell in front of a linear array of microperfusion pipes under computer control (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). All drugs used in our experiments were stored and handled following the manufacturer's instructions. Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice expressing EGFP under control of the TRPM8 promoter were described previously (6Takashima Y. Daniels R.L. Knowlton W. Teng J. Liman E.R. McKemy D.D. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14147-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). All animals were handled and cared for in accordance with guidelines established by the University of Southern California Animal Care and Use Committee. Neuronal Cell Culture and Ca2+ Microfluorimetry—Trigeminal ganglia were dissected from newborn transgenic mice and dissociated with 0.25% collagenase P (Roche Applied Science) in a solution of 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate, Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA), and 50% F-12 (Ham's F-12 Nutrient Mixture with l-glutamine, Invitrogen) for 30 min. The ganglia were then pelleted and resuspended in 0.05% trypsin at 37 °C for 2 min, and triturated gently with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette in culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin). Cells were then resuspended in culture medium with nerve growth factor 7S (Invitrogen) (100 ng/ml) and plated onto coverslips coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) (20 μl/ml). Cultures were examined 16–20 h after plating. Intracellular Ca2+ was determined with the cell-permeable form of Fura-2 (Invitrogen) as described (7McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar), and pseudo-colored ratiometric images were captured on an Olympus IX70 fluorescent microscope with Sutter Lambda LS light source, Roper CoolSnap ES camera, and the MetaImaging software suite. Confocal images were collected on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope and analyzed with MetaMorph software. Acquired fluorescent images are shown in negative contrast such that fluorescence is represented as dark. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting and RT-PCR—Freshly dispersed TG neurons (prepared as described above) were sorted by GFP fluorescence with a MoFlo Cytomation Cell Sorter, and total RNA was purified using the Qiagen RNeasy kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of PLCδ isozymes was determined by RT-PCR with the Qiagen One-step RT-PCR kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Primers for each isozyme were as follows: PLCδ1 forward, 5′-GGCAGGCATTCTATGAGATG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGGGTCCACGATAGAATTCT-3′; PLCδ3 forward, 5′-TCAGGTTTGTGGTAGAAGAT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTCCTCTTCGGTCTTTTCAG-3′; PLCδ4 forward, 5′-CCATCATGTGCCCAGACCTA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCCATCCCACATAACCGGTT-5′; and TRPM8 forward, GCTCTCCACCAATATCCTTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAGTAGGTGGGACACGAGTC-3′. Data Analysis—Data analysis was performed using Origin 6.1 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Steady-state activation curves were determined using methods described previously (25Voets T. Droogmans G. Wissenbach U. Janssens A. Flockerzi V. Nilius B. Nature. 2004; 430: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 26Voets T. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Talavera K. Nilius B. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Briefly, to estimate maximal TRPM8 activity at a given voltage, we used a saturating dose of 1 mm menthol at room temperature to activate TRPM8 and measured currents at the end of each voltage step. We then calculated the conductance, g, at each data point, using the relation g = Iss/V, where Iss is the steady-state current at the end of a voltage step, and V is the voltage difference across the cell membrane. Because the conductance appears to saturate and reach a maximum, we calculated g/gmax for each value, thus normalizing data so that comparisons could be made between cells. We assume for our calculations a two-state model of channel gating. Therefore, as in Refs. 25Voets T. Droogmans G. Wissenbach U. Janssens A. Flockerzi V. Nilius B. Nature. 2004; 430: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 26Voets T. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Talavera K. Nilius B. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, we fit the g/gmax values with steady-state activation curves using a Boltzmann function of the form shown in Equation 1, g/gmax=11+exp(−ZappkBT(V−V1/2))(Eq. 1) where zapp is the experimentally determined gating charge; kB is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10-23 J K-1), and T is the absolute temperature. The half-maximal conductance (V½) is estimated from these steady-state activation curves for each cell. Data are represented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assayed using a Student's t test. Ca2+ Dependence of Cold-evoked TRPM8 Currents—Cold-evoked membrane currents, recorded in menthol-sensitive DRG neurons in primary culture, are reported to adapt in a Ca2+-dependent manner (15Reid G. Flonta M.L. Nature. 2001; 413: 480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Moreover, in heterologous cells, we have shown that menthol-evoked TRPM8 currents adapt to prolonged menthol exposure only in the presence of external physiological Ca2+ (7McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar). We set out to determine whether TRPM8 currents adapt to a cold stimulus like that observed in native cells. Using two-electrode voltage clamp recordings in rat TRPM8-expressing Xenopus oocytes, bathed in nominally free Ca2+ solutions, a cold ramp from ∼32 to 15 °C evoked a rapid and reproducible inward current that was sustained for the length of the stimulus (Fig. 1A). In the presence of 2 mm external Ca2+, cold-evoked (15 °C) currents were activated likewise, but then adapted to approximately half the peak values after 5 min (46.0 ± 4.1%, n = 4; Fig. 1, B and C). The degree of adaption was temperature-dependent as less adaption was observed if the perfusate was reduced to colder temperatures (6 °C, 74.3 ± 4.0%, n = 3; Fig. 1C). We also found that calcium exerts its effects on TRPM8 activity intracellularly. Even in the presence of 2 mm external Ca2+, no adaption to cold was observed once intracellular Ca2+ was buffered by injection of the rapid Ca2+ chelator BAPTA into the oocyte (27Jordt S.E. Bautista D.M. Chuang H.H. McKemy D.D. Zygmunt P.M. Hogestatt E.D. Meng I.D. Julius D. Nature. 2004; 427: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar) (n = 4; Fig. 1D). Finally, recovery from adaptation was found to be temperature-dependent as the magnitude of TRPM8 currents remained at the adapted levels as long as bath temperatures were held in the sub-physiological range (∼22 °C). However, current amplitudes returned to pre-adapted levels once temperatures were raised above 30 °C (Fig. 1E). Thus, as in menthol-sensitive DRG neurons, cold-evoked TRPM8 currents adapt in a Ca2+-dependent manner, yet remain adapted until temperatures are returned to physiological levels. These results suggest that TRPM8 adaptation is a Ca2+- and temperature-dependent process. Ca2+ and Other Divalent Cations Are TRPM8 Channel Blockers—We set out to determine the Ca2+-dependent mechanisms that promote TRPM8 adaptation. However, it has been reported that TRPM8 currents are partially blocked by calcium and barium ions (28Hui K. Guo Y. Feng Z.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, it is critical to distinguish between physical blockade of the channel and decreased channel activity by other regulatory mechanisms, such as adaptation. To this end, we used whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of HEK293T cells expressing rat TRPM8 (7McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar) in which the pipette solution contained 5 mm EGTA to buffer cytoplasmic Ca2+ and thus prevent adaptation. Under these conditions, we observed that external calcium reduced menthol-evoked currents in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). To distinguish between block and adaptation, we employed a rapid perfusion system in which the external Ca2+ concentration was changed in less than 2 s (24Liu D. Liman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15160-15165Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Quickly switching the perfusate from nominally Ca2+ free to 2 mm Ca2+ resulted in reduced menthol-evoked whole-cell currents, measured during voltage ramps from -80 to +80 mV (by 41.3 ± 8.7% at +80 mV and 75.5 ± 4.9% at -80 mV, n = 5), that recovered upon Ca2+ washout (Fig. 2, B–D). External magnesium also reversibly blocked menthol currents (not shown). Thus, with the rapid time course in the reduction of TRPM8 currents, and as intracellular Ca2+ was strongly buffered, it is unlikely that this effect was because of adaptation but is a result of block by Ca2+. Therefore, in all subsequent experiments calcium concentration was held constant such that Ca2+ block was not misinterpreted as adaptation. Chemical Activation of PLC Reduces Menthol-evoked TRPM8 Currents—Several groups have reported that PIP2 levels effect TRPM8 activity in membrane patches excised from heterologous cells (16Liu B. Qin F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1674-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 29Brauchi S. Orta G. Mascayano C. Salazar M. Raddatz N. Urbina H. Rosenmann E. Gonzalez-Nilo F. Latorre R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10246-10251Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These data, along with our previous results on the Ca2+ and temperature dependence of adaptation, suggest that PLC activation and subsequent PIP2 hydrolysis induces adaptation, presumably through a rise in intracellular calcium via TRPM8. For adaptation to be mediated in this manner, menthol-evoked increases in intracellular Ca2+ must give rise to increased PLC activity. We tested if this was indeed the case in rTRPM8 transfected HEK293T cells using an optical probe that monitors depletion of PIP2 (30Horowitz L.F. Hirdes W. Suh B.C. Hilgemann D.W. Mackie K. Hille B.

Mackie), a fusion protein of red fluorescent protein (RFP) or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), and the PIP2- and IP3-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLCδ1, and we co-transfected it with TRPM8 in HEK293T cells. Under basal conditions, the majority of PH-PLCδ1 is bound to PIP2 and localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 1). We first confirmed that Ca2+ influx itself can promote translocation of the reporter from the membrane to the cytosol by applying 10 μm ionomycin to PH-PLCδ1-expressing HEK293T in the presence of 2 mm external Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. 1A). Next, we tested if Ca2+ influx via TRPM8 can likewise evoke translocation by applying 200 μm menthol in 2 mm external Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, we observed increased cytosolic fluorescence, with a concomitant decrease in membrane fluorescence, indicating cleavage of PIP2 (decrease at the membrane) and generation of IP3 (increase in the cytosol). These data are consistent with a FRET-based approach that showed that menthol application can induce PH domain translocation in TRPM8-expressing COS-1 cells (17Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and show that Ca2+ entry through TRPM8 is sufficient to increase PLC activity in HEK293T cells as well. When menthol was applied in nominally Ca2+-free conditions, little change occurred in the localization of PH-PLCδ1 fluorescence (not shown). Next, we sought to test the hypothesis that PLC regulates TRPM8 activity using the benzenesulfonamide compound m-3M3FBS, which activates all isoforms of PLC, including those of the calcium-sensitive PLCδ family (30Horowitz L.F.

Thus, if adaptation is a result of Ca2+-mediated activation of PLC, then PLC activation in the absence of a rise in intracellular Ca2+ should lead to reduced TRPM8 activity. We first tested the effectiveness of m-3M3FBS to activate PLC using the PH-PLCδ1 optical reporter. It has been previously reported t"

The historical and archaeological records reveal that humans became especially good at killing 'outsiders' from other groups, tribes or nations. Some animals do engage in such conflicts, but humans excel. We are also uniquely receptive to socialization and learning, and can achieve the heights of altruistic behaviour. Economist Samuel Bowles argues that these two extremes may be related: generosity and solidarity towards one's own may have emerged only in combination with hostility towards outsiders. Both may be part of what it is to be human. All essays in the 'Being human' series are available free via http://tinyurl.com/55ncjj ."
https://openalex.org/W2001017511,"Hydramacin-1 is a novel antimicrobial protein recently discovered during investigations of the epithelial defense of the ancient metazoan Hydra. The amino acid sequence of hydramacin-1 shows no sequence homology to any known antimicrobial proteins. Determination of the solution structure revealed that hydramacin-1 possesses a disulfide bridge-stabilized alphabeta motif. This motif is the common scaffold of the knottin protein fold. The structurally closest relatives are the scorpion oxin-like superfamily. Within this superfamily hydramacin-1 establishes a new family of proteins that all share antimicrobial activity. Hydramacin-1 is potently active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including multi-resistant human pathogenic strains. It leads to aggregation of bacteria as an initial step of its bactericidal mechanism. Aggregated cells are connected via electron-dense contacts and adopt a thorn apple-like morphology. Analysis of the hydramacin-1 structure revealed an unusual distribution of amino acid side chains on the surface. A belt of positively charged residues is sandwiched by two hydrophobic areas. Based on this characteristic surface feature and on biophysical analysis of protein-membrane interactions, we propose a model that describes the aggregation effect exhibited by hydramacin-1."

We therefore evaluated these parameters in the C57BL/6J, 129SV/EV and C3H/HeJ mice.We measured by dry chemistry 26 analytes relative to electrolyte balance, lipoprotein metabolism, and muscle/heart, liver, kidney and pancreas functions, and by automated blood counter 5 hematological parameters in 30 animals (15 male and 15 female) of each mouse strain at three age ranges: 1-2 months, 3-8 months and 9-12 months. Whole blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus. We used quality control procedures to investigate analytical imprecision and inaccuracy. Reference values were calculated by non parametric methods (median and 2.5(th) and 97.5(th) percentiles). The Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for between-group comparisons. Median levels of GLU, LDH, Chol and BUN were higher, and LPS, AST, ALP and CHE were lower in males than in females (p range: 0.05-0.001). Inter-strain differences were observed for: (1) GLU, t-Bil, K+, Ca++, PO(4)- (p<0.05) and for TAG, Chol, AST, Fe++ (p<0.001) in 4-8 month-old animals; (2) for CK, Crea, Mg++, Na++, K+, Cl- (p<0.05) and BUN (p<0.001) in 2- and in 10-12 month-old mice; and (3) for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT and PLT (p<0.05) during the 1 year life span.Our results indicate that metabolic variations in C57BL/6J, 129SV/EV and C3H/HeJ mice after therapeutic intervention should be evaluated against gender- and age-dependent reference intervals."
https://openalex.org/W2025397309,"Superconductivity without phonons has been proposed for strongly correlated electron materials that are tuned close to a zero-temperature magnetic instability of itinerant charge carriers. Near this boundary, quantum fluctuations of magnetic degrees of freedom assume the role of phonons in conventional superconductors, creating an attractive interaction that 'glues' electrons into superconducting pairs. Here we show that superconductivity can arise from a very different spectrum of fluctuations associated with a local (or Kondo-breakdown) quantum critical point that is revealed in isotropic scattering of charge carriers and a sublinear, temperature-dependent electrical resistivity. At this critical point, accessed by applying pressure to the strongly correlated, local-moment antiferromagnet CeRhIn(5), magnetic and charge fluctuations coexist and produce electronic scattering that is maximal at the optimal pressure for superconductivity. This previously unanticipated source of pairing glue opens possibilities for understanding and discovering new unconventional forms of superconductivity."
https://openalex.org/W2025570171,"Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) is involved in angiogenesis and lipid metabolism. It is secreted by liver and adipose tissues and cleaved to generate circulating coiled-coil domain (CCD) and fibrinogen-like domain (FLD) fragments. The full-length ANGPTL4 produced by hypoxic endothelial cells interacts with the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM-bound and soluble forms of ANGPTL4 have antiangiogenic properties. We carried out a structure-function analysis to investigate the regulation of ANGPTL4 bioactivity in endothelial cells. We found that the recombinant CCD binds to the ECM, whereas the FLD is released into the medium. The CCD, like the full-length ANGPTL4, binds to heparan and dermatan sulfates in surface plasmon resonance assays and inhibits endothelial cell adhesion, motility, and tubule-like formation. In endothelial cells, ANGPTL4 is processed in the secretion medium after release from the ECM. This processing is altered by the proprotein convertases inhibitor alpha1-PDX and abolished by the mutation of the (161)RRKR(164) cleavage site without modification of the ECM binding and release. These data suggest that the full-length form, which interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans via its CCD, is protected from proteolysis by proprotein convertases and constitutes the major active pool of ANGPTL4 in hypoxic endothelial cells."

We first generated a conformational monoclonal antibody (monoclonal antibody 45 (Mab45)) whose binding to NiV-G was enhanced upon NiV-G-ephrinB2 binding. However, Mab45 also inhibited viral entry, and its receptor binding-enhanced (RBE) epitope was temperature-dependent, suggesting that the Mab45 RBE epitope on G may be involved in triggering F. The Mab45 RBE epitope was mapped to the base of the globular domain (β6S4/β1H1). Alanine scan mutants within this region that did not exhibit this RBE epitope were also non-fusogenic despite their ability to bind ephrinB2, oligomerize, and associate with F at wild-type (WT) levels. Although circular dichroism revealed conformational changes in the soluble ectodomain of WT NiV-G upon ephrinB2 addition, no such changes were detected with soluble RBE epitope mutants or short-stalk G mutants. Additionally, WT G, but not a RBE epitope mutant, could dissociate from F upon ephrinB2 engagement. Finally, using a biotinylated HR2 peptide to detect pre-hairpin intermediate formation, a cardinal feature of F-triggering, we showed that ephrinB2 binding to WT G, but not the RBE-epitope mutants, could trigger F.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4024-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), the region(s) in G important for receptor-activated triggering of F-mediated fusion remains unknown. Current models of Paramyxovirus membrane fusion posit that receptor binding to the attachment glycoprotein (G, H, or HN) triggers a conformational cascade in the fusion protein (F). Such F-triggering results in fusion peptide (FP) exposure, which involves formation of a pre-hairpin intermediate and subsequent six-helix bundle formation (11Lamb R.A. Jardetzky T.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The energy released upon refolding into the stable six-helix bundle ground state is what drives the fusion of the viral and host-cell membranes. These are common functional and structural features responsible for membrane fusion for all enveloped viruses regardless of whether the fusion protein has predominantly trimeric α-helical coiled-coil (Class I), β (Class II), or a combination of α and β (Class III) core structures (12White J.M. Delos S.E. Brecher M. Schornberg K. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 189-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Important human pathogens such as the HIV, influenza, and various paramyxoviruses have Class I fusion proteins, and their similar structural features point to similar membrane fusion mechanisms (11Lamb R.A. Jardetzky T.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 12White J.M. Delos S.E. Brecher M. Schornberg K. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 189-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Besides sharing trimeric coiled-coil structures, they are synthesized as precursors that are cleaved into a metastable conformation; cleavage generates a new hydrophobic N terminus FP that gets released and inserted into the target cell membrane upon triggering (11Lamb R.A. Jardetzky T.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 12White J.M. Delos S.E. Brecher M. Schornberg K. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 189-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Class I fusion proteins have two heptad repeat regions, HR1 and HR2, at their N and C termini, respectively, that fold up onto each other during six-helix bundle formation to bring about merging of target cell and viral membranes (12White J.M. Delos S.E. Brecher M. Schornberg K. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 189-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). For Paramyxovirus F proteins, the C-terminal HR2 region is generally thought to be pre-formed, but the N-terminal HR1 region is formed only upon F-triggering and FP insertion (11Lamb R.A. Jardetzky T.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Yin H.S. Wen X. Paterson R.G. Lamb R.A. Jardetzky T.S. Nature. 2006; 439: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The formation of this trimeric HR1 core just before six-helix bundle formation, is known as the pre-hairpin intermediate. Despite their common features, viral fusion proteins vary in their detailed structures, triggering factors, and number of viral surface proteins involved. For paramyxoviruses, receptor binding and fusion functions are carried out by two distinct transmembrane proteins (attachment (G, H, or HN) and fusion (F) proteins, respectively), and with few exceptions both are required for membrane fusion. The underlying mechanism of fusion triggering by the attachment protein may vary depending on their use of protein versus carbohydrate receptors (14Iorio R.M. Mahon P.J. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 135-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

For the paramyxoviruses, the early steps in the fusion cascade, particularly how H/HN “triggers” F, are not well understood, and the region(s) in H/HN responsible for F triggering remains unclear, although the stalk domain of H/HN appears to be important for F triggering or for interaction with F (5Corey E.A.

Here we analyze the early steps in the fusion cascade for NiV and identify a specific region in NiV-G distinct from the receptor binding site that is involved in 1) B2-induced changes that trigger FP exposure in F, 2) modulating the avidity of F/G interactions resulting in displacement of F from G, and 3) transducing receptor-induced membrane fusion.

Circular Dichroism (CD)—Changes in the secondary structure of NiV-G were monitored by CD spectroscopy in a Jasco-715 spectrometer. Data were collected between 200 and 240 nm, keeping the high voltage below noise levels at all times. Experiments were repeated three times, and each trial was the average of three scans at 20 nm/min and 0.2 nm of resolution. PBS+ buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 500 μm Mg2Cl and 900 μm CaCl2) (22Connolly S.A. Lamb R.A. Virology. 2006; 355: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was used in a 300-μl cuvette at room temperature. CD spectra of ephrinB2 (B2) (2.5 μm), soluble G (1.2 μm), and B2:G mixture were collected. Data were corrected by subtracting the buffer signal. The theoretical spectrum of the B2:G mixture, assuming no interprotein interaction, was calculated by the linear addition of the individual B2 and G scans, and the changes in the ellipticity were calculated by subtracting the experimental B2:G data from the theoretical spectrum. The change in ellipticity magnitude was calculated by averaging the ellipticity values between 223 and 208 nm in both theoretical and experimental data. NiV-F/NiV-G Co-immunoprecipitation—NiV-F/G vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped virions were allowed to mix with CHO cells (negative control) or CHOB2 cells for 2 h at 4 °C then triggered at 37 °C for 0, 15, or 60 min and lysed in 1% Triton-X100. G was immunoprecipitated under each condition using rabbit anti-G polyclonal antibodies as previously described (2Aguilar H.C. Matreyek K.A. Filone C.M. Hashimi S.T. Levroney E.L. Negrete O.A.

Co-immunoprecipitated F was detected by Western blotting using the primary anti-AU1 tag antibodies, and signals were quantified by densitometry as previously described (2Aguilar H.C. Matreyek K.A.

Triggering of NiV-F—CHO cells were transfected with WT F and WT or mutant G expression plasmids as well as a green fluorescent protein expression plasmid at a 10:10:1 ratio, respectively. 18 h post-transfection, a 1:1 ratio of the transfected cells and either CHO (negative control) or CHOB2 cells were mixed and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C or 37 °C in the presence of excess (500 μm) biotinylated HR2 peptide (biotin-KVDISSQISSMNQSLQQSKDYIKEAQRLLDTVNPSL). Subsequently, the cells were washed with wash buffer (1% FBS in phosphate-buffered saline), fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde in wash buffer, and washed again 2X with wash buffer. The biotinylated HR2 peptide bound to F was detected using streptavidin-allophycocyanin and quantified by flow cytometric analysis. To enhance our signal:noise ratio and to focus only on F-expressing cells, green fluorescent protein (GFP++) cells were gated and analyzed for their allophycocyanin (HR2-biotin binding) signals. Enhanced Binding of Monoclonal Antibody 45 (Mab45) to NiV-G (G) Induced by EphrinB2 Receptor Binding—Receptor-induced conformational epitopes can be suggestive of conformational changes in viral envelopes that eventually lead to membrane fusion and viral entry. This is exemplified by CD4-induced coreceptor binding epitopes in HIV gp120. Binding to coreceptor after CD4-induced conformational changes in HIV gp120 triggers fusion peptide exposure in gp41 and the subsequent six-helix bundle formation that eventually leads to membrane fusion (23Finnegan C. Blumenthal R. Infect. Disord. Drug Targets. 2006; 6: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 24Gallo S.A. Finnegan C.M. Viard M. Raviv Y. Dimitrov A. Rawat S.S. Puri A. Durell S. Blumenthal R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). NiV also uses a protein-based receptor and a type I fusion protein, although in this Paramyxovirus, the receptor-interacting attachment glycoprotein (G) is physically distinct from the fusion (F) protein. To determine whether receptor engagement of G also results in conformational changes that lead to F triggering and fusion peptide exposure, we first sought to develop conformational antibodies against NiV-G that exhibit a receptor-induced epitope. Fig. 1A shows a representative set of NiV-G-specific rabbit polyclonal (806) and monoclonal antibodies (Mab26 and Mab45) obtained via genetic immunization with expression plasmids for codon-optimized Nipah matrix M, F, and G (see “Experimental Procedures”). Note that both Mab26 and the polyclonal anti-NiV-G antiserum (806) showed a relative decrease in NiV-G binding in the presence of soluble ephrinB2 (B2), the cognate receptor for henipaviruses, suggesting that B2 may compete for the binding epitopes of these antibodies. In contrast, Mab45 bound better to G in the presence of soluble B2 (Fig. 1A). CHO cells expressing full-length G were used in these assays because they do not express endogenous henipavirus receptors (17Negrete O.A. Levroney E.L. Aguilar H.C. Bertolotti-Ciarlet A. Nazarian R. Tajyar S. Lee B. Nature. 2005; 436: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 18Negrete O.A. Wolf M.C. Aguilar H.C. Enterlein S. Wang W. Muhlberger E. Su S.V. Bertolotti-Ciarlet A. Flick R. Lee B. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e7Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and thus, we could control for receptor engagement by adding exogenous soluble B2. The enhancement of Mab45 binding to G upon B2 engagement was observed at 20 and 37 °C (Fig. 1, A and C) but not at 4 °C (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the receptor-induced enhancement of Mab45 binding to NiV-G was a temperature/energy-dependent process. To further examine the specificity of this phenomenon, increasing amounts of soluble ephrinB1 (B1), ephrinB2 (B2), or ephrinB3 (B3) were added to CHO cells expressing NiV-G and were allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of a constant amount of Mab45 (0.2 μg/ml). Fig. 1C shows that there was a dose-dependent enhancement of Mab45 binding to G when titrating in B2 and to a much lesser extent, B3, and not at all for B1. This was consistent with the much higher affinity of B2 than B3 for NiV-G (18Negrete O.A. Wolf M.C. Aguilar H.C. Enterlein S. Wang W. Muhlberger E. Su S.V. Bertolotti-Ciarlet A. Flick R. Lee B. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e7Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Indeed, the EC50 of the dose-response curve for B2-enhanced Mab45 binding was remarkably close to the established Kd of ephrinB2 for NiV-G (∼0.1 nm). Additionally, a receptor binding-deficient NiV-G mutant, E533Q, which is expressed and can be bound by Mab45 at WT levels (25Negrete O.A. Chu D. Aguilar H.C. Lee B. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 10804-10814Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), displayed no enhancement of Mab45 binding upon the addition of B2, underscoring that receptor binding to NiV-G was necessary for the enhancement of Mab45 binding (Fig. 1C). Altogether, these results suggested that upon B2 binding, a structural change occurred in NiV-G that allowed Mab45 to bind more efficiently and that such a change(s) was energy-dependent. Mapping of the Mab45 Conformational Epitope in NiV-G— Because Mab45 binding to NiV-G was enhanced upon receptor binding and yet Mab45 was still able to block NiV entry (Fig. 1D), we hypothesized that Mab45 receptor binding-enhanced (RBE) epitope may be important for the receptor-induced changes in G that lead to F triggering and membrane fusion. Thus, we first sought to map the Mab45 epitope on NiV-G. The Mab45 epitope was conformational, as Mab45 did not Western blot, and screening of overlapping 22-mer peptides spanning the entire ectodomain of NiV-G did not result in any positive hits (supplemental Fig. 1). Next, we utilized a series of well expressed, previously described soluble NiV-G deletion mutants (17Negrete O.A. Levroney E.L. Aguilar H.C. Bertolotti-Ciarlet A. Nazarian R. Tajyar S. Lee B. Nature. 2005; 436: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) in a pre-absorption/competition assay to show that region 4 and 9 (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 2) were important for Mab45 and Mab26 binding, respectively. Then, we confirmed these results in the context of the full-length NiV-G protein by deleting the regions 4 or 9 and measuring the direct binding of Mab45 and Mab26 to these deletion mutants expressed on CHO cells. Fig. 2B shows that although the Δ4 mutant bound monoclonal anti-HA tag or Mab26 antibodies, it did not bind Mab45. Conversely, although expressed at lower levels at the cell surface, Δ9 bound anti-HA or Mab45 antibodies but not Mab26 (Fig. 2B). Thus, we confirmed that region 4 in G, located at the β6S4/β1H1 region (amino acids 195–211) at the base of the head domain, is important for Mab45 binding, whereas region 9, within the β3H1/β3H2 region (amino acids 371–392) at the top of the head domain near the receptor binding site, is important for Mab26 binding (supplemental Fig. 3A) (26Bowden T.A. Aricescu A.R. Gilbert R.J. Grimes J.M. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 27Xu K. Rajashankar K.R. Chan Y.P. Himanen J.P. Broder C.C. Nikolov D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 9953-9958Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To further map the putative Mab45 epitope, we constructed a series of triple alanine scan mutants within region 4 (mutants 4-1 through 4-5, Fig. 2C). We determined the relative levels of binding of these mutant proteins to anti-HA, Mab45, and Mab26 by flow cytometry using CHO cells expressing the full-length WT or mutant G proteins in the absence of any ephrinB2. Fig. 2D shows the levels of Mab45 and Mab26 binding normalized to the anti-HA levels to correct for any cell surface expression differences. Surprisingly, although deletion of the entire region 4 (Δ4) abolished Mab45 binding to NiV-G, none of the triple alanine mutants showed a significant decrease in Mab45 binding. These results may imply that the Mab45 epitope was complex and was not determined by any short primary linear sequence, even within region 4. Alternatively, because Mab45 was a conformational antibody as mentioned above, deletion of region 4 may have resulted in a gross perturbation of NiV-G that abrogated Mab45 binding as an indirect effect. Thus, region 4, which we posited as being part of the putative Mab45 epitope, may have no direct but only an indirect involvement with the RBE epitope that we hypothesized as being involved in the receptor-induced changes in G that lead to membrane fusion. Role of the Region of G in Membrane Fusion—To further clarify whether region 4 (β6S4/β1H1) or the putative Mab45 epitope plays an active role in the receptor-induced conformational cascade that leads to Nipah virus fusion, we analyzed the receptor binding and fusogenic capabilities of the region 4 mutants when coexpressed with F. The Δ4 mutant itself was relatively well expressed and bound to B2 at 50% that of wild-type levels but was completely defective in a syncytia formation assay (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, although WT G and mutant proteins 4-1 and 4-2 formed syncytia with an efficiency that paralleled their ability to bind B2, almost no syncytia formation was observed for the 4-3, 4-4, and 4-5 mutant proteins despite them being 1) expressed at significant levels at the cell surface (Fig. 2D), 2) able to bind soluble B2 (Fig. 2E), 3) able to associate with F (supplemental Fig. 4A), and 4) able to form G oligomers (supplemental Fig. 4B). Because there were no obvious differences between the fusion-competent (4-1, 4-2) and fusion-defec"

https://openalex.org/W2035266400,"The maturation of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes in the human host takes several days, during which the parasites need to efficiently evade the host immune system. Like asexual stage parasites, immature gametocytes can sequester at various sites in the human body, and only mature sexual stages are found in the circulation. Although the fundamental mechanisms of gametocyte immune evasion are still largely unknown, candidate molecules that may be involved include variant antigens encoded by multigene families in the P. falciparum genome, such as the PfEMP1, STEVOR and RIFIN proteins. While expression of the former two families in sexual stages has been investigated earlier, we report here RIFIN expression during gametocytogenesis.Variants of two previously characterized RIFIN subfamilies (A- and B-type RIFINs) were found to be synthesized in gametocytes. Immunofluorescence experiments showed A-type RIFINs to be accumulated in a crescent-shaped pattern of discrete punctate structures at the infected erythrocyte membrane, while members of the B-type family were associated with the parasite. Transcription analysis demonstrated the existence of diverse transcriptional regulation patterns during sexual differentiation and indicated variant-specific regulation of B-type RIFINs, in contrast to group-specific regulation for A-type RIFINs. Phylogenetic analysis of 5'-upstream regions showed that the rif-gene family falls into five defined clusters, designated rups (rifupstream) A1, A2, AB, B and C. In trophozoites and early gametocytes, rif variants of the rupsA2-type were preferentially expressed.In this work we demonstrate the expression dynamics of the rif-gene family during sexual differentiation and present indications for subgroup specific regulation patterns. Therefore, our data provide a first foundation and point to new directions for future investigations of the potential role of RIFINs in gametocyte immune evasion."

RECK-deficient mice die around embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) with reduced extracellular matrix integrity, premature blood vessels, and precocious neuronal differentiation, and some of these phenotypes have been attributed to the deregulation of metalloproteases such as MMP-2 and ADAM10 (2Oh J.

Kondo S. Takahashi R. Oh J. Kawashima S. Kitayama H. Takahashi C. Noda M. Oncogene.. 2005; 24: 5850-5857Google Scholar, 5Kawashima S. Imamura Y. Chandana E.P. Noda T. Takahashi R. Adachi E.

Cancer Sci.. 2007; 98: 1659-1665Google Scholar). Restored expression of RECK in tumor cells suppresses tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis in animal models (1Takahashi C. Sheng Z. Horan T.P. Kitayama H. Maki M. Hitomi K. Kitaura Y. Takai S. Sasahara R.M. Horimoto A. Ikawa Y. Ratzkin B.J. Arakawa T. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1998; 95: 13221-13226Google Scholar, 2Oh J.

Takahashi C. Noda M. Cell.. 2001; 107: 789-800Google Scholar), and the level of residual RECK expression in tumor tissues often correlates with better prognosis (7Noda M. Takahashi C. Cancer Sci.. 2007; 98: 1659-1665Google Scholar). Despite the accumulating evidence indicating the importance of RECK in mammalian development and tumor suppression, the molecular basis of its actions remains poorly understood. Several characteristics of RECK, such as high cysteine content, requirement of carbohydrate modification for its bioactivity (8Simizu S. Takagi S. Tamura Y. Osada H. Cancer Res.. 2005; 65: 7455-7461Google Scholar), and susceptibility to proteolysis, make it difficult to produce a large quantity of this protein in a laboratory. In addition, many RECK mutants and fragments have been found biologically inactive, most likely because of misfolding. It is therefore imperative to establish a system to produce full-length RECK protein satisfactory for biochemical studies. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (∼23 in humans) typically consist of a propeptide, catalytic domain, linker peptide, and hemopexin domain (9Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 2001; 17: 463-516Google Scholar, 10Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol.. 2002; 22: 51-86Google Scholar, 11Nagase H. Visse R. Murphy G. Cardiovasc. Res.. 2006; 69: 562-573Google Scholar). Noncatalytic domains of MMPs contribute to their interaction with other molecules, including their specific substrates. MMP-7 (also known as matrilysin and pump-1) is one of the smallest members of the family, consisting only of a propeptide and the catalytic domain. Some MMP family members are up-regulated in cancer cells, and their expression is often associated with poor prognosis (12Fingleton B. Front. Biosci.. 2006; 11: 479-491Google Scholar). Enhanced production of MMP-7, for instance, is found in endometrial carcinoma, and its expression is correlated with invasion and metastasis (13Shiomi T. Okada Y. Cancer Metastasis Rev.. 2003; 22: 145-152Google Scholar). MMP-2-deficient mice show reduced progression of inoculated tumors (14Itoh T. Tanioka M. Yoshida H. Yoshioka T. Nishimoto H. Itohara S. Cancer Res.. 1998; 58: 1048-1051Google Scholar). Previous studies using a partially purified, soluble form of RECK expressed in CHO cells demonstrated competitive inhibition of gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and MT1-MMP in vitro (1Takahashi C.

Chem.. 2007; 282: 12341-12352Google Scholar). The spectrum and modes of inhibition by RECK on other MMP family members remain to be elucidated. Fibronectin (FN) is one of the major extracellular matrix components that can be cleaved by several MMPs (9Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 2001; 17: 463-516Google Scholar). FN is mainly composed of three repeating units (types I–III), expressed in multiple cell types, and plays important roles in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation (16Pankov R. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci.. 2002; 115: 3861-3863Google Scholar, 17Mao Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. Matrix Biol.. 2005; 24: 389-399Google Scholar). FN was initially identified as a glycoprotein lost in malignant transformation, and later studies revealed the involvement of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in this event (18Olden K. Yamada K.M. Cell.. 1977; 11: 957-969Google Scholar). Whether RECK down-regulation in malignant transformation plays any part in this FN loss is an interesting question yet to be addressed. In this study, we established a system to produce a highly purified, soluble form of human RECK protein. Using this protein, we could uncover its dimeric nature and unique three-dimensional structure. We also identified MMP-7 as its novel potential target and FN as an MMP substrate protected by RECK. Plasmid Construction—The retroviral vector, pL(RECK-His)SB, was constructed by inserting, by three parts ligation, the MluI-EagI fragment of human RECK cDNA, and the double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the C-terminal 7 amino acids (954AHHHHHH) between the MluI and ApaI site of pLXSB, a derivative of pLXSN (19Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques.. 1989; 7 (984–986, 989–990): 980-982Google Scholar) carrying the bsd marker. The virus was propagated using EcoPack 293 (Clontech). Establishing RECK-His Producer—MEFs were prepared as described (2Oh J. Takahashi R. Kondo S. Mizoguchi A. Adachi E. Sasahara R.M. Nishimura S. Imamura Y. Kitayama H. Alexander D.B. Ide C. Horan T.P.

R–M2–MT– MEFs were infected with L(RECK-His)SB virus and selected with blasticidin S (8 μg/ml). A transfectant clone (TOM2–6) secreting RECK-His at a high level was expanded to 20–40 150-mm dishes using selection medium. When the culture reached confluence, the medium was replaced with α-minimum essential medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and harvested every 48 h for several weeks.

Electrophoretic Detection of Proteins—For immunoblot assay, proteins boiled in sample buffer without (nonreducing conditions) or with 50 mm dithiothreitol (reducing conditions; only when so indicated) were separated by SDS-PAGE (PA: 8% for RECK, 6% for FN), transferred onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore), and detected using a mouse anti-human RECK (5B11D12; final 1.34 μg/ml), anti-human FN (antigen is full-length human FN; BD Biosciences), anti-human FN N-terminal, anti-human FN C-terminal (Chemicon), anti-human integrin-α5, anti-human integrin-β1 (BD Biosciences), or antiα-tubulin (Calbiochem) antibody following standard protocol. Coomassie Brilliant Blue Stain One (Nakalai Tesque) and Silver staining mass spectrometry kit (WAKO) were used for direct gel staining. Blue native-PAGE was performed using Native-PAGE Novex BisTris Gel System (3–12%) (Invitrogen). Enzyme Reactions—Recombinant pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-7 (R & D Systems) were activated (37 °C, 1 h) in 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Brij-35, mixed with substrate in the same buffer, and incubated at 37 °C. For deglycosylation, cell lysate (16.7 μg of protein) or purified RECK-His (0.14 pmol) was heat-denatured (100 °C, 10 min) in 0.5% SDS, 40 mm dithiothreitol and then incubated with N-glycosidase F (1,000 units; New England Biolabs) (37 °C, 1 h) in 30 μl of reaction mixture in 50 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40. Mass Spectrometry (26Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom.. 1996; 10: 1371-1378Google Scholar)—After SDS-PAGE, proteins were visualized by silver staining, excised individually from the gel, and digested in gel with trypsin (Promega). Molecular mass analyses of the tryptic peptides were performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/mass spectrometry using an ultraflex TOF/TOF (Bruker Daltonics). Analysis of RECK and FN Associated with HT1080 Transfectants—HT1080 transfectants have been described (2Oh J. Takahashi R. Kondo S. Mizoguchi A. Adachi E. Sasahara R.M. Nishimura S. Imamura Y. Kitayama H. Alexander D.B. Ide C. Horan T.P. Arakawa T. Yoshida H. Nishikawa S. Itoh Y. Seiki M. Itohara S. Takahashi C. Noda M. Cell.. 2001; 107: 789-800Google Scholar). For immunoblot assay, the cells (5 × 105) were plated onto 6-well dishes, incubated for 17–24 h, and homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, protease inhibitor mixture (Nakalai Tesque)). For blue native-PAGE, the cells were homogenized in 1× Native-PAGE Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) containing 1% digitonin. To eliminate extracellular components, the cells were treated with trypsin (0.5 mg/ml)/EDTA (0.53 mm) for 15 min at 37 °C, collected by centrifugation, and washed twice with PBS before cell lysis. To prepare conditioned media, the cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h in 700 μl of serum-free DMEM or for 4 h in 500 μl of serum-free DMEM containing 100 milliunits of PI-PLC (ProZyme). RNA Extraction and Analyses—Total mRNA was extracted using NucleoSpin RNAII (Macherey-Nagel). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using SuperScriptIII Platinum (SYBR Green) one-step quantitative RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) with the Mx3005P QPCR system (Stratagene). Primers/probes used are cctatgtggtcggagaaacg (forward), gatgtccttgtgtcctgatcg (reverse), and Cy5-cgcgatcggatgatggtagattgtacttgcctgggatcgcg-Eclipse (Molecular Beacon probe) for FN and the primer set HA031580 (Takara Bio) for hHPRT1. Reaction conditions were as follows: 94 °C, 15 s; 54 °C, 40 s; 72 °C, 20 s; 45 cycles. Immunofluorescent Staining—Cells (2–3 × 105) seeded onto glass coverslips in 6-well plates were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS) or permeabilized (4% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) and on the following day stained with mouse anti-human FN (BD Biosciences) and rabbit anti-mouse IgG-FITC (Dako) or Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). To label plasma membrane, pEYFP-Mem (BD Biosciences) was transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The samples were mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) and recorded with a fluorescence microscope (Axioplan, Zeiss) or a confocal microscope (FV300, Olympus). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human RECK Protein—Our preliminary experiments indicated that a recombinant human RECK protein (RECK-His), in which the C-terminal GPI-anchoring signal (28 residues) was replaced by six histidines, could be expressed as a secreted protein in insect cells (Sf21) and that this protein could be cleaved by MMP-2 and MT1-MMP (supplemental Fig. 1A). This protein, however, was not glycosylated as extensively as RECK produced in mammalian cells (supplemental Fig. 1B). In an attempt to produce intact and fully glycosylated RECK-His in large quantity, we established a MEF line from an animal carrying null mutations in three genes, Reck, Mmp-2, and Mmp-14 (MT1-MMP). When the RECK-His transgene was expressed in this MEF line (named R–M2–MT– MEFs) using a retroviral vector, near full-length RECK-His could be detected in the culture supernatant (Fig. 1A). We set up a four-step purification procedure starting from this material: 1) His tag affinity fractionation; 2) cation exchange chromatography; 3) anion exchange chromatography; and 4) gel filtration chromatography. This procedure allowed us to routinely prepare RECK-His to over 90% purity (Fig. 1B) with a net yield of ∼4 μg from 1-liter of culture supernatant. Intactness of the RECK-His Protein—RECK is rich in cysteine (9.17%) and has Kazal motifs with conserved cysteine residues (1Takahashi C. Sheng Z. Horan T.P. Kitayama H. Maki M. Hitomi K. Kitaura Y. Takai S. Sasahara R.M. Horimoto A. Ikawa Y. Ratzkin B.J. Arakawa T. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1998; 95: 13221-13226Google Scholar). When we detected the native RECK protein in the lysates of HT1080 cells overexpressing RECK (R/HT1080 cells) by immunoblot assay, a major band of ∼125 kDa was found under reducing conditions (Fig. 1C, lane 1), and a band of ∼95 kDa was found under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1C, lane 2), suggesting the presence of intra-molecular disulfide bridges. A similar band shift was observed when the purified recombinant RECK-His was analyzed under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 3 and 4). In addition to the ∼125-kDa band, several smaller bands (major species, ∼110 and ∼53 kDa) were detectable in the lysate of R/HT1080 when the antibody recognizing the C-terminal portion of RECK was used (Fig. 1, C and D, lane 1). Many of these smaller bands were absent or less intense in the cells treated with a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 (Fig. 1D, lane 2). Sizes of the major subfragments are similar to those of the RECK-His fragments produced by MMPs in vitro (see below). These observations suggest that the folding of the RECK-His preparation was largely intact. Furthermore, treatment with N-glycosidase F indicated that the extent of glycosylation was similar between the purified RECK-His and the RECK in R/HT1080 cell lysate (Fig. 1E). Molecular Mass of RECK-His—We next estimated the molecular mass of nondenatured RECK-His by two methods, gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2, A and B) and blue native-PAGE (Fig. 2C). Both experiments yielded similar results: 215.9 ± 4.2 kDa (mean ± S.D., n = 5) by gel filtration chromatography and ∼210 kDa by blue native-PAGE. Because the calculated molecular mass of RECK-His polypeptide is 102 kDa, and the contribution of carbohydrate groups is typically ∼10 kDa in a RECK monomer (e.g. Fig. 1E) (1Takahashi C. Sheng Z. Horan T.P. Kitayama H. Maki M. Hitomi K. Kitaura Y. Takai S. Sasahara R.M. Horimoto A. Ikawa Y. Ratzkin B.J. Arakawa T. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1998; 95: 13221-13226Google Scholar, 8Simizu S. Takagi S. Tamura Y. Osada H. Cancer Res.. 2005; 65: 7455-7461Google Scholar), the observed molecular mass is close to the value expected for a dimer: i.e. (102 + 10) x 2 = 224. To test whether intact RECK also shows a similar molecular mass, we subjected a lysate of R/HT1080 cells to blue native-PAGE-immunoblot assay (Fig. 2D). A major band at the position corresponding to the dimer was detected. We also prepared the supernatants of the cells cultured in the presence of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC); this treatment released a large fraction of RECK (probably representing the molecules displayed on the cell surface) into the medium (Fig. 2E, lanes 2 and 4). This sample again showed a major band at the dimeric position in blue native-PAGE immunoblot assay (Fig. 2F, lane 2). Hence, a major fraction of RECK molecules, including those on the cell surface (i.e. mature form), are probably in the dimeric form. Three-dimensional Structure of RECK-His—Given the high purity and intactness of the RECK-His preparation, we studied its gross three-dimensional structure by negative staining and TEM. Differently shaped globular objects of similar sizes, presumably representing projections of RECK-His at different angles, were observed (Fig. 3A, arrowheads). The raw images of these globular objects (n = 2,325) were picked up and analyzed to reconstruct a three-dimensional density assuming C2 symmetry (i.e. dimeric assembly) using our SPINNS method and the Imagic V program (see “Experimental Procedures”). The final reconstruction included 2,033 particles, 87.4% of all the selected images. In Fig. 3B, representative raw images (top panels) are shown with their corresponding class averages (2nd row), the surface representations, and the projections of the reconstruction (3rd and 4th rows). Despite the large divergence in the shapes of the raw images, a higher level of consistency was observed in their size, shape, and inner structure with the corresponding averages and the projections from the final three-dimensional structure. This indicates successful three-dimensional reconstruction from the original particle images. A plot of the Euler angles of the 87 adopted class averages (Fig. 3C) shows that RECK-His was almost randomly oriented on the grid surface. The resolution (20van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R.

Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies: Visualization of Biological Molecules in Their Native State. Oxford University Press, New York2006Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar) was 25.2 Å at the correlation coefficient of 0.5 according to the FSC function (27Harauz G. van Heel M. Optik.. 1986; 73: 146-156Google Scholar) (Fig. 3D). The surface representation (Fig. 4) demonstrates that the RECK-His dimer is a cowbell-shape with an inside cavity that opens widely at the bottom. From an elliptic bottom view, the estimated lengths at the widest and narrowest positions are 109 and 89 Å, respectively (Fig. 4B, lower panel). The molecular height is 120 Å (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Of note, a pair of small protrusions (∼16 Å height) sticking out from the bottom cavity can be seen (Fig. 4, A, panels 11, 12 and 17, and B, upper panel). The three-dimensional map is contoured using isosurfaces and contains a volume corresponding to 235 kDa by assuming a protein density of 1.37 g/cm3. This is 115% of the dimeric RECK mass (204.2 kDa) calculated from the amino acid composition. We also observed RECK-His decorated with anti-penta-His monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 3E). Binding of this antibody to the globular objects was clearly demonstrated, indicating that the images we analyzed indeed represent RECK-His. Moreover, globular objects bearing two antibodies were frequently found (Fig. 3E, lower panels), further supporting the dimeric assembly of RECK-His. Cleavage of RECK-His by MMPs—Consistent with the preliminary data pertaining to the protein expressed in insect cells (see above and supplemental Fig. 1), RECK-His purified in this study could be cleaved by MMP-2 when the enzyme concentration was higher than the substrate concentration (Fig. 5A, lanes 2–4; [RECK-His]:[MMP-2] = 1:13, 1:26, 1:38), yielding two major fragments (∼110 and ∼53 kDa), although complete digestion was not achieved under these conditions. RECK-His could also be cleaved by MMP-7 when the enzyme was present in great excess (Fig. 5B, lanes 2–4; [RECK-His]:[MMP-7] = 1:109, 1:218, 1:326), yielding a major fragment of ∼53 kDa (Fig. 5B). Double digestion experiments (Fig. 5C; [RECK-His]:[MMP-2]:[MMP-7] = 1:38:39) indicated that MMP-2 and MMP-7 cleave RECK-His at proximate (or identical) sites to yield the ∼53-kDa fragment. Effects of RECK-His on the Proteolytic Activity of MMPs—Next, we asked whether highly purified RECK-His can regulate MMPs. We chose to use plasma fibronectin (pFN), a natural substrate known to be cleaved by both MMP-2 and MMP-7 (9Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 2001; 17: 463-516Google Scholar, 28Miyazaki K. Hattori Y. Umenishi F. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Cancer Res.. 1990; 50: 7758-7764Google Scholar). MMP-2 cleaves pFN at several sites as visualized by immunoblot technique (Fig. 6A; compare lanes 1–3). This reaction was partially inhibited by RECK-His when its concentration was higher than the concentrations of both MMP-2 and pFN (Fig. 6A, lane 2; [RECK-His]:[MMP-2]:[pFN] = 43:5:1). Under similar conditions, RECK-His could also inhibit the cleavage of pFN by MMP-7 (Fig. 6B; [RECK-His]:[MMP-7]: [pFN] = 46:9:1). The above results indicate that RECK can inhibit MMPs, while at the same time being a substrate of MMPs. To understand why this is possible, we compared the susceptibility of pFN and RECK-His to MMP-7 under similar, substrate-excess conditions (Fig. 6, D and E). MMP-7-catalyzed cleavage of pFN was detectable over a wide range of substrate concentrations (Fig. 6D; [MMP-7]:[pFN] = 1:8–80), whereas the cleavage of RECK-His was barely detectable under similar conditions (Fig. 6E; [MMP-7]:[RECK-His] = 1:9–86). RECK-His could only be cleaved at far higher MMP-7 concentrations (see Fig. 5B), indicating that RECK-His is a poor substrate for MMP-7. In time course studies such as the one shown in Fig. 6B, we ascertained that it was possible to determine the reaction velocity of MMP-mediated pFN cleavage by immunoblot densitometry (e.g. Fig. 6, B and C). We therefore determined initial reaction velocities at various pFN concentrations in the absence or presence of RECK-His (Fig. 6F; [RECK-His]:[MMP-7]:[pFN] = 68:1:1.1–81) and obtained Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 6G). The plots yielded two lines (representing the data in the absence and presence of RECK-His) crossing near the y axis (Fig. 6G), suggesting competitive inhibition, and the following kinetic constants: Vmax = 44 pm/min, Km = 8.2 nm for pFN cleavage by MMP-7, and Ki = 41 nm for inhibition of this reaction by RECK-His. Characterization of pFN Fragments—Cleavage of pFN by MMP-7 results in the appearance of an ∼175-kDa doublet, followed by the appearance of a lower molecular weight doublet (Fig. 6B). The 175-kDa doublet, particularly the upper band, remains prominent for more than 6 h in mixtures to which RECK has been added. Persistence of similar fragments was also observed when pFN was treated with MMP-2 in the presence of RECK-His (Fig. 6A, lane 2, bracket). The doublet FN fragments could be recognized by a C-terminal specific anti-FN antibody but not by an N-terminal specific anti-FN antibody (Fig. 7A; see Fig. 7C, top diagram for the positions of antigens). Partial digestion of pFN by MMP-7 also gave rise to similar doublet bands (Fig. 7B, arrowheads a and b). Mass spectrometry of these bands indicated that they share the same N-terminal end, 721LVAT—, corresponding to the beginning of the FN III2 module and that they contain a common sequence YSQR2356 corresponding to a site near the C-terminal end of FN (Fig. 7C, lower diagrams). The size difference between the doublet bands is because of the presence or absence of the V region (residues 1991–2110 in P02751), which is consistent with the known composition of the pFN dimer (i.e. only one subunit contains the V region). Thus, the FN fragments (∼175 kDa) that persist in the presence of RECK-His are devoid of the N-terminal assembly domain, which consists mainly of type I and type II modules (Fig. 7C). Effects of RECK Expression on FN Associated with HT1080 Cells—To assess the biological relevance of our findings in vitro, we compared the levels of FN associated with HT1080 cells transfected with the control vector (V) or RECK-expression vector (R). FN levels, both in the cell lysate and culture supernatant, were elevated by 1.6–1.8-fold in R/HT1080 cells as compared with V/HT1080 cells (Fig. 8A, lanes 2 and 4), although the ∼175-kDa FN fragments are not obvious in this case. Up-regulation of endogenous FN mRNA was not detectable (Fig. 8B), suggesting the involvement of post-transcriptional mechanism(s). The MMP inhibitor GM6001 also increased the level of FN as assessed by immunofluorescent staining of nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 8C, panel 3) and by immunoblot assay (Fig. 8D, lane 3), suggesting the involvement of regulated protein degradation. The major FN receptor, integrin-α5β1, was not up-regulated in RECK transfectants (Fig. 8E), making it unlikely that the observed increase in the level of cell-associated FN reflected an increase in the ability of the cells to bind FN. Finally, we examined the localization of cell-associated FN by two approaches. In the first approach, we treated the cells with trypsin and determined the levels of FN remaining associated with the cells (Fig. 8F). Interestingly, the level of FN in the try"

We analyzed ligand recognition by the retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) protein in biochemical assays and in transiently transfected cells and characterized the requirements for both single- and double-stranded RNA agonists for RIG-I activation of signaling. RIG-I mutants such as K270A and T409A/S411A that were defective in signaling with triphosphorylated single-stranded RNAs were perfectly capable of signaling with dsRNAs. Furthermore, phosphorothioated oligodeoxynucleotides were found to antagonize RIG-I signaling. Both agonists and antagonist bind purified RIG-I protein and a truncated RIG-I protein that lacked the signaling domain. The agonists were necessary to activate RIG-I ATPase activity in vitro, whereas antagonist inhibited ATPase activity. Differential scanning fluorometry showed that RIG-I bound to agonists, and antagonists have different denaturation properties, suggesting a difference in protein conformations. Last, single particle reconstruction was used to generate three-dimensional models of the RIG-I dimers in complex with an agonist and an antagonist.

RIG-I encodes two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARD) that function in signaling, a middle portion containing DEXD/H RNA helicase motifs that can bind dsRNA, and a C-terminal regulatory domain that interacts with the helicase domain and inhibits signaling by the CARD domain (18Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Intramolecular and intermolecular interactions are critical to regulate the conformational changes upon ligand binding that are a part of the activation of signaling. In the presence of an agonist, RIG-I is thought to undergo a conformational change to expose the CARD domain that can trigger multimerization and cell signaling (18Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The structure for the regulatory domain (amino acids 800-925) of RIG-I was elucidated recently (19Cui S. Eisenacher K. Kirchhofer A. Brzozka K. Lammens A. Lammens K. Fujita T. Conzelmann K.K. Krug A.

The regulatory domain (RD) is sufficient to bind RNA with a 5′-triphosphate with nanomolar affinity (19Cui S. Eisenacher K. Kirchhofer A. Brzozka K. Lammens A. Lammens K. Fujita T. Conzelmann K.K.

RNA binding was also shown to induce dimerization of the recombinant RIG-I protein (19Cui S. Eisenacher K. Kirchhofer A. Brzozka K. Lammens A. Lammens K. Fujita T. Conzelmann K.K. Krug A. Hopfner K.P. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The goal of this study is to better define ligand recognition by the RIG-I protein using cell-based and biochemical assays. A number of ligands were found to serve as agonists and also antagonists for RIG-I. Expression Constructs—For nomenclature, the full-length RIG-I protein is simply named RIG-I. The deletion of the CARD domain (deleting amino acids 2-228) is named by the prefix “R” to designate RIG-I followed by single letters for the helicase and regulatory domains; that is, R-HR. Where a GST tag is present, it is denoted with a lowercase “g,” as in R-gHR. The cDNA of RIG-I cloned in pUNO (pRIGI) was purchased from InvivoGen. Mutations within RIG-I were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit and the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The presence of the designed mutations and the lack of spurious mutations were checked by DNA sequencing using the Big-Dye® Terminator Version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing kits (Applied Biosystems). Full-length RIG-I, R-HR, and their GST-tagged versions were cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pBAC1 (Novagen Inc.). The expression constructs were cotransfected with linearized Baculovirus DNA (BD Biosciences) into Sf9 cells to produce recombinant virus. The virus was amplified in Sf9 cells and used for protein expression. RIG-I Expression and Purification—Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda 9) cells were cultured in HyQ® SFX-Insect™ media and grown at 27 °C in flasks. At 48 and 72 h after infection with the recombinant viruses, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 680 × g. The cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40), and the lysate was clarified with a 15-min centrifugation at 30,600 × g. The supernatant was added to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads equilibrated in the lysis buffer. The proteins bound to the beads were washed 4 times with lysis buffer amended with 10 mm imidazole followed by repeated washes by centrifugation at 1 min and 3400 × g. Finally, the desired proteins were eluted with the lysis buffer amended with 250 mm imidazole. The protein was then concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex200 10/300 GL column and eluted with TS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). The peak of protein was dialyzed with storage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 40% glycerol, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and stored in aliquots. gRIG-I and R-gRH were purified by glutathione resin before elution with buffer E (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The peak of protein was dialyzed with the storage buffer and stored in aliquots at -70 °C. Removal of the GST tag was performed by incubating the protein for 30 min with thrombin. The cleaved reaction was then purified again using the GST resin. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Wild type or mutant protein samples (∼100 μg) were filtered through a Superdex 200 column using a GE Healthcare fast protein liquid chromatography system calibrated with the molecular mass standards blue dextran (2000 kDa), thyroglobulin (660 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (140 kDa), BSA (67 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa) according to the protocol described in Guarino et al. (21Guarino L.A. Bhardwaj K. Dong W. Sun J. Holzenburg A. Kao C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 1106-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cell-based Assay for RIG-I Activity—Actively growing HEK293T cells was plated in CoStar White 96-well plates at 4.4 × 104/ml for transfection. Cells were between 60 to 80% confluent and were transfected with a mixture of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and plasmids pNiFty Luc (15 ng, InvivoGen), phRL-TK (5 ng, Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and pRIG1 (0.5 ng) that, respectively, code for the firefly luciferase reporter, the Renilla luciferase transfection control, and plasmids coding for either wild-type or mutant RIG-I. The cells were incubated for 24 h to allow expression from the plasmids. Ligands were then transfected into the cells at 0.5 μm unless otherwise specified. After another incubation for 12 h, the cells were assayed using the Dual Glo Luciferase Assay System reagents (Promega), quantifying luminescence with the FLUOstar OPTIMA Plate Reader (BMG Labtech, Inc). ATPase Assay—ATPase assay was performed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm NaCl, and 4% glycerol. The reaction contained ligand RNA (1 μm) or pIC (500 ng) and 1 mm cold ATP along with trace amounts of [γ-32P]ATP. Specified proteins were added, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reaction products were then separated on thin-layer chromatography using cellulose polyethyleneimine sheets. Relative ATPase activity was calculated as the amount of 32P released relative to a reaction where RIG-I was not exposed to a ligand. Reversible Protein-RNA Cross-linking and Peptide Mapping—N-hydroxy succinimide-Sepharose (20 μl) was washed with 0.1 m sodium tetraborate, pH 8.5, and mixed with 20 μl of 50 μm oligodeoxynucleotide 2006 (ODN2006) containing an amine group attached to the 3′ end. The mixture was incubated overnight followed by washes with buffer A (20 mm Hepes, 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in the same buffer. RIG-I (5 μg) was added to it and incubated at room temperature for 15 min followed by the addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 0.1% in a 50-μl reaction. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by the addition of glycine at a 0.2 m final concentration. After 5 min, sequencing grade trypsin (Trypsin Gold; Promega) was added at a protease: substrate ratio 1:50 (w/w) in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, at 37 °C and allowed to digest overnight. The released the ODN2006-peptide conjugates were purified and subjected to incubation at 70 °C for 1 h to reverse the cross-links. The samples were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants containing the peptides were desalted using a Ziptip (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The bound peptides were eluted in 2.5 μl of 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. Biochemical Analysis of RIG-I Binding to Nucleic Acid—Native gel assay used recombinant proteins mixed with various nucleic acids in ATPase reaction buffer and separated on non-denaturing PAGE and stained with ethidium bromide UV cross-linking. Nucleic acids were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. A standard cross-linking reaction used a mixture of recombinant protein (200 ng) with and without competitors in ATPase buffer. Cross-linking was for 2 min at 3600 μJ/cm2. The reaction was separated in a denaturing 4-12% protein gel. Pulldown assays were performed by binding biotinylated ODN2006 to streptavidin resin overnight in buffer A. A slurry of resin (30 μl) containing bound ∼3 μg of biotinylated 2006 was mixed with 1 μg of recombinant R-gHR and 2 μg of BSA in the presence or absence of equimolar amounts (5 μm) of competitors (poly(I:C) was used at 1 and 2 μg) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The unbound fraction was removed by centrifugation, and the pellet was washed with the same buffer as above. The final pellet was resuspended in 15 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated on 4-12% denaturing protein gel along with the unbound fraction followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Fluorescence Anisotropy Assay—Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled RNA for the binding assays were synthesized, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and quantified by the manufacturer (IDT technologies; Coralville, IA). The probes were diluted to 200 nm in ATPase buffer. For the formation of dsRNA, the probes were heated with a 1:1 molar ratio of the complementary RNA in an 80 °C water bath and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. Fluorescence measurements were made at room temperature with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminescence spectrometer LS55 using cuvettes with an optical path length of 0.4 cm. Measurements were taken with an integration time of 1 s and a slit width of 5 nm. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 495 and 520 nm, respectively. Anisotropy values were recorded 20 s after each protein addition to allow the sample to reach equilibrium. The total volume of protein added was less than 5% that of the final volume. Represented anisotropy values are the average of 10 measurements. Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least square fitting using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The simple hyperbola equation ΔA = BmaxX/(X + Kd) was used to determine the dissociation constant (Kd). In this equation ΔA is the anisotropy change caused by the ligand binding, Bmax is the maximum anisotropy change, and X is the total concentration of the input protein. Differential Scanning Fluorometry—Differential scanning fluorometry was performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler EP Realplex machine. Each sample contains 20-μl solutions of RIG-I (1 μm), SYPRO orange (Molecular probes), and ligand (5 μm) in the ATPase buffer. The 96-well plate containing all of the samples was heated at a rate of 1.0 °C/min in a real-time PCR machine (Eppendorf) from 25 to 95 °C, and the fluorescence intensity was measured with excitation/emission wavelengths of 470/550 nm. TM values were calculated using the software provided by Eppendorf. Each sample was tested in triplicate, and the results were duplicated in at least two independent assays. Negative-stained Electron Microscopy and Three-dimensional Reconstructions—A JEOL 1200 TEM operated at 100 kV was used for routine negative staining and direct size measurements. Electron micrographs were digitalized using an Epson Projection 3200 scanner at 1200 dots/inch, corresponding to 5.5 Å/pixel at the specimen level. Three-dimensional reconstruction of different proteins reported in this paper were calculated using the EMAN software package (22Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar) run under Linux and following procedures similar to those described by Sun et al. (23Sun J. Duffy K.E. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Xiong J. Lamb R.J. Santos J. Masarapu H. Cunningham M. Holzenburg A. Sarisky R.T. Mbow M.L. Kao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11144-11151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, particles of the protein of interest (R-HR, 1900 particles; R-HR dimer + dsRNA, 2500 particles; or R-HR dimer + ODN2006, 3300 particles) were selected using the EMAN boxer routine, filtered, and centered. A set of class averages were generated from these centered particles with no assumed symmetry. An initial three-dimensional model was generated from a set of representative class averages and was used for refinement. The reconstructions were iteratively refined until the structure was stable as judged by Fourier shell correlation (FSC). The appropriate molecular mass (R-HR, 80 kDa; R-HR dimers, 167 kDa) was used for the surface-rendering threshold of the three-dimensional structure. Three-dimensional reconstructions were visualized using the University of California, San Francisco Chimera software package (24Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (26024) Google Scholar). R-HR dimers complexed with 2006 were subjected to EMAN multi-refinement to separate the R-HR monomers present in the gel filtration fraction from the dimers (See “Results” and “Discussions”). The particle set corresponding to dimeric forms was used for further refinement. Agonists for RIG-I Activation of Signaling in Cells—Transient transfection of 293T cells was used to test agonists for RIG-I-mediated signaling. To confirm that the signaling observed is due to RIG-I, we used two mutants, K270A and T409A/S411A (referred to as TS). Mutant K270A has a defect in the Walker A motif of the helicase-like domain and was shown to inactivate RIG-I signaling (5Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3023) Google Scholar). Residues Thr-409 and Ser-411 was suggested to be important for poly(I:C) binding (20Takahasi K. Yoneyama M. Nishihori T. Hirai R. Kumeta H. Narita R. Gale Jr., M. Inagaki F. Fujita T. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 428-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). These mutants are both expressed in the cells, as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A), although mutant TS may be expressed at a reduced level. Different ss- and dsRNAs were tested for their ability to activate RIG-I using the NF-κB promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1). These include in vitro transcribed 27-nt RNA named 3P-css27, the same RNA lacking 5′-triphosphates (css27), an in vitro transcribed 60-nt hairpin RNA named shRNA9, and in vitro transcribed HCV subgenomic replicon RNA of 9 kilobases (HCV sgR), an unphosphorylated 27-bp dsRNA named dsR27 that has the sequence as css27 in one of its strands, heterogeneous poly(I:C), and poly(I:C) of 115 bp (pIC115) and 25 bp (pIC25). RIG-I-mediated signaling could be induced by all the agonists tested in Fig. 1B except css27, consistent with reports that ssRNA require a 5′-triphosphate to act as an RIG-I agonist (25Kato H. Takeuchi O. Mikamo-Satoh E. Hirai R. Kawai T. Matsushita K. Hiiragi A. Dermody T.S. Fujita T. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 26Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Duffy K.E. Jordan J.L. Eaton-Bassiri A. Vaughan R. Hoose S.A. Lamb R.J. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4507-4519Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Double-stranded RNAs dsR27, pIC25, pIC115, and poly(I:C) were able to activate RIG-I signaling in the absence of the 5′-triphosphates from 6- to 13-fold (Fig. 1B). The activation is specific to RIG-I as signaling was observed only in cells transfected with RIG-I-expressing plasmid and not in vector-transfected cells (pUNO, Fig. 1B). Furthermore, mutants K270A and TS showed significantly lower signaling with 3P-css27, shR9, and HCV sgR compared with wild type RIG-I (Fig. 1B). An unexpected observation was that mutants K270A and TS were fully capable of signaling at levels similar to that of wild type RIG-I with ligands dsR27, pIC25, pIC115, and poly(I:C) (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that dsRNA agonists may induce RIG-I-specific signaling independent of the activities conferred by the ATPase domain. The signaling by mutant TS with poly(I:C) was contrary to the report of Takahasi et al. (20Takahasi K. Yoneyama M. Nishihori T. Hirai R. Kumeta H. Narita R. Gale Jr., M. Inagaki F. Fujita T. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 428-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), but the substitutions in TS did affect signaling with other ligands. These results show that signaling by RIG-I is very much influenced by the properties of the ligand. To confirm whether dsRNA and ssRNA induce RIG-I signaling differently, we tested the affect of LGP2 on RIG-I signaling with shR9 and poly(I:C) (Fig. 1C). LGP2 has been proposed to antagonize the signaling by RIG-I through the formation of heterodimeric complexes (18Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). An alternative model is that LGP2 could limit the amount of ligand that is accessible to RIG-I by binding dsRNA with higher affinity and cooperativity (8Murali A. Li X. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Bhardwaj K. Holzenburg A. Li P. Kao C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15825-15833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although LGP2 interfered with shR9-mediated RIG-I signaling, it did not significantly affect poly(I:C)-induced signaling (Fig. 1C). These observations support the hypothesis that ssRNA and dsRNA is recognized differently by RIG-I. The poly(I:C) used varied from 25 bp to a length that averaged ∼500 bp (Fig. 1B). To determine whether poly(I:C) length could affect signaling, we hydrolyzed commercial preparations of poly(I:C) with sodium hydroxide and separated the products on preparative denaturing gels. Segments of the gel were eluted to obtain different lengths of poly(I:C). The average lengths were determined with an analytical gel stained with toluidine blue (data not shown). These poly(I:C)s were then tested for their ability to induce RIG-I signaling (Fig. 1D). Poly(I:C) of up to 19 bp were unable to activate RIG-I signaling. In addition, heterogeneous poly(I:C)s with average lengths of >200 bp were not a better agonist for RIG-I signaling than ones of ∼45 bp, suggesting that dsRNA length and/or an concentration will affect RIG-I signaling (25Kato H. Takeuchi O. Mikamo-Satoh E. Hirai R. Kawai T. Matsushita K. Hiiragi A. Dermody T.S. Fujita T. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Last, to determine whether the effect of ligand length is specific to RIG-I, the same set of RNAs was tested with the cytoplasmic DEAD-box helicase, MDA5, and the membrane-associated receptor Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) (Fig. 1D). For both MDA5 and TLR3, increasing poly(I:C) length increased the signaling (Fig. 1D). These results show that response to dsRNA by RIG-I is distinguishable from that of MDA5 and TLR3. Altogether, results in this section demonstrate that RIG-I can recognize agonists by a complex set of rules, including their length, whether they are single- or double-stranded, or whether they possess 5′-triphosphates. Antagonists of RIG-I Signaling—Modified ODNs with phosphorothioate backbones can bind to the ectodomain of TLR3 and inhibit signaling (26Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Duffy K.E. Jordan J.L. Eaton-Bassiri A. Vaughan R. Hoose S.A. Lamb R.J. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4507-4519Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We wanted to assess whether ODNs such as 2006 can affect RIG-I activity in the cell-based assay (Fig. 2). When 2006 was transfected into 293T cells expressing RIG-I in the absence of an agonist, no significant change in reporter activity was observed (data not shown). However, when ODN2006 (2 μm) was transfected along with the agonist shR9, RIG-I-dependent reporter activity was reduced to less than 10% (Fig. 2A). Comparable inhibition of RIG-I signaling was observed with 2006c that lacks the CpG motif, demonstrating that the inhibition is independent of TLR9 signaling (data not shown). 2216 (containing CpG motifs) as well as 2216c (lacking CpG motifs) had inhibitory effects when they were transfected along with agonist shR9, confirming that the CpG motif is not required for ODNs to act as an antagonist to RIG-I (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Finally, 2006 or 2216 transfected into cells 8 h after shR9 had decreased inhibitory activity, suggesting that they compete with shR9 for recognition by RIG-I (Fig. 2A). Given that RIG-I signaling can depend on the agonist used, we examined whether ODNs can affect RIG-I activation by poly(I:C) (Fig. 2B). Although 2006 inhibited poly(I:C)-induced RIG-I signaling, 2216 lost its inhibitory activity. In fact, 2216 showed a modest increase in RIG-I signaling in the presence of poly(I:C). The addition of both the inhibitory 2006 and the non-inhibitory 2216 together with poly(I:C) resulted i"

The mutation of Trp(G8), an absolutely conserved residue in group II and III truncated hemoglobins, to Phe introduces two new Fe–CO conformers, both of which exhibit reduced electrostatic potentials. Computer simulations reveal that the structural perturbation is a result of the increased flexibility of the Tyr(CD1) and Leu(E11) side chains due to the reduction of the size of the G8 residue. Laser flash photolysis studies show that the G8 mutation induces 1) the presence of two new geminate recombination phases, one with a rate faster than the time resolution of our instrument and the other with a rate 13-fold slower than that of the wild type protein, and 2) the reduction of the total geminate recombination yield from 86 to 62% and the increase in the bimolecular recombination rate by a factor of 530. Computer simulations uncover that the photodissociated ligand migrates between three distal temporary docking sites before it subsequently rebinds to the heme iron or ultimately escapes into the solvent via a hydrophobic tunnel. The calculated energy profiles associated with the ligand migration processes are in good agreement with the experimental observations. The results highlight the importance of the Trp(G8) in regulating ligand migration in trHbO, underscoring its pivotal role in the structural and functional properties of the group II and III truncated hemoglobins.

Hemoglobins (Hbs) 3The abbreviations used are: Hb, hemoglobin; trHb, truncated hemoglobin; QM/MM, quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics.3The abbreviations used are: Hb, hemoglobin; trHb, truncated hemoglobin; QM/MM, quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics. have been discovered in organisms from virtually all kingdoms (1Egawa T. Yeh S.R. J. Inorg. Biochem... 2005; 99: 72-96Google Scholar, 2Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 871-874Google Scholar). The individual subunit of all Hbs consists of a polypeptide chain with 6–8 α-helical segments that fold around a heme group, which are conventionally labeled from A to H according to the linear sequence order. The proximal heme ligand is always a histidine residue at the F8 position. The distal ligand binding pocket is typically constructed from the B and E helices, the CD loop connecting them, as well as part of the G helix. The identities of several residues in the ligand binding pocket, especially the B10, E7, E11, CD1, and G8 residues, are important for the regulation of ligand binding and discrimination. As compared with mammalian globins, the distal residues of microbial Hbs are typically more polar, suggesting that the structures of these Hbs are tailored to perform functions other than dioxygen transport, as reviewed in the literature (1Egawa T.

Truncated Hbs (trHbs) are small globins, consisting of ∼110–140 amino acid residues, which are widely distributed in bacteria, eukaryotes, and higher plants. They form a unique cluster within the Hb superfamily (2Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 871-874Google Scholar, 4Wu G. Wainwright L.M. Poole R.K. Adv. Microb. Physiol... 2003; 47: 255-310Google Scholar). The major structural features of trHbs that distinguish them from the classical vertebrate globins are the unprecedented 2-over-2 α-helical sandwich fold (replacing the commonly seen 3-over-3 α-helical sandwich motif), the absence of the A-helix, and the presence of an extended loop substituting for most of the F-helix (2Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 871-874Google Scholar). On the basis of amino acid sequence analysis, three phylogenetic groups (trHb-I, trHb-II, and trHb-III) have been identified within the trHb family. trHbO is a trHb-II globin from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. trHbO is expressed throughout the bacterial growth phase (5Mukai M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Guertin M. Yeh S.R. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 3897-3905Google Scholar). The physiological function of trHbO remains unclear. trHbO contains 128 amino acid residues, with a molecular mass of 14.9 kDa (5Mukai M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Guertin M. Yeh S.R. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 3897-3905Google Scholar). Under solution conditions, trHbO exists as an equilibrium mixture of monomer and dimer (6Ouellet H. Juszczak L. Dantsker D. Samuni U. Ouellet Y.H. Savard P.Y. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Friedman J.M. Guertin M. Biochemistry.. 2003; 42: 5764-5774Google Scholar), which is sensitive to the ionic strength of the solvent. The B10, E7, E11, CD1, and G8 positions in trHbO are occupied by Tyr23, Ala44, Leu48, Tyr36, and Trp88, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1 (the Ala(E7) is not shown for clarity). One intriguing feature of trHbO is that a covalent bond between the phenyl oxygen of the Tyr(B10) and the Cϵ2 of the Tyr(CD1) was observed in six subunits of the dodecamer but not in the other six subunits, although in the latter, the aromatic side chain groups of the Tyr(B10) and the Tyr(CD1) are in close contact and in a similar orthogonal orientation (7Milani M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Ascenzi P. Guertin M. Bolognesi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2003; 100: 5766-5771Google Scholar). The importance of this covalent bond remains unknown. Resonance Raman spectroscopy combined with mutagenesis studies show that the Tyr(CD1), but not the Tyr(B10), is important in stabilizing the heme-bound CO in the CO complex of trHbO (5Mukai M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Guertin M. Yeh S.R. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 3897-3905Google Scholar). Additional findings demonstrate that, in addition to the Tyr(CD1), the Trp(G8) residue, which is highly conserved in the trHb-II and trHb-III family of proteins, also plays a critical role in ligand binding and stabilization (8Ouellet H. Milani M. LaBarre M. Bolognesi M. Couture M. Guertin M. Biochemistry.. 2007; 46: 11440-11450Google Scholar, 9Lu C. Egawa T. Mukai M. Poole R.K. Yeh S.R. Methods Enzymol.. 2008; 437: 255-286Google Scholar, 10Feis A. Lapini A. Catacchio B. Brogioni S. Foggi P. Chiancone E. Boffi A. Smulevich G. Biochemistry.. 2008; 47: 902-910Google Scholar). In this work, we aimed to investigate the role of the Trp(G8) residue in regulating ligand migration in trHbO, by using resonance Raman spectroscopy, nanosecond laser flash photolysis, and novel computer simulation methodologies. Computer simulations have been widely used to investigate ligand migration in proteins since late 1970s (11Elber R. Karplus M. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 1990; 112: 9161-9175Google Scholar, 12Tilton R.F.

Most of these studies involve molecular dynamics techniques based on simultaneous integration of Newton's equations of motion. Due to computer limitations, these simulations often require a certain degree of steering via a random (14Ludemann S.K. Lounnas V. Wade R.C. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 303: 797-811Google Scholar) or a directed bias force (15Marti M.A. Bidon-Chanal A. Crespo A. Yeh S.R. Guallar V. Luque F.J. Estrin D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 2008; 130: 1688-1693Google Scholar, 16Boechi L. Marti M.A. Bolognesi M. Luque F.J. Estrin D.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinformat.. 2008; 73: 372-379Google Scholar) in order to reach a microsecond time scale. In the current study, we employed a recently developed methodology, involving a stochastic ligand and protein perturbation algorithm coupled to protein structure prediction techniques, to model ligand migration in trHbO (17Borrelli K.W. Vitalis A. Alcantara R. Guallar V. J. Chem. Theory Comput.. 2005; 1: 1304-1311Google Scholar). Although this method cannot capture all of the atomic details that are accessible with conventional molecular dynamic methods, it provides an efficient alternative for the studies of ligand migration in proteins without adding any bias force. In addition, a mixed quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method was used to model the ligand dissociation. In that case, the Schrödinger equation is solved for the QM region, covering the atoms involved in the process of interest, whereas the MM region is described by a set of “solid” spheres, with point charges and classical force fields. The combined experimental and theoretical approaches allow the rationalization of the role of the Trp(G8) in regulating ligand migration in trHbO. The natural abundant gases, argon and CO were obtained from Tech Air (White Plains, NY). The isotopically labeled gas 13C16O was supplied by Icon (Mount Marion, NY). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The wild type and G8WF mutant of the recombinant trHbO were cloned, expressed, and purified to near homogeneity, as described elsewhere (5Mukai M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Guertin M. Yeh S.R. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 3897-3905Google Scholar, 18Couture M. Yeh S.R. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Ouellet Y. Rousseau D.L. Guertin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 11223-11228Google Scholar). The protein was buffered with 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4 in the presence of 50 μm EDTA. The deoxy derivative was prepared by first flushing the protein solution with argon gas for 1 h in a gas-tight cuvette, sealed with a rubber septum, followed by reduction with a 5-fold molar excess of sodium dithionite. The CO-bound derivative was prepared by either injecting CO-saturated solution with a gas-tight syringe into the deoxy protein solution or flushing the deoxy protein sample with CO gas for 1 h. The corresponding 13C18O-substituted samples were prepared by injecting the 13C18O-saturated solution with a gas-tight syringe into the dithionite-reduced protein. Optical absorption spectra were recorded by using a Shimadzu UV2100U spectrophotometer. Protein concentrations of 1–15 μm were used. All spectra were recorded at room temperature (∼25 °C). The resonance Raman measurements were carried out with previously described instrumentation (9Lu C. Egawa T. Mukai M. Poole R.K. Yeh S.R. Methods Enzymol.. 2008; 437: 255-286Google Scholar). Briefly, the laser line was focused on a quartz cuvette, constantly rotating at ∼6000 rpm to avoid photodamage of the sample. The scattered light was collected at right angles to the incident beam and focused on the entrance slit (100 μm) of a polychromator (Spex, Metuchen, NJ), where it was dispersed by a 1200-groove/mm grating and subsequently detected by a liquid nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). The 413.1 nm output from a krypton ion laser (Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA) was used as the excitation source unless otherwise indicated. A halographic notch filter (Kaiser Optical Systems Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) was used to eliminate the Rayleigh scattering. The Raman spectra were calibrated with indene for the 200–1700 cm-1 spectral region or acetone/potassium ferrocyanide for the 1700–2300 cm-1 spectral region. Optical absorption spectra were acquired before and after the Raman measurements to ensure the integrity of the samples. The Raman data were processed by GRAMS software (Galactic Industries Corp.). For the low temperature Raman measurement, the spectrum of the frozen sample kept in a Linkam THMS 600 temperature control stage was obtained with a Raman microscope system (LabRam from JY Horiba, Edison, NJ). Laser flash photolysis studies were carried out with the LKS.60 spectrometer system from Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leatherhead, UK), as described elsewhere (19Lu C. Egawa T. Wainwright L.M. Poole R.K. Yeh S.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 13627-13636Google Scholar). In that system, the second harmonic line at 532 nm from an Nd:YAG laser (Brillian B from Big Sky Laser, Bozeman, Montana), with a pulse duration of 5 ns and a maximum energy of 110 mJ/pulse, was used as the pump beam. The absorbance of the CO complexes at 532 nm was kept at ∼0.05–0.1. The output from a 150-watt xenon arc lamp, right angle to the photolysis beam, was used as the probe beam. The probe beam passed through a monochromator prior to reaching the quartz cuvette (4 × 10 mm with a 10-mm optical path) containing the sample; the light transmitted through the sample entered a second monochromator, which was synchronized with the first monochromator and was detected by a photomultiplier tube (IP28 from Hamamatsu Corp.). The signal from the photomultiplier tube was transferred to a digital oscilloscope (Infinium from Agilent Technologies) and then to a personal computer for subsequent analysis. Typically, six or seven kinetic traces were averaged to improve the signal/noise ratio. To measure the bimolecular rebinding kinetics of CO following photodissociation, the kinetics were measured as a function of CO concentration, which is kept significantly higher than the concentration of the protein (4.0–10.0 μm) to ensure pseudo-first order conditions. For the CO dissociation kinetic measurements, the reaction was initiated by injecting a small volume (50–60 μl) of concentrated dithionate-free CO-bound protein into a sealed quartz cuvette containing 900 μl of NO-saturated buffer at pH 7.4 (50 mm Tris with 50 μm EDTA). The CO dissociation kinetics were monitored as a function of time at 405 nm, since the spontaneous replacement of the heme-bound CO with NO is rate-limited by the dissociation of the CO. The PELE algorithm combines a steered stochastic approach with protein structure prediction methods, capable of projecting the migration dynamics of ligands in proteins. The PELE heuristic algorithm is based on consecutive iterations of three main steps. Ligand and/or Protein Perturbation—The procedure begins with the generation of a local perturbation in the ligand and/or in the protein. Ligand perturbation involves a translation and rotation of the center of mass of the ligand. Protein perturbation involves α-carbon displacement following an anisotropic network model approach (see below). Side Chain Sampling—The algorithm proceeds by placing all side chains local to the ligand using the algorithms designed by Prof. Jacobson (University of California, San Francisco). Energy Minimization—The last step in every move involves the minimization of a region including, at least, all residues local to the atoms involved in steps 1 and 2. These three steps compose a move that is accepted (defining a new minima) or rejected based on a Metropolis criterion for a given temperature. By increasing or decreasing the temperature, the energy gaps can be tuned in each stochastic transition. The collection of accepted steps forms a stochastic trajectory. Typically, a simulation involves several processors running multiple steps and sharing information toward addressing a common task, such as minimizing global energy or driving ligand far from a fixed point. The method and its initial tests have been published elsewhere (17Borrelli K.W. Vitalis A. Alcantara R. Guallar V. J. Chem. Theory Comput.. 2005; 1: 1304-1311Google Scholar). The data confirm the capability of this method for millisecond landscape exploration. In this study, we have introduced a novelty in the algorithm. We have included the option of an additional perturbation on the backbone, in order to produce a larger protein conformational sampling. The α-carbons are displaced based on one of the lowest eigenvectors obtained in an anisotropic network model approach, a simple model for normal mode analysis (20Bahar I. Atilgan A.R. Erman B. Folding Des.. 1997; 2: 173-181Google Scholar). The system is then minimized with a harmonic constraint on each displaced α-carbon. The magnitude of the displacement, the nature of the eigenvector, and the strength of the constraint are user-adjustable variables. The algorithm also computes each side chain energy before and after the anisotropic network model perturbation; it includes the more excited side chains, the ones experiencing a larger increase in energies as a consequence of the anisotropic network model move, in the side chain prediction step. The combination of ligand and backbone perturbations, coupled to a side chain prediction and unconstrained minimization, results in a more effective exploration of the protein energy landscape, capable of reproducing large conformational changes associated with ligand migration. The mixed QM/MM method joins together a quantum and a classical representation of different sectors of a complex condensed phase system (21Friesner R.A. Guallar V. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem... 2005; 56: 389-427Google Scholar). The reactive region of the active site is treated with a robust ab initio QM methodology, and the remainder of the protein is modeled at the MM level, providing the appropriate structural constraints and electrostatic and van der Waals interactions within the core reactive region. The QM/MM method contains all of the elements necessary to properly describe the potential energy surfaces relevant to a biochemical process of interest. All of the QM/MM calculations were performed with the QSite program, using the DFT B3LYP level of theory and 6-311G* basis set (and a lacv3p pseudopotential for the iron center). The quantum region included the heme group, the axial histidine, and the CO ligand. Starting with the crystal structure, Protein Data Bank Code 1NGK (chain L), protons were added, and all Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg residues were modeled in their ionic state. Based on local pKa, His-108 was doubly protonated; all other His residues were singly protonated at the δ-position. The system was solvated and equilibrated with a 14-Å layer of water molecules, on the basis of the procedure described elsewhere (22Guallar V. Borrelli K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 3954-3959Google Scholar). After equilibration, the system was ready for the QM/MM study. Along the QM/MM reaction coordinate, the oxygen atoms corresponding to the last layer of salvation water molecules were kept fixed. The ligand dynamics exploration was performed with the GBSA implicit solvation model (explicitly keeping all water molecules with two or more hydrogen bonds with protein atoms). The G8WF mutant was obtained by performing the Trp to Phe side chain replacement followed by four iterations of side chain prediction and minimization for all residues within 10 Å of the mutated residue. The side chain prediction, the minimization, and the protein setup were performed with the PLOP program (23Jacobson M.P. Friesner R.A. Xiang Z.X. Honig B. J. Mol. Biol... 2002; 320: 597-608Google Scholar). The Resonance Raman Spectra of the CO Complex—Previous resonance Raman studies of trHbO show that the deoxy form of trHbO has a typical five-coordinate high spin configuration (5Mukai M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Guertin M. Yeh S.R. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 3897-3905Google Scholar). In addition, the νFe-His mode was identified at 226 cm-1, indicating a staggered geometry of the proximal histidine with respect to the pyrrole nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin ring (24Samuni U. Ouellet Y. Guertin M. Friedman J.M. Yeh S.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 2004; 126: 2682-2683Google Scholar). Binding of CO to the deoxy derivative generates a stable six-coordinate low spin heme, with CO bound to the distal heme ligand binding site. To understand the role of Trp(G8) in ligand stabilization in trHbO, we have obtained the resonance Raman spectra of the CO-bound G8WF mutant with respect to the wild type protein. As shown in Fig. 2A, in the wild type protein, the bands at 526 and 1918 cm-1 are assigned to the νFe–CO and νC–O modes, respectively, as reported previously (5Mukai M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Guertin M. Yeh S.R. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 3897-3905Google Scholar). The mutation of the Trp(G8) to Phe causes the νFe–CO mode to split into two bands at 496 and 514 cm-1 (8Ouellet H. Milani M. LaBarre M. Bolognesi M. Couture M. Guertin M. Biochemistry.. 2007; 46: 11440-11450Google Scholar), which are associated with two νC–O modes at 1965 and 1938 cm-1, respectively. All of the CO-related modes shift to lower frequencies with the substitution of 12C16O with 13C18O (data not shown), confirming the assignments of these modes. In general, the structure of the Fe–C–O moiety in CO-bound heme proteins can be described as equilibrium between two extreme resonance structures. Fe−−C≡O+(I)↔Fe=C=O(II) When the distal environment is positively charged, structure I is disfavored over structure II. Consequently, the νFe–CO frequency increases, and the νC–O frequency decreases (9Lu C. Egawa T. Mukai M. Poole R.K. Yeh S.R. Methods Enzymol.. 2008; 437: 255-286Google Scholar, 25Yu N.-T. Kerr E.A.

Quillin M.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Biochemistry.. 1994; 33: 1433-1446Google Scholar). On this basis, the νFe–CO and νC–O frequencies are typically inversely correlated, as illustrated in Fig. 2C. In the inverse correlation plot, the data point associated with the wild type protein with νFe–CO/νC–O at 526 and 1918 cm-1 lies in the upper left corner, reflecting a positive electrostatic potential of the CO binding site. The mutation of the Trp(G8) to Phe causes the data point to shift along the correlation line to the lower right corner. One of the conformers of the G8WF mutant (denoted as the closed conformer, G8C), with νFe–CO/νC–O at 514 at 1938 cm-1, falls in the middle of the correlation line, whereas the other conformer (denoted as the open conformer, G8O), with νFe–CO/νC–O at 496 at 1965 cm-1, shifts to the lower right corner. The fact that these data points stay on the same inverse correlation line indicates that the structural changes in the distal pocket do not affect the electronic properties of the proximal heme ligand. The data shown in Fig. 2C highlight the important role of the Trp(G8) in ligand stabilization in trHbO. Like the Trp(G8), the Tyr(CD1), but not Tyr(B10), has been demonstrated to play a critical role in stabilizing the heme-bound CO (5Mukai M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Guertin M. Yeh S.R. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 3897-3905Google Scholar). The mutation of the Tyr(CD1) to Phe causes the νFe–CO/νC–O to shift to 515/1934 cm-1 (5Mukai M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Guertin M. Yeh S.R. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 3897-3905Google Scholar), similar to those of the closed conformation of the G8WF mutant. Taken together, the data suggest that the heme-bound CO in the wild type trHbO is stabilized by the Tyr(CD1) and Trp(G8) in a synergetic fashion via hydrogen-bonding interactions. It is conceivable that the CO ligand in the CD1YF mutant is stabilized by a hydrogen bond from the Trp(G8); conversely, that in the closed conformation of the G8WF mutant is stabilized by the Tyr(CD1). The presence of the additional open conformer in the G8WF mutant, in which the hydrogen bond from Tyr(CD1) is presumably missing, suggests that the replacement of the Trp(G8) with Phe increases the flexibility of the protein matrix, thereby allowing the Tyr(CD1) to change its conformation. The coexistence of more than one conformer in the CO complexes of other hemoglobins has been reported in the past (10Feis A. Lapini A. Catacchio B. Brogioni S. Foggi P. Chiancone E. Boffi A. Smulevich G. Biochemistry.. 2008; 47: 902-910Google Scholar, 19Lu C. Egawa T. Wainwright L.M. Poole R.K. Yeh S.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 13627-13636Google Scholar, 29Lu C. Mukai M. Lin Y. Wu G.

Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 837-842Google Scholar), but their molecular origin remains unclear. To further investigate the two conformers of the G8WF mutant of trHbO, we sought to examine their temperature dependence. As shown in Fig. 2B, the intensity of the 514 cm-1 mode significantly diminishes at low temperature (83 K), as compared with that obtained at room temperature (298 K), indicating that the open conformer is lower energy than the closed conformer. It is important to note that the intensity change is not a result of preferential photodissociation of the 514 cm-1 mode at low temperature, since the ν4 mode, which is sensitive to the coordination state of the heme, remains the same during the spectral acquisition (data not shown). On the other hand, the slight shift in the frequency of the remaining closed conformer from 514 to 519 cm-1 is plausibly a result of minor structural change in the Fe–C–O moiety. Association Kinetics of CO—Fig. 3A shows the kinetic trace obtained at 440 nm following the photodissociation of CO-bound wild type trHbO in 50 mm Tris buffer at pH 7.4. The transient spectrum obtained at 20 ns coincides with the difference spectrum between the deoxy and CO complex of trHbO obtained under equilibrium conditions (Fig. 4A), indicating that the spectral change is a result of CO-rebinding, and no other intermediate is involved in the kinetic process.FIGURE 4The CO association kinetics of the wild type (wt) and G8WF mutant of trHbO. A, shows the 20-ns transient absorption spectrum (circles) and the calculated difference spectrum between those of the deoxy and CO-derivative of trHbO. In B, the observed association rate constant is plotted as a function of CO concentration, and the indicated bimolecular association rate constants are determined from the slopes of the linear fits of the data. The inset is an enlarged view of the data of the wild type protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In general, when CO is photolyzed from the heme iron in a hemeprotein, the ligand can either rapidly rebind to the heme (i.e. the so-called “geminate recombination”) or migrate away from the distal pocket into the protein matrix, which subsequently returns to the distal pocket or escapes into the bulk solution. The CO escapes into the free solution and can ultimately rebind to the heme iron in a CO concentration-dependent manner (i.e. the so-called “bimolecular recombination”) (34Carver T.E. Rohlfs R.J. Olson J.S. Gibson Q.H. Blackmore R.S. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 20007-20020Google Scholar). The quantum yield for each recombination process depends on the dynamic properties of the protein matrix. The CO-rebinding kinetic trace of trHbO shown in Fig. 3A can be fitted with two sequential single exponential functions, with rates of 2.5 × 108 and 10 s-1. Since the fast rebinding kinetics is CO concentration-independent, it is assigned to the geminate recombination phase. The slow kinetics, on the other hand, is sensitive to the concentration of CO applied, as shown in Fig. 4B; it is attributed to the bimolecular rebinding phase. The bimolecular rebinding rate constant is determined to be 1.0 × 104m-1 s-1, based on the slope of the linear fit of the data, which is consistent with the published value (6Ouellet H. Juszczak L.

https://openalex.org/W2029888311,"Ceruloplasmin (Cp), a copper-containing protein, plays a significant role in body iron homeostasis as aceruloplasminemia patients and Cp knock-out mice exhibit iron overload in several tissues including liver and brain. Several other functions as oxidant, as antioxidant, and in nitric oxide metabolism are also attributed to Cp. Despite its role in iron oxidation and other biological oxidation reactions the regulation of Cp by reactive oxygen species (ROS) remains unexplored. Cp is synthesized in liver as a secretory protein and predominantly as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane-bound form in astroglia. In this study we demonstrated that Cp expression is decreased by an mRNA decay mechanism in response to extracellular (H2O2) or intracellular oxidative stress (by mitochondrial chain blockers rotenone or antimycin A) in both hepatic and astroglial cells. The promotion of Cp mRNA decay is conferred by its 3′-untranslated region (UTR). When chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was transfected as a chimera with Cp 3′-UTR in hepatic or astroglial cells, in response to either H2O2, rotenone, or antimycin A, the expression of CAT transcript was decreased, whereas expression of a 3′-UTR-less CAT transcript remained unaffected. RNA gel shift assay showed significant reduction in 3′-UTR-binding protein complex by ROS in both cell types that was reversed by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine suggesting that ROS affects RNA-protein complex formation to promote Cp mRNA decay. Our finding is not only the first demonstration of regulation of Cp by ROS by a novel post-transcriptional mechanism but also provides a mechanism of iron deposition in neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2139117025,"Fibronectin polymerization is essential for the development and repair of the extracellular matrix. Consequently, deciphering the mechanism of fibronectin fibril formation is of immense interest. Fibronectin fibrillogenesis is driven by cell-traction forces that mechanically unfold particular modules within fibronectin. Previously, mechanical unfolding of fibronectin has been modeled by applying tensile forces at the N- and C-termini of fibronectin domains; however, physiological loading is likely focused on the solvent-exposed RGD loop in the 10th type-III repeat of fibronectin (10FNIII), which mediates binding to cell-surface integrin receptors. In this work we used steered molecular dynamics to study the mechanical unfolding of 10FNIII under tensile force applied at this RGD site. We demonstrate that mechanically unfolding 10FNIII by pulling at the RGD site requires less work than unfolding by pulling at the N- and C- termini. Moreover, pulling at the N- and C-termini leads to 10FNIII unfolding along several pathways while pulling on the RGD site leads to a single exclusive unfolding pathway that includes a partially unfolded intermediate with exposed hydrophobic N-terminal β-strands – residues that may facilitate fibronectin self-association. Additional mechanical unfolding triggers an essential arginine residue, which is required for high affinity binding to integrins, to move to a position far from the integrin binding site. This cell traction-induced conformational change may promote cell detachment after important partially unfolded kinetic intermediates are formed. These data suggest a novel mechanism that explains how cell-mediated forces promote fibronectin fibrillogenesis and how cell surface integrins detach from newly forming fibrils. This process enables cells to bind and unfold additional fibronectin modules – a method that propagates matrix assembly."

https://openalex.org/W2031053226,"Rab GTPases are key regulators of intracellular vesicular transport that control vesicle budding, cargo sorting, transport, tethering, and fusion. In the inactive (GDP-bound) conformation, Rab GTPases are targeted to intracellular compartments where they are converted into the active GTP-bound form and recruit effector domain containing proteins. Rab6a has been implicated in dynein-mediated vesicle movement at the Golgi apparatus and shown to interact with a plethora of effector proteins. In this study, we identify minimal Rab6a binding domains of three Rab6a effector proteins: PIST, BicaudalD2, and p150glued. All three domains are >15-kDa fragments predicted to form coiled-coil structures that display no sequence homology to each other. Complex formation with BicaudalD2 and p150 has a moderate inhibitory effect on the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rab6a, while interaction with PIST has no influence on the hydrolysis rate. The effectors bind activated Rab6a with comparable affinities with Kd values ranging from high nanomolar to low micromolar. Transient kinetic analysis revealed that effectors bind to Rab6a in an apparent single-step reaction characterized by relatively rapid on- and off-rates. We propose that the high off-rates of Rab6·effector complexes enable GTPase-activating protein-mediated net dissociation, which would not be possible if the off-rate were significantly slower. Rab GTPases are key regulators of intracellular vesicular transport that control vesicle budding, cargo sorting, transport, tethering, and fusion. In the inactive (GDP-bound) conformation, Rab GTPases are targeted to intracellular compartments where they are converted into the active GTP-bound form and recruit effector domain containing proteins.

Vesicle-mediated transport between intracellular membrane-bound compartments of eukaryotic cells is essential for biosynthesis, secretion, endocytosis, cell differentiation, and growth. Transport involves sequestering of the cargo molecules into vesicles, vesicular budding, transport processes, and finally docking and fusion of vesicles at the target membrane (1Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol... 1999; 1: E17-E22Google Scholar). GTPases of the Rab family play a central role in the regulation of these processes by recruiting specific partner (effector) proteins (2Grosshans B.L. Ortiz D. Novick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2006; 103: 11821-11827Google Scholar). Like all other GTPases involved in regulatory processes, Rab proteins interconvert between active, GTP-bound forms that are capable of effector interactions, and inactive, GDP-bound forms. Rab GTPases, such as Rab1, 6, 8, 12, and 24, play a decisive role in the maintenance and function of the Golgi apparatus, which represents the most active site of transport of vesicles in the cell. The proteins BicaudalD2, p150glued, and PIST, R6IP1, mint3, Rab6IP2A, and B and Rabkinesin-6 had been identified as putative effectors of Rab6a. These proposed effector interactions suggest a role for Rab6a in COPI-independent Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or trans-Golgi network to ER retrograde transport, endosome to Golgi transport, and transition from metaphase to anaphase during mitosis (3Monier S.

Nature.. 1991; 350: 715-718Google Scholar). BicaudalD2, p150glued, and PIST belong to the class of proteins known as Golgins. Golgins associate with Golgi membranes either via transmembrane domains (Giantin), a myristylated Golgi reassembly stacking protein (GRASP)-adaptor domain (golgin-45, GM130) or through recruitment by small GTPases (Rab, Arf, Arl) (for a review see Ref. 10Short B. Haas A. Barr F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2005; 1744: 383-395Google Scholar). Golgins bind RabGTPases via their coiled-coil domains; however, a particular Golgin may have multiple Rab binding partners. It was previously found that Rab6a indeed binds to the Golgins BicaudalD1 and D2 as well as to p150glued, a subunit of dynactin, dynamitin, and PIST (11Short B. Preisinger C. Schaletzky J. Kopajtich R. Barr F.A. Curr. Biol... 2002; 12: 1792-1795Google Scholar). 2F. Barr, unpublished data.2F. Barr, unpublished data. Rab6a laden membranes were shown to be sufficient to recruit the dynein motor complex in vitro and in vivo. This recruitment is a critical step in microtubule-dependent retrograde trafficking. Furthermore, the positioning of the Golgi in the pericentriolar region of the cell is known to be dynein-dependent. These observations point to a central role of Rab6a in dynein-mediated vesicle movement at the Golgi. The plethora of potential Rab6a effector domains present in structurally and functionally diverse proteins raises the question as to the mechanistic and thermodynamic basis of their function and the order of their recruitment by Rab6a. Because Rab6a has the lowest GTPase activity among RabGTPases (12Bergbrede T. Pylypenko O. Rak A. Alexandrov K. J. Struct. Biol... 2005; 152: 235-238Google Scholar), it is expected to generate long-lived Rab6·effector complexes. This creates a potential problem for GAP-mediated regulation of Rab6 GTPase activity, because effectors and GAP molecules are predicted to recognize overlapping regions of the GTPase. In this study we identify the minimal Rab6a binding domains of PIST, BicaudalD2, and p150glued and characterize their association with Rab6a using a combination of spectroscopic and biochemical methods. We demonstrate that in all cases the Rab6a binding domains are encoded by small, contiguous domains that selectively bind the GTP-loaded GTPase. The affinity of the domains for Rab6a·GTP is in the low micromolar range, and the interactions are characterized by relatively fast off-rates. The latter feature probably allows regulation of complex stability by Rab6aGAP activity. Protein Expression and Purification—All proteins used in this study were expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) RIL strain using the T7-polymerase-based inducible expression vector systems of pET or pTriex origin (13Berrow N.S. Alderton D. Sainsbury S. Nettleship J. Assenberg R. Rahman N. Stuart D.I. Owens R.J. Nucleic Acids Res... 2007; 35: e45Google Scholar). Rab6a—The expression and purification of Rab6a was performed as described earlier (12Bergbrede T. Pylypenko O. Rak A. Alexandrov K. J. Struct. Biol... 2005; 152: 235-238Google Scholar). Briefly, a shake flask culture with LB-medium containing 125 mg/liter ampicillin was inoculated with an aliquot of an overnight culture to an A600 of ∼0.05. The culture was incubated at 37 °C and 100 rpm until the A600 reached ∼0.6 and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The culture was further incubated at 30 °C for 5–6 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. The bacterial pellet was washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and stored as frozen pellets at –80 °C. Effectors—For expression of Rab6a effectors, 5-liter cultures were grown as described above. After addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the culture was further incubated overnight at 18 °C with 130 rpm agitation, before harvesting the cells 10–15 h postinduction. Isolation of Rab6a Effectors—Effector constructs containing N-terminal His6 -or His6-GST 3The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; DTT, dithiothreitol; wt, wild type; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer. fusion tags were purified using a standard combination of affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Cleared bacterial lysate supplemented with 5 mm imidazole was loaded onto 5 ml of Ni-HisTrap FF crude affinity chromatography columns equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins bound nonspecifically to the column matrix were eluted with a buffer containing 25 mm imidazole. An additional washing step with 6 column volumes of wash buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS was applied in some cases. His6-tagged protein was eluted in 50-column volumes with a linear gradient from 25 to 200 mm imidazole. The affinity tag was removed by digestion with TEV protease during dialysis against cleavage buffer. Finally, size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 26/60 column equilibrated with GCF buffer was carried out at a flow-rate of 3 ml/min. Fractions containing the target protein were concentrated by membrane filtration and aliquots shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at –80 °C. Lysis buffer: 0.5× phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, 70 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm KCl, pH adjusted to 7.4 with HCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml anti-pain, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. Buffer A: 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm LiCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Buffer B: as buffer A + 500 mm imidazole. Wash buffer: 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm LiCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS. Cleavage buffer: 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm LiCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. GFC buffer: 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm LiCl, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm DTT. Preparation of Rab6a·Effector Complexes—For the preparation of Rab6a·effector complexes with p150 or PIST, 400 μm of the GTPase were mixed with 200 μm of the effector protein, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm GTP. The samples were incubated for 1 h on ice before resolving them on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated with 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm LiCl, 2% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm DTT. Complex-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, the pooled sample was concentrated by membrane filtration, and aliquots were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at –80 °C. Preparation of the Rab6a·BicaudalD2 Complexes—For preparation of the Rab6a·bicaudalD2 complexes, the GST-tagged minimal Rab6a binding domain of bicaudalD2 was incubated with GSH-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. 10 μm GTP was added prior to the addition of Rab6a, and the slurry was further incubated for 1 h. The slurry was then was poured into a column and unbound protein removed by washing with 3-column volumes of buffer containing 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm LiCl, 2% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm DTT. Following the addition of 1 mm GTP, the complex was TEV protease digested by incubating with protease overnight at 4 °C. The flow-through was further purified on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column equilibrated with 30 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 50 mm LiCl, 5 mm DTT, 10 μm GTP. Complex-containing fractions were concentrated by membrane-filtration followed by addition of GTP to a final concentration of 1 mm and shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at –80 °C. Analytical Gel Filtration—Analytical gel filtration chromatography was carried out using a HPLC 600S controller with 626 pump system and autosampler (717plus). Protein was detected using absorbance (2487 Dual λ Absorbance) and fluorescence (2475 Multi λ Fluorescence) detector (Waters). Depending on the calculated molecular weight of the analyzed protein, Superdex 75 HR10/30 and 200 HR10/30 gel filtration columns were used. The molecular weight proteins were calculated by interpolation on a calibration curve constructed using a molecular weight standard mixture (Bio-Rad). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—All measurements were carried out at 25 °C in reaction buffer containing 30 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 80 mm LiCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm nucleotide (GTP or GDP), using a VP-ITC and Thermovac system (MicroCal). Protein samples were dialysed extensively in the same batch of reaction buffer. All samples were degassed for at least 10 min at 25 °C prior to the experiment. The acquired titration data were corrected for the increase in volume and for the heat of dilution of the titrant. To correct for heat of dilution of the titrant, the heats evolved from injection of titrant into reaction buffer were subtracted from the heat of each injection. The data were analyzed using the manufacturer's software yielding the stoichiometry (N), the binary equilibrium association constant (Ka), and the enthalpy of binding (ΔH0). ΔH0 was assumed to be independent of the primary ligand concentration. From the relationship ΔG0 = –RTln Ka and the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, the standard free energy (ΔG0) and the standard entropy of association (ΔS0) were calculated. Stopped-flow Measurements—To determine the rates of association (kon) and of dissociation (koff) of Rab6a with its effectors a SF-61MX spectrofluorimeter with IS-2 Rapid Kinetics (High Tech Scientific) was used. Measurements were carried out at 25 °C in degassed buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm LiCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT. The fluorescence signal of the mant-group at 448 nm, induced by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from tryptophan excited at 295 nm, was monitored. In practice, a 420-nm cut-off filter was used in front of the emission monochromator. To improve the signal to noise ratio, data from eight to twelve measurements were averaged and used for further analysis. For the chosen experimental set-up, where the concentration of effectors was much greater than that of the Rab6a-mantGppNHp, association can be considered a pseudo-first order reaction and the fluorescence signal can be analyzed by fitting to a single exponential equation. Plotting the observed rate constants of the single exponential fit against the corresponding concentrations of the effector yielded a linear relationship over the usable concentration range in all cases. The association rate (kon) was derived from the slope of the linear fit, while the dissociation rate (koff) was calculated from the intercept with the ordinate. Based on kon and koff, the dissociation constants (Kd) for the interaction of Rab6a with its effectors were calculated. GTPase Activity Assay—GTP hydrolysis was assayed as a function of time by HPLC as described previously (12Bergbrede T. Pylypenko O. Rak A. Alexandrov K. J. Struct. Biol... 2005; 152: 235-238Google Scholar). Excess GTP from the storage buffer of the protein sample was removed by passing it over a NAP-5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm LiCl, and 5 mm DTT. The sample concentration was adjusted to 150 μm, and the hydrolysis reaction started by addition of 10 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C. 20-μl samples were withdrawn at appropriate time intervals and analyzed by HPLC. Identification and Recombinant Production of the Minimal Rab6a Binding Domains of PIST, BicaudalD2, and p150glued—To thermodynamically analyze the interactions of Rab6a with its effector proteins we first sought to identify the minimal Rab6a binding domains of PIST, bicaudalD2, and p150glued. Because no structural information on these Rab6a effectors is available, the expression constructs were designed either by a trial and error approach or were guided by secondary structure predictions and yeast two-hybrid analysis of PIST, p150glued, and bicaudalD2 interactions with Rab6a.2 Several Rab6a binding fragments of bicaudalD2 and PIST were designed based on limited proteolytic analyses of the Rab6a·effector complexes (supplemental materials). Fig. 1 provides a summary of the generated fragments, their solubility in E. coli and their interaction with GTP-loaded Rab6a. The Rab6a binding domains used in the described studies are named by the sequence source gene followed by the number of the construct. Construct 1 of bicaudalD2 was prepared as an N-terminal GST fusion protein to make the effector domain more amenable to concentration. The protein resulting from construct 14 of PIST was also subjected to heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy to assess its folding state (supplemental materials and Figs. S4A and S5).FIGURE 1Schematic overview of protein constructs tested for Rab6a-effector interactions. A, expression constructs of bicaudalD2 and their biochemical properties for Rab6a binding.

Although nucleotide-bound state-dependent interactions with some effector domains were observed, the efficiency of effector recovery was low (data not shown). We propose that the effector domains dissociated during the washing procedure due to binding of Rab6a to effectors with an affinity in the micromolar range. As an alternative method that allows detection of complex formation when the interaction affinities are in the micromolar range, we chose size exclusion chromatography. Injection of a mixture of effectors with GTP-bound Rab6aCΔ27 resulted in elution of the Rab6a·effector complexes at positions approximately corresponding to their calculated molecular weights when a 1:1 binding stoichiometry is observed (Fig. 3). The only exception was the full-length construct of the PIST·Rab6a complex, which displayed an apparent stoichiometry of 1:2. This may be due to the extended shape of the PIST molecule imparted by the coiled-coil segments resulting in lower retention times on a gel filtration column.FIGURE 3Gel filtration analysis of Rab6aCΔ27, Rab6a·effector domains, and their complexes. The panels depict elution profiles from Superdex 75 (panels A and B) and 200 10/30 (panels C–I) gel filtration chromatography columns loaded with the indicated proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the binding affinities and thermodynamics of the interactions of Rab6a with its effectors we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (14Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem... 1989; 179: 131-137Google Scholar, 15Indyk L. Fisher H.F. Methods Enzymol.. 1998; 295: 350-364Google Scholar). The advantage of this method is that it does not require modification of the protein molecules for measurements, as it measures the heat that is absorbed or generated by the system due to binding events. The heat generated or absorbed is proportional to the fraction of bound molecules. In these experiments, 100 μm solutions of PIST wt and p150-2 or a 50 μm solution of GST-bicaudalD2-1 were titrated with a 10-fold molar excess of Rab6a bound to either GDP or GTP (Fig. 4). As the injections proceeded, the size of the injection peaks decreased gradually, indicating saturation of binding sites. The reactions with the GTP-bound form of Rab6a were exothermic and the obtained titration data could be fitted to Kd values of 2.8, 2.2, and 1 μm, respectively. The binding stoichiometry for interaction of the effectors with Rab6a was found to be 1:1. No heat generation or absorption was detected when the GDP form of Rab6a was used confirming that the three proteins were specific for GTP-bound Rab6a, as observed for other GTPase effector molecules (Fig. 4). In the case of PIST and GST-bicaudalD2-1, binding of the effector protein to Rab6a·GTP is an enthalpy-driven process, with a negligible entropic contribution (supplemental Table S1). Because GST-bicaudalD2-1, PIST-14, and p150-12 remained in solution at higher concentrations, the reverse titrations could be performed. In these experiments a 10-fold molar excess of the effector domains (1 mm) were titrated into 100 μm Rab6a·GTP. The results are summarized in supplemental Table S1. The data indicate that all effector domains interact with the active form of Rab6a with comparable micromolar affinities, indicating they have the potential to compete with each other provided that they bind to the same or at least overlapping sites. Kinetic Analysis of Rab6a Interaction with Its Effectors—The ITC data provides an insight into the thermodynamics of protein-protein interactions, but does not yield information on the kinetics of such processes. To obtain the kinetic parameters of Rab6a-effector interactions, as well as to independently confirm the obtained affinity values, we employed fluorescent stopped-flow methodology. As a fluorescent reporter we chose the well characterized mant group conjugated to either GDP or GppNHp (a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue). The signal from FRET from tryptophan to the mant group of the nucleotide, i.e. exciting at 295 nm and measuring the fluorescence emission above 420 nm, proved to be most suitable for transient kinetic measurements. When mant-GppNHp loaded Rab6a was rapidly mixed with GST-bicaudalD2-1 in the stopped flow apparatus, a time-dependent increase of FRET-excited mant fluorescence was observed. To improve the signal to noise ratio, data from eight to twelve single measurements were averaged and used for further analysis. The data could be reliably fitted to a single exponential equation (Fig. 5). The experiments were repeated with increasing concentrations of the effector domain, and the resulting kobs data were plotted against the concentration. A linear fit to the data yielded an estimate of kon of 4.3 × 106m–1 s–1 assuming a one step association mechanism. The dissociation rate for the Rab6a-bicaudalD2 interaction was calculated from the intercept with the ordinate giving 6.4 s–1. Based on kon and koff, the dissociation constant (Kd) for binding of GST-bicaudalD2-1 to Rab6a was calculated to be 1.5 μm. However, the calculated Kd depends on the accuracy of the inferred dissociation rate. In an attempt to directly determine the dissociation rate a displacement experiment was carried out. For this, a preformed complex of Rab6a·mantGppNHp·bicaudalD2-1 was rapidly mixed with a large molar excess of unlabeled Rab6a. Displacement of the fluorescently labeled Rab6a from the complex can be observed in a time-resolved fashion by monitoring the change in the fluorescence signal (Fig. 5B). The observed change in the fluorescent signal was fitted to a single exponential equation, which yielded the dissociation rate of 6.2 s–1, in agreement with the initial estimate. Thus, the affinity determined using transient kinetic analysis is congruent with the estimated values obtained by ITC. These findings are in keeping with the idea that binding of Rab6a with the bicaudalD2 binding domain occurs in a simple, single-step, reversible binding mode. Of course, it cannot be excluded that an initial very weak binding interaction is followed by a rapid first order process, as seen for many protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions, but the evidence suggests that the interaction is probably not accompanied by large conformational changes in either of the components. The off-rate of the interaction is relatively high, possibly indicating that although the Rab6a·effector complex is long lived due to the very slow intrinsic hydrolysis rate, its dynamic nature enables stimulation of the GTPase activity of Rab6a by a specific GAP protein. The described approach was also used to characterize the interaction of Rab6a with PIST (Fig. 5C and Table 1). Confirming observations made in ITC experiments, a Kd value of 2.7 μm was derived from the transient kinetic experiments. Similar to the bicaudalD2 binding domain, the Rab6a-PIST interaction appears to be a single-step process. Interestingly, in contrast to other effectors, binding of p150-2 to Rab6a·mantGppNHp resulted in a concentration-dependent fluorescence quenching rather than enhancement (Fig. 5D). The affinity calculated from the measured rates was 2.4 μm.TABLE 1Kinetic constantsEffector constructk1k-1Kd×106m-1 s-1s-1×10-6mGST-bicaudalD2-14.36.41.5PIST wt1.02.62.7p150-27.818.52.4 Open table in a new tab Influence of Effector Domain Binding on the Hydrolysis Rate of Rab6a—Several Rab GTPases were reported to possess an altered hydrolytic activity when complexed to their effector proteins. Interaction of Rabphilin-3a with Rab3a was shown to have a weak stimulating effect on the intrinsic GTPase activity, while concurrently inhibiting GAP-stimulated hydrolysis (16Kishida S. Shirataki H. Sasaki T. Kato M. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 22259-22261Google Scholar). In a mechanism counteracting inactivation, other Rab-effector interactions reduce the intrinsic GTPase activity of the complex. This has been observed for Rab5a and Rabaptin-5 (17Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra M.C. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature.. 1996; 383: 266-269Google Scholar) as well as for Rab4a binding to Rabaptin-4 and -5 (18Nagelkerken B. Van A.E. Van R.M. Gerez L. Mohrmann K. Van U.N. Holthuizen J. Pelkmans L. Van Der S.P. Biochem. J... 2000; 346: 593-601Google Scholar). To assess whether similar effects can also be exerted on Rab6a by its effector domains we compared the rate of hydrolysis of Rab6a with that of preformed gel filtration chromatography-purified Rab6a·bicaudalD2-1, Rab6a·PIST, and Rab6a·p150-2 complexes. The samples were incubated at 25 °C over the course of 12 days and continuously analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 6). The decrease in protein-bound GTP follows a single-exponential time course that can be analyzed to yield the rate constant for the assumed first order reaction. Table 2 summarizes the rates for GTP hydrolysis of the different Rab6a-effector complexes.TABLE 2Hydrolysis ratesProtein complexHydrolysis rate×10-6 s-1Rab6a·p150-22.1Rab6a·bicaudalD2-12.5Rab6a·PISTwt5.4Rab6a5.8 Open table in a new tab Comparison of the observed hydrolysis rates of the GTPase complexes shows that the Rab6a effectors under investigation have different effects on Rab6 GTP hydrolysis. While binding of PIST appears to have only a limited influence, interaction with GST-bicaudalD2-1 or p150-2 leads to a decrease in the already low intrinsic hydrolysis activity of Rab6a by a factor of ∼2–3 (12Bergbrede T. Pylypenko O. Rak A. Alexandrov K. J. Struct. Biol... 2005; 152: 235-238Google Scholar). Because no protein degradation was observed for any of the proteins used in the assay, changes in the hydrolysis rates appear to be the result of changes in protein activity rather than altered protein levels. Conclusions—In this study, we have characterized three Rab6a effector domains derived from bicaudalD2, p150glued, and PIST. Similar to previously described effector proteins of other Rab GTPases, minimal Rab6a binding domains are composed of short contiguous coiled-coil segments (19Eathiraj S. Mishra A. Prekeris R. Lambright D.G. J. Mol. Biol... 2006; 364: 121-135Google Scholar, 20Eathiraj S. Pan X. Ritacco C. Lambright D.G. Nature.. 2005; 436: 415-419Google Scholar). Besides this proposed domain fold, the Rab6a binding domains do not share sequence similarity, indicating that they probably have different evolutionary origins. This is in contrast to the effectors of the endocytic RabGTPases: Rab5 and Rab22, where the effector domains have emerged via gene duplication. All three Rab6a effector domains bind to the active form of the GTPase with low micromolar affinity. This is similar to the affinity previously determined for the FIP3-Rab11 interaction (19Eathiraj S. Mishra A. Prekeris R. Lambright D.G. J. Mol. Biol... 2006; 364: 121-135Google Scholar). The binding mechanism appears to be simple and similar in all cases. Based on the transient kinetic analysis, the interactions are best described by a single-step mechanism and do not appear to involve large structural rearrangements in any of the interacting partners. This observation is in line with the rather rigid structure of a coiled-coil domain, where helices are wrapped around each other and do not allow large structural changes besides unwinding (21Lupas A.N. Gruber M. Adv. Protein Chem... 2005; 70: 37-78Google Scholar). The complexes formed are relatively dynamic and display high off-rates, suggesting that electrostatic interactions rather than hydrophobic interactions compose the interaction interface. Again, this observation is in agreement with the secondary structure prediction since coiled-coil structures are typically known to be highly polar at surfaces distinct from their hydrophobic dimer interface (21Lupas A.N. Gruber M. Adv. Protein Chem... 2005; 70: 37-78Google Scholar). The dynamic nature of the interactions presumably enables regulation of the complex stability by a Rab6a GAP that could induce a decay in the complex population by stimulating the otherwise slow GTP hydrolysis of Rab6a.

https://openalex.org/W1973053031,"The homeodomain transcription factor HoxA10 is maximally expressed in myeloid progenitor cells. Sustained HoxA10 expression during differentiation has been described in poor prognosis human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Consistent with this, engineered overexpression of HoxA10 in murine bone marrow induces a myeloproliferative disorder that progresses to AML over time. This murine model suggests that HoxA10 overexpression is sufficient for myeloproliferation but that differentiation block, and therefore AML, requires acquisition of additional mutations. In myeloid progenitor cells, HoxA10 represses transcription of genes that encode phagocyte effector proteins such as gp91PHOX and p67PHOX. Tyrosine phosphorylation of HoxA10 during myelopoiesis decreases binding to these target genes. In immature myeloid cells, HoxA10 also activates transcription of the DUSP4 gene that encodes Mkp2, an anti-apoptotic protein. HoxA10 binding to the DUSP4 promoter decreases during myelopoiesis. Therefore, both myeloid-specific gene repression and DUSP4 activation by HoxA10 decrease during myelopoiesis. This results in phenotypic differentiation and facilitates apoptosis as differentiation proceeds. HoxA10 is de-phosphorylated by SHP2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase in myeloid progenitors. This mechanism maintains HoxA10 in a nonphosphorylated state in immature, but not differentiating, myeloid cells. Constitutively active SHP2 mutants have been described in human AML, which dephosphorylate HoxA10 throughout myelopoiesis. In this study, we hypothesize that constitutive SHP2 activation synergizes with HoxA10 overexpression to accelerate progression to AML. Because both HoxA10 overexpression and constitutive SHP2 activation are found in poor prognosis human AML, these studies contribute to understanding biochemical aspects of disease progression in myeloid malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2145680582,"Integrins are important cell surface receptors that transmit bidirectional signals across the membrane. It has been shown that a conformational change of the integrin β-subunit headpiece (i.e. the β I domain and the hybrid domain) plays a critical role in regulating integrin ligand binding affinity and function. Previous studies have used coarse methods (a glycan wedge, mutations in transmembrane contacts) to force the β-subunit into either the open or closed conformation. Here, we demonstrate a detailed understanding of this conformational change by applying computational design techniques to select five amino acid side chains that play an important role in the energetic balance between the open and closed conformations of αIIbβ3. Eight single-point mutants were designed at these sites, of which five bound ligands much better than wild type. Further, these mutants were found to be in a more extended conformation than wild type, suggesting that the conformational change at the ligand binding headpiece was propagated to the legs of the integrin. This detailed understanding of the conformational change will assist in the development of allosteric drugs that either stabilize or destabilize specific integrin conformations without occluding the ligand-binding site.

This detailed understanding of the conformational change will assist in the development of allosteric drugs that either stabilize or destabilize specific integrin conformations without occluding the ligand-binding site. Allostery is important in the function of many signaling proteins (1Volkman B.F. Lipson D. Wemmer D.E. Kern D. Science.. 2001; 291: 2429-2433Google Scholar), including cell adhesion molecules, such as integrins (2Luo B.-H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol.. 2007; 25: 619-647Google Scholar). Integrins are large, heterodimeric molecules that transmit signals bidirectionally across the plasma membrane and regulate many biological functions, including wound healing, cell differentiation, and cell migration. The conformational changes associated with integrin activation and signaling have been studied structurally and functionally (3Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L.

Nature.. 2004; 432: 59-67Google Scholar). Integrins bind ligands at an interface between the α-subunit β-propeller domain and the β-subunit I domain in the integrin headpiece (2Luo B.-H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol.. 2007; 25: 619-647Google Scholar). An acidic residue in the ligand coordinates with a Mg2+ ion in a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). 5The abbreviations used are: MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; SASA, solvent-accessible surface area; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; LIBS, ligand-induced binding site. Remodeling of ligand-binding residues in the β I domain is allosterically linked to reorientation at its interface with the hybrid domain. Crystal structures of integrins have revealed open, liganded (8Xiao T. Takagi J. Wang J.-h. Coller B.S. Springer T.A. Nature.. 2004; 432: 59-67Google Scholar) and closed, unliganded (3Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science.. 2001; 294: 339-345Google Scholar) conformations of the integrin headpiece (Fig. 1). Movement of the β1-α1 and β6-α7 loops, which bind the MIDAS and ADMIDAS (adjacent to MIDAS) metal ions are coupled to movements of the α1 and α7 helices, which are adjacent to one another. Reshaping to the open conformation, which exhibits high affinity for ligand, is allosterically linked to C-terminal piston-like movement of the α7-helix. This linkage is critical for bidirectional propagation of conformational signals between the ligand binding pocket and other integrin domains. The orientation between the β I and hybrid domains appears to represent the critical “translator” for converting large scale interdomain rearrangements into local conformational changes within the β I domain that regulate affinity for ligand. The piston-like displacement of the α7-helix of the β I domain in the “open” crystal structure results in complete remodeling of the interface with the hybrid domain (8Xiao T. Takagi J. Wang J.-h. Coller B.S. Springer T.A. Nature.. 2004; 432: 59-67Google Scholar). Relative to the closed conformation, the hybrid domain swings out about 60°, resulting in a 70-Å displacement of the β-subunit knee away from the α-subunit knee. In the bent integrin conformation, the headpiece is in the closed conformation. After a switchblade-like extension at the integrin knees, the headpiece is found in both closed and open conformations (2Luo B.-H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol.. 2007; 25: 619-647Google Scholar). Extensive interfaces between the integrin headpiece and lower legs in the bent conformation are broken both by integrin extension and by hybrid domain swing-out; therefore, headpiece opening is less energetically costly in the extended than in the bent conformation. Conversely, headpiece opening favors integrin extension. This provides a mechanism in integrins for communicating activation signals between the ligand binding site in the headpiece and cytoskeletal protein-binding sites in the α and β-subunit cytoplasmic domains. Characterization of integrin variants has provided strong evidence linking the “open” state observed in crystal structures, the “extended” integrin morphology observed via negative staining electron microscopy, and the “high affinity for ligand” state observed in cell adhesion assays. One such study introduced an N-glycosylation site at the most acute region of the interface between the β I domain and the hybrid domain. The resulting glycan “wedge,” designed to shift the conformational balance toward the open state, was indeed found to increase ligand binding affinity (9Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Google Scholar, 10Luo B.-H. Strokovich K. Walz T. Springer T.A. Takagi J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 27466-27471Google Scholar). This study laid the groundwork for understanding the relationship of the hinge between the β I domain and the hybrid domain to ligand binding affinity. Here, we seek to extend the understanding of integrin function beyond the resolution afforded by the glycan wedge. We test the hypothesis that the detailed interactions that differ between crystal structures in the open and closed headpiece conformations indeed form the basis for allosteric regulation of ligand binding affinity and that shifting the equilibrium toward the open headpiece also shifts the equilibrium from the bent toward the extended conformation. Protein engineering can manipulate the energetic balance between alternate conformational states of proteins (11Ambroggio X.I. Kuhlman B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol.. 2006; 16: 525-530Google Scholar). We have applied computational design techniques to select single amino acid side chains that play an important role in the energetic balance between the open and closed conformations of αIIbβ3. A series of single-point mutants was rationally designed, with the goal of stabilizing the open conformation of αIIbβ3 relative to the closed conformation. These mutations were predicted to enhance both ligand binding affinity and integrin extension on the cell surface. Identification of Sites for Mutation—Identification of sites for mutation was carried out by using the Rosetta software package to compute differences in the environment of each residue associated with the switch between the open and closed conformations. The residue environments for residues in the closed state were taken as the median from values computed using each of four αvβ3 structures: Protein Data Bank codes 1jv2, 1l5g, 1m1x, and 1u8c (3Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science.. 2001; 294: 339-345Google Scholar, 4Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M.

The residue environments for residues in the open state were taken as the median from values computed using each of six αIIbβ3 structures: Protein Data Bank codes 1txv, 1ty3, 1ty5, 1ty6, 1ty7, and 1tye (8Xiao T. Takagi J. Wang J.-h. Coller B.S. Springer T.A. Nature.. 2004; 432: 59-67Google Scholar). In all cases, the range of residues considered was Pro57-Asp432. After the mutational studies were completed, five of these open structures were rerefined, and four further ones were reported: Protein Data Bank codes 2vc2, 2vdk, 2vdl, 2vdm, 2vdn, 2vdo, 2vdp, 2vdq, and 2vdr (13Springer T.A. Zhu J. Xiao T. J. Cell Biol.. 2008; 182: 791-800Google Scholar). Moreover, a higher resolution and better refined closed structure of αIIbβ3 was reported. 6Zhu, J., Luo, B. H., Xiao, T., Zhang, C., Nishida, N., and Springer, T. A. (2008) Mol. Cell 32, 849-861. The environment of each selected residue was computed retrospectively for these structures as well, by using only the newer or rerefined structures. For cases in which more than one subunit was present in the asymmetric unit, calculations were averaged over all independent subunits. This retrospective analysis shows no qualitative differences to the data collected using the smaller set of structures (Table 1), except for the quality of packing around Leu138 and Glu206 (the new open αIIbβ3 structures exhibit better packing at these positions than the new closed structures). The electron density around these two residue environments is not well resolved in the newer closed structures, however, which may explain these differences. Pro85 was originally selected as a site for mutation but has been discarded from the current study because it was assigned as cis in open αIIbβ3 and trans in closed αVβ3 but subsequently cis in closed αIIbβ3; furthermore, the mutation of this cis-Pro to Gly resulted in a lack of expression (data not shown). The side chain solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) was computed using a 1.4-Å probe to search for sites buried in the closed state but exposed in the open state.TABLE 1Median value of quantifiers computed from multiple Protein Data Bank structures for the open and closed statesQuantifierOpen state structures used in designing mutants (6Takagi J.

This metric has proven effective at detecting packing defects, since holes lead to an increase in the accessible surface area available to a small probe. 7P. Bradley, personal communication. Plasmid Construction, Expression, and Immunoprecipitation—Plasmids coding for full-length human αIIb and β3 were subcloned into pEF/V5-HisA and pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (+), respectively (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell.. 2002; 110: 599-611Google Scholar). Single-residue substitutions of β3 were carried out using site-directed mutagenesis. Constructs were transfected into CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) using a Fugene transfection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected CHO cells were established as described (9Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Google Scholar). The expression levels of αIIb and β3 were detected by flow cytometry staining with the following monoclonal antibodies: 10E5 (anti-αIIb mAb, kindly provided by B. S. Coller, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY) (15Coller B.S. Peerschke E.I. Scudder L.E. Sullivan C.A. J. Clin. Invest.. 1983; 72: 325-338Google Scholar), 7E3 (anti-β3 mAb), and AP3 (nonfunctional anti-β3 mAb, American Type Culture Collection), respectively. Soluble Ligand Binding—The activating anti-αIIb mAb PT25-2 was a generous gift from M. Handa (Keio University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan) (16Tokuhira M. Handa M. Kamata T. Oda A. Katayama M. Tomiyama Y. Murata M. Kawai Y. Watanabe K. Ikeda Y. Thromb. Haemost.. 1996; 76: 1038-1046Google Scholar). Soluble binding of FITC-labeled human fibrinogen (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and ligand mimetic IgM PAC-1 (BD Biosciences) was determined as described (9Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells suspended in 20 mm Hepes-buffered saline (pH 7.4) supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose and 1% bovine serum albumin were incubated with FITC-conjugated human fibrinogen or PAC-1 in the presence of either 5 mm EDTA; 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 1 mm Mn2+; 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+ plus 10 μg/ml activating mAb PT25-2; or 1 mm Mn2+ plus 10 μg/ml PT25-2 at room temperature for 30 min. For PAC-1 binding, cells were washed and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgM on ice for another 30 min before being subjected to flow cytometry. Cells were also stained in parallel with anti-β3 mAb AP3 followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Binding activity is presented as the percentage of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of PAC-1 or fibrinogen staining, after background subtraction of the staining in the presence of EDTA, relative to the MFI of the AP3 staining. Cell Adhesion—Cell adhesion on immobilized human fibrinogen was assayed using cellular lactate dehydrogenase (17Zhu J. Carman C.V. Kim M. Shimaoka M. Springer T.A. Luo B.-H. Blood.. 2007; 110: 2475-2483Google Scholar). Briefly, cells suspended in Hepes-buffered saline supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose and 1% bovine serum albumin and either 1 mm EDTA or 1 mm Ca2+ plus 1 mm Mg2+ were added to flat bottom 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells/well) that had been precoated with different concentrations of fibrinogen and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, wells were washed three times with Hepes-buffered saline supplemented as indicated above. Remaining adherent cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100, and lactate dehydrogenase activity was assayed using the Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (LDH) (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ligand-induced Binding Site (LIBS) Epitope Expression—Anti-LIBS mAb AP5, LIBS1, and D3 were kindly provided by M. H. Ginsberg (University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA) and L. K. Jennings (University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN). LIBS epitope expression was determined as described previously (9Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Google Scholar). In brief, transfected cells suspended in Hepes-buffered saline supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose and 1% bovine serum albumin were incubated with or without 50 μm Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro peptide (GRGDSP) in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ plus 1 mm Mg2+ and 10 μg/ml anti-LIBS antibodies or control X63 IgG. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, cells were washed and stained with FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG on ice for 30 min. The stained cells were subjected to flow cytometry, and LIBS epitope expression was expressed as the percentage of MFI of anti-LIBS antibody after subtraction of MFI of the control X63 IgG, relative to MFI of the conformation-independent anti-β3 mAb AP3 after subtraction of the same control. Rationale for Mutations to Stabilize β3 Integrin in the Open State—Initally, conventional computational design methodologies (18Korkegian A. Black M.E. Baker D. Stoddard B.L. Science.. 2005; 308: 857-860Google Scholar) were applied to collect a series of mutations predicted to be stabilizing for each of several open β3 state integrin structures. Incorporation of a predicted stabilizing mutation from one open state structure onto a different open state structure, however, seldom proved stabilizing; this was an indication that the design methodology was too sensitive to structural details to be useful for this application. For this reason, mutations at each site were selected as per the rationale described below. Computational design was based on multiple examples of β3 integrin structures in each of the closed and open conformations (Table 1). Changes in residue environments as measured by SASA or SASApack (see “Materials and Methods”) between closed and open structures were used to identify sites of mutation. Due to the moderate resolution of the crystal structures used (Bragg spacings for these structures range from 2.7 to 3.3 Å), emphasis was placed on disruption of specific stabilizing interactions in the closed conformation rather than design of new stabilizing interactions in the open conformation. Residues near the fibrinogen-binding site were not considered. Arg352 (β I-Hybrid Interface)—The solvent-accessible surface area of Arg352 increases considerably in switching from the closed to the open state (Table 1). At the C-terminal end of the α7-helix of the β I domain, Arg352 appears to play a critical role in stabilizing the closed state, in which it is fully occluded from solvent and forms a series of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2a). After the switch to the open state, however, the α7-helix unwinds just enough that this side chain becomes largely exposed and forms a single surface-exposed hydrogen bond that caps the C terminus of the α7-helix (Fig. 2b). In order to destabilize the closed state with minimal disruption of the open state, a glutamate was introduced at this position. Ser243 (β I-Hybrid Interface)—The solvent-accessible surface area of this side chain near the hinge region was also found to increase upon switching from the closed to open state (Table 1). In the closed state, this partially buried serine side chain faces the α7-helix and occupies a small cavity below the plane of the side chain of Arg352 (described above) (Fig. 2c). This cavity is sterically bounded by Tyr110 and Phe421, shown in the fore-ground of Fig. 2c (in stick representation). The relocation of the α7-helix and release of Arg352 associated with the transition to the open conformation, meanwhile, expose this side chain to solvent (Fig. 2d). Additionally, Tyr110 and Phe421 have shifted to where they are no longer visible in the view presented (Fig. 2d). In order to take advantage of the tight steric constraints of the low affinity state, aspartate and glutamate were each introduced in place of this serine. Leu138 (β I Domain)—The SASApack value computed for this leucine side chain in the closed conformation, about zero, showed that this residue was packed in an environment similar to that of an average leucine in the Protein Data Bank (Table 1). After the transition to the open conformation, however, this side chain was much less well packed than the Protein Data Bank average for leucine (Table 1). Examination of the surrounding side chains shows that packing considerations are responsible for this difference. In the closed state, this inward facing leucine side chain fits snugly into a pocket that exactly complements the shape of the side chain (Fig. 2e). Upon transition to the open conformation, however, the α1-helix slides relative to the rest of the β I domain, such that this side chain fits into a pocket formed by a different set of side chains. This pocket exhibits much less shape complementarity toward the leucine side chain (Fig. 2f); in particular, a void remains near the leucine C-β atom, which would be filled by substitution of a β-branched amino acid at this position. To improve the packing of the open conformation while disrupting the packing of the closed conformation, this position was mutated to isoleucine. Lys417 (Hybrid Domain)—A difference in SASA between the open and closed conformations was observed for this lysine side chain (Table 1), which is located on the outward facing side of the βF-strand of the hybrid domain. In the closed state, the βF-βG loop adopts a noncanonical conformation, allowing it to pack against the α5-helix of the β I domain. The backbone carbonyl groups in this loop face inward, allowing one of these to form a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Lys417. This lysine side chain also forms a hydrogen bond to Asn303, which in turn acts as a “capping residue” on the C-terminal end of the α5-helix (Fig. 2g). The hinge motion involved in the transition to the open conformation results in a complete loss of the interactions between the βF-βG loop and the β I domain, exposing the outward facing side chains on the βF-strand of the hybrid domain (including Lys417). The conformation of the βF-βG loop relaxes, allowing the backbone to form hydrogen bonds to solvent (Fig. 2h). Given the relative unimportance of the detailed interactions in the open conformation (further supported by the higher crystallographic B-factors in this state), “charge reversal” mutations of Lys417 to aspartate and glutamate were introduced to disrupt the hydrogen bonds stabilizing the βF-βG loop in the closed conformation. Glu206 (β I Domain)—Although the most obvious structural rearrangement of the β I domain takes place in the α1- and α7-helices, a very subtle twist occurs in the α2-helix as well (8Xiao T. Takagi J. Wang J.-h. Coller B.S. Springer T.A. Nature.. 2004; 432: 59-67Google Scholar). Comparison of the quality of packing in both states via SASA-pack (see “Materials and Methods”) brought to light a subtle difference in this region (Table 1). Although the aliphatic portion of the Glu206 side chain packs snugly against Val193 and Leu194 in the closed conformation (Fig. 2i), this interaction is lost in the open conformation (Fig. 2j). This small decrease in packing density led to the hypothesis that introduction of a β-branched amino acid in place of this glutamate could be accommodated in the open conformation but would prove greatly destabilizing to the closed conformation. Mutations to isoleucine and threonine were therefore introduced in place of this glutamate. In all, eight point mutants were selected at five sites: R352E, S243D, S243E, L138I, K417D, K417E, E206I, and E206T. As shown in Fig. 1, these sites are not restricted to the hinge region connecting the β I and hybrid domains; rather, they span the pathway that transmits the conformational change from the cell surface to the fibrinogen-binding site. Each of these point mutations was tested independently to gauge its effect on expression and ligand binding. Expression of the Mutant αIIbβ3 in 293T Cells—To determine whether these mutant β3 integrins could be expressed with the αIIb-subunit, we transiently transfected the eight αIIbβ3 mutants into 293T cells. Two anti-β3 antibodies, 7E3 and AP3, and an αβ complex-dependent anti-αIIb antibody, 10E5, were used to monitor expression on the cell surface. All three antibodies gave similar results (Fig. 3A). Three mutants (L138I, E206I, and S243D) were expressed at wild-type levels. Four mutants (E206T, S243E, K417E, and K417D) were expressed at levels lower than that of the wild type. The remaining mutant, R352E, was not expressed at detectable levels. Five Mutants Have Enhanced Ligand Binding Affinity—The seven expressed mutants were tested for ligand binding in 293T transfectants. In all experiments measuring binding of the ligand-mimetic antibody PAC-1 or soluble fibrinogen, binding was expressed relative to αIIbβ3 surface expression to correct for differing amounts of cell surface expression by the mutants. In the presence of Ca2+, wild type αIIbβ3 bound very little ligand-mimetic PAC-1 antibody, whereas the presence of Mn2+ and activating mAb PT25-2 greatly increased binding (Fig. 3B). In contrast to wild type, five of the seven mutants, L138I, E206T, S243E, K417E, and K417D, bound PAC-1 in Ca2+ (Fig. 3B). Binding in Ca2+ was comparable with that in activating conditions and with activated wild-type. We have previously observed that mutations that stabilize integrins in the high affinity, extended conformation lead to decreased cell surface expression, presumably because the bent conformation is more efficiently processed and transported to the cell surface (9Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. Takagi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 2403-2408Google Scholar). Consistent with the tendency of activating mutations to decrease surface expression, three of five activating mutations, E206T, K417E, and K417D, decreased surface expression, whereas the two nonactivating mutations, E206I and S243D, had no effect on surface expression (Fig. 3). However, the L138I and S243E mutations were activating while having no or little effect on surface expression. To further characterize the five high affinity mutants, stable CHO-K1 cell transfectants were established, and clones with similar expression of wild-type and mutant αIIbβ3 were selected. Soluble PAC-1 (Fig. 4A) and fibrinogen (Fig. 4B) binding showed that wild type αIIbβ3 bound ligands only when stimulated by Mn2+ and/or PT25-2. By contrast, the five mutants bound ligands with significant higher capability in the presence of Ca2, confirming that all five mutations activated integrins for ligand binding (Fig. 4, A and B). In the presence of Mn2+ and PT25-2, all mutations and wild-type bound ligands maximally. The affinity state of the wild type and mutants was further assessed by cell adhesion assays on immobilized fibrinogen. In contrast to soluble ligand binding, at coating concentrations above 5 μg/ml, wild type cells mediated efficient adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen even in the absence of activation (Fig. 4C). All mutant cells adhered to immobilized fibrinogen at lower coating concentrations than wild-type, and two mutants, K417E and K417D, even adhered to the substrate at 1 μg/ml coating concentrations. Mutations That Enhanced Ligand Binding Stabilized Integrins in the Extended Conformation—Activation and/or ligand binding change the conformation of αIIbβ3, resulting in the exposure of neoepitopes called LIBS. We investigated the conformation of the mutants with three different LIBS antibodies, which bind to various sites in the β3-subunit (Fig. 5). Under basal conditions in Ca2+, all mutants showed increased expression of the D3 (anti-β3 residues 422-490) (19Kouns W.C. Wall C.D. White M.M. Fox C.F. Jennings L.K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1990; 265: 20594-20601Google Scholar) and LIBS1 (anti-β3 residues 422-690) (20Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R. Ruggeri Z. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 1995; 270: 11947-11954Google Scholar) epitopes and, with the exception of S243E, showed increased expression of the AP5 (anti-β3 residues 1-5) (20Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R. Ruggeri Z. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 1995; 270: 11947-11954Google Scholar) epitope. Thus, the equilibrium is shifted to a more extended conformation in the five mutant receptors with higher affinity for ligand. We computationally designed mutations that energetically favor the open, high affinity conformation of the β3 integrin headpiece. Five of the eight designed mutations bound ligands much better than wild type. More"

Although methods for flow cytometric detection of phosphoproteins in hematopoeitic progenitors and mature cells are available, analogous protocols for HSC are lacking. We present a robust method to study intracellular signaling in immunophenotypically-defined murine HSC/progenitor cell (HPC)-enriched populations. Using this method, we uncover differences in the response dynamics of several phosphoproteins representative of the Ras/MAP-Kinase(K), PI3K, mTOR and Jak/STAT pathways in HSC/HPCs stimulated by Scf, Thpo, as well as several other important HSC/HPC agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2059523765,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a potent regulator of tissue homeostasis and can act as both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter. The ability to induce cell cycle arrest is a major component of the tumor suppressor function of TGF-β. Lung, mammary, and skin epithelial cells exhibit a common minimal cytostatic program in response to TGF-β signaling involving the repression of the growth-promoting factors c-MYC, Id1, Id2, and Id3. Loss of c-MYC expression is a pivotal event in this process, resulting in derepression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2B (p15) and ultimately leading to growth arrest. It is not clear, however, which responses are necessary for TGF-β-mediated growth arrest in other cell types. Here, in human Burkitt lymphoma cells transformed by deregulated c-MYC expression, we demonstrate that efficient TGF-β-induced cytostasis can occur despite both maintenance of c-MYC levels and a lack of p21 and p15 induction. TGF-β treatment also results in induction, rather than repression, of Id1 and Id2 expression. In this context, growth arrest correlates with transcriptional repression of E2F-1, and overexpression of E2F-1 in Burkitt lymphoma cells largely overcomes the TGF-β-mediated G1 arrest phenotype. These data indicate that deregulation of c-MYC in lymphoma cells does not overcome the tumor suppressor function of TGF-β and that repression of E2F-1 transcription is sufficient for the efficient induction of cytostasis.

This family of cytokines affects a multitude of cellular processes including homeostasis, angiogenesis, migration, and differentiation. TGF-β has dual roles in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter in a context-dependent manner. The tumor promotion function of TGF-β only occurs following subversion of its normal tumor suppressor activity, which, in many cell types, involves regulating cell proliferation through the potent induction of cytostasis (1Pardali K. Moustakas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 21-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). TGF-β-mediated cytostasis is induced, at least in part, by Smad-dependent regulation of TGF-β target genes involved in cell cycle control. Progression through the cell cycle from G1 to S phase is dependent on cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. CDK4 and CDK6 bind cyclin D, whereas CDK2 associates with cyclin E. These kinases phosphorylate members of the pRB family of proteins (pocket proteins) to regulate their ability to bind E2F transcription factors, and ultimately, to control the function of E2F proteins in gene activation and repression. Loss of pRB function confers resistance to TGF-β (2Schwarz J.K. Bassing C.H. Kovesdi I. Datto M.B. Blazing M. George S. Wang X.F. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The TGF-β-induced cytostatic transcriptional program shared by lung, mammary, and skin epithelial cells involves the induction of the CDK inhibitor genes p21Cip1/Waf1 and p15Ink4b. Previous studies have indicated that a lack of p15 will not, by itself, result in a defective cytostatic response to TGF-β, suggesting that p15 induction alone is not sufficient for growth arrest (3Iavarone A. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 387: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 4Latres E. Malumbres M. Sotillo R. Martín J. Ortega S. Martín-Caballero J. Flores J.M. Cordón-Cardo C.

A. 2001; 98: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, TGF-β signaling also results in the transcriptional repression of the growth-promoting transcription factor genes c-myc, Id1, Id2, and Id3 (6Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar), the key event in this cytostatic response being the transcriptional repression of c-myc. Artificially avoiding c-MYC down-regulation prevents both TGF-β-mediated p15 induction and TGF-β-mediated cell cycle arrest (7Warner B.J. Blain S.W. Seoane J. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, keratinocytes can be rendered insensitive to the gantiproliferative effects of TGF-β by activating an estrogen-inducible form of c-MYC (mycER) (8Alexandrow M.G. Kawabata M. Aakre M. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3239-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), whereas the ability to repress c-MYC is selectively lost in transformed breast cancer cells (5Chen C.R. Kang Y.B. Massague J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The mechanism of transcriptional repression of c-myc by TGF-β has been well characterized. Following TGF-β signaling, a preformed cytoplasmic complex comprising activated receptor-regulated Smad3, the pRB family co-repressor p107, and E2F-4 accumulates in the cell nucleus with Smad4. The Smad3,4-p107-E2F-4 complex is recruited to a transcriptional inhibitory element adjacent to E2F binding sites within the c-myc promoter (5Chen C.R. Kang Y.B. Massague J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 9Chen C.R. Kang Y. Siegel P.M. Massague J.

Biol. 2004; 24: 2546-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and inhibits transcription. Decreased c-MYC expression then directly impacts on transcription of the p21 and p15 CDK inhibitor genes because the promoters of both genes are repressed by c-MYC. Repression of p15 occurs by direct interaction of c-MYC with MIZ-1, thereby inhibiting MIZ-1-mediated activation of the p15 promoter (12Seoane J. Pouponnot C. Staller P. Schader M. Eilers M. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 13Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In addition, c-MYC directly binds to Smad2 and Smad3, preventing their functional cooperation with Sp1 and further interfering with p15 transcription (14Feng X.H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 15Feng X.H. Liang Y.Y. Liang M. Zhai W. Lin X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, when c-MYC expression levels decrease following exposure of the cell to TGF-β, repression is relieved, and at the same time, MIZ-1 is free to interact with activated Smad-Sp1 complexes to fully activate p15 transcription. Similarly, TGF-β signaling activates p21 transcription via a diverse range of factors acting at the promoter and enhancer region (1Pardali K. Moustakas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 21-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Activation is inhibited by c-MYC binding to the promoter via its interaction with Sp1. In many cell types, therefore, TGF-β and c-MYC functionally oppose one another, and TGF-β-mediated repression of c-MYC is essential for derepression of genes involved in the cytostatic response. We and others have shown previously that TGF-β potently induces either apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in human Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells (16Inman G.J. Allday M.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1567-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). BLs arise following translocation of the c-myc locus to the enhancer region of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus (t(8;14)), resulting in overexpression of c-MYC (17Madisen L. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2212-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). At present, the mechanism of TGF-β-mediated cell cycle arrest induced in these cells is unknown. Because the chromosomal translocation event deregulates c-myc expression, we hypothesized that TGF-β may not be able to repress c-MYC as part of the cytostatic program in these cells. Indeed, here we show that efficient cell cycle arrest in human BL cells is entirely independent of the minimal epithelial cytostatic program induced by TGF-β. G1 arrest occurs in the absence of c-MYC, Id1, and Id2 repression, and interestingly (because loss of the p21 (18Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3698-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or p15 response is often associated with resistance to TGF-β-induced growth arrest), without induction of either p21 or p15. Inhibition of progression through G1-S phase by TGF-β correlated instead with transcriptional repression of the E2F-1 gene, whereas overexpression of E2F-1 largely overcame the ability of TGF-β to induce G1 arrest in BL cells. Our data support the conclusion that inhibition of E2F-1 is minimally required for induction of cytostasis and suggests that TGF-β can still effectively exert tumor suppressor function in cells lacking c-MYC, p15, and p21 responses. Cell Lines, Reagents, and Treatments—CA46 Burkitt lymphoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in 10% CO2. For TGF-β treatment time courses, cells were seeded at 3 × 105/ml and cultured overnight prior to treatment with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Peprotech). HaCaT epithelial cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Inhibition of protein synthesis was carried out by 2 h of pretreatment with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) and anisomycin (100 μm) (Sigma) prior to TGF-β addition. Inhibition of transcription was carried out by 1 h of pretreatment of cells with 2.5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma). Plasmids—Promoter luciferase reporter constructs were generated by PCR of a region of human genomic DNA spanning the E2F-1 transcription start site from –1808 to +9 using high fidelity Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and the following primers: forward, 5′-tgtgcccatttgaaactaagg-3′, and reverse, 5′-aaagtcccggccacttttac-3′. The product was cloned into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen) and subcloned into pGL3-basic (Promega) using MluI/XhoI restriction enzyme digests. Constructs were sequenced prior to use. pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1-E2F-1 were kindly provided by Professor Kevin Ryan, The Beatson Institute. Transfection of BL Cells and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—5 × 106 CA46 cells were transfected in triplicate with 2 μgof reporter plasmid and 1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase using an Amaxa nucleofector as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were incubated overnight before being re-fed with medium with or without TGF-β. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was assessed after 8 h as described previously (19Spender L.C. Whiteman H.J. Karstegl C.E. Farrell P.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1873-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Stable cell pools were generated by transfection with 5 μgof DNA followed by selection with 500 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—Cells were seeded overnight at 3 × 105/ml in 96-well plates and then cultured for up to 48 h with and without TGF-β. Cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine, and the amount incorporated into cell DNA was measured as described previously (20Spender L.C. Cannell E.J. Hollyoake M. Wensing B. Gawn J.M. Brimmell M. Packham G. Farrell P.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4678-4688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Radioimmune precipitation buffer lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing p15 (sc-612), p21 (sc-397), p57 (sc-1040), c-MYC (9E10) (sc-40), ID1 (sc-488), ID2 (sc-489), ID3 (sc-490), ATF-3 (sc-188), CDK2 (sc-163), CDK4 (sc-260), and pRB (sc-50) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against phosphorylated-Smad2 (Ser-465/476), phosphorylated-Smad3 (Ser-433/ 435), and phosphorylated-S6 kinase (Cell Signaling), and mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against E2F-1 (Upstate Biotechnology), Smad2/3 (BD Biosciences), and actin (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Dako) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig (Dako). Bound immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry—Cells were fixed in 80% ethanol and labeled with propidium iodide. At least 104 events were analyzed for DNA content using a flow cytometer (BD FACScan or Facs-Calibur) and CellQuest software. RNase Protection Assay (RPA)—Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol. RPAs were carried out exactly as described previously (19Spender L.C. Whiteman H.J. Karstegl C.E. Farrell P.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1873-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using the appropriate multiprobe template sets (BD Biosciences). Real-time qRT-PCR—Total cell RNA was isolated using TRIzol as recommended by the manufacturer. cDNA and qRT-PCR reactions were prepared using SYBR green 2-step qRT-PCR kits (Finnzymes) and specific primers (Qiagen). Amplified products were analyzed by Chromo4 continuous fluorescence detector and Opticon Monitor3 software. Samples were amplified in triplicate, and the mean relative amount of specific RNA expressed after normalization to the amount of 18 S rRNA is shown unless stated otherwise. TGF-β Induces Growth Arrest in CA46 BL Cells—BL cell lines can undergo G1 growth arrest in response to TGF-β (16Inman G.J. Allday M.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1567-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). BLs arise following translocation of the c-myc locus to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus (t(8;14)), resulting in deregulated c-MYC expression (17Madisen L. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2212-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Because BL cells overexpress c-MYC and the repression of c-MYC is a pivotal event in TGF-β-mediated cytostasis (directly affecting transcription of p15, p21, and Id2 in epithelial cells), we investigated how cells harboring a deregulated c-myc locus might respond to TGF-β treatment. CA46 BL cells were seeded overnight at 3 × 105/ml, during which time nearly 80% of cells were synchronized in the G1 phase of the cell cycle as shown by propidium iodide staining (Fig. 1A). Cells were then either left untreated or treated with TGF-β for 48 h. Control cells progressed from G1 through the cell cycle, whereas TGF-β-treated cells exhibited an efficient G1 cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1A). This was confirmed by a reduction in cell counts (Fig. 1B) and an inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation in CA46 cells treated with TGF-β (Fig. 1C). Cell Cycle Arrest of BL Cells Is Independent of c-MYC and CDK Inhibitor Regulation—To establish whether TGF-β-mediated growth arrest in BL cells occurs via induction of the minimal epithelial cytostatic program, we compared expression of c-MYC, p15, and p21 following TGF-β treatment of CA46 BL and HaCaT epithelial cells (Fig. 2A). As expected, rapid TGF-β-dependent repression of c-MYC and induction of p15 and p21 was observed in HaCaT cells. However, these changes were not observed in CA46 BL cells. High c-MYC expression levels were maintained throughout, and p15 and p21 were undetectable despite TGF-β treatment readily stimulating phosphorylation of Smad2 in these cells (Fig. 2A). In addition to the well characterized effects on p15 and p21, TGF-β can induce other CDK inhibitors (for example, p27 in CH31 and WEHI231 murine B-cells (21Kamesaki H. Nishizawa K. Michaud G.Y. Cossman J. Kiyono T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 770-777PubMed Google Scholar) and p57 in hematopoietic stem cells (22Scandura J.M. Boccuni P. Massague J. Nimer S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15231-15236Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)). We therefore analyzed expression of the different CDK inhibitors in both CA46 and HaCaT cells using a multiprobe RPA (Fig. 2B). We readily detected the TGF-β-mediated induction of p21 and p15 RNA in HaCaT cells, but none of the CDK inhibitors assayed were induced in CA46 cells. TGF-β-induced growth arrest in CA46 BL cells therefore is independent of induction of the previously described TGF-β-responsive CDK inhibitors p27, p57, p21, and p15. TGF-β Induces Id1 and Id2 in CA46 Cells—TGF-β-mediated cytostasis in epithelial cells is also associated with repression of the growth-promoting transcription factors Id1, Id2, and Id3. Sustained repression of Id2 occurs following reduced c-MYC expression and an increase in Mad4 levels, resulting in the replacement of activating MYC-MAX heterodimers with repressive MAD-MAX complexes on the Id2 promoter (23Siegel P.M. Shu W. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35444-35450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Id1 repression meanwhile is mediated by Smad3-dependent activation of ATF3, which is then recruited by Smad3 to the Id1 promoter (24Kang Y. Chen C.R. Massague J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). However, during TGF-β-induced growth arrest of CA46 BL cells, the expression of both Id1 and Id2 proteins increased, peaking at 4 h (Fig. 2C), whereas Id3 was not expressed in CA46 cells (data not shown). The differences in Id protein regulation between the two cell types may be explained not only by the difference in c-MYC response but also by the lack of induction of the Smad co-repressor ATF3 in CA46 cells (Fig. 2D). Taken together, our findings so far indicate that the induction of cell cycle arrest in CA46 cells is entirely independent of the minimal cytostatic program associated with TGF-β-induced arrest of epithelial cells. TGF-β-mediated Cell Cycle Arrest of BL Cells Correlates with Loss of E2F-1 Expression—To determine the likely mechanism of cell cycle arrest in CA46 cells, we analyzed the effect of TGF-β on cell cycle-related proteins (Fig. 3). At 0 h, most cells are synchronized in G1 (as described in Fig. 1A). Progression through the cell cycle during the subsequent 48-h incubation was associated with the cyclin/cdk-dependent phosphorylation of the E2F transcriptional co-repressor pRb (Fig. 3). As expected, in the presence of TGF-β, pRb, was maintained in its active, hypo-phosphorylated form (Fig. 3) (25Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J. Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). We observed very little effect on basal expression of the cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4 and no effect on the phosphorylation state of p70 S6 kinase (a substrate of the phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A and a component of a post-transcriptional mediated G1 arrest pathway activated by TGF-β in mammary epithelial cells (26Petritsch C. Beug H. Balmain A. Oft M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3093-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar)). Expression of the transcription factor E2F-1, however, was dramatically decreased within 4–8 h of TGF-β treatment. TGF-β Induces Transcriptional Repression of E2F-1 in BL Cells—We next investigated the mechanism of TGF-β-mediated inhibition of E2F-1 expression. Using a multiprobe RPA assay, we found that TGF-β treatment resulted in the down-regulation of E2F-1 RNA levels followed by a decrease in the RNA levels of the E2F DNA binding partners DP-1 and DP-2 and the family member E2F-4 (Fig. 4A). We confirmed this decrease in E2F-1 RNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4B). Treatment of the cells with the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and anisomycin blocked the TGF-β-mediated inhibition of E2F-1 mRNA expression, suggesting either that the mechanism of E2F-1 regulation requires induction of a TGF-β-responsive transcriptional repressor or that continued synthesis of a labile factor is required for efficient repression of the E2F-1 gene (Fig. 4B). The effects of TGF-β and actinomycin D (an inhibitor of transcription) on E2F-1 RNA levels were comparable (Fig. 4C), suggesting that TGF-β inhibits transcription of the E2F-1 gene. To confirm this, we cloned a region of the E2F-1 promoter spanning –1808 to +9 relative to the gene transcription start site into a luciferase reporter construct (a schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 4D) and assayed its responsiveness to TGF-β signaling following transfection into CA46 cells. Transcription driven by this region of the E2F-1 promoter was repressed to background levels when cells were treated with TGF-β for 8 h (Fig. 4E). Re-expression of E2F-1 Rescues BL Cells from TGF-β-induced G1 Arrest—To determine whether transcriptional regulation of E2F-1 is sufficient for TGF-β-mediated growth arrest in cells with deregulated c-MYC expression, we constitutively re-expressed E2F-1 in CA46 cells. The TGF-β-responsiveness of stable cell pools containing empty vector (CA46-pcDNA) or an E2F-1 expression vector (CA46-E2F-1) were compared. E2F-1 was overexpressed in cells transfected with the expression vector when compared with control cell pools and, importantly, both cell pools were equally responsive to TGF-β as evidenced by equivalent levels of repression of E2F-1 RNA (Fig. 5A) and of Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). The high levels of E2F-1 expression were maintained even after treatment with 1 ng/ml TGF-β for 24 h (Fig. 5, A and B). Elevated expression of cell cycle-stimulating oncogenes (such as E2F-1) can be associated with increased apoptosis through an E2F-1-p14ARF-p53 pathway, by induction of the p53-related homologue p73, or by increasing transcription of BH3-only proapoptotic proteins such as PUMA and NOXA (reviewed in Ref. 27Iaquinta P.J. Lees J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We saw no increase in apoptosis in CA46 cells stably expressing E2F-1 (Fig. 5E). It is possible that the mutant p53 (28Cherney B.W. Bhatia K.G. Sgadari C. Gutierrez M.I. Mostowski H. Pike S.E. Gupta G. Magrath I.T. Tosato G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2508-2515PubMed Google Scholar) expressed in CA46 cells and a lack of BAX/BAK (29Doucet J.P. Hussain A. Al-Rasheed M. Gaidano G. Gutierrez M.I. Magrath I. Bhatia K. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2004; 45: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) expression allows successful E2F-1 overexpression in this cell background. In fact, at low cell-seeding densities (≤1.2 × 105/ml), E2F-1-overexpressing cells had a proliferative advantage over control cells (data not shown). Enforced expression of E2F-1 efficiently reduced TGF-β-mediated growth arrest measured in cell-counting experiments (Fig. 5, C and D), and this effect was apparent irrespective of cell-seeding density. The reduction in the cytostatic response correlated with a reduction in the ability of TGF-β to induce G1 arrest shown in representative histograms of propidium iodide-stained cells analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5E) and as the average increase in cells undergoing aG1 arrest in response to TGF-β (Fig. 5F). Overall our data indicate that TGF-β-mediated growth arrest in human B lymphoma cells is independent of c-MYC regulation and is mediated predominantly by the repression of E2F-1 transcription. The key event in TGF-β-mediated cytostatic responses of epithelial cells is the transcriptional regulation of c-myc and its target genes. In the context of deregulated c-MYC expression, however, for example, in BL cells transformed by t(8;14) translocation of the c-myc gene, it was unknown whether TGF-β cell cycle arrest could occur by a similar mechanism. Here we provide evidence that efficient TGF-β-mediated growth arrest can occur in human lymphoma cells despite a lack of the core cytostatic program events including loss of c-MYC and Id transcription factors and without induction of CDK inhibitors. The absence of any substantive effect on c-MYC, p15, p21, and p27 expression following TGF-β stimulation is more usually associated with increased proliferation (30Khalil N. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) rather than with the antiproliferative response shown here in BL cells. In the human breast cancer cell line MCF-10A (deficient in the p15Ink4b locus), transformation with Ras-ErB2 induces resistance to TGF-β cytostasis by virtue of an inability to down-regulate c-MYC. In these cells, therefore, the combination of a defective c-MYC response and lack of p15 is enough to render the cells completely insensitive to TGF-β-induced cytostasis (5Chen C.R. Kang Y.B. Massague J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, we have demonstrated that these same defects in the cytostatic program are in no way detrimental to the ability of BL cells to undergo growth arrest in response to TGF-β. The observed differences may be cell type-specific, although not confined to epithelial versus hematopoietic cells because c-MYC down-regulation may not be a prerequisite for TGF-β-mediated growth arrest in canine thyroid epithelial cells (31Depoortere F. Pirson I. Bartek J. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1061-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). TGF-β has been observed to repress expression of the Id transcription factors in epithelial cells (32Rotzer D. Krampert M. Sulyok S. Braun S. Stark H.J. Boukamp P. Werner S. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2070-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that TGF-β treatment of CA46 BL cells readily induced expression of Id1 and Id2, indicating that this may be an example of cell type differences in the TGF-β response. Consistent with our findings, others have also observed Id proteins to be induced by TGF-β family members. During development, Id proteins are essential for lymphocyte development and function (33Engel I. Murre C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). TGF-β treatment of primary murine lymphocyte progenitors results in induction of Id3, causing growth arrest and apoptosis of B220+ve B cell progenitors (34Kee B.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4518-4527Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Kee B.L. Rivera R.R. Murre C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), whereas TGF-β induction of Id2 has a role in negatively regulating IgE class switching in mature B cells (36Sugai M. Gonda H. Kusunoki T. Katakai T. Yokota Y. Shimizu A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Interestingly BMP-6 also induces Id1 Ramos BL cells (37Kersten C. Sivertsen E.A. Hystad M.E. Forfang L. Smeland E.B. Myklebust J.H. BMC Immunol. 2005; 6: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and induces both Id1 and Id3 in human bone marrow B lymphocyte progenitors and the pre-B-ALL cell line Nalm-6 (38Kersten C. Dosen G.

It has yet to be determined whether induction of Id proteins shown here has a functional role in TGF-β-induced growth arrest in human BL cells. In our study, TGF-β-mediated growth arrest in BL cells correlated with transcriptional repression of E2F-1. Loss of E2F-1 RNA expression has been reported in mink lung (2Schwarz J.K. Bassing C.H. Kovesdi I. Datto M.B. Blazing M. George S. Wang X.F. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and HaCaT epithelial cells (39Li J.M. Hu P.P. Shen X. Yu Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4948-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) after 24 and 12 h of TGF-β signaling, respectively. We now show that in BL cells, TGF-β signaling affects E2F-1 transcription rapidly (within 4 h) and requires de novo protein synthesis. We also demonstrate for the first time the TGF-β-dependent repression of E2F-1 promoter activity using luciferase reporter constructs containing ∼2 kb of the wild type E2F-1 promoter. Transcriptional autoregulation of E2F-1 occurs through two E2F binding sites near the transcription start (shown in Fig. 4D). The same sites also mediate E2F-1 repression in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle through binding of repressor E2F complexes made up of E2F-4 and E2F-5 bound to pocket proteins p107, p130, and perhaps pRb (40Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). TGF-β can induce these repressor E2F complexes in HaCaT cells (39Li J.M. Hu P.P. Shen X. Yu Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4948-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 41Iavarone A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which, in concert with histone deacetylases, repress E2F target genes such as cdc25a (41Iavarone A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is possible that a similar mechanism exists in BL cells to regulate E2F-1 transcription; however, analysis of Smad binding elements (5′-GTCT-3′ or its reverse complement 5′-AGAC-3′) (42Yang Y.C. Piek E. Zavadil J. Liang D. Xie D. Heyer J. Pavlidis P. Kucherlapati R. Roberts A.B. Bottinger E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10269-10274Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), within the –1808 to +9 E2F-1 promoter region assayed, also reveals at least 14 potential Smad binding elements. 3L. C. Spender, unpublished observations. It is therefore possible that activated Smads are recruited to the E2F-1 promoter along with E2F repressor complexes (as in the case of c-myc repression). We are currently investigating the mechanism of E2F-1 repression in BL cells. We have shown here that TGF-β-mediated repression of E2F-1 in lymphoma cells transformed by c-MYC deregulation induces cell cycle arrest; however, it is also possible that the loss of E2F-1 expression may affect tumor cell survival. Blocking E2F-1 function in osteosarcoma cells overexpressing wild type c-MYC induces apoptosis, which is caspase-dependent but independent of the ability of deregulated c-MYC to activate the ARF/p53 response to oncogenic stress (43Santoni-Rugiu E. Duro D. Farkas T. Mathiasen I.S. Jaattela M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6498-6509Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this situation, E2F-1-induced expression of the prosurvival factor BCL-2 may account for the requirement for E2F activity concomitant with Myc overexpression because BCL-2 can counteract the function of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein BIM induced by c-MYC. In some Burkitt lymphomas, however, the situation is complicated by selection of c-MYC mutants, which cannot induce BIM expression and consequently have diminished apoptotic potential (44Hemann M.T. Bric A. Teruya-Feldstein J. Herbst A. Nilsson J.A. Cordon-Cardo C. Cleveland J.L. Tansey W.P. Lowe S.W. Nature. 2005; 436: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Whether BL cell lines rely on E2F-1 as a survival factor and whether TGF-β-induced apoptosis in this cell type involves E2F-1 repression therefore requires further investigation. Because re-expression of E2F-1 in CA46 cells largely overcomes the effect of TGF-β in BL cells, we conclude that down-regulation of E2F-1 is the predominant mechanism by which TGF-β can induce cell cycle arrest in the absence of c-MYC regulation. It remains to be determined whether TGF-β can directly repress expression of E2F-1 in other cell types and whether this contributes to the cytostatic program. Our data suggest that in human B cells, deregulation of the c-MYC expression is not sufficient to evade the tumor suppressor function of TGF-β. It is possible that some lymphomas may escape from the potent tumor suppressor functions of TGF-β by deregulation of the E2F-1 pathway, and we are currently investigating this hypothesis. We thank Professor Kevin Ryan (The Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, UK) for the gift of the E2F-1 expression vector."
https://openalex.org/W2027448614,"Background The prevalence of thyroid nodules increases with age, average 4–7% for the U.S.A. adult population, but it is much higher (19–67%) when sub-clinical nodules are considered. About 90% of these lesions are benign and a reliable approach to their preoperative characterization is necessary. Unfortunately conventional thyroid scintigraphy does not allow the distinction among benign and malignant thyroid proliferations but it provides only functional information (cold or hot nodules). The expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule galectin-3 is restricted to cancer cells and this feature has potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications. We show here the possibility to obtain thyroid cancer imaging in vivo by targeting galectin-3. Methods The galectin-3 based thyroid immuno-scintigraphy uses as radiotracer a specific 99mTc-radiolabeled mAb. A position-sensitive high-resolution mini-gamma camera was used as imaging capture device. Human galectin-3 positive thyroid cancer xenografts (ARO) and galectin-3 knockout tumors were used as targets in different experiments in vivo. 38 mice with tumor mass of about 1 gm were injected in the tail vein with 100 µCi of 99mTc-labeled mAb to galectin-3 (30 µg protein/in 100 µl saline solution). Tumor images were acquired at 1 hr, 3 hrs, 6 hrs, 9 hrs and 24 hrs post injection by using the mini-gamma camera. Findings Results from different consecutive experiments show an optimal visualization of thyroid cancer xenografts between 6 and 9 hours from injection of the radiotracer. Galectin-3 negative tumors were not detected at all. At 6 hrs post-injection galectin-3 expressing tumors were correctly visualized, while the whole-body activity had essentially cleared. Conclusions These results demonstrate the possibility to distinguish preoperatively benign from malignant thyroid nodules by using a specific galectin-3 radio-immunotargeting. In vivo imaging of thyroid cancer may allow a better selection of patients referred to surgery. The possibility to apply this method for imaging and treatment of other galectin-3 expressing tumors is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2060081210,"Stromal derived factor 1 (SDF-1) is a CXC chemokine important in the homing process of stem cells to injured tissue. It has been implicated in healing and tissue repair. Growing evidence suggests that the glycoprotein-130 (gp130) ligand family is involved in repair processes in the heart. The aim of our study was to determine whether gp130 ligands could affect SDF-1 expression in cardiac cells. Human adult cardiac myocytes (HACMs) and fibroblasts (HACFs) were treated with gp130 ligands. Protein and mRNA levels of SDF-1 were determined using ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. mRNA levels of SDF-1 were determined in human and mouse heart samples by RT-PCR. HACMs and HACFs constitutively express SDF-1, which was significantly up-regulated by the gp130 ligand oncostatin M (OSM). This effect was counteracted by a p38 inhibitor and to a lesser extent by a PI3K inhibitor. mRNA expression of SDF-1 in hearts of mice injected with OSM increased significantly. Levels of OSM and SDF-1 mRNA correlated significantly in human failing hearts. Our data, showing that OSM induces SDF-1 protein secretion in human cardiac cells in vitro and murine hearts in vivo, suggest that OSM via the induction of SDF-1 might play a key role in repair and tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1996711684,"Despite the emerging success of multi-targeted protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors in cancer therapy, significant side effects and resistance concerns seems to be avoided unlikely. The aim of the present study was to identify novel multi-targeting PTK inhibitors. The kinase enzymatic activities were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The antiproliferative activities in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) were evaluated by sulforhodamine (SRB) assay. The phosphorylation of kinases and their downstream molecules was probed by western blot analysis. The binding mode between MdOS and PTKs was profiled by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) approach and molecular simulation. Tube formation assay, rat aortic ring method and chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay were combined to illustrate the in vitro and in vivo anti-angiogenic effects. Results indicated that MdOS, a novel marine-derived oligosaccharide sulfate, exhibited a broad-spectrum PTK inhibitory action. At an enzymatic level, MdOS inhibited HER2, EGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR, c-Kit, FGFR1 and c-Src, with little impact on FGFR2. In cellular settings, MdOS inhibited phosphorylation of PTKs, exemplified by HER2, EGFR and VEGFR2, and downstream molecules of Erk1/2 and AKT. Further studies demonstrated that MdOS acted as an ATP-competitive inhibitor via directly binding to the residues of entrance rather than those of the ATP-binding pocket. Furthermore, MdOS inhibited proliferation and tube formation of HMECs, arrested microvessel outgrowth of rat aortic rings and hindered the neovascularization of chick allantoic membrane. Taken together, results presented here indicated that MdOS exhibited anti-angiogenic activity in a PTK-dependent manner and make it a promising agent for further evaluation in PTK-associated cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2043257467,"We have made a wide phylogenetic survey of Pix proteins, which are constituents of vertebrate centrioles in most eukaryotes. We have also surveyed the presence and structure of flagella or cilia and centrioles in these organisms, as far as is possible from published information. We find that Pix proteins are present in a vast range of eukaryotes, but not all. Where centrioles are absent so are Pix proteins. If one considers the maintenance of Pix proteins over evolutionary time scales, our analysis would suggest that their key function is to make cilia and flagella, and the same is true of centrioles. Moreover, this survey raises the possibility that Pix proteins are only maintained to make cilia and flagella that undulate, and even then only when they are constructed by transporting ciliary constituents up the cilium using the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system. We also find that Pix proteins have become generally divergent within Ecdysozoa and between this group and other taxa. This correlates with a simplification of centrioles within Ecdysozoa and a loss or divergence of cilia/flagella. Thus Pix proteins act as a weathervane to indicate changes in centriole function, whose core activity is to make cilia and flagella."
https://openalex.org/W2088309718,"Background Paper pulp wastewater resulting from alkaline extraction of wheat straw, known as black liquor, is very difficult to be treated and causes serious environmental problems due to its high pH value and chemical oxygen demand (COD) pollution load. Lignin, semicellulose and cellulose are the main contributors to the high COD values in black liquor. Very few microorganisms can survive in such harsh environments of the alkaline wheat straw black liquor. A naturally developed microbial community was found accidentally in a black liquor storing pool in a paper pulp mill of China. The community was effective in pH decreasing, color and COD removing from the high alkaline and high COD black liquor. Findings Thirty-eight strains of bacteria were isolated from the black liquor storing pool, and were grouped as eleven operational taxonomy units (OTUs) using random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR profiles (RAPD). Eleven representative strains of each OTU, which were identified as genera of Halomonas and Bacillus, were used to construct a consortium to treat black liquor with a high pH value of 11.0 and very high COD pollution load of 142,600 mg l−1. After treatment by the constructed consortium, about 35.4% of color and 39,000 mg l−1 (27.3%) CODcr were removed and the pH decreased to 7.8. 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis suggested a two-stage treatment mechanism to elucidate the interspecies collaboration: Halomonas isolates were important in the first stage to produce organic acids that contributed to the pH decline, while Bacillus isolates were involved in the degradation of lignin derivatives in the second stage under lower pH conditions. Conclusions/Significance Tolerance to the high alkaline environment and good controllability of the simple consortium suggested that the constructed consortium has good potential for black liquor treatment. Facilitating the treatment process by the constructed consortium would provide a promising opportunity to reduce the pollution, as well as to save forest resources and add value to a waste product."
https://openalex.org/W2122448497,"Seasonal photoperiodic responses in mammals depend on the pineal hormone melatonin. The pars tuberalis (PT) region of the anterior pituitary has emerged as a principal melatonin target tissue, controlling endocrine responses. Rising melatonin levels acutely influence the expression of a small cluster of genes either positively (exemplified by cryptochrome-1, cry1) or negatively (exemplified by the type 1 melatonin receptor, mt1). The purpose of this study was to characterize the pathways through which these evening actions of melatonin are mediated. In vitro experiments showed that cAMP signaling in the PT directly influences mt1 but not cry1 expression. Analysis of nuclear extracts from sheep PT tissue collected 90 min after melatonin or saline control injections highlighted the response element for the immediate early gene egr1 (EGR1-RE) as a candidate for acute melatonin-dependent transcriptional regulation. We identified putative EGR1-RE's in the proximal promoter regions of the ovine cry1 and mt1 genes, and confirmed their functionality in luciferase reporter assays. Egr1 expression is suppressed by melatonin in PT cell cultures, and is rhythmic in the ovine PT with a nadir in the early night. We propose that melatonin-dependent effects on EGR1-RE's contribute to evening gene expression profiles in this pituitary melatonin target tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2093723313,"H/ACA ribonucleoprotein particles are essential for ribosomal RNA and telomerase RNA processing and metabolism. Shq1p has been identified as an essential eukaryotic H/ACA small nucleolar (sno) ribonucleoparticle (snoRNP) biogenesis and assembly factor. Shq1p is postulated to be involved in the early biogenesis steps of H/ACA snoRNP complexes, and Shq1p depletion leads to a specific decrease in H/ACA small nucleolar RNA levels and to defects in ribosomal RNA processing. Shq1p contains two predicted domains as follows: an N-terminal CS (named after CHORD-containing proteins and SGT1) or HSP20-like domain, and a C-terminal region of high sequence homology called the Shq1 domain. Here we report the crystal structure and functional studies of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Shq1p CS domain. The structure consists of a compact anti-parallel beta-sandwich fold that is composed of two beta-sheets containing four and three beta-strands, respectively, and a short alpha-helix. Deletion studies showed that the CS domain is required for the essential functions of Shq1p. Point mutations in residues Phe-6, Gln-10, and Lys-80 destabilize Shq1p in vivo and induce a temperature-sensitive phenotype with depletion of H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs and defects in rRNA processing. Although CS domains are frequently found in co-chaperones of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone, no interaction was detected between the Shq1p CS domain and yeast Hsp90 in vitro. These results show that the CS domain is essential for Shq1p function in H/ACA snoRNP biogenesis in vivo, possibly in an Hsp90-independent manner."

Previous considerations of RFC structure and mechanism were based on the notion that RFC monomers were sufficient to mediate transport of folate and antifolate substrates. The present study examines the possibility that human RFC (hRFC) exists as higher order homo-oligomers. By chemical cross-linking, transiently expressed hRFC in hRFC-null HeLa (R5) cells with the homobifunctional cross-linker 1,3-propanediyl bis-methanethiosulfonate and Western blotting, hRFC species with molecular masses of hRFC homo-oligomers were identified. Hemagglutinin- and Myc epitope-tagged hRFC proteins expressed in R5 cells were co-immunoprecipitated from both membrane particulate and surface-enriched membrane fractions, indicating that oligomeric hRFC is expressed at the cell surface. By co-expression of wild type and inactive mutant S138C hRFCs, combined with surface biotinylation and confocal microscopy, a dominant-negative phenotype was demonstrated involving greatly decreased cell surface expression of both mutant and wild type carrier caused by impaired intracellular trafficking. For another hRFC mutant (R373A), expression of oligomeric wild type-mutant hRFC was accompanied by a significant and disproportionate loss of wild type activity unrelated to the level of surface carrier. Collectively, our results demonstrate the existence of hRFC homo-oligomers. They also establish the likely importance of these higher order hRFC structures to intracellular trafficking and carrier function."
https://openalex.org/W2048709570,"The Runt homology domain (Runx) defines a metazoan family of sequence-specific transcriptional regulatory proteins that are critical for animal development and causally associated with a variety of mammalian cancers. The sea urchin Runx gene SpRunt-1 is expressed throughout the blastula stage embryo, and is required globally during embryogenesis for cell survival and differentiation.Depletion of SpRunt-1 by morpholino antisense-mediated knockdown causes a blastula stage deficit in cell proliferation, as shown by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and direct cell counts. Reverse transcription coupled polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies show that the cell proliferation deficit is presaged by a deficit in the expression of several zygotic wnt genes, including wnt8, a key regulator of endomesoderm development. In addition, SpRunt-1-depleted blastulae underexpress cyclinD, an effector of mitogenic Wnt signaling. Blastula stage cell proliferation is also impeded by knockdown of either wnt8 or cyclinD. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) indicates that Runx target sites within 5' sequences flanking cyclinD, wnt6 and wnt8 are directly bound by SpRunt-1 protein at late blastula stage. Furthermore, experiments using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter transgene show that the blastula-stage operation of a cis-regulatory module previously shown to be required for wnt8 expression (Minokawa et al., Dev. Biol. 288: 545-558, 2005) is dependent on its direct sequence-specific interaction with SpRunt-1. Finally, inhibitor studies and immunoblot analysis show that SpRunt-1 protein levels are negatively regulated by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3.These results suggest that Runx expression and Wnt signaling are mutually linked in a feedback circuit that controls cell proliferation during development."

Whether there also exists a reciprocal metabolic arm affecting energy metabolism in white adipose tissue is unknown.We investigated the effects of apoB-containing lipoproteins on catecholamine-induced lipolysis in adipocytes from subcutaneous fat cells of obese but otherwise healthy men, fat pads from mice with plasma lipoproteins containing high or intermediate levels of apoB100 or no apoB100, primary cultured adipocytes, and 3T3-L1 cells. In subcutaneous fat cells, the rate of lipolysis was inversely related to plasma apoB levels. In human primary adipocytes, LDL inhibited lipolysis in a concentration-dependent fashion. In contrast, VLDL had no effect. Lipolysis was increased in fat pads from mice lacking plasma apoB100, reduced in apoB100-only mice, and intermediate in wild-type mice. Mice lacking apoB100 also had higher oxygen consumption and lipid oxidation. In 3T3-L1 cells, apoB100-containing lipoproteins inhibited lipolysis in a dose-dependent fashion, but lipoproteins containing apoB48 had no effect. ApoB100-LDL mediated inhibition of lipolysis was abolished in fat pads of mice deficient in the LDL receptor (Ldlr(-/-)Apob(100/100)).Our results show that the binding of apoB100-LDL to adipocytes via the LDL receptor inhibits intracellular noradrenaline-induced lipolysis in adipocytes. Thus, apoB100-LDL is a novel signaling molecule from the liver to peripheral fat deposits that may be an important link between atherogenic dyslipidemias and facets of the metabolic syndrome."

Cell. 2001; 8: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), Spx (3Nakano S. Zheng G. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3664-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and CtsR (4Kruger E. Zuhlke D. Witt E. Ludwig H. Hecker M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 852-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in Bacillus subtilis, PopR in Streptomyces lividans (5Viala J. Mazodier P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) is controlled through conditional proteolysis by Clp proteases. The concentration of the Clp subunits in the cell must be strictly controlled to ensure the capability to respond adequately to stress conditions resulting in accumulation of truncated or misfolded proteins. In Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, transcriptional activation of clp genes is mediated primarily by the action of the alternative sigma factor σ32, which binds to the RNA polymerase enhancing transcription (6Arsene F. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2000; 55: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In contrast, in several Gram-positive bacteria with low G+C content, e.g. Bacillus subtilis, the transcriptional repressor CtsR controls the expression of the clpC, clpE, and clpP genes (7Derre I. Rapoport G. Msadek T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 8Derre I. Rapoport G. Devine K. Rose M. Msadek T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Kruger E. Hecker M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6681-6688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, another transcriptional activator designated ClgR (for clp gene regulator) was discovered in Corynebacterium glutamicum, which activates expression of the clpP1P2 and clpC genes (10Engels S. Schweitzer J.E. Ludwig C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). According to genome-based searches, ClgR homologs are present in most members of the Actinomycetales, an order of high G+C Gram-positive bacteria that comprises prominent pathogenic species like Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Regulation of clp genes by ClgR was also demonstrated in S. lividans (11Bellier A. Mazodier P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3238-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and Bifidobacterium breve (12Ventura M. Zhang Z. Cronin M. Canchaya C. Kenny J.G. Fitzgerald G.F. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8411-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The ClgR regulon has been analyzed in more detail in C. glutamicum (13Engels S. Ludwig C. Schweitzer J.E. Mack C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 576-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Besides clpP1P2 and clpC, ClgR binds to operator sequences of several genes that are involved in proteolysis and DNA repair. The binding sites of ClgR were determined by DNase I-footprint experiments, and a 18-bp consensus operator sequence (WNNWCGCYNANRGCGWWS) has been proposed for the ClgR regulon in C. glutamicum. The pseudo-palindromic structure of the consensus sequence indicates that ClgR recognizes its target DNA as a dimer. In most cases, the ClgR binding site is located between position -39 and -67 relative to the transcriptional start site (+1). Only in the case of clpC the binding site lies further upstream stretching from position -121 to -138 (13Engels S. Ludwig C. Schweitzer J.E. Mack C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 576-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, different intervals between the ClgR binding site and the core promoter apparently allow transcriptional activation by ClgR. In all bacteria containing ClgR the central consensus motif CGC-N5-GCG is found in the promoter upstream regions of clpP1P2 and clpC. Furthermore, it was shown that ClgR from M. tuberculosis is capable of replacing ClgR in C. glutamicum enhancing expression of the clpC and clpP1P2 genes as well (10Engels S. Schweitzer J.E. Ludwig C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These results support the hypothesis that the regulation of clpC and clpP1P2 by ClgR is highly conserved within the actinomycetes. Similar to the clp gene regulators in Gram-negative and low G+C Gram-positive bacteria described above, convincing evidence was provided that the activity of ClgR is also controlled at the level of protein stability via ClpCP-mediated degradation (10Engels S. Schweitzer J.E. Ludwig C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Bellier A. Gominet M. Mazodier P. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, neither the environmental stimuli nor the molecular mechanism leading to stabilization of ClgR are known at present. ClgR of C. glutamicum consists of a polypeptide chain of 107 amino acids with a molecular mass of 11.3 kDa and a theoretical pI of 5.4. The protein contains a helix-turn-helix type 3 (HTH 3) DNA-binding motif according to the Pfam data base (15Finn R.D. Mistry J. Schuster-Bockler B. Griffiths-Jones S. Hollich V. Lassmann T. Moxon S. Marshall M. Khanna A. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Sonnhammer E.L. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D247-D251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). It is most similar to the ClgR orthologs from C. efficiens, C. diphtheriae, and C. jeikeium with which it shares 91%, 75, and 61% sequence identity, respectively. It shares 38% sequence identity with ClgR from M. tuberculosis. The proteolytic core subunits of the Clp protease ClpP1 and ClpP2 are essential in C. glutamicum (10Engels S. Schweitzer J.E. Ludwig C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and possibly also in other members of the actinomycetes. We ultimately seek to understand the regulation mechanisms controlling the expression of the corresponding genes at a level that enables us to interfere with it and thus control viability of the bacteria. Here, we present the first crystal structure of a clp gene regulator, ClgR, from C. glutamicum solved from two different crystal forms to 1.75- and 2.05-Å resolution, respectively. Protein Expression and Purification—The cloning, expression, and purification of the ClgR construct used for crystallization was performed as described previously by Engels et al. (10Engels S. Schweitzer J.E. Ludwig C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ClgR was expressed in dnaK-deficient E. coli BB1553 cells and purified by StrepTag-II affinity chromatography using a StrepTactin-Sepharose column (IBA). An additional washing step was carried out with a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl. Elution fractions containing ClgR were pooled, and buffer was exchanged against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using Vivaspin concentrators with a cut-off of 5 kDa (Sartorius). The resulting protein possesses ten additional amino acids at the C terminus representing a linker and the StrepTag-II peptide. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as standard. For the incorporation of selenomethionine by metabolic inhibition, the cells were cultivated in M9 minimal medium (42.3 mm Na2HPO4, 22.0 mm KH2PO4, 18.7 mm NH4Cl, 8.6 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 22.2 mm glucose, 1.5 mm thiamine) additionally containing 15 μm FeSO4 at 30 °C until the A600 reached a value of 0.3. At this point the following amino acids were added to the cultures: 100 mg/liter l-lysine, 100 mg/liter l-phenylalanine, 100 mg/liter l-threonine, 50 mg/liter l-isoleucine, 50 mg/liter l-leucine, 50 mg/liter l-valine, and 50 mg/liter l-selenomethionine. After 15 min the expression was induced by addition of 3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and allowed to continue for 4 h. The selenomethionine-labeled ClgR was purified in the same way as the native protein (10Engels S. Schweitzer J.E. Ludwig C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The integrity of the purified proteins was confirmed by mass spectrometry and gel electrophoresis. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystal screens of native ClgR were set up by a Phoenix crystallization robot (Art Robbins Instruments) using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. 200 nl of protein solution (5 mg/ml) were mixed with 100 nl of reservoir solution (0.1 m NaCl, 23% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 15% glycerol, 0.085 m sodium-acetate, pH 4.6) and equilibrated against 50 μl of reservoir solution at 20 °C. Crystals with an average size of 50 × 20 × 20 μm3 were obtained after 3 days. They belong to space group P21 with cell constants of a = 65.7, b = 85.1, c = 71.4 Å, and β = 95.6°. Crystals of selenomethionine-labeled ClgR were obtained after 5 days by mixing 2 μl of protein with 1 μl of reservoir solution (0.0085 m CoCl2, 0.85 m 1,6-hexanediol, 15% glycerol, 0.085 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6). The largest crystals had dimensions of 30 × 30 × 15 μm3 and, as the native crystals, belonged to space group P21 displaying slightly different cell constants (a = 66.9, b = 84.6, c = 72.6 Å, and β = 96.6°). While this report was in the final stage of preparation, a second ClgR crystal form was obtained from a crystallization experiment designed to crystallize a ClgR-DNA complex. The crystals with an average size of 60 × 40 × 40 μm3 grew after 1 month from a solution containing 0.085 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 8.5% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 15% glycerol. They belong to space group P43212 with cell constants of a = b = 55.1, c = 129.6 Å. Crystals were mounted directly from the mother liquor and flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream at 100 K (16Teng T.-Y. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1990; 23: 387-391Crossref Google Scholar). Native data from the monoclinic crystals were collected to 2.05-Å resolution on beamline X06SA at the Swiss Light Source using the PILATUS 6M hybrid pixel detector (Dectris Ltd.) (17Broennimann C. Eikenberry E.F. Heinrich B. Horisberger R. Huelsen G. Pohl E. Schmitt B. Schulze-Briese C. Suzuki M. Tomizaki T. Toyokawa H. Wagner A. J. Synchrotron Rad. 2006; 13: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Phases to 2.7-Å resolution were determined from a multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiment carried out on a selenomethionine-labeled crystal on beamline X10SA at the Swiss Light Source using a Mar225 detector (Marresearch) (18Pohl E. Pradervand C. Schneider R. Tomizaki T. Pauluhn A. Chen Q. Ingold G. Zimoch E. Schulze-Briese C. Synchrotron Radiat. News. 2006; 19: 24-26Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Diffraction data from the tetragonal crystal form were collected at beamline X10SA on a Mar225 detector to a resolution of 1.75 Å. All datasets were integrated and scaled with XDS (19Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). The data from the monoclinic crystal form were corrected for radiation damage using zero-dose extrapolation as implemented in XSCALE (20Diederichs K. McSweeney S. Ravelli R.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).

Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Structure Solution, Refinement, and Analysis—Initially, retrieval of phase information was attempted using heavy atom labeling of the first obtained monoclinic crystals. The crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing different heavy atom compounds in concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mm. The most promising result was obtained with a crystal soaked with 10 mm Na2WO4 overnight. A three-wavelength multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiment was carried out across the tungsten absorption edge. Three tungsten positions per asymmetric unit could be determined with SHELXC/D (21Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80217) Google Scholar) using the FA values calculated from all three datasets. The positions were refined, and phases were calculated using SHARP (22Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The resulting map showed clear helical features; however it was not possible to trace the amino acid chain from this map. In parallel, selenomethionine-substituted protein was prepared and crystallized as described above. Apart from the N-terminal methionine, ClgR contains one methionine residue at position 95 of the amino acid sequence. Six selenium positions per asymmetric unit were located from a multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiment to 2.7-Å resolution using SHELXD. Phases were calculated and extended to 2.1 Å with SHARP (22Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), refined by solvent flattening using SOLOMON (23Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) and further improved by likelihood-based density modification as implemented in RESOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Initially, the ARP/wARP Quick Fold tool (25Morris R.J. Zwart P.H. Cohen S. Fernandez F.J. Kakaris M. Kirillova O. Vonrhein C. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. J Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was used to build most helical parts of the structure. The six molecules embodied in the asymmetric unit were then built manually using COOT (26Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23040) Google Scholar). The structure was completed by iterative cycles of model building and crystallographic refinement with REFMAC5 (27Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13822) Google Scholar) using medium main chain and loose side chain non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. Final refinement was performed against the native data to 2.05-Å resolution without the use of non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. The structure of the tetragonal crystal form was subsequently solved by molecular replacement employing the program PHASER (28McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14292) Google Scholar) and a ClgR monomer from the solved monoclinic crystal structure as search model. The two molecules enclosed in the tetragonal asymmetric unit were refined with REFMAC5 to 1.75-Å resolution. The quality of the structures were verified with PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and Molprobity (30Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3001) Google Scholar). Comparisons of three-dimensional structures were performed with DALI (31Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were generated using ClustalW (32Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55425) Google Scholar) and ESPRIPT (33Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). Structure figures were created using the program PyMOL. 4DeLano, W. L. (2002) PyMOL, DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA. EMSAs—EMSAs were performed as described previously (35Wennerhold J. Krug A. Bott M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40500-40508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Different concentrations of purified ClgR were mixed with promoter DNA fragments of clpP1P2 and clpC (309 bp and 290 bp, respectively, final concentration 25 nm) containing the ClgR binding site (10Engels S. Schweitzer J.E. Ludwig C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Engels S. Ludwig C. Schweitzer J.E. Mack C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 576-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, in a total volume of 20 μl. A non-target promoter fragment from gene cg2311 (190 bp, final concentration 40 nm) was included as a negative control. The promoter DNA fragments were obtained by PCR using the following oligonucleotide pairs: 5′-TTCGGTGAAGAAGAAGTAGCTGAGAC and 5′-TGCGCTCACTCAGGAGGCGATCAAAG for clpP1P2, 5′-CCTGAACACGGCAAGGGTACCTC and 5′-GCGTGCACGATCGGTAAACCTCTC for clpC, and 5′-AGCTTCAGAGGAGCCTGAAGCGG and 5′-CGGAGTGGGTTGATTCTGGGATG for cg2311. After incubation of the DNA/ClgR mixtures for 30 min at room temperature, the samples were separated on a 12% native polyacrylamide gel, stained with Sybr-Green I, and photographed. Overall Structure—To confirm the DNA binding activity of ClgR as it was crystallized, EMSAs were performed with the promoter regions of the clpP1P2 and clpC genes containing the pseudo-palindromic ClgR binding sites. As shown in Fig. 1, ClgR is able to bind to the clpP1P2 promoter fragment in vitro without the requirement of an additional activator molecule or protein cofactor. A complete shift was observed at a 15-fold molar excess of ClgR, whereas the cg2311 promoter fragment serving as negative control was not shifted even at a 63-fold molar excess. Similar results as with the clpP1P2 promoter fragment were obtained with the clpC promoter fragment (data not shown). The structure of the ClgR monoclinic crystal form was determined to a resolution of 2.05 Å. Six ClgR monomers are present in the asymmetric unit containing 4-7 additional residues of the C-terminal StrepTag-II. Chain A comprises residues 21-114, chain B residues 19-111, chain C residues 23-112, chain D residues 20-112, chain E residues 19-112, and chain F residues 21-113. Altogether, the final model consists of 557 amino acid residues, 3 MPD molecules, 1 acetate ion, and 188 water molecules. The side chains of some polar residues at the protein surface are invisible in the electron density and were therefore refined as alanines. All residues are in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot (36Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3818) Google Scholar), 99.5% of those are in the most favorite regions. The structure of the tetragonal crystal form was refined to a resolution of 1.75 Å. Here, the asymmetric unit contains two monomers (chains A and B) comprising residues 22-98 and 19-96, respectively, 5 glycerol molecules and 156 water molecules. Except for Lys-19 at the N terminus of subunit B, which was refined as an alanine, all side chains could be built in the electron density. All residues are in the most favorite region of the Ramachandran plot. Refinement statistics of the two models are summarized in Table 1. The ClgR monomer folds into a five-helix bundle (Fig. 2), of which helix2 (H2) and helix3 (H3) build a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif typical for DNA-binding proteins comprising residues 44-64. H3 (Ser-54 to Gly-64) is the putative DNA-recognition helix. In the monoclinic crystal form (Fig. 2, A and B) a long C-terminal α-helix (H5) is formed by residues 84-107 and continued by the additional C-terminal residues representing the two linker amino acids (Leu-108 and Glu-109) and part of the StrepTag-II (residues 110-114). Of the six monomers embodied in the asymmetric unit, molecules A and E and molecules B and C form two physiological dimers, respectively, and molecules D and F each form half of a dimer, which is completed by their symmetry equivalents. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal H5 helices are involved in crystal contacts forming extensive hydrophobic interactions with each other. The H5 helices of subunits A and B build a coiled-coil as do the H5 of subunits C and D, and E and F, respectively. Remarkably, the C-terminal StrepTag-II residues (residues 108-114) contribute to the crystal contacts by composing short four-helix bundles with the H5 helices of the neighboring dimer and its coiled-coil partner. The subsequently solved tetragonal crystals contain two monomers per asymmetric unit, which form a physiological dimer. Overall, the structure is the same five-helix bundle as seen in the monoclinic crystals showing <1 Å root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.s) of Cα atoms. However, substantial differences occur at the C termini of the polypeptides. Here, the C-terminal helices H5 and H5′ are considerably shorter, only comprising residues 84-95 (Fig. 2, C and D). The C-terminal residues 99-107 of chain A and 97-107 of chain E are invisible in the electron density. Dimer Structure—The previous finding that ClgR binds to pseudo-palindromic DNA sequences (13Engels S. Ludwig C. Schweitzer J.E. Mack C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 576-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) already suggested that ClgR binds to DNA as a dimer. Gel-filtration experiments confirmed that ClgR as used for the gel-shift assay shown in Fig. 1 is a dimer in solution (data not shown). In the crystal structures, the physiological dimers are immediately recognizable by their tight dimer interface burying 740 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface per monomer, of which 67% is of hydrophobic nature. Furthermore, the relative positioning of the two DNA-binding helices H3 and H3′ in a distance of ∼30 Å from each other indicates that H3 and H3′ could well bind into two adjacent major grooves of slightly bent canonical B-DNA (Fig. 2). An electrostatic potential calculation shows that the surface of H3 and H3′ displays a positive electrostatic potential whereas the rest of the molecule predominantly exhibits a negative electrostatic potential (data not shown). The dimer interface is composed of a number of polar and non-polar contacts (indicated in Fig. 3). On the dimer surface opposite to the C-terminal H5 and H5′ helices, several hydrophilic interactions are formed by residues of the N-terminal regions of H4 and of the loops between helices H3 and H4, and by the N-terminal ends of the first helices H1 (Fig. 4). The side chain of Glu-67 forms two hydrogen bonds with Ser-70, one with the main-chain amide group and one with the side-chain hydroxyl group. The Ser-70 side chain is in addition the acceptor of a hydrogen bond with the main-chain amide nitrogen of Arg-26. The side chain of Arg-26 forms a salt bridge with the carboxyl group of Glu-71. Additionally, the carbonyl moiety of Glu-22 forms two hydrogen bonds with the main-chain amino group of Val-84 and Ala-85 located at the beginning of the C-terminal helix H5. These interactions are formed by both subunits and follow the internal 2-fold symmetry of the dimer. Moreover, there is a strong network of hydrophobic contacts in the core of the dimer involving residues of helices H1 (Leu-25 and Leu-29), H4 (Leu-73 and Ala-74), and H5 (Val-84, Leu-88, and Ile-89). These interactions between physiological dimers are present in all three dimers of the monoclinic crystal form as well as in the dimer solved from the tetragonal crystals. The only exceptions are the hydrogen bonds between Glu-22 and the main-chain nitrogens of residues 84 and 85, which in the tetragonal structure are formed only on one side of the dimer. A multiple sequence alignment of ClgR and homologous proteins (Fig. 3) shows that, except Glu-22, which is an alani"
https://openalex.org/W1964262438,"The S4 transmembrane domain in Shaker (Kv1) voltage-sensitive potassium channels has four basic residues (R1–R4) that are responsible for carrying the majority of gating charge. In Kv4 channels, however, R1 is replaced by a neutral valine at position 287. Among other differences, Kv4 channels display prominent closed state inactivation, a mechanism which is minimal in Shaker. To determine if the absence of R1 is responsible for important variation in gating characteristics between the two channel types, we introduced the V287R mutant into Kv4.3 and analyzed its effects on several voltage sensitive gating transitions. We found that the mutant increased the voltage sensitivity of steady-state activation and altered the kinetics of activation and deactivation processes. Although the kinetics of macroscopic inactivation were minimally affected, the characteristics of closed-state inactivation and recovery from open and closed inactivated states were significantly altered. The absence of R1 can only partially account for differences in the effective voltage sensitivity of gating between Shaker and Kv4.3. These results suggest that the S4 domain serves an important functional role in Kv4 channel activation and deactivation processes, and also those of closed-state inactivation and recovery."
