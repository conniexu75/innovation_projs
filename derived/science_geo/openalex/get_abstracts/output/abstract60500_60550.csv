https://openalex.org/W2044573154,"A formula for diference between amino acids combines properties that correlate best with protein residue substitution frequencies: composition, polarity, and molecular volume. Substitution frequencies agree much better with overall chemical difference between exchanging residues than with minimum base changes between their codons. Correlation coefficients show that fixation of mutations between dissimilar amino acids is generally rare."

Learning to sample odor cues before responding and adoption of a ""win-stay, lose-shift"" strategy probably accounts for the virtually errorless learning. Learning-set performance of rats trained with odor stimulus comparable to that reported for primates trained on visual cues."
https://openalex.org/W1564265361,"Abstract The alanine apolipoprotein (apoLp-Ala) was isolated from patients with familial hyperlipoproteinemia (type V). ApoLp-Ala is a single chain protein of 79 amino acids with a single carbohydrate side chain containing 1 mole each of galactosamine and galactose, and 0 to 2 moles of sialic acid per mole of protein. The complete amino acid sequence of apoLp-Ala was determined by manual and automated Edman degradations of the intact protein, and tryptic and succinylated tryptic peptides. The NH2-terminal residue is serine, the COOH-terminal residue alanine. The carbohydrate moiety is attached to threonine at position 74 in the sequence. The amino acid sequence of apoLp-Ala contains no long sequences of hydrophobic residues which contrasts with the linear amphipathic regions present in the two integral membrane proteins cytochrome b5 and glycophorin."

Bone resorption was enhanced with unheated normal rabbit serum as compared to heated serum or serum from rabbits lacking the sixth component of complement (C6). Addition of functionally purified C6 restored resorptive activity in C6-deficient serum. Concentrations of prostaglandin E were increased in the culture media of bones incubated with complement-sufficient serum. The resorptive effects of active serum as well as the appearance of prostaglandin E in the media were inhibited by indomethacin.

https://openalex.org/W2084401927,"Ashestiform amphibole minerals, which have been demonstrated to be associated with human health problems, have been detected in substantial quantities in municipal water supplies taken from western Lake Superior Water. The total concentrationl of amphibole minerals in the Duluth, Minnesota, water supply, as measured by x-ray diffraction for daily samples of suspended solids averages 0.19 milligram per liter with large fluctuations due to seasonal and climatological effects on lake circulation. Electron microscopic examination of these water samples confirms the presence of asbestiform amphibole fibers. A conservatiue estimate of the fiber count for 1973 Duluth water supply samples is (1 to 30) x 10(6) amphibole fibers identifiable by electron diffraction per liter of water with a mass concentration of 1 to 30 micrograms per liter."

https://openalex.org/W1534756035,"Abstract Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of 5'-AMP were examined over a concentration range of 0.001 to 2.2 m in the Fourier mode in the 1H and 1H-{31P} configuration and were analyzed by computer simulation. The principal conclusions with respect to the solution conformation of 5'-AMP are as follows. (a) The exocyclic C(5')—O(5') and C(4')—C(5') bonds are flexible, and preferentially exist in the gauche-gauche conformation with a W relationship across H(4')—C(4')—C(5')—O(5')—P(5') in which the above atoms lie in one plane as in its crystal structure. (b) The ribose moiety exists as a flexible ring system undergoing interconversion between the 3E and 2E conformations. The sugar ring conformation is strongly concentration dependent, being 63 ± 10% 2E and 37 ± 10% 3E at concentrations below 0.01 m. At higher concentrations, the population of the 3E form increases at the expense of the 2E form, and at 2.0 m, 3E is the preferred conformation. In the solid state the conformation of the sugar ring is 3E for 5'-AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1517966804,"Abstract Pentapeptides containing either l-methionine, l-proline, l-arginine, or l-lysine as central residue in the pattern glycylglycyl-X-glycylglycine have been studied at natural abundance by proton-decoupled 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Resonances were assigned in most cases by comparison with the free amino acids and by detailed observation of change in chemical shift with pH over the range 1.09 to 12.47. The ratio of trans to cis isomers with respect to the -Gly-Pro- bond was approximately 9:1 as judged by the presence of resonance pairs for Cα, Cβ, Cγ, and Cδ of the pyrrolidine ring. Chemical shift assignments for the lysine peptide were made by comparison with the free amino acids l-lysine and l-δ-hydroxylysine and were confirmed by pH effects and spin-lattice relaxation times (T1). The effect of varying the nature of the central residue on the chemical shifts of the flanking glycine residues was small except for l-proline. Each pentapeptide resonance was categorized according to the degree of sensitivity to the state of protonation of terminal and side chain groups, and pK values at 26° for those groups were determined. The pK value for the e-amino group of the lysine peptide was 10.47. The pattern of grading of T1 values within each peptide backbone and the side chains of methionine, arginine, and lysine reflects substantial rotational freedom for the peripheral protonated carbon nuclei. The T1 values for the pyrrolidine ring reflect elements of rotational anisotropy in the trans form of the proline pentapeptide. This evidence suggests that the conformational flexibility of the pyrrolidine ring is sterically hindered by the adjacent glycine residue on the NH2-terminal side."

https://openalex.org/W1557684437,"Abstract Sulfogalactosylsphingosine sulfatase activity was demonstrated in cultured human skin fibroblasts using 35S-labeled sulfogalactosylsphingosine as the substrate. The pH optimum of the enzyme was 4.5. The reaction was linear up to 2 hours and the rate was proportional to the amount of enzyme added. The Km of the enzyme was 3.32 x 10-4 m. Taurodeoxycholate, taurocholate, deoxycholate, and cholic acid stimulated enzyme activity. Taurodeoxycholate had the greatest effect. Tween 80 and Triton X-100 had no effect. Mn2+ increased the enzyme activity 2-fold, whereas Hg2+, Cu2+, Ba2+, and Zn2+ were all inhibitory. The isoelectric point of the enzyme, determined by isoelectric focusing, was 4.8. Sulfogalactosylceramide was a competitive inhibitor with an inhibition constant of 0.2 x 10-3 m. The above properties and kinetics of sulfogalactosylsphingosine sulfatase were identical with those of sulfogalactosylceramide sulfatase except for minor differences in the effects of detergents and ions. Both enzymes were deficient in fibroblasts from patients with classical metachromatic leukodystrophy or with a variant form of metachromatic leukodystrophy characterized by multiple sulfatase deficiencies. These findings suggest that the same enzyme may be capable of degrading both sulfogalactosylsphingosine and sulfogalactosylceramide. The implication of this observation in relation to the degradation of sulfogalactosylceramide and to the pathogenesis of metachromatic leukodystrophy is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2019918717,THE primary response to human serum albumin (HSA) in the 6 to 10-week-old fowl is characterised by an early and accelerating rise in antibody level to a peak at about 9 d followed by an abrupt decline1. Comparison of the kinetics of this decline from the peak gave a close correspondence between it and the curve of decline of passively transfused labelled homologous 7S immunoglobulin. It seems clear that antibody production has been switched off before the peak and little ensues thereafter. The primary haemagglutinin response to sheep erythrocytes has a similar shape but the peak is earlier (Fig. 1)2. The in vivo suppressive effect is attributed to the negative feedback inhibition of the 7S antibody product and is thought to operate by the process of segregation of B cells into germinal centres2.

Calculations show that anesthesia occurs at an expansion of 1.1 percent and convulsions at a compression of 0.85 percent, the latter site of action being more compressible."

https://openalex.org/W2085763795,Urine formation in antarctic bony fish does not involve glomerular filtration. Evidence for aglomerularism came from both direct observation of kidney serial sections by light microscopy and the low concentrations of inulin labeled with carbon-14 that were excreted into the urine when this renal clearance tracer was injected into the bloodstream via a cannula implanted in the caudal vein. Aglomerularism most likely prevents urinary loss of glycoproteins with biological antifreeze properties.

https://openalex.org/W1490399344,"Abstract The interaction of pyruvate carboxylase purified from chicken liver with univalent and divalent metal ion activators has been investigated by a steady state kinetic analysis and also by examination of the effect of these activators on the rate of inactivation observed on incubation at 2°. Previous studies (Barden, R. E., Fung, C.-H., Utter, M. F., and Scrutton, M. C. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 1323) have shown that each active site on this enzyme is composed of two functionally distinct catalytic subsites which are linked by a biotinyl residue which serves as carboxyl carrier. In the present studies the kinetic analysis indicates that the divalent metal ion activator (Mg2+) interacts only at the subsite which catalyzes the carboxylation of the biotinyl residue. This observation is consistent with the results of previously reported isotope exchange studies (Scrutton, M. C., Keech, D. B., and Utter, M. F. (1965) J. Biol. Chem. 240, 574). In contrast, the univalent metal ion activator (K+) appears to interact at both the carboxylation subsite and also the subsite which catalyzes the transfer of the carboxyl group from the carboxylated biotinyl residue to pyruvate. The binding of MgATP2- to the enzyme strongly enhances the binding of Mg2+, and vice versa; a similar relationship exists between K+ and HCO3-. In the latter case the kinetic data indicate an equilibrium-ordered mechanism of addition with HCO3- adding first. Interaction of the enzyme with K+ markedly enhances the interaction with Mg2+, and vice versa. However, only a minimal enhancement of interactions is observed in the case of the K+-acetyl coenzyme A pair. When Mg2+ and acetyl-CoA are varied as an activator-activator pair, the initial rate versus [Mg2+] profile exhibits a significant extent of positive cooperativity in the presence of nonsaturating concentrations of acetyl-CoA but approaches classical behavior as acetyl-CoA is increased to saturation. Variation of Mg2+ does not, however, alter the extent of positive cooperativity which characterizes activation by acetyl-CoA. When catalytic activity is measured in the presence of various alkylammonium cations, the data obtained suggest that pyruvate carboxylase from chicken liver may catalyze a small but significant rate of oxalacetate synthesis in the absence of an added activating univalent cation. K+, NH4+, Rb+, Cs+, and T1+ are effective activators of this enzyme. Other univalent cations act either as weak activators (Tris+), or as noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to activation by K+ (Li+, Na+)."

https://openalex.org/W1551476815,"The following sequence has been derived for the myoglobin of the California sea lion: [see PDF for sequence]. The sequence differs from that of harbor seal myoglobin at 17 positions and from that of sperm whale myoglobin at 27 positions. By comparison with these and other myoglobins it appears that those residues that in the sperm whale protein make direct contact with the heme or are directed inward are most closely conserved, followed by residues in the nonhelical regions, lastly followed by those in helical segments. The methodology made use of cleavages by trypsin, thermolysin, chymotrypsin, or cyanogen bromide, with or without exhaustive carboxymethylation of the apomyoglobin substrate. Sequence were determined by Edman degradation, both manual and automated, with frequent use of aminopeptidase M and carboxypeptidase C."
https://openalex.org/W1487692282,"Abstract Galactosyltransferases that catalyze the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to galactosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and ganglioside GalNAcβ1 →4(NANα2 →3)-Galβ1 →4Glc →ceramide (Gm2) were measured in rat tissues as a function of development; the subcellular distribution of these enzymes was also determined. The novel galactosyltransferase catalyzing the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to galactosylceramide has been characterized. The enzyme attached the terminal galactose in an α linkage; it required Mn2+ for activity and showed a pH optimum of 6.0. The enzyme was detected in extracts obtained from kidney, but not from any other tissue tested. The galactosyltransferase attaching the terminal galactose in triglycosylceramide was also studied. The anomeric configuration of the terminal galactose in the triglycosylceramide was found to be α. Since the two transferases are both active with acceptor lipids containing terminal β-galactosyl units, the substrate specificities of these transferases must be defined by a structure larger than the ultimate glycosyl unit. These two transferases were differentiated from a third galactosyltransferase catalyzing the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to ganglioside Gm2. High activities of this enzyme were demonstrated in spleen and liver. A relationship between the concentration of detergent and the enzyme concentration required for optimal reaction rate was found. In view of this finding, the limited value of classical kinetics in the examination of glycolipid transferases is emphasized."

https://openalex.org/W42086742,The stoichiometric formation of ATP from adenosine 3′ : 5′-monophosphate and PPi was established using a homogeneous adenylate cyclase preparation from Brevibacterium liquefaciens. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated based on the measurement of equilibrium constants of the reaction. The standard Gibb's free energy change (ΔG0′) for the conversion of ATP to adenosine 3′ : 5′-monophosphate and PPi varied as a function of pH and was + 0.8 to 2.1 Cal per mole between pH 7.7 and 6.2 at 25° in the presence of 5 m m MgSO4. This indicates that the formation of adenosine 3′ : 5′-monophosphate from ATP is an endergonic reaction. The standard enthalpy change of the formation of adenosine 3′ : 5′-monophosphate and PPi from ATP at pH 7.3 was determined to be +5.0 Cal per mole according to the measurement of equilibrium constants as a function of temperature. The standard entropy change of the conversion of ATP to adenosine 3′ : 5′monophosphate and PPi was calculated to be 12.4 e.u. at pH 7.3.

https://openalex.org/W1555939384,"Abstract Complexes between chicken ovoinhibitor (OI) and porcine trypsin were allowed to dissociate in the presence of the active site titrant, p-nitrophenyl p'-guanidinobenzoate, which reacts extremely rapidly with free active trypsin (T). The rate of the slower, postburst reaction with titrant, which is a measure of the rate of dissociation of the complexes, showed a distinct break not observed previously with bovine trypsin (Zahnley, J. C., and Davis, J. G. (1970) Biochemistry 9, 1428–1433). The OI-trypsin complexes dissociate according to the scheme OI-T2 ⇌ OI-T ⇌ OI + T + T With porcine trypsin, rate constants for dissociation of the OI-T2 and OI-T complexes were 7.5 x 10-2 and 4 to 8 x 10-4 s-1, respectively. The OI-T2 complex obtained with porcine trypsin dissociated 6 to 8 times faster than that obtained with bovine trypsin, perhaps reflecting structural differences between the two trypsins. The greater ratio of dissociation rate constants, kd, with porcine trypsin (g 100, against 9 for bovine trypsin) shows clearly that the two binding sites for trypsin on the single polypeptide chain of chicken ovoinhibitor are not equivalent. This appears to be due to intrinsic differences between the two sites, rather than to changes induced by the binding of the first trypsin molecule. An association rate constant, ka, of 8 x 104 m-1 s-1 for formation of the OI-bovine trypsin (1:1) complex was calculated from the inhibition constant (Ki) and the kd. This value of ka is lower than those previously reported for other naturally occurring trypsin inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1668911152,"Abstract Conformational studies have been carried out on two lysozyme derivatives in which the carboxyl groups of aspartic acid 119 and the COOH-terminal leucine 129 were coupled, after carbodiimide activation, with glycine methyl ester (i.e. (GlyMe)2-Lysoz) or with histidine methyl ester (i.e. (HisMe)2-Lysoz). No changes were observed in the spectral and sedimentation behaviors of the two derivatives relative to those of lysozyme. In ORD measurements the rotatory behaviors of lysozyme and (GlyMe)2-Lysoz were identical both at the negative minimum at 233 nm and at the positive 199-nm extremum. Also, their b0 values were identical. On the other hand, (HisMe)2-Lysoz showed a decrease in the ORD parameters of [m']233, [m']199, and b0 values. The rotatory behaviors of the derivatives were also determined over a wide pH range. It was significant that the ORD parameters of (GlyMe)2-Lysoz and lysozyme were equal throughout the pH range 2 to 11. At a given pH, the corresponding parameters of (HisMe)2-Lysoz were lower. In circular dichroism measurements, the [θ'] values at the negative ellipticity bands at 208 and 220 nm for lysozyme and (GlyMe)2-Lysoz were equal. The ellipticity values for (HisMe)2-Lysoz were suppressed appreciably relative to lysozyme. Although no conformational differences between lysozyme and (GlyMe)2-Lysoz were observed by ORD and CD measurements, some differences were detectable by chemical monitoring of the conformation. Accessibility to tryptic hydrolysis was appreciably increased in (GlyMe)2-Lysoz (1.15 bonds per mole of protein), and more greatly in the (HisMe)2-Lysoz derivative (3.83 bonds) relative to lysozyme (0.14 bond). Also, there was an appreciable increase in the reducibility of the disulfide bonds in (GlyMe)2-Lysoz (0.29 bond) and (HisMe)2-Lysoz (1.1 bonds) relative to native lysozyme (0.03 bond). The enzymic activity of each derivative retained the same pH optimum as native lysozyme but was decreased drastically. The results are valuable for understanding the immunochemistry of the derivatives. Also, the contribution of the interactions of the modified carboxyl groups to the three-dimensional structure in solution and its relation to the crystalline structure are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2413917994,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxytransphosphorylase from Propionibacterium shermanii catalyzes the conversion of P-enolpyruvate, orthophosphate, and CO2 to oxalacetate and pyrophosphate. The enzyme occurs in three enzymatically active forms, tetramer, dimer, and monomer, but only the tetrameric and monomeric forms have been isolated from the bacteria. The dimeric form was initially observed by Haberland et al. (Haberland, M. E., Willard, J. M., and Wood, H. G. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 712–722) in reacting enzyme sedimentation centrifugation, and it was shown that dissociation of the tetrameric enzyme and association of monomeric enzyme to dimeric forms occurred during catalysis of the forward reaction. We have now shown that the association-dissociation is not caused by the substrates but by the product, oxalacetate. When the forward reaction is conducted in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, which oxidizes oxalacetate to malonate, no dimer formation is observed. In addition to oxalacetate, malate and fumarate induce the subunit interactions. Our results show that the dimeric species is less active than the tetrameric species. Preincubation of the tetrameric enzyme at dilute concentrations in malate buffer results in a loss of 50% of the activity within 5 min. This loss in activity is strongly dependent on the concentration of protein, there being less loss of activity with higher concentrations of protein in the malate buffer. The tetramer-dimer interaction is in equilibrium since only a single peak is observed on centrifugation in malate buffer, and as the protein concentration of the tetrameric form is decreased the s20, obs value decreases until it approaches that of the dimer. At the same time, there is a loss in enzymatic activity which correlates with the increase in the dimeric form. The monomeric species has a specific activity about one-fourth that of the tetrameric species, and the activity is not affected by the presence of malate although there is total conversion of monomeric into dimeric species. The continued presence of an effector is required for maintenance of the dimeric species from either tetramer or monomer. Sedimentation equilibrium studies in malate buffer gave a molecular weight of 224,000 for the dimeric species formed from monomeric enzyme. When tetrameric enzyme was employed a nonlinear log Y versus r2 plot was observed reflecting the equilibrium between tetramers and dimers induced by the presence of an effector. The malate-treated tetrameric enzyme is more susceptible to proteolytic attack by trypsin and chymotrypsin than the untreated enzyme. It is proposed that the ligand-induced subunit interactions play a role in the control of the propionic acid fermentation."
