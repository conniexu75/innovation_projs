https://openalex.org/W2889423013,"Patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have significantly benefited from the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, long-term efficacy of these therapies is limited due to de novo resistance (~30%) as well as acquired resistance. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factors (EMT-TFs), have been identified as drivers of EMT-mediated resistance to EGFR TKIs, however, strategies to target EMT-TFs are lacking. As the third generation EGFR TKI, osimertinib, has now been adopted in the first-line setting, the frequency of T790M mutations will significantly decrease in the acquired resistance setting. Previously less common mechanisms of acquired resistance to first generation EGFR TKIs including EMT are now being observed at an increased frequency after osimertinib. Importantly, there are no other FDA approved targeted therapies after progression on osimertinib. Here, we investigated a novel strategy to overcome EGFR TKI resistance through targeting the EMT-TF, TWIST1, in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. We demonstrated that genetic silencing of TWIST1 or treatment with the TWIST1 inhibitor, harmine, resulted in growth inhibition and apoptosis in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. TWIST1 overexpression resulted in erlotinib and osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. Conversely, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of TWIST1 in EGFR TKI-resistant EGFR-mutant cells increased sensitivity to EGFR TKIs. TWIST1-mediated EGFR TKI resistance was due in part to TWIST1 suppression of transcription of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only gene, BCL2L11 (BIM), by directly binding to BCL2L11 intronic regions and promoter. As such, pan-BCL2 inhibitor treatment overcame TWIST1-mediated EGFR TKI resistance and were more effective in the setting of TWIST1 overexpression. Finally, in a mouse model of autochthonous EGFR-mutant lung cancer, Twist1 overexpression resulted in erlotinib resistance and suppression of erlotinib-induced apoptosis. These studies establish TWIST1 as a driver of resistance to EGFR TKIs and provide rationale for use of TWIST1 inhibitors or BCL2 inhibitors as means to overcome EMT-mediated resistance to EGFR TKIs."

Although both c-Myc and EZH2 have been implicated in regulating cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer, the interplay between these two regulators is poorly understood. Using RNA sequence analysis (RNA-seq), for the first time we find that miR-137 level is extremely low in cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cells, correlating with higher levels of c-Myc and EZH2 expression. Further analyses indicate that in resistant cells c-Myc enhances the expression of EZH2 by directly suppressing miR-137 that targets EZH2 mRNA, and increased expression of EZH2 activates cellular survival pathways, resulting in the resistance to cisplatin. Inhibition of c-Myc-miR-137-EZH2 pathway re-sensitizes resistant cells to cisplatin. Both in vivo and in vitro analyses indicate that cisplatin treatment activates c-Myc-miR-137-EZH2 pathway. Importantly, elevated c-Myc-miR-137-EZH2 pathway in resistant cells is sustained by dual oxidase maturation factor 1 (DUOXA1)-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Significantly, clinical studies further confirm the activated c-Myc-miR-137-EZH2 pathway in platinum drug-resistant or recurrent ovarian cancer patients. Thus, our studies elucidate a novel role of miR-137 in regulating c-Myc-EZH2 axis that is crucial to the regulation of cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2888887765,"Macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia, M. tetraphylla and hybrids) is an Australian native nut crop and has a significant economic value in the food industries worldwide. Long juvenility along with traditional breeding strategies impede quick genetic improvement of this crop. The existing cultivars constitute only second to fourth generation of the wild germplasm in the rainforest. The utilisation of molecular markers for genomic selection and genome-wide association studies may accelerate genetic gains. Identification of a robust, reproducible, and cost-effective marker system is instrumental in increasing the efficiency of genomic studies. This study is the first to report the potential of two ultra-high-throughput diversity array technology (DArT) markers (silicoDArT and SNP) in macadamia. Both markers were used to identify the genetic diversity and population structure in 80 macadamia cultivars. Parentage analysis of 25 scions in a rootstock trial was conducted to confirm plant identity where recorded identities did not corroborate with phenotypic field observations. A total of 22,280 silicoDArT and 7,332 SNP markers were reported, of which 11,526 silicoDArT and 3,956 SNP markers were used for analyses after screening with quality control parameters including >95% call rate, >95% reproducibility, and >0.05 one ratio. The average polymorphic information content (PIC) values of silicoDArT and SNP markers were 0.29 and 0.21, respectively. Genetic variance among the cultivars ranged from 0.003 to 0.738 in silicoDArT and 0.004 to 0.412 in SNP markers. Four distinct population groups were identified from SNP data analysis. Most of the accessions used in this study were descended from two or more populations. Cluster analysis clearly separated genotypes of distinct origins, such as the Hawaii Agricultural Experiment Station and Hidden Valley Plantation accessions. Two wild accessions of Macadamia jansenii and M. ternifolia were found to be distantly related to the cultivars. Wild germplasm individuals and their hybrids with cv. ‘660’ formed separate clusters, suggesting that crossing between wild and cultivated genepools can extend genetic diversity. DArTseq-based SNP markers were successfully utilized to confirm the genetic identity of 25 scions in a rootstock trial. Our study suggests that DArT platforms are a robust system for the facilitation of genomic studies with regard to macadamia."
https://openalex.org/W2889351714,"To evaluate the effects of person-centred support via telephone in two chronically ill patient groups, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or chronic heart failure (CHF).221 patients ≥ 50 years with COPD and/or CHF were randomized to usual care vs. usual care plus a person-centred telephone-support intervention and followed for six months. Patients in the intervention group were telephoned by a registered nurse initially to co-create a person-centred health plan with the patient and subsequently to discuss and evaluate the plan. The primary outcome measure was a composite score comprising General Self-Efficacy (GSE), re-hospitalization and death. Patients were classified as deteriorated if GSE had decreased by ≥ 5 points, or if they had been re-admitted to hospital for unscheduled reasons related to COPD and/or CHF or if they had died.At six-month follow-up no difference in the composite score was found between the two study groups (57.6%, n = 68 vs. 46.6%, n = 48; OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 0.9-2.7; P = 0.102) in the intention-to-treat analysis (n = 221); however, significantly more patients in the control group showed a clinically important decrease in GSE (≥ 5 units) (22.9%, n = 27 vs. 9.7%, n = 10; OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.3-6.0; P = 0.011). There were 49 clinical events (14 deaths, 35 re-admissions) in the control group and 41 in the intervention group (9 deaths, 32 re-admissions). Per-protocol analysis (n = 202) of the composite score showed that more patients deteriorated in the control group than in the intervention group (57.6%, n = 68 vs. 42.9%, n = 36; OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.2; P = 0.039).Person-centred support via telephone mitigates worsening self-efficacy without increasing the risk of clinical events in chronically ill patients with CHF and/or COPD. This indicates that a patient-healthcare professional partnership may be established without the need for face-to-face consultations, even in vulnerable patient groups.ISRCTN.com ISRCTN55562827."

https://openalex.org/W2889455089,"Translation of radiomics into the clinic may require a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying morphologic tissue characteristics they reflect. In the context of prostate cancer (PCa), some studies have correlated gross histological measurements of gland lumen, epithelium, and nuclei with disease appearance on MRI. Quantitative histomorphometry (QH), like radiomics for radiologic images, is the computer based extraction of features for describing tumor morphology on digitized tissue images. In this work, we attempt to establish the histomorphometric basis for radiomic features for prostate cancer by (1) identifying the radiomic features from T2w MRI most discriminating of low vs. intermediate/high Gleason score, (2) identifying QH features correlated with the most discriminating radiomic features previously identified, and (3) evaluating the discriminative ability of QH features found to be correlated with spatially co-localized radiomic features. On a cohort of 36 patients (23 for training, 13 for validation), Gabor texture features were identified as being most predictive of Gleason grade on MRI (AUC of 0.69) and gland lumen shape features were identified as the most predictive QH features (AUC = 0.75). Our results suggest that the PCa grade discriminability of Gabor features is a consequence of variations in gland shape and morphology at the tissue level."
https://openalex.org/W2888959026,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is associated with poor prognosis and is often untreatable. MicroRNA 483-3p (miR-483) and partitioning-defective 3 (Pard3), a member of the Pard family, have functions and regulatory mechanisms in ATC. The abnormal regulation of miR-483 may play an important role in tumorigenesis, and Par3 is known to regulate cell polarity, cell migration, and cell division. Tumor proliferation promoted by the regulation of miRNA expression can be regulated in thyroid cancer by upregulating transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), which is thought to interact with Pard3. When compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues, we found that miR-483 was upregulated and Pard3 was downregulated in 80 thyroid tumor samples. Disease-free survival was decreased when expression of miR-483 was upregulated and Pard3 expression was downregulated. Cell growth, migration, and invasion were induced by overexpression of miR-483. However, knockdown of miR-483 resulted in a loss of cell invasion and viability, both in vitro and in vivo. The expression of Pard3 was increased by the inhibition of miR-483, but TGF-β1-induced cell migration and invasion were decreased by miR-483 inhibition. A dual-luciferase reporter assay determined that Pard3 expression was downregulated when targeted with miR-483. The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), as well as Tiam1-Rac signaling, was induced by TGF-β1, which was decreased by the overexpression of Pard3. Pard3 decreased the inhibition of EMT and Tiam-Rac1 signaling, which resulted from transfection of ATC cells with miR-483. Overall, the results showed that downregulation of Pard3 resulted in increased cell invasion and EMT in ATC, which was promoted by treatment with miR-483. These findings suggest novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2888971852,"Food webs are an integral part of every ecosystem on the planet, yet understanding the mechanisms shaping these complex networks remains a major challenge. Recently, several studies suggested that non-trophic species interactions such as habitat modification and mutualisms can be important determinants of food web structure. However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across ecosystems, and whether non-trophic interactions affect food webs randomly, or affect specific trophic levels or functional groups. Here, we combine analyses of 58 food webs from seven terrestrial, freshwater and coastal systems to test (1) the general hypothesis that non-trophic facilitation by habitat-forming foundation species enhances food web complexity, and (2) whether these enhancements have either random or targeted effects on particular trophic levels, functional groups, and linkages throughout the food web. Our empirical results demonstrate that foundation species consistently enhance food web complexity in all seven ecosystems. Further analyses reveal that 15 out of 19 food web properties can be well-approximated by assuming that foundation species randomly facilitate species throughout the trophic network. However, basal species are less strongly, and carnivores are more strongly facilitated in foundation species' food webs than predicted based on random facilitation, resulting in a higher mean trophic level and a longer average chain length. Overall, we conclude that foundation species strongly enhance food web complexity through non-trophic facilitation of species across the entire trophic network. We therefore suggest that the structure and stability of food webs often depends critically on non-trophic facilitation by foundation species."

This unusual mode of cell division is controlled by a regulatory pathway composed of two evolutionarily conserved protein kinases, Polo-like kinase and Aurora B kinase, and three trypanosome-specific proteins, CIF1, CIF2, and CIF3, which act in concert at the cytokinesis initiation site located at the distal tip of the newly assembled flagellum attachment zone (FAZ). However, additional regulators that function in this cytokinesis signaling cascade remain to be identified and characterized. Using proximity biotinylation, co-immunofluorescence microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation, we identified 52 CIF1-associated proteins and validated six CIF1-interacting proteins, including the putative protein phosphatase KPP1, the katanin p80 subunit KAT80, the cleavage furrow–localized proteins KLIF and FRW1, and the FAZ tip–localized proteins FAZ20 and FPRC. Further analyses of the functional interplay between CIF1 and its associated proteins revealed a requirement of CIF1 for localization of a set of CIF1-associated proteins, an interdependence between KPP1 and CIF1, and an essential role of katanin in the completion of cleavage furrow ingression. Together, these results suggest that CIF1 acts as a master regulator of cytokinesis in T. brucei by recruiting a cohort of cytokinesis regulatory proteins to the cytokinesis initiation site.

https://openalex.org/W2889237955,"In a last few decades mushrooms are increasingly attracting attention as functional food and sources of biologically active compounds. Several Trametes species have been used for centuries in traditional medicine of East Asia cultures, but only T. versicolor was studied sufficiently while there are less substantial data about medicinal properties of other species. Trametes versicolor, T. hirsuta and T. gibbosa were the species tested for biological activities. Antifungal potentials of extracts were assessed for clinical strains of selected Candida and Aspergillus species. ABTS and FRAP assays were used to evaluate antioxidant capacities of studied extracts. Cytotoxic activity was determined against human cervix and lung adenocarcinoma and colon carcinoma cell lines. Antineurodegenerative activity was assessed by determining the rate of acetylcholinesterase and tyrosinase activity. The presence of metabolites in extracts of mycelia and basidiocarps of studied Trametes species was analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Studied extracts showed low antifungal potential in comparison with ketoconazole. Basidiocarp extracts were more effective ABTS+ scavengers and Fe2+ reducers than mycelium ones but less effective in comparison with L-ascorbic acid. Results showed that mycelium extracts had stronger cytotoxic effects against three cancer cell lines than basidiocarp ones, and that cervix adenocarcinoma cells were the most sensitive to the extracts and commercial cytostatics. T. versicolor mycelium extract was the most effective inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase activity but double weaker than galantamine, and T. gibbosa mycelium extract was significantly better inhibitor of tyrosinase activity than kojic acid for 40.9%. Chemical analysis indicated strong synergistic action of triterpenes, sugars and polyphenols in applied assays. The results suggest that tested Trametes species have significant medicinal potentials which could be attributed to antioxidative and cytotoxic activity. Additionally both, basidiocarps and mycelia extracts can strongly inhibit activity of acetylcholinesterase and tyrosinase."
https://openalex.org/W2889265328,"Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Heidelberg (S. Heidelberg) is a clinically-important serovar linked to food-borne illness, and commonly isolated from poultry. Investigations of a large, multistate outbreak in the USA in 2013 identified poultry litter (PL) as an important extra-intestinal environment that may have selected for specific S. Heidelberg strains. Poultry litter is a mixture of bedding materials and chicken excreta that contains chicken gastrointestinal (GI) bacteria, undigested feed, feathers, and other materials of chicken origin. In this study, we performed a series of controlled laboratory experiments which assessed the microevolution of two S. Heidelberg strains (SH-2813 and SH-116) in PL previously used to raise 3 flocks of broiler chickens. The strains are closely related at the chromosome level, differing from the reference genome by 109 and 89 single nucleotide polymorphisms/InDels, respectively. Whole genome sequencing was performed on 86 isolates recovered after 0, 1, 7 and 14 days of microevolution in PL. Only strains carrying an IncX1 (37kb), 2 ColE1 (4 and 6kb) and 1 ColpVC (2kb) plasmids survived more than 7 days in PL. Competition experiments showed that carriage of these plasmids was associated with increased fitness. This increased fitness was associated with an increased copy number of IncX1 and ColE1 plasmids. Further, all Col plasmid-bearing strains had hotspot mutations in 37 loci on the chromosome and in 3 loci on the IncX1 plasmid. Additionally, we observed a decrease in susceptibility to tobramycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, neomycin and fosfomycin for Col plasmid-bearing strains. Our study demonstrates how positive selection from poultry litter can change the evolutionary path of S. Heidelberg."
https://openalex.org/W2888974220,"Healthcare personnel are at high risk for exposure to influenza by direct and indirect contact, droplets and aerosols, and by aerosol generating procedures. Information on air and surface influenza contamination is needed to assist in developing guidance for proper prevention and control strategies. To understand the vulnerabilities of healthcare personnel, we measured influenza in the breathing zone of healthcare personnel, in air and on surfaces within a healthcare setting, and on filtering facepiece respirators worn by healthcare personnel when conducting patient care.Thirty participants were recruited from an adult emergency department during the 2015 influenza season. Participants wore personal bioaerosol samplers for six hours of their work shift, submitted used filtering facepiece respirators and medical masks and completed questionnaires to assess frequency and types of interactions with potentially infected patients. Room air samples were collected using bioaerosol samplers, and surface swabs were collected from high-contact surfaces within the adult emergency department. Personal and room bioaerosol samples, surface swabs, and filtering facepiece respirators were analyzed for influenza A by polymerase chain reaction.Influenza was identified in 42% (53/125) of personal bioaerosol samples, 43% (28/ 96) of room bioaerosol samples, 76% (23/30) of pooled surface samples, and 25% (3/12) of the filtering facepiece respirators analyzed. Influenza copy numbers were greater in personal bioaerosol samples (17 to 631 copies) compared to room bioaerosol samples (16 to 323 copies). Regression analysis suggested that the amount of influenza in personal samples was approximately 2.3 times the amount in room samples (Wald χ2 = 16.21, p<0.001).Healthcare personnel may encounter increased concentrations of influenza virus when in close proximity to patients. Occupations that require contact with patients are at an increased risk for influenza exposure, which may occur throughout the influenza season. Filtering facepiece respirators may become contaminated with influenza when used during patient care."
https://openalex.org/W2889412335,"In this research, a strain with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities was isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of hairtail (Trichiurus haumela) and identified as Bacillus siamensis JFL15 through morphological, 16S rRNA, and average nucleotide identity analyses. The genome of B. siamensis JFL15 was sequenced, and three gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of surfactin (srf), bacillibactin (dhb), and fengycin (fen) were predicted through antiSMASH analysis. The combined genomics-metabolics profiling of the strain revealed 20 active compounds, which belong to four main types of cyclic lipopeptides produced by Bacillus species: bacillibactin, iturin, fengycin, and surfactin. Among these lipopeptides, two high-purity antifungal components, namely, components b and c, were successfully identified as iturin A and bacillomycin F. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of iturin A for Magnapothe grisea, Rhizoctorzia solani, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides were 125.00, 62.50, and 125.00 μg/ml, respectively, whereas the MICs of bacillomycin F for these three organisms were 62.50, 31.25, and 62.50 μg/ml, respectively. The mechanism of bacillomycin F and iturin A against M. grisea was also investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the surface of the hypha treated with iturin A or bacillomycin F became sunk, lumpy, and wrinkled. The diversity of the identified and predicted compounds from B. siamensis JFL15 suggested that this strain might be a promising biocontrol agent for an effective and environmentally friendly control of pathogenic microorganisms.

Additionally, to determine population-specific seated/supine waist and abdominal circumference cutoffs, which may identify men at increased risk of cardiometabolic disease.Twenty-two men with chronic SCI underwent MRI scans, anthropometric measurements along with assessments of various cardiometabolic risk biomarkers. Pearson/part (accounting for age as a covariate) correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the associations between study variables. Abdominal and waist circumference cutoffs were extrapolated using the slope of linear regression equations.Seated/supine abdominal and waist circumferences were (P < 0.01) associated with MRI visceral fat cross-sectional area (VATCSA), VAT volume and CSA:TotalCSA. Low density lipoprotein, non-high-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol were positively associated with seated/supine abdominal and waist circumferences after controlling for age; r = 0.50-0.61, r = 0.46-0.58, r = 0.52-0.58, P < 0.05, respectively. Tumor necrosis factor alpha was associated with seated/supine abdominal and waist circumferences after accounting for age; r = 0.49-0.51 and r = 0.48-0.56, P < 0.05 respectively. The population-specific cutoffs were 86.5cm and 88.3cm for supine waist and abdominal circumferences, respectively, as well as 89cm and 101cm for seated waist and abdominal circumferences, respectively. After dichotomizing VATCSA (< or ≥ 100cm2), peak oxygen uptake, triglycerides, insulin sensitivity and glycated hemoglobin were different (P < 0.05) between groups. After dichotomizing (< or ≥ 86.5cm) supine waist circumference, VATCSA, triglycerides and insulin sensitivity were different (P < 0.05) between groups.Seated/supine circumferences are associated with both central adiposity and biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease risk in persons with SCI. Population-specific cutoffs are proposed herein to identify central adiposity and potential cardiometabolic disease risk after SCI."

The present study was conducted to analyze the bio-sorption characteristics of a strain (HM8) isolated from manganese ore wastes. Analytical data from the 16S rDNA sequence determination showed that the species, HM8, had a 99% similarity to Ralstonia pickettii. Results from the designed physiological, biochemical and isothermal adsorption tests indicated that HM8 did not only grow well at a Mn(II) concentration level of 10,000 mg/L but also removed 1,002.83 mg/L of Mn(II) from the bulk solution of the culture, showing that the isolated strain possessed strong capabilities to tolerate and remove Mn(II). In the isothermal bio-sorption experiments performed to investigate the effects of relevant factors on Mn(II) sorption, the highest Mn(II) removal rate was obtained at the contact time 72 h, temperature 40°C, and pH 6.0, while the differences in both strain growth and Mn(II) removal rate between different inoculated HM8 doses were found to be insignificant within the tested range. Scanning electron microscopy showed that, under Mn(II) stress, HM8 cells appeared irregular and cracked, with apparent wrinkles on the surface. The peaks in the Fourier transform infrared spectra showed that hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were the main functional groups for Mn(II) adsorption. The experimental data supported the practical application of HM8 as a biological adsorbent for remediation of heavily Mn contaminated sites."
https://openalex.org/W2889507069,"Background and aims In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the impact of established cardiovascular risk factors and disease-related factors on the risk of acute arterial events is still unclear. We aimed to identify risk factors of acute arterial events in patients with IBD. Methods All consecutive patients followed at Saint-Antoine Hospital between 1996 and 2015 with subsequent occurrence of acute arterial events (acute coronary syndrome or ischemic stroke) were identified. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, treatment exposure, systemic inflammation (mean serum CRP level greater than or equal to 5 mg/L) and IBD clinical activity were assessed. A nested case-control study was performed including cases and controls without arterial ischemic event, matched on age, gender, and disease extent. Results A total of 30 patients (median age at acute vascular event occurrence: 42 years (interquartile range: 25–59)) developed acute coronary syndrome (n = 22) or ischemic stroke (n = 8). In univariate analysis, clinical disease activity and the persistence of systemic inflammation, diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension were significantly associated with an increased risk of acute arterial events. Neither protective nor aggravating effects associated with treatment exposure were identified. In multivariate analysis, the presence of diabetes (Odds ratio (OR): 14.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1–184.7) and clinical disease activity (OR: 10.4, 95% CI: 2.1–49.9) remained significantly associated with the risk of acute arterial event. Conclusion Disease activity may have an independent impact on the risk of acute arterial events in patients with IBD. These findings may highlight new potential benefits of optimizing anti-inflammatory treatment in patients with persisting clinical activity."

This study included 514 women with breast cancer between 21- and 66-years-old. The cases were gathered between June 2016 and January 2017. The instruments used were the questionnaire on Women's Sexual Function and a questionnaire to collect socio-demographic and clinical data.The average age (± standard deviation, SD) of participants was 46.34 ± 8.28 years. Their average age at date of diagnosis was 42.26 ± 8.56 years, and the average time suffering from cancer was 4.05 ± 5.23 years. There were significant differences (p = 0.002) in the presence of sexual dysfunction before (32.1%) and after (91.2%) cancer. The primary sexual dysfunctions were due to penetration pain (50.6%), lubrication (50.6%), dysfunctional desire (44.6%), and dysfunctional excitement (44.6%). Two-thirds of participants were satisfied with their sexual relations. The women who presented most sexual dysfunction were those that had a bilateral mastectomy (p = 0.009) and those who received chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormonal-therapy (p < 0.001).Sexual function was changed in women with breast cancer. The main problems included penetration pain, desire, lubrication, and dysfunctional excitement. It is important that Health professionals recognize which circumstances influence the sexual function of women with breast cancer and to make interventions that facilitate sexual adjustment."
https://openalex.org/W2888841559,"Statins, which reduce LDL-cholesterol by inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl–coenzyme A reductase, are among the most widely prescribed drugs. Skeletal myopathy is a known statin-induced adverse effect associated with mitochondrial changes. We hypothesized that similar effects would occur in cardiac myocytes in a lipophilicity-dependent manner between 2 common statins: atorvastatin (lipophilic) and pravastatin (hydrophilic). Neonatal cardiac ventricular myocytes were treated with atorvastatin and pravastatin for 48 h. Both statins induced endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress, but only atorvastatin inhibited ERK1/2T202/Y204, AktSer473, and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling; reduced protein abundance of caveolin-1, dystrophin, epidermal growth factor receptor, and insulin receptor-β; decreased Ras homolog gene family member A activation; and induced apoptosis. In cardiomyocyte-equivalent HL-1 cells, atorvastatin, but not pravastatin, reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption. When male mice underwent atorvastatin and pravastatin administration per os for up to 7 mo, only long-term atorvastatin, but not pravastatin, induced elevated serum creatine kinase; swollen, misaligned, size-variable, and disconnected cardiac mitochondria; alteration of ER structure; repression of mitochondria- and endoplasmic reticulum–related genes; and a 21% increase in mortality in cardiac-specific vinculin-knockout mice during the first 2 months of administration. To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate in vivo that long-term atorvastatin administration alters cardiac ultrastructure, a finding with important clinical implications.——Godoy, J.

https://openalex.org/W2789977344,"For humans and for non-human primates heart rate is a reliable indicator of an individual’s current physiological state, with applications ranging from health checks to experimental studies of cognitive and emotional state. In humans, changes in the optical properties of the skin tissue correlated with cardiac cycles (imaging photoplethysmogram, iPPG) allow non-contact estimation of heart rate by its proxy, pulse rate. Yet, there is no established simple and non-invasive technique for pulse rate measurements in awake and behaving animals. Using iPPG, we here demonstrate that pulse rate in rhesus monkeys can be accurately estimated from facial videos. We computed iPPGs from eight color facial videos of four awake head-stabilized rhesus monkeys. Pulse rate estimated from iPPGs was in good agreement with reference data from a contact pulse-oximeter: the error of pulse rate estimation was below 5% of the individual average pulse rate in 83% of the epochs; the error was below 10% for 98% of the epochs. We conclude that iPPG allows non-invasive and non-contact estimation of pulse rate in non-human primates, which is useful for physiological studies and can be used toward welfare-assessment of non-human primates in research."
https://openalex.org/W2890524303,"IFNϵ and IFNκ are interferons that induce microbial immunity at mucosal surfaces and in the skin. They are members of the type-I interferon (IFN) family, which consists of 16 different IFNs, that all signal through the common IFNAR1/IFNAR2 receptor complex. Although IFNϵ and IFNκ have unique expression and functional properties, their biophysical properties have not been extensively studied. In this report, we describe the expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant human IFNϵ and IFNκ. In cellular assays, IFNϵ and IFNκ exhibit ∼1000-fold lower potency than IFNα2 and IFNω. The reduced potency of IFNϵ and IFNκ are consistent with their weak affinity for the IFNAR2 receptor chain. Despite reduced IFNAR2-binding affinities, IFNϵ and IFNκ exhibit affinities for the IFNAR1 chain that are similar to other IFN subtypes. As observed for cellular IFNAR2 receptor, the poxvirus antagonist, B18R, also exhibits reduced affinity for IFNϵ and IFNκ, relative to the other IFNs. Taken together, our data suggest IFNϵ and IFNκ are specialized IFNs that have evolved to weakly bind to the IFNAR2 chain, which allows innate protection of the mucosa and skin and limits neutralization of IFNϵ and IFNκ biological activities by viral IFN antagonists.

In contrast, poxviruses encode IFN-binding proteins that neutralize IFN activity by binding to secreted IFNs, which prevents them from engaging cell-surface IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (29.Seet B.T.

IFNϵ and IFNκ are unique from the other IFNs based on their amino acid sequences and limited expression in mucosa and skin.

IFNβ exhibits 35% sequence identify with all other IFNs, whereas IFNω shares the highest sequence identity (60%) with both IFNϵ/κ/β and the IFNαs.

A unique feature of IFNϵ is that it encodes an 18-amino acid C-terminal tail following helix F, whereas IFNκ has a 13-amino acid peptide insertion between helices D and E.

In fact, HIV-1 negative female sex workers express high levels of IFNϵ in their cervical tissues (40.Abdulhaqq S.A. Zorrilla C. Kang G. Yin X. Tamayo V. Seaton K.E. Joseph J. Garced S. Tomaras G.D.

IFNκ is constitutively expressed in keratinocytes, which are found in skin and in the mucosa of the FRT. Thus, IFNκ and IFNϵ are both found in the FRT, but IFNκ is inducible by virus and dsRNA, whereas IFNϵ is not (36.LaFleur D.W. Nardelli B. Tsareva T. Mather D. Feng P. Semenuk M. Taylor K. Buergin M. Chinchilla D. Roshke V. Chen G. Ruben S.M. Pitha P.M. Coleman T.A. Moore P.A. Interferon-κ, a novel type I interferon expressed in human keratinocytes.J. Biol.

Although it appears that IFNϵ appears to play an important role in immunity against HIV-1, IFNκ expression is rapidly reduced in keratinocytes that are infected with human papilloma virus strains that induce cervical cancer (41.Reiser J. Hurst J. Voges M. Krauss P. Münch P. Iftner T. Stubenrauch F. High-risk human papillomaviruses repress constitutive κ interferon transcription via E6 to prevent pathogen recognition receptor and antiviral-gene expression.J. Virol. 2011; 85 (21849431): 11372-1138010.1128/JVI.05279-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These data strongly argue that IFNϵ and IFNκ are essential components to the host response against pathogens in the FRT, whereas the specific role of IFNκ, produced by keratinocytes in the skin, remains to be determined. Despite a critical role of IFNϵ and IFNκ signaling in mucosa and skin, their interactions with the IFNARs and their functional activities have not been extensively characterized. To address this issue, we have expressed human IFNϵ and IFNκ for comparative biophysical and functional studies with other IFN family members (often called IFN subtypes). Studies with purified IFNϵ and IFNκ reveal they induce ISFG3-mediated gene expression that is ∼1000-fold weaker than IFNα2 or IFNω. The weaker potency of IFNϵ and IFNκ is consistent with their reduced affinities for the IFNAR2 receptor chain. However, IFNϵ and IFNκ exhibit IFNAR1 binding affinity that is similar to IFNα2 and IFNω. Because poxviruses cause disseminated infections of the skin and mucosa and can block type-I IFN signaling, we evaluated the ability of B18R to neutralize IFNϵ and IFNκ cellular activity. Subsequent kinetic binding studies determined IFNϵ, IFNκ, as well as IFNα1, exhibit reduced binding to B18R, relative to the other IFNs. Sequence and structural models of IFNϵ/κ-IFNAR2 and IFNϵ/κ-B18R complexes identified residues responsible for the disrupted IFNAR2 and B18R binding phenotypes. Our data suggests IFNϵ and IFNκ have evolved to exhibit reduced IFNAR2 binding affinity and biological potency optimized for tissue-specific expression and escape from viral type-I IFN antagonists. Expression plasmids encoding human IFNϵ and IFNκ protein sequences, which also encode C-terminal histidine tags, were synthesized using optimized codons. Expression studies were performed in Escherichia coli where IFNϵ and IFNκ formed insoluble inclusion bodies. The guanidine-solubilized IFNs were refolded by rapid dilution into a refolding buffer. The refolded IFNs were purified using a 2-step strategy consisting of nickel affinity and cation exchange chromatography. Endotoxin levels for IFNϵ and IFNκ were less than 1 EU/μg, which is within the range of values observed in IFNα preparations obtained from commercial sources (42.Kuruganti S. Accavitti-Loper M.A. Walter M.R. Production and characterization of thirteen human type-I interferon-α subtypes.Protein Expr.

SDS-PAGE gel analysis of the final purified IFNϵ and IFNκ protein preparations is shown in Fig. 1. The molecular weight of IFNϵ on SDS-PAGE gels matched its theoretical molecular weight of 23,249. However, IFNκ ran larger than expected (∼25,000 kDa) in SDS-PAGE gels, suggesting the peptide could be a frameshift product (43.Yoon S.I. Walter M.R. Identification and characterization of a +1 frameshift observed during the expression of Epstein-Barr virus IL-10 in Escherichia coli.Protein Expr.

To resolve these possibilities, MS was performed on the samples, which demonstrated the molecular masses were consistent with full-length IFNϵ and IFNκ proteins without the N-terminal initiating methionine residues (Table 1).Table 1Mass spectrometry of IFNϵ and IFNκTreatmentObserved massExpected massaCalculated mass without N-terminal methionine.DeltabMass difference between expected and observed masses.InterpretationIFNϵNone23,08223,11836IA23,14523,1396+ 1 IAIA + DTT23,25623,2533+ 3 IAIFNκNone23,20123,22019IA23,25923,2581+ 1 IAIA + DTT23,49623,48610+ 5 IAa Calculated mass without N-terminal methionine.b Mass difference between expected and observed masses.

To confirm disulfide bond formation had occurred during the refolding process, IFNϵ and IFNκ were treated with iodoacetamide (IA) in the presence, or absence, of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT, Table 1). IA selectively binds to free cysteines, resulting in an increase in mass of 57 Da. Upon IA treatment in the absence DTT, the mass of IFNϵ and IFNκ increased by 57 Da, which is consistent with one free cysteine in the folded proteins (Table 1). However, in the presence of DTT, the mass of IFNϵ and IFNκ increased by three IA and five IA mass units, respectively. This is consistent with the protection of two (IFNϵ) and four (IFNκ) cysteines, due to disulfide bond formation, in the folded proteins (Table 1). Thus, the MS data are consistent with the predicted IFNϵ and IFNκ disulfide bonding patterns. Three preparations of IFNϵ and IFNκ were characterized for their ability to bind to soluble IFNARs (Fig. 2). The IFNs were injected over Biacore chips coupled with IFNAR1-FC, IFNAR2-FC, or an IFNAR1/IFNAR2-FC heterodimer, as previously described (45.Deshpande A. Putcha B.D. Kuruganti S. Walter M.R.

Binding is reported as receptor occupancy (RO) for each IFN. For comparison with other IFNs, binding studies were also performed with IFN subtypes, IFNα2 and IFNω. IFNα2 and IFNω bound to IFNAR2 with RO values of 53 and 69%, respectively (Fig. 2). In contrast, IFNϵ and IFNκ bound very poorly to IFNAR2, exhibiting IFNAR2 occupancies of 3 and 5%, respectively. Despite poor IFNAR2-binding properties, IFNϵ bound to IFNAR1 (RO = 26%) better than IFNα2 (RO = 19%), whereas IFNκ-IFNAR1 RO values were lower than IFNα2 (RO = 11%). In addition to binding to the single IFNARs, we evaluated IFN binding to an IFNAR1/IFNAR2-FC heterodimer, which positions IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 close to one another in space through the FC heterodimer (45.Deshpande A. Putcha B.D. Kuruganti S. Walter M.R.

IFNϵ and IFNκ binding to IFNAR1/IFNAR2-FC remained low, relative to IFNα2 and IFNω. However, IFNκ binding, in particular, was significantly enhanced (RO = 36%) relative to the IFNAR2 and IFNAR1 single receptor experiments. The biological activity of IFNϵ and IFNκ were compared against IFNω and IFNα2 using a reporter cell line (HL116), which contains a firefly luciferase gene downstream of the IFI6 promoter. Dose-response curves were generated from at least six independent measurements, to derive half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50, Fig. 2B, Table 2). Consistent with the receptor binding data, IFNϵ (60 nm ± 26 nm) and IFNκ (22 ± 16 nm) exhibited ∼1000-fold lower EC50 values, compared with IFNα2 (11 ± 3 pm) or IFNω (6 ± 1 pm). The dose-response curves were repeated using a different reporter cell line that contains the ISG54 promoter, with similar results.Table 2Surface plasmon resonance-derived binding constants and ISFG3 assay EC50 valueskakdKDm−1 s−1s−1mIFNα2IFNAR1——2.3 (± 0.5) × 10−6EC50 = 11 pm (±3 pm)IFNAR25.9 (± 0.4) × 1060.031 (± 0.002)5.3 (± 0.2) × 10−9IFNAR1/28 (± 1) × 1064.2 (± 0.4) × 10−454 (± 3) × 10−12IFNϵIFNAR1——2.2 (± 0.3) × 10−6EC50 = 60 nm (±26 nm)IFNAR24 (± 3) × 1050.01 (± 0.01)70 (± 16) × 10−9IFNAR1/23.3 (± 0.8) × 1059 (± 1) × 10−43.5 (± 0.8) × 10−9IFNωIFNAR1——0.5 (± 0.1) × 10−6EC50 = 6 pm (±1 pm)IFNAR27 (± 2) × 1070.01 (± 0.07)237 (± 37) × 10−12IFNAR1/23 (± 2) × 1084 (± 2) × 10−325 (± 8) × 10−12IFNκIFNAR1——0.34 (± 0.13) × 10−6EC50 = 22 nm (±16 nm)IFNAR21.2 (± 0.2) × 1052.1 (± 0.3) × 10−321 (± 4) × 10−9IFNAR1/24 (± 2) × 1058 (± 1) × 10−42 (± 1) × 10−9IFNκ-M2IFNAR1/27 (± 2) × 1053 (± 1) × 10−40.4 (± 0.3) × 10−9EC50 = 4 nm (±2 nm)IFNα1IFNAR1——0.4 × 10−6EC50 = 258 pm (±73 pm)IFNAR25 (± 0.1) × 1050.18 (± 0.02)353 (± 83) × 10−9IFNAR1/21.8 (± 0.2) × 1064 (± 2) × 10−4222 (± 92) × 10−12IFNα1-M1IFNAR1——0.2 × 10−6EC50 = 26 pm (±10 pm)IFNAR22.4 (± 0.1) × 1060.06 (± 0.01)26"

They are the most expanded components of the system. The Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain contains 40-60 residues that are highly represented among E3 ubiquitin ligases. The Arabidopsis thaliana E3 ubiquitin ligases with a RING finger primarily contain RING-HC or RING-H2 type domains or less frequently RING-v, RING-C2, RING-D, RING-S/T and RING-G type domains. Our previous work on three E3 ubiquitin ligase families with a RING-H2 type domain, ATL, BTL, and CTL, suggested that a phylogenetic distribution based on the RING domain allowed for the creation a catalog of known domains or unknown conserved motifs. This work provided a useful and comprehensive view of particular families of RING E3 ubiquitin ligases. We updated the annotation of A. thaliana RING proteins and surveyed RING proteins from 30 species across eukaryotes. Based on domain architecture profile of the A. thaliana proteins, we catalogued 4711 RING finger proteins into 107 groups, including 66 previously described gene families or single genes and 36 novel families or undescribed genes. Forty-four groups were specific to a plant lineage while 41 groups consisted of proteins found in all eukaryotic species. Our present study updates the current classification of plant RING finger proteins and reiterates the importance of these proteins in plant growth and adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2889494366,"RNF144A is a single-pass transmembrane RBR E3 ligase that interacts with and degrades cytoplasmic DNA-PKcs, which is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-interacting partner. Interestingly, RNF144A expression is positively correlated with EGFR mRNA and protein levels in several types of cancer. However, the relationship between RNF144A and EGFR is poorly understood. This study reports an unexpected role for RNF144A in the regulation of EGF/EGFR signaling and EGF-dependent cell proliferation. EGFR ligands, but not DNA-damaging agents, induce a DNA-PKcs-independent interaction between RNF144A and EGFR. RNF144A promotes EGFR ubiquitination, maintains EGFR protein, and prolongs EGF/EGFR signaling during EGF stimulation. Moreover, depletion of RNF144A by multiple independent approaches results in a decrease in EGFR expression and EGF/EGFR signaling. RNF144A knockout cells also fail to mount an immediate response to EGF for activation of G1/S progression genes. Consequently, depletion of RNF144A reduces EGF-dependent cell proliferation. These defects may be at least in part due to a role for RNF144A in regulating EGFR transport in the intracellular vesicles during EGF treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2889543513,"The chromosome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) contains a large number of Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. The majority of these belong to the VapBC TA family, characterised by the VapC protein consisting of a PIN domain with four conserved acidic residues, and proposed ribonuclease activity. Characterisation of five VapC (VapC1, 19, 27, 29 and 39) proteins from various regions of the Mtb chromosome using a combination of pentaprobe RNA sequences and mass spectrometry revealed a shared ribonuclease sequence-specificity with a preference for UAGG sequences. The TA complex VapBC29 is auto-regulatory and interacts with inverted repeat sequences in the vapBC29 promoter, whereas complexes VapBC1 and VapBC27 display no auto-regulatory properties. The difference in regulation could be due to the different properties of the VapB proteins, all of which belong to different VapB protein families. Regulation of the vapBC29 operon is specific, no cross-talk among Type II TA systems was observed. VapC29 is bacteriostatic when expressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis, whereas VapC1 and VapC27 displayed no toxicity upon expression in M. smegmatis. The shared sequence specificity of the five VapC proteins characterised is intriguing, we propose that the differences observed in regulation and toxicity is the key to understanding the role of these TA systems in the growth and persistence of Mtb."

Control of infection depends on classical IL-6 signaling via membrane IL-6Rα, but IL-6 target cells and protective mechanisms remain unclear. We used mice with IL-6Rα-deficiency in T cells (Il6rafl/fl×CD4cre) or myeloid cells (Il6rafl/fl×LysMcre) to define the role of these cells in IL-6-mediated protection. Abrogation of IL-6Rα in T cells did not interfere with bacteria control and induction of TH1 and CD8+ T-cell responses. IL-6Rα-deficiency in myeloid cells caused significant defects in listeria control. This defect was not associated with reduced recruitment of granulocytes and inflammatory monocytes, and both cell populations were activated and not impaired in cytokine production. However, IL-6Rα-deficient inflammatory monocytes displayed diminished expression of IL-4Rα and of CD38, a protein required for phagocytosis and innate control of listeria. In vitro studies revealed that IL-4 and IL-6 cooperated in induction of CD38. In listeria-infected mice, phagocytic activity of inflammatory monocytes correlated with CD38 expression levels on cells and inflammatory monocytes of Il6rafl/fl×LysMcre mice were significantly impaired in phagocytosis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that inhibition of classical IL-6 signaling in myeloid cells causes alterations in differentiation and function of these cells, which subsequently prevent effective control of L. monocytogenes."

We show that recombinant EgKI-1 inhibits the growth and migration of a range of human cancers including breast, melanoma and cervical cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner in vitro without affecting normal cell growth. Furthermore, EgKI-1 treatment arrested the cancer cell growth by disrupting the cell cycle and induced apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2889051503,"DNA-binding proteins from starved cells (Dps, EC: 1.16.3.1) have a variety of different biochemical activities such as DNA-binding, iron sequestration, and H2O2 detoxification. Most bacteria commonly feature one or two Dps enzymes, whereas the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme displays an unusually high number of five Dps proteins (NpDps1–5). Our previous studies have indicated physiological differences, as well as cell-specific expression, among these five proteins. Three of the five NpDps proteins, NpDps1, -2, and -3, were classified as canonical Dps proteins. To further investigate their properties and possible importance for physiological function, here we characterized and compared them in vitro. Nondenaturing PAGE, gel filtration, and dynamic light-scattering experiments disclosed that the three NpDps proteins exist as multimeric protein species in the bacterial cell. We also demonstrate Dps-mediated iron oxidation catalysis in the presence of H2O2. However, no iron oxidation with O2 as the electron acceptor was detected under our experimental conditions. In modeled structures of NpDps1, -2, and -3, protein channels were identified that could serve as the entrance for ferrous iron into the dodecameric structures.

Iron, the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, plays an essential role in biological processes. A great variety of co-factors and prosthetic moieties that contain iron as a major constituent, e.g. iron-sulfur clusters and heme groups, can be found throughout all three domains of life (1Imlay J.A. Iron-sulphur clusters and the problem with oxygen. Mol.Microbiol. 2006; 59 (16430685): 1073-108210.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05028.xGoogle Scholar). Iron is involved in, e.g. photosynthesis, respiration, N2-fixation, gene regulation, and DNA biosynthesis. The two physiologically relevant iron species, namely ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric iron (Fe3+), are interconvertible iron redox states and under an oxic environment, Fe2+ is usually oxidized to Fe3+, whose solubility is limited under physiological conditions (2Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodríguez-Quiñones F. Bacterial iron homeostasis. FEMS Microbiol.Rev. 2003; 27 (12829269): 215-23710.1016/S0168-6445(03)00055-XGoogle Scholar).

Therefore, organisms have developed strategies to regulate the intracellular iron pool, for example, by storage inside “ferritin-like” proteins (2Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodríguez-Quiñones F.

The five NpDps proteins were, based on their predicted structural similarities to Ftns, Bfrs, and Dps proteins, clustered into specific clades.

A functional characterization of the complete set of Dps proteins considering their individual functions and their possible interdependent physiological roles has not yet been addressed. A striking and fundamental question is: why would the cyanobacterium N. punctiforme need three different Dps proteins that all belong to the canonical group of Dps? Although NpDps1–3 have been predicted to be structurally similar, functional genetics studies have revealed that they are not redundant. NpDps2 is of core importance for H2O2 tolerance in N. punctiforme, and the lack of NpDps2 activity could not be compensated for by any of the other four Dps proteins or other H2O2 detoxification proteins in this cyanobacterium, such as catalases or peroxidases (8Ekman M.

In particular, multiple Dps proteins within one cyanobacterium have only been studied in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (also known as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120) (20Sato N. Moriyama T. Toyoshima M. Mizusawa M.

We present here in vitro and in silico characterizations of three individual canonical Dps proteins NpDps1, NpDps2, and NpDps3 within the one and the same cyanobacterium, N. punctiforme focusing on protein complex stability, DNA-binding properties, and iron incorporation/oxidation. The working hypothesis is that, based on results of our earlier studies (8Ekman M. Sandh G. Nenninger A. Oliveira P. Stensjö K. Cellular and functional specificity among “ferritin-like” proteins in the multicellular cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme.Environ. Microbiol. 2013; 16 (23992552): 829-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), these multiple Dps proteins have different and specific functions of importance for cell homeostasis in vivo, and that these differences will be reflected in the biochemical properties of the individual Dps proteins. Such understanding of the biochemical potential will be of importance for future research on the individual physiological roles of the multiple Dps proteins in vivo in multicellular cyanobacteria. To study the biochemical properties of the canonical Dps proteins from N. punctiforme we expressed and purified the NpDps1, NpDps2, and NpDps3 from E. coli cells via affinity chromatography utilizing a Strep-tag that was genetically introduced at the C terminus of each protein sequence. As a control for the different biophysical and biochemical characterizations, the Dps protein from E. coli was additionally expressed and purified. For each protein purification, SDS-PAGE analysis was used to ensure the purity of the Dps protein samples. All the Dps proteins migrated through the polyacrylamide matrix close to the expected molecular mass of their monomers (Fig. 1) and all protein sequence identities were confirmed by MS. The band pattern occurring with EcDps was analyzed by MS confirming the protein sequence identity, accordingly. The double band pattern for EcDps has been described by Schmidt et al. (22Schmidt R. Zahn R. Bukau B. Mogk A. ClpS is the recognition component for Escherichia coli substrates of the N-end rule degradation pathway. Mol.Microbiol. 2009; 72 (19317833): 506-51710.1111/j.1365-2958.2009.06666.xGoogle Scholar) to be due to short N-terminal truncation inside E. coli. The EcDps sample contained an additional protein with approximately double the molecular mass of its monomer. This additional protein band (between 31.0 to 45.0 kDa) was also identified by MS to be the correct Dps sequence indicating the formation of dimers of this Dps protein. The persistence of dimeric structures in the gel after SDS and high temperature treatment might be due to high protein (thermo)stability. A band of a similar size from EcDps in SDS-PAGE has been observed earlier (22Schmidt R. Zahn R. Bukau B. Mogk A. ClpS is the recognition component for Escherichia coli substrates of the N-end rule degradation pathway. Mol.Microbiol. 2009; 72 (19317833): 506-51710.1111/j.1365-2958.2009.06666.xGoogle Scholar). The NpDps protein material was used for further analytical in vitro investigations. Dps proteins are often found to exhibit DNA-binding properties that might protect DNA against oxidative cleavage (6Chiancone E. Ceci P. The multifaceted capacity of Dps proteins to combat bacterial stress conditions: Detoxification of iron and hydrogen peroxide and DNA binding.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 798-80510.1016/j.bbagen.2010.01.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the cyanobacterium N. punctiforme exhibits one or more Dps proteins that may protect DNA by forming DNA-Dps complexes, we conducted a series of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) under different pH conditions. NpDps2 and NpDps3 formed DNA-Dps complexes at pH 6.0 as indicated by the DNA retardation in the gel (Fig. 2). At pH 7.0 the DNA-binding affinity for the two NpDps proteins, found to bind to DNA at pH 6.0, was completely abolished (Fig. 2). NpDps1 did not form a DNA-Dps complex, at either pH 6.0 or 7.0. In contrast to all NpDps proteins, EcDps bound to the complete amount of DNA at both pH 6.0 and 7.0, likewise demonstrated by an earlier study on EcDps (5Ceci P. Cellai S. Falvo E. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Chiancone E. DNA condensation and self-aggregation of Escherichia coli Dps are coupled phenomena related to the properties of the N-terminus.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 (15534364): 5935-594410.1093/nar/gkh915Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In EcDps DNA-binding is mediated by a lysine-rich N-terminal motif (5Ceci P. Cellai S. Falvo E. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Chiancone E. DNA condensation and self-aggregation of Escherichia coli Dps are coupled phenomena related to the properties of the N-terminus.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 (15534364): 5935-594410.1093/nar/gkh915Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interestingly, similar motifs were found in the N-terminal and C-terminal protein sequence of NpDps2 and NpDps3, respectively, whereas no such motifs were found in NpDps1 (see Fig. S1 for further details). Members of the Dps protein family are generally expected to form dodecameric protein complexes that fulfil various functions such as iron incorporation and storage (6Chiancone E. Ceci P. The multifaceted capacity of Dps proteins to combat bacterial stress conditions: Detoxification of iron and hydrogen peroxide and DNA binding.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 798-80510.1016/j.bbagen.2010.01.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the NpDps proteins were able to form such multimeric complexes, and if there was a correlation between the multimeric state of the proteins and DNA-binding properties, multiple strategies were followed. Our first approach to identify possible multimers of the NpDps proteins was based on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under nondenaturing conditions. To estimate the approximate molecular masses of each investigated NpDps protein, the multimeric forms of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were used. Under nondenaturing conditions, BSA appeared to be present in its monomeric (66 kDa), dimeric (132 kDa), trimeric (198 kDa), and its tetrameric forms (264 kDa) (24Chowdhury R.P. Vijayabaskar M.S. Vishveshwara S. Chatterji D. Molecular mechanism of in vitro oligomerization of Dps from Mycobacterium smegmatis: mutations of the residues identified by “interface cluster” analysis.Biochemistry. 2008; 47 (18826253): 11110-1111710.1021/bi801158eCrossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The three NpDps samples showed formation of different multimeric protein complexes when analyzed with nondenaturing PAGE at approximately pH 8 (Fig. 3). NpDps3 formed a large protein complex with comparable molecular mass to EcDps, which was included in this study as a control protein and was found to form a single multimeric protein complex. NpDps1 formed the lowest molecular mass complex of the three NpDps proteins with a band at ∼60 kDa, which might indicate its presence as a trimer (theoretical molecular mass 63.3 kDa). NpDps2 was found to have formed a putative pentamer of about 100 kDa (theoretical molecular mass 97 kDa). Even though NpDps1 and NpDps2 do not form protein complexes as large as NpDps3 under the gel electrophoresis conditions they both formed multimeric protein complexes. This provided the first indication of differential multimerization behavior among these NpDps proteins. To expand our investigation of the multimeric Dps protein complexes from N. punctiforme, we conducted a series of dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments, in solution, under different pH conditions. Our experimental design included the analysis of EcDps serving as a control protein to indicate the size of a Dps dodecamer, which has been earlier reported to be ∼101 Å in hydrodynamic diameter by DLS analysis (25Fan R. Boyle A.L. Cheong V.V. Ng S.L. Orner B.P. A helix swapping study of two protein cages.Biochemistry. 2009; 48 (19405543): 5623-563010.1021/bi900387tCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Dps proteins were analyzed by DLS at pH 3.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0 using different buffer systems (Fig. 4). There was a clear variation of pH-dependent stability between the individual NpDps. Nevertheless, at certain pH values, all three NpDps formed protein species with a hydrodynamic diameter larger than 99 Å indicating the presence of multimeric protein complexes. The proteins forming the most stable multimers with respect to varying pH conditions were NpDps3 and EcDps, where only large protein forms of similar hydrodynamic diameters (107 and 100 Å) were found at pH 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0. At pH 9.0 and 3.0, no protein species were found for any of the Dps, which might be due to complete protein denaturation. For NpDps1, a large protein species was found at pH 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0. However, at pH 5.0, this large species was about 21 Å larger than the species formed at pH 6.0 and 7.0, which had an average size of about 117 Å. At pH 8.0, no such large protein complex was observed, but two other smaller protein species were found with sizes of 81 and 28 Å. For both species, considerably larger mean ± S.E. were found, which may indicate the existence of intermediate protein species. At pH 9.0, only a protein species with a hydrodynamic diameter of 86 Å was observed, again, with large mean ± S.E. indicating more variable protein forms. Furthermore, the low peak occurrence for NpDps1 at pH 9.0 might be related to protein denaturation. NpDps2 formed a large protein species (117 Å) at pH 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0. However, at pH 7.0 another smaller protein species of about 27 Å coexists with the large species. Large mean ± S.E. again implies partial decomposition of the large protein species into intermediate forms. At pH 8.0, only a medium-sized protein species of about 78 Å was observed for NpDps2. Note also that these DLS results correlate well with those from the nondenaturing PAGE analysis at pH ∼8, where NpDps3 formed the largest protein complex, whereas smaller complexes were observed for NpDps2 and NpDps1. To clarify the overall oligomerization state of the three investigated NpDps proteins in solution at different pH (6.0 and 8.0), we performed a classic molecular mass determination using size-exclusion chromatography. EcDps was used as a control. For further chromatographic details, see Fig. S2. We found that all NpDps proteins could form a dodecamer, but lower multimeric states (n) calculated on the basis of protein mass standards could also be observed for NpDps1 and NpDps2. At pH 6.0, NpDps1 and NpDps3 are predominantly in their dodecameric state (n = 11.3 and 12.4, respectively), whereas NpDps2 was found to only partially form such state (n = 11.2), accompanied by a trimer (n = 2.63). Surprisingly, the mass of the control protein EcDps indicated an octamer (n = 8.06). For NpDps1 and NpDps2, there was a clear shift from a dodecameric state to lower multimeric form with an increase in pH from pH 6.0 to 8.0. By contrast, NpDps3 did not change its oligomerization state with pH, and remained predominantly a dodecamer even at pH 8.0. Besides the DNA-binding properties, another function that has been reported for Dps proteins is the incorporation of ferrous iron for its oxidation and storage inside the protein cavity. Two different sets of channel structures that link the protein interior to the exterior have been discovered, namely, the ferritin-like pore and the “Dps-type” pore (23Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. The crystal structure of Dps, a ferritin homolog that binds and protects DNA.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5 (9546221): 294-30310.1038/nsb0498-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The ferritin-like pore has been demonstrated to contain several conserved negatively charged amino acids that line the path into the protein cavity, attracting metal ions and facilitating their incorporation into the protein interior (26Bellapadrona G. Stefanini S. Zamparelli C. Theil E.C. Chiancone E. Iron translocation into and out of Listeria innocua Dps and size distribution of the protein-enclosed nanomineral are modulated by the electrostatic gradient at the 3-fold “ferritin-like” pores.J.

The ferritin-like pore is formed around a C3-symmetrical axis at the interaction interface of three Dps monomers close to their N-terminal random coil sequences (N-terminal C3 axis). Another pore structure, the Dps-type pore, is formed by three Dps monomers around a C3-symmetry axis, in the vicinity of their random coil C-terminal sequences (C-terminal C3 axis). In contrast to the ferritin-like pore, the Dps-type pore has been shown to be highly variable in terms of its pore size. There is also no general trend regarding its hydrophilicity or lipophilicity (14Franceschini S. Ceci P. Alaleona F. Chiancone E. Ilari A. Antioxidant Dps protein from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus: an intrinsically stable cage-like structure endowed with enhanced stability.FEBS J. 2006; 273 (17018059): 4913-492810.1111/j.1742-4658.2006.05490.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the NpDps proteins might form structures that could function as pores for incorporating metal ions such as ferrous iron, we first created model structures of NpDps1, NpDps2, and NpDps3 based on the crystal structure of the EcDps protein (PDB code 1DPS), which has been demonstrated to incorporate iron into its dodecameric structure. The electrostatic potentials of the predicted NpDps1, NpDps2, and NpDps3 structures were calculated with focus on the region around N- and C-terminal C3-axes (Fig. 5). Electrostatic potentials were also calculated for the EcDps for comparison. Note that because the structures of the random coil N and C termini could not easily be predicted for the dodecameric models, they were truncated prior to model building. Therefore,"

In super-resolution applications, the optimal dye suited to the method can be chosen, the optical setup can be simpler and there are no chromatic aberrations between images of different structures. We describe a method based on DNA strand displacement that can be used to quickly and easily perform the labeling and removal of the fluorophores during each sequence. Site-specific tags are conjugated with unique and orthogonal single stranded DNA. Labeling for a particular structure is achieved by hybridization of antibody-bound DNA with a complimentary dye-labeled strand. After imaging, the dye is removed using toehold-mediated strand displacement, in which an invader strand competes off the dye-labeled strand than can be subsequently washed away. Labeling and removal of each DNA-species requires only a few minutes. We demonstrate the concept using sequential dSTORM super-resolution for multiplex imaging of subcellular structures."
https://openalex.org/W2889074166,"Background The assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is important for health outcomes research, disease modeling studies and comparisons of different healthcare interventions. Yet, only a few tools are available to assess HRQoL in 0-1-year-old infants. Furthermore, there is a need for an instrument able to assess HRQoL with a single, standardized, overall score in the first year of life. Here we described the development of the Infant health-related Quality of life Instrument (IQI), a generic, preference-based instrument that can be administered through a mobile application for assessing HRQoL in 0-1-year-old infants. Methods A multi-step development process began by extracting candidate health concepts from relevant measures identified by two literature searches. Next, three panels, with experts from Asia, Europe, New Zealand and United States of America, and two surveys, with primary caregivers in New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, evaluated the relevance of the candidate health concepts, organized them into attributes based on their similarities, explored alternative attributes and generated response scales. Additional interviews assessed the cross-cultural interpretability, parents’ understanding of health attributes, and the usability of the mobile application. Results The final list of 7 health attributes included in the IQI consisted of sleeping, feeding, breathing, stooling/poo, mood, skin, and interaction. The users’ experiences with the mobile application were generally positive. Conclusions The IQI is the first generic, preference-based, instrument designed to assess overall HRQoL in 0-1-year old infants. It is short and easy-to-administer through a mobile application. Moreover, close attention was paid to the opinions of the infants’ primary caregivers during the instrument and mobile application development process."

Our objective was to assess the impact of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) on the accuracy of the FIT in the detection of AN, namely advanced colorectal adenoma and CRC. Methods and findings We performed a prospective study of 1002 individuals referred for a diagnostic colonoscopy at Bellvitge University Hospital from September 2011 through to October 2012. An exhaustive interview was performed by a gastroenterologist, prescription drug dispensing database was reviewed and the patient was given a FIT prior to colonoscopy. The positivity threshold of FIT used was ≥ 20 μg Hb/g feces and the main outcome was AN. AN was detected in 13.2% (133) of patients. The accuracy of FIT for detecting AN in the PPI users and non-PPI users were: sensitivity 43.0% vs 65.6%, P = 0.009; specificity 86.9% vs 92.3%, P = 0.010; and, predictive positive value 34.4% vs 55.5%, P = 0.007, respectively. In multivariate analysis, adjusting for potential confounders, PPIs were associated with false positives in AN detection by FIT (OR 1.63 CI 95% 1.02–2.59, P < 0.037). The ROC curve for the FIT in the detection of AN in the PPI users and non-PPI users was 0.68 (CI 95% 0.61–0.76) and 0.85 (CI 95% 0.79–0.90).

https://openalex.org/W2891142286,"Sialic acids are a family of more than 50 structurally distinct acidic sugars on the surface of all vertebrate cells where they terminate glycan chains and are exposed to many interactions with the surrounding environment. In particular, sialic acids play important roles in cell-cell and host-pathogen interactions. The sialic acids or related nonulosonic acids have been observed in Deuterostome lineages, Eubacteria, and Archaea but are notably absent from plants. However, the structurally related C8 acidic sugar 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid (Kdo) is present in Gram-negative bacteria and plants as a component of bacterial lipopolysaccharide and pectic rhamnogalacturonan II in the plant cell wall. Until recently, sialic acids were not thought to occur in algae, but as in plants, Kdo has been observed in algae. Here, we report the de novo biosynthesis of the deaminated sialic acid, 3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-2-nonulosonic acid (Kdn), in the toxin-producing microalga Prymnesium parvum Using biochemical methods, we show that this alga contains CMP-Kdn and identified and recombinantly expressed the P. parvum genes encoding Kdn-9-P synthetase and CMP-Kdn synthetase enzymes that convert mannose-6-P to CMP-Kdn. Bioinformatics analysis revealed sequences related to those of the two P. parvum enzymes, suggesting that sialic acid biosynthesis is likely more widespread among microalgae than previously thought and that this acidic sugar may play a role in host-pathogen interactions involving microalgae. Our findings provide evidence that P. parvum has the biosynthetic machinery for de novo production of the deaminated sialic acid Kdn and that sialic acid biosynthesis may be common among microalgae."

https://openalex.org/W2889204873,"Background We previously developed a logistic regression algorithm that uses AFP, age, gender, ALK and ALT levels to improve the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In 3,158 patients from 5 independent sites, this algorithm, referred to as the “Doylestown” algorithm, increased the AUROC of AFP 4% to 12% and had equal benefit regardless of tumor size or the etiology of liver disease. Aims Analysis of the Doylestown algorithm using samples from individuals taken before their diagnosis of HCC. Methods Here, the algorithm was tested using samples at multiple time points from (a) patients with established chronic liver disease, without HCC (120 patients) and (b) 116 patients with HCC diagnosis (85 patients with early stage HCC and 31 patients with recurrent HCC), taken at the time of, and up to 12 months prior to cancer diagnosis. Results Among patients who developed HCC, comparing the Doylestown algorithm at a fixed cut-off to AFP at 20 ng/mL, the Doylestown algorithm increased the True Positive Rate (TPR) in identification of HCC from 36 to 50%, at a time point of 12 months prior to the conventional HCC detection. Similar results were obtained in those patients with recurrent HCC, where the Doylestown algorithm increased TPR in detection of HCC from 18% to 59%, at 12 months prior to detection of recurrence. Conclusions This algorithm significantly improves the prediction of HCC by AFP alone and may have value in the early detection of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2889456153,"Recently, Entamoeba histolytica clones derived from isolate HM-1:IMSS that differ in their pathogenicity were identified. Whereas some clones induce amoebic liver abscesses (ALAs) in animal models of amoebiasis, others provoke only minimal liver lesions. Based on transcriptome studies of pathogenic and nonpathogenic clones, differentially expressed genes associated with reduced or increased liver pathology can be identified. Here, to analyze the influence of these genes on ALA formation in more detail, an RNA interference-trigger mediated silencing approach was used. Using newly identified trigger sequences, the expression of 15 genes was silenced. The respective transfectants were analyzed for their ability to induce liver destruction in the murine model for the disease. Silencing of EHI_180390 (encoding an AIG1 protein) increased liver pathology induced by a nonpathogenic parent clone, whereas silencing of EHI_127670 (encoding a hypothetical protein) decreased the pathogenicity of an initially pathogenic parent clone. Additional phenotypical in vitro analyses of EHI_127670 silencing as well as overexpression transfectants indicated that this molecule has an influence on size, growth, and cysteine peptidase activity of E. histolytica. This work describes an example of how the sole operational method for effective gene silencing in E. histolytica can be used for comprehensive analyses of putative pathogenicity factors.-Matthiesen, J., Lender, C., Haferkorn, A., Fehling, H., Meyer, M., Matthies, T., Tannich, E., Roeder, T., Lotter, H., Bruchhaus, I.

https://openalex.org/W2949909951,"Bile acids are critical biological detergents in the gastrointestinal tract and also act as messengers to regulate a multitude of intracellular signaling events, including mitogenic signaling, lipid metabolism and endo/exocytosis. In particular, bile acids stimulate many receptors and ion channels on the cell surface, the mechanisms of which are still poorly understood. Membrane-associating proteins depend on the local spatial distribution of lipids in the plasma membrane (PM) for their function. Here, we report that the highly amphipathic secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA), a major constituent in the human bile, at doses <1μM enhances the nanoclustering and the PM localization of phosphatidic acid (PA) but disrupts the local segregation of phosphatidylserine in the basolateral PM of the human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells. PA is a key structural component of the signaling nano-domains of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the cell surface. We show that DCA promotes the co-localization between PA and EGFR, the PA-driven EGFR dimerization/oligomerization and EGFR signaling. Depletion of PA abolishes the stimulatory effects of DCA on the EGFR oligomerization and signaling. This effect occurs in the cultured Caco-2 cells and the ex vivo human intestinal enteroids. We propose a novel mechanism, where the amphiphilic DCA monomers alter the nano-assemblies of anionic phospholipids and in turn change the dynamic structural integrity of the lipid-driven oligomerization of cell surface receptors and their signal transduction."

These graphs are not only connected but often also k-connected (or at least part of them). Different metrics are used to determine the distance between two nodes in the graph. In this article, we propose a novel metric that takes into account the higher degree of connectivity on the part of the graph (for example, biconnected fullerene graphs and fulleroids). Designed metric reflects the cyclical interdependencies among the nodes of the graph. Moreover, a new component model is derived, and the examples of various types of graphs are presented."

Ezh2 conditional null mice were viable up to birth, but died within the first hour of life. In addition to craniofacial defects, Ezh2 conditional null mice displayed reduced number of ganglion cells in the enteric nervous system. RT-PCR and ChIP assays indicated aberrant up-regulation of Zic1, Pax3, and Sox10 and loss of H3K27me3 marks in the promoter regions of these genes in the myenteric plexus. Overall, these results suggest that Ezh2 is an important epigenetic modifier for the enteric neural crest cell development through repression of Zic1, Pax3, and Sox10."

After exclusion of the results of one laboratory, analysis was done for 133 laboratories using 137 RDT products. Scores of 10/10, 9/10 and 8/10 were achieved for 58.4%, 13.1% and 8.0% of 137 RDT products respectively. For three-band P. falciparum-pan-Plasmodium RDTs (113 (82.5%) products, 6 brands), most frequent errors were (1) disregarding faint test lines (18.6%), (2) reporting invalid instead of P. falciparum (16.8%) and (3) reporting ""Plasmodium spp., no further differentiation possible"" without mentioning the presence or absence of P. falciparum (11.5%). For four-band RDTs (21 (15.3%) products, 1 brand), errors were (4) disregarding faint P. vivax test lines (47.6%) and (5) reporting ""Plasmodium spp., no further differentiation possible"" without mentioning the presence of P. falciparum and P. vivax (28.6%). Instructions for use (IFU) of only 4 out of 10 RDT products mentioned to interpret faint-intensity test lines as positive (conducive to errors 1 and 4) and IFU of 2 products displayed incorrect information (conducive to errors 2 and 5). Outside of office hours, 36.1% of participants relied on RDTs as the initial diagnostic test; 13.9% did not perform microscopic confirmation.Reading and interpretation of malaria RDTs was satisfactory, but errors were embedded in the instructions for use of the products. Relying on RDTs alone for malaria diagnosis (about one third of participants) is not a recommended practice."

In-vitro in-vivo correlation (IVIVC) with the level A is accepted for the registration of new molecules. In the present study deconvolution technique with numeric approaches was applied after compressing and in vitro validating the 100mg Nimesulide immediate, intermediate and slow release tablets. Single centered, crossover, randomized study was conducted in four phases with a two-week washout period to obtain the plasma drug concentration data after administrating test and reference products in male healthy volunteers. KineticaTM 4.4.1 (Thermoelectron corp, USA) was used for the calculation of two ways ANOVA with 90% CI from both log transformed and non- transformed data and Phoenix WinNonlin 7 and it's IVIVC toolkit version 7.0 was used for the application of numeric approaches of IVIVC. Results revealed that the individual internal percentage prediction error for AUCinf and Cmax were found to be < 15% while their average values were < 10% in all medium. Numeric values of % PE at pH 6.8 and pH 7.4 (50 rpm in USP II and 100 rpm in USP I and II apparatus) were found to be (2.5842, 2.9789 and, 7.1732; 7.0944, 2.4721 and 4.350) for AUCinf and (2.5842, 0.5736 and 4.6928; 5.6214, 3.0551 and -2.4711) values for Cmax respectively. The low values of prediction errors demonstrate that the correlation model is projecting the in vivo response of each formulation. Percentage External error (% PE) was not required because individual values of percentage internal error (%PE) of Cmax and AUClast were not >15. In order to predict point to point correlation between fraction drug dissolved and drug absorbed, their mean r2 value was found to be > 0.9112 which showed a linear correlation in slightly alkaline pH."
https://openalex.org/W2892235463,"The tumor suppressor F-box protein 31 (FBXO31) is indispensable for maintaining genomic stability. Its levels drastically increase following DNA damage, leading to cyclin D1 and MDM2 degradation and G1 and G2/M arrest. Prolonged arrest in these phases leads to cellular senescence. Accordingly, FBXO31 needs to be kept at low basal levels in unstressed conditions for normal cell cycle progression during growth and development. However, the molecular mechanism maintaining these basal FBXO31 levels has remained unclear. Here, we identified the F-box family SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO46 (SCFFBXO46) as an important proteasomal regulator of FBXO31 and found that FBXO46 helps maintain basal FBXO31 levels under unstressed conditions and thereby prevents premature senescence. Using molecular docking and mutational studies, we showed that FBXO46 recognizes an RXXR motif located at the FBXO31 C terminus to direct its polyubiquitination and thereby proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, FBXO46 depletion enhanced the basal levels of FBXO31, resulting in senescence induction. In response to genotoxic stress, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) Ser/Thr kinase-mediated phosphorylation of FBXO31 at Ser-278 maintained FBXO31 levels. In contrast, activated ATM phosphorylated FBXO46 at Ser-21/Ser-67, leading to its degradation via FBXO31. Thus, ATM-catalyzed phosphorylation after DNA damage governs FBXO31 levels and FBXO46 degradation via a negative feedback loop. Collectively, our findings reveal that FBXO46 is a crucial proteasomal regulator of FBXO31 and thereby prevents senescence in normal growth conditions. They further indicate that FBXO46-mediated regulation of FBXO31 is abrogated following genotoxic stress to promote increased FBXO31 levels for maintenance of genomic stability.

Our genome is challenged by a multitude of DNA-damaging signals, such as UV radiations, chemical agents, and metabolic stress (1.Ciccia A. Elledge S.J. The DNA damage response: making it safe to play with knives.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40 (20965415): 179-20410.1016/j.molcel.2010.09.019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). It is essential to safeguard the genome from these stresses to prevent aging and cancer. For this purpose, there are crucial players acting at several steps to sense, transduce, and modify the DNA damage signal, to subsequently execute the appropriate rescue pathway. These players, from sensors to the executors, act in a concerted manner to elicit an effective DNA damage response (2.Maréchal A. Zou L. DNA damage sensing by the ATM and ATR kinases.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 (24003211): a01271610.1101/cshperspect.a012716Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). This response includes many biological events such as the activation of check points leading to arrest in the G1 or G2/M phase of the cell cycle and activation of the machinery that repairs the damaged genome (3.Zhou B.-B.

The SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex consists of the three invariable components RBX1, Cullin 1, SKP1 and a variable component F-box protein. F-box proteins are grouped into three classes (FBXW, FBXL, and FBXO) based on the substrate interaction motif located in the C-terminal domain.

Previous studies have shown that FBXO31 protein levels fluctuate during the cell cycle in unstressed cells (4.Santra M.K. Wajapeyee N. Green M.R. F-box protein FBXO31 mediates cyclin D1 degradation to induce G1 arrest after DNA damage.Nature. 2009; 459 (19412162): 722-72510.1038/nature08011Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 20.Kumar R.

However, how the levels of expression are maintained in unstressed conditions and the physiological relevance of its regulation are not fully elucidated. To address this question, we performed a RING finger (SCF and APC/C) E3 ligase screen to identify potential regulators of FBXO31. Among the several candidates that emerged out of the screen, we focused our investigations on FBXO46, the F-box family SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligase whose cellular function was unknown. In this study, we demonstrate two mechanisms: (a) how FBXO46 limits the senescence induction property of FBXO31 in unstressed cells, and (b) how FBXO31, in turn, regulates FBXO46 in a negative feedback loop and acts as a dedicated check point protein upon genotoxic stress. This coordinated regulation of the axis between FBXO31 and FBXO46 is essential for maintaining the genomic integrity and cellular homeostasis. A previous study has shown that levels of FBXO31 protein oscillate during cell cycle progression (20.Kumar R. Neilsen P.M. Crawford J. McKirdy R. Lee J. Powell J.A. Saif Z. Martin J.M. Lombaerts M. Cornelisse C.J. Cleton-Jason A.M. Callen D.F. FBXO31 is the chromosome 16q24.3 senescence gene, a candidate breast tumor suppressor, and a component of an SCF complex.Cancer Res. 2005; 65 (16357137): 11304-1131310.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0936Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We observed that FBXO31 mRNA levels remains unchanged during the cell cycle, indicating the existence of post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms that regulate FBXO31 protein levels throughout the cell cycle (data not shown). To delineate the factors that regulate FBXO31, we performed a RING finger E3 (SCF, APC/C) ligase screen and identified FBXO46 as one of the potential candidates that can regulate FBXO31. To validate FBXO46 as a potential negative regulator of FBXO31, we ectopically expressed FBXO46 in increasing doses in HEK-293T cells. The results showed that FBXO46 significantly decreased FBXO31 levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). However, FBXO31 mRNA levels remained unchanged, with significant ablation of post-transcriptional levels, following FBXO46 overexpression (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating the existence of post-transcriptional regulation. Consistent with these results, the addition of MG132 (a 26S proteasome inhibitor) inhibited FBXO46-mediated degradation of FBXO31 (Fig. 1D). To further confirm the proteasomal degradation of FBXO31 by FBXO46, the cycloheximide pulse–chase assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 1E, the half-life of FBXO31 significantly decreased in cells co-expressing FBXO46, as compared with empty vector transfected cells. For example, the half-life of FBXO31 decreased from 2.6 to 1.2 h (2.1-fold) upon overexpression of FBXO46 (Fig. 1F). Additionally, compared with WT FBXO46, the F-box motif-deleted mutant of FBXO46 (Myc-ΔF-FBXO46) failed to reduce FBXO31 levels, suggesting that FBXO46 degrades FBXO31 through the SCF complex (Fig. 1G). We next monitored the cellular localization of FBXO31 in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from cells expressing either vector or FBXO46. Immunoblot analysis showed the presence of FBXO31 predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction, but we found that ectopically expressed FBXO46 degraded FBXO31 in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 1H). Collectively, these observations suggest that SCFFBXO46 directs the proteasomal degradation of FBXO31 through the 26S proteasome. To determine whether FBXO46 maintains cellular levels of FBXO31, we generated a stable knockdown of FBXO46 (FBXO46 KD) in MCF7 cells using lentiviral shRNAs. Immunoblot analysis showed that FBXO31 levels significantly increased in the FBXO46 KD cells generated using three unrelated independent shRNAs targeting FBXO46 (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1H, the depletion of FBXO46 increased FBXO31 levels in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, demonstrating that FBXO46 regulates the levels of FBXO31 in both locations (Fig. 2B). To further validate these results, cycloheximide pulse–chase experiments were performed in cells expressing nonsilencing (NS) and FBXO46 shRNA. The results showed that the stability of FBXO31 increased 1.8-fold in the FBXO46 knockdown cells as compared with the NS control (Fig. 2, C and D). Overall, these results suggest that FBXO46 regulates cellular levels of FBXO31. As the results above indicate that FBXO46 regulates FBXO31 levels, we therefore examined whether FBXO46 targets FBXO31 at any specific phase of the cell cycle. To address this, both the WT (NS) and FBXO46 KD cells were synchronized using hydroxyurea at the G1/S boundary. Following release from hydroxyurea at different time points, cells were analyzed for FBXO31 expression. As shown in Fig. 2, E and F, the expression levels of FBXO31 were significantly elevated throughout the cell cycle in FBXO46-depleted cells, being optimum at the G1/S phase. Similar results were also observed in nocodazole-synchronized cells (Fig. 2, G and H). We next investigated whether stabilization of FBXO31 in the FBXO46 KD cells would lead to alteration in any cell cycle checkpoint. To address this, the cells expressing shRNA either for control (NS) or FBXO46 or FBXO31 along with FBXO46 were trapped at the G2/M phase using nocodazole. As expected, the NS cells were arrested at the G2/M phase, whereas a substantial population of the FBXO46 KD cells still remained at the G1 phase (Fig. 2I). Interestingly, a maximum number of cells were trapped in the G2/M phase following co-depletion of FBXO31 and FBXO46 (Fig. 2I). These observations collectively suggest that increased basal levels of FBXO31 in FBXO46 KD cells might be responsible for an increase in the G1 population. It has been reported previously that G1 arrest is a prerequisite for senescence, and FBXO31 is known to facilitate G1 arrest and senescence (4.Santra M.K. Wajapeyee N. Green M.R. F-box protein FBXO31 mediates cyclin D1 degradation to induce G1 arrest after DNA damage.Nature. 2009; 459 (19412162): 722-72510.1038/nature08011Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25.Agami R.

We therefore proceeded to check whether the FBXO46 KD cells have an increased propensity to undergo senescence. It was observed that the FBXO46 KD cells showed increased β-galactosidase activity, characteristic of senescent cells (Fig. 2, J and K). F-box proteins have the ability to interact with and promote polyubiquitination of their substrates through the SCF complex (14.Wang G. Chan C.H. Gao Y. Lin H.K. Novel roles of Skp2 E3 ligase in cellular senescence, cancer progression, and metastasis.Chin. J.

Along these lines, we investigated the interaction between FBXO46 and FBXO31 by co-immunoprecipitation assay. Myc-FBXO46 was co-transfected either with an empty vector or FLAG–FBXO31 in HEK-293T cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of FBXO46 in the FBXO31 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3A). In a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assay, FBXO31 was found to be present in the FBXO46 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that FBXO46 and FBXO31 interact with each other (Fig. 3A). These results were validated by endogenous co-immunoprecipitation of FBXO31 and FBXO46. As shown in Fig. 3B, an endogenous interaction between FBXO31 and FBXO46 was detected, which increased in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 3B). These observations suggested that FBXO46 physically interacts with FBXO31. Canonical polyubiquitination by ubiquitin ligases is a prerequisite for any cellular protein to be degraded via the 26S proteasome (26.Jentsch S. Schlenker S. Selective protein degradation: a journey's end within the proteasome.Cell. 1995; 82 (7553848): 881-88410.1016/0092-8674(95)90021-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 27.Hochstrasser M. Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30 (8982460): 405-43910.1146/annurev.genet.30.1.405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether proteasomal degradation of FBXO31 occurred through polyubiquitination. To address this, we performed an in vivo ubiquitination assay in which His-ubiquitin, FLAG–FBXO31, Myc-FBXO46, and Myc-ΔF-FBXO46 were co-expressed followed by Ni-NTA pulldown to capture the ubiquitylated proteins. As shown in Fig. 3C, only co-expression of Myc-FBXO46 promoted robust polyubiquitination of FBXO31, whereas Myc-ΔF-FBXO46 failed to polyubiquitinate FBXO31. To examine why ΔF-FBXO46 fails to polyubiquitinate FBXO31, we checked the interaction of Myc-ΔF-FBXO46 with FLAG–FBXO31. The results revealed that Myc-ΔF-FBXO46 efficiently interacts with FBXO31 but fails to form the SCF complex (Fig. 3D). Next, we examined the involvement of the lysine residue of ubiquitin in polyubiquitination and found that FBXO46 promoted the Lys-48–linked polyubiquitination of FBXO31 (Fig. 3E). These observations were further supported by reduction in Lys-48–linked ubiquitination of FBXO31 in FBXO46 KD cells (Fig. 3F). Thus, results taken together suggest that FBXO46 interacts with FBXO31, promotes Lys-48–linked polyubiquitination, and thereby facilitates proteasomal degradation through the 26S proteasome. The interaction between FBXO46 and FBXO31 prompted us to map the FBXO46-binding motif within the FBXO31 protein. To address this, we generated a series of N-terminal deletion mutants of FBXO31 (Fig. 4A) and studied their interaction with FBXO46 following co-expression by co-immunoprecipitation. The results revealed that FBXO46 degrades all the deletion mutants of FBXO31 suggesting that FBXO46 recognizes the C-terminal domain of FBXO31 (Fig. 4B). To further delineate the specific region of FBXO31 recognized by FBXO46, we searched for the motif present in the C-terminal deletion mutant (ΔD8-FBXO31) of FBXO31 using in silico modeling. Analysis revealed the presence of an RXXR motif at the C terminus of FBXO31 (Fig. 4C). The structural model of FBXO31 was obtained from the Robetta server (28.Kim D.E. Chivian D. Baker D. Protein structure prediction and analysis using the Robetta server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 (15215442): W526-W53110.1093/nar/gkh468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). After validation, the model analysis indicated that FBXO31 was accurate and had the least errors. The peptides of FBXO31 listed in Table S1 were docked in the FBXO46 model. Following docking, the pose analysis indicated that four RXXR motifs had the best binding score. Among these peptides, the best affinity was shown by the motif YPRTCRM located in the C terminus (ΔD8-FBXO31), with binding energy −6.5 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 4, D and E). Detailed structural analysis indicated that all these peptide motifs interacted in the same binding pocket even in the blind docking mode. The peptide bound at the cavity was more charged and possessed hydrophobic residues. The detailed docking results are given in the docking scores (Table S1). Atomic level interaction analysis using Ligplot+ (29.Laskowski R.A. Swindells M.B. LigPlot+: Multiple ligand-protein interaction diagrams for drug discovery.J. Chem. Inf.

Here, we analysed the gamma-diversity (γ-diversity) partitioning of gobiid fishes to evaluate the additive and multiplicative components of α and β-diversity, species replacement and species loss and gain, at four spatial scales: sample units, ecoregions, provinces and realms. The richness of gobies from the realm Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) is represented by 87 species. Along latitudinal and longitudinal gradients, we found that the γ-diversity is explained by the β-diversity at both spatial scales, ecoregions and provinces. At the ecoregion scale, species are diverse in the north (Cortezian ecoregion) and south (Panama Bight ecoregion) and between insular and coastal ecoregions. At the province scale, we found that the species turnover between the warm temperate Northeast Pacific (WTNP), Tropical East Pacific (TEaP) and the Galapagos Islands (Gala) was high, and the species nestedness was low. At the ecoregion scale, historical factors, and phylogenetic factors have influenced the hotspots of gobiid fish biodiversity, particularly in the Cortezian, Panama Bight and Cocos Island ecoregions, where species turnover is high across both latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. At the provincial level, we found that the contributions of the β-diversity from north to south, in the WTNP, TEaP and Gala were high, as result of the high number of unique species. Species turnover was also high at this scale, with a low contribution from species nestedness that was probably due to the low species/gene flow within the provinces. These results highlight the importance and successful inclusion of a cryptobenthic fish component in ecological and biogeographical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2889445700,"Background In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study and Jackson Heart Study (JHS) cohorts, serum potassium (K) is an independent predictor of diabetes risk, particularly among African-American participants. Experimental studies show that serum K levels affects insulin secretion. The KCNJ11 gene encodes for a K channel that regulates insulin secretion and whose function is affected by serum K levels. Variants in KCNJ11 are associated with increased diabetes risk. We hypothesized that there could be a gene-by-environment interaction between KCNJ11 variation and serum K on diabetes risk. Methods Evaluating a combined cohort of ARIC and JHS participants, we sought to determine if KCNJ11 variants are risk factors for diabetes; and if KCNJ11 variants modify the association between serum K and diabetes risk. Among participants without diabetes at baseline, we performed multivariable logistic regression to determine the effect of serum K, KCNJ11 variants, and their interactions on the odds of incident diabetes mellitus over 8–9 years in the entire cohort and by race. Results Of 11,812 participants, 3220 (27%) participants developed diabetes. 48% and 47% had 1 or 2 diabetes risk alleles of rs5215 and rs5219, respectively. Caucasians had higher proportions of these risk alleles compared to African Americans (60% vs 17% for rs5215 and 60% vs 13% for rs5219, p<0.01). Serum K was a significant independent predictor of incident diabetes. Neither rs5215 nor rs5219 was associated with incident diabetes. In multivariable models, we found no statistically significant interactions between race and either rs5215 or rs5219 (P-values 0.493 and 0.496, respectively); nor between serum K and either rs5215 or rs5219 on odds of incident diabetes (P-values 0.534 and 0.687, respectively). Conclusion In this cohort, rs5215 and rs5219 of KCNJ11 were not significant predictors of incident diabetes nor effect modifiers of the association between serum K and incident diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2888775451,"Background An agent-based modeling approach has been suggested as an alternative to traditional, equation-based modeling methods for describing oral drug absorption. It enables researchers to gain a better understanding of the pharmacokinetic (PK) mechanisms of a drug. This project demonstrates that a biomimetic agent-based model can adequately describe the absorption and disposition kinetics both of midazolam and clonazepam. Methods An agent-based biomimetic model, in silico drug absorption tract (ISDAT), was built to mimic oral drug absorption in humans. The model consisted of distinct spaces, membranes, and metabolic enzymes, and it was altogether representative of human physiology relating to oral drug absorption. Simulated experiments were run with the model, and the results were compared to the referent data from clinical equivalence trials. Acceptable similarity was verified by pre-specified criteria, which included 1) qualitative visual matching between the clinical and simulated concentration-time profiles, 2) quantitative similarity indices, namely, weighted root mean squared error (RMSE), and weighted mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and 3) descriptive similarity which requires less than 25% difference between key PK parameters calculated by the clinical and the simulated concentration-time profiles. The model and its parameters were iteratively refined until all similarity criteria were met. Furthermore, simulated PK experiments were conducted to predict bioavailability (F). For better visualization, a graphical user interface for the model was developed and a video is available in Supporting Information. Results Simulation results satisfied all three levels of similarity criteria for both drugs. The weighted RMSE was 0.51 and 0.92, and the weighted MAPE was 5.99% and 8.43% for midazolam and clonazepam, respectively. Calculated PK parameter values, including area under the curve (AUC), peak plasma drug concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (Tmax), terminal elimination rate constant (Kel), terminal elimination half life (T1/2), apparent oral clearance (CL/F), and apparent volume of distribution (V/F), were reasonable compared to the referent values. The predicted absolute oral bioavailability (F) was 44% for midazolam (literature reported value, 31–72%) and 93% (literature reported value, ≥ 90%) for clonazepam. Conclusion The ISDAT met all the pre-specified similarity criteria for both midazolam and clonazepam, and demonstrated its ability to describe absorption kinetics of both drugs. Therefore, the validated ISDAT can be a promising platform for further research into the use of similar in silico models for drug absorption kinetics."

Choices of participants were modelled using panel-mixed logit methods.60 patients completed the DCE. Attending a service was strongly preferred over no service (selected 99% of the time). Assuming equivalent efficacy of fall-prevention programs, participants indicated a preference for services that were culturally-specific (OR 1.25 95% CI: 1.00-1.55) and incurred lower out-of-pocket participant costs (OR 1.19 95% CI 1.11-1.27).

https://openalex.org/W2889012337,"The reliability of differential gene expression analysis on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) expression profiles generated using Affymetrix arrays is questionable, due to the high range of percent-present values reported in studies which profiled FFPE samples using this technology.

By generating matched gene expression profiles using RNAs derived from fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE preserved breast tumors with Affymetrix arrays and FF/FFPE RNA specific amplification-and-labeling kits, the reliability of differential expression analysis and the validity of gene modules derived from external datasets were investigated. Specifically, the reliability of differential expression analysis was investigated by developing de-novo ER/HER2 pathway gene-modules from the matched datasets and validating them on external FF/FFPE gene expression datasets using ROC analysis. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of module scores between matched FFPE/frozen datasets was used to measure the reliability of gene-modules derived from external datasets in FFPE expression profiles. Independent of the array/amplification-kit/sample preservation method used, de-novo ER/HER2 gene-modules derived from all matched datasets showed similar prediction performance in the independent validation (AUC range in FFPE dataset; ER: 0.93-0.95, HER2: 0.85-0.91), except for the de-novo ER/HER2 gene-module derived from the FFPE dataset using the 3'IVT kit (AUC range in FFPE dataset; ER: 0.79-0.81, HER2: 0.78). Among the external gene modules considered, roughly ~50% gene modules showed high concordance between expression profiles derived from matching FF and FFPE RNA. The remaining discordant gene modules between FF and FFPE expression profiles showed high concordance within matching FF datasets and within matching FFPE datasets independently, implying that microarrays still require improved amplification-and-sample-preparation protocols for deriving 100% concordant expression profiles from matching FF and FFPE RNA."

The participants were 19 to 98 years of age. They were followed in 2008-2009, 2010-2011, and 2012-2013 by the same medical staff that did the initial physical examinations in 2006-2007. Participants were censored on the visit reporting CKD. A CVH score was created based on the seven AHA health metrics. The cumCVH score was CVH1×timev1-v2+CVH2×timev2-v3+CVH3×timev3-v4. In the fully adjusted model, compared with the lowest quintile of cumCVH, individuals in the highest quintile had a 75% lower risk of CKD (95% confidence interval (CI): 66-82%). Every additional year lived with a 1-unit increase in ideal CVH was associated with an 11% (95% CI: 9-13%) reduction in the incidence of CKD. Furthermore, when we excluded each of the six metrics from the cumCVH score in turn, the association was unaffected after the exclusion of individual risk factors.

In the coupled model, the full Navier-Stokes equations are solved for the wind field using a finite difference method (FDM), and coupled to a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model adapted to simulate animal behavior (penguins are individual particles in the SPH). We use the model to examine the dynamics of penguin huddling as a purely individual fitness maximizing behavior. SPH is a mesh-free Lagrangian method driven by local interactions between neighboring fluid particles and their environment allowing particles to act as free ranging ‘animals’ unconstrained by a computational grid that implicitly interact with one another (a critical element of aggregative behavior). The coupled model is recomputed simultaneously as the huddle evolves over time to update individual particle positions, redefine the properties of the developing huddle (i.e., shape and density), and adjust the wind field flowing through and around the dynamic huddle. This study shows the ability of a coupled model to predict the dynamic properties of penguin huddling, to quantify biometrics of individual particle “penguins”, and to confirm communal penguin huddling behavior as an individualistic behavior."

Both NSD2 overexpression and point mutations that increase its catalytic activity are associated with several human cancers. Although NSD2 is an attractive therapeutic target, no potent, selective, and bioactive small molecule inhibitors of NSD2 have been reported to date, possibly due to the challenges of developing high-throughput assays for NSD2. Full-Text PDF Open Access Epigenetic modifications are patterns of posttranslational modifications (such as methylation or acetylation) found on histone tails, commonly referred to as the “histone code.” These modifications are installed, removed, and read out by diverse molecules to effect biological outcomes (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. The language of covalent histone modifications.Nature. 2000; 403 (10638745): 41-4510.1038/47412Crossref PubMed Scopus (6605) Google Scholar). Importantly, these molecules are often mutated or misregulated in diseases, including cancer, which manifests itself as alterations to the histone code. For example, mutations of the methyltransferases EZH2 and NSD2, including those causing gain-of-function amino acid substitutions, like increased activity or altered specificity, have been linked to tumorigenesis (2Shen C. Vakoc C.R. Gain-of-function mutation of chromatin regulators as a tumorigenic mechanism and an opportunity for therapeutic intervention.Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2015; 27 (25402979): 57-6310.1097/CCO.0000000000000151Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These “epimutations” can theoretically be reversed by chemotherapeutic intervention, making the concept of epigenetic therapy exceptionally appealing. There are two primary ways to block an epigenetic signaling pathway: either inhibit the enzyme that adds the mark or inhibit the effector that reads it. Toward that end, drug discovery efforts for EZH2 have been successful. However, as yet, no potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of NSD2 have been identified. NSD2 is responsible for depositing the bulk of the histone H3K36me2 mark. Increased levels of this mark, caused by elevated NSD2 activity, are observed in different cancer types and result in the transcriptional activation of normally silenced genes (3Kuo A.J. Cheung P.

In a cancer setting, NSD2 activity has been shown to be up-regulated in three ways. First, a chromosomal translocation can generate a fusion between NSD2 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH), which places the NSD2 gene under the control of the IgH enhancer, resulting in its overexpression (4Stec I.

Second, NSD2 can be up-regulated at the transcriptional level, as seen in a large variety of human tumors (5Hudlebusch H.R. Santoni-Rugiu E. Simon R. Ralfkiær E. Rossing H.H. Johansen J.V. Jørgensen M. Sauter G. Helin K. The histone methyltransferase and putative oncoprotein MMSET is overexpressed in a large variety of human tumors.Clin.

Third, point mutations that produce the amino acid changes E1099K or T1150A result in a hyperactive enzyme (6Oyer J.A. Huang X. Zheng Y. Shim J. Ezponda T. Carpenter Z. Allegretta M. Okot-Kotber C.I.

Ectopic expression of WT NSD2 or these activating mutants causes elevated K3K36me2 levels and promotes oncogenic transformation, whereas knockdown of this enzyme in certain cell lines reduces proliferation and tumorigenesis. Thus, NSD2 is a very good target for drug discovery. Unfortunately, ongoing efforts to identify specific NSD2 inhibitors have largely been unsuccessful, with lead compounds either being weak (LEM-06) or nonspecific (suramin, chaetocin, sinefungin, and BIX-01294) (8Coussens N.P.

Progress in this field has been slow in large part because NSD2 requires a nucleosomal substrate and will not efficiently catalyze the methylation of peptides or recombinant histones, which has made the development of HTS 2The abbreviations used are: HTShigh-throughput screening(s)HTRFhomogeneous time-resolved fluorescenceSAHS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine. challenging (9Li Y.

In a recently published study, Coussens et al. (8Coussens N.P. Kales S.C. Henderson M.J. Lee O.W. Horiuchi K.Y. Wang Y. Chen Q. Kuznetsova E. Wu J. Chakka S. Cheff D.M. Cheng K.C.-C. Shinn P.

A histone octamer assembles when a tetramer, containing two copies of both H3 and H4, complexes with two H2A/H2B dimers. Once DNA is wrapped around this octamer, it is referred to as a nucleosome. Importantly, in the absence of DNA, the histone octamer is methylated on H4 by recombinant NSD2; in the presence of DNA, the nucleosome is methylated “correctly” on H3 (9Li Y. Trojer P. Xu C.F. Cheung P. Kuo A. Drury 3rd, W.J. Qiao Q. Neubert T.A. Xu R.M. Gozani O. Reinberg D. The target of the NSD family of histone lysine methyltransferases depends on the nature of the substrate.J. Biol.

Thus, the development of HTS using nucleosomes requires more effort than screens using peptides or recombinant protein, but is critical in the search for NSD2 inhibitors. The primary screen they developed used a bioluminescent assay called MTase-Glo, with full-length NSD2 and purified HeLa nucleosomes as the substrate. They also demonstrated that this assay can be used with the NSD2 variants E1099K and T1150A, which should facilitate the identification of selective inhibitors of these two oncogenic forms of NSD2. As a secondary screen, they adapted a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay using recombinant NSD2 and a nucleosomal substrate. When NSD2 methylates a nucleosome, it produces S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH), and both the MTase-Glo assay and the HTRF assay measure the production of SAH as an indirect gauge of methylation. The authors also implemented a redox cycling assay and an interference compound filter to remove promiscuous or reactive compounds. As a next step, the authors used an additional secondary screening approach, using a radioisotope-based filter-binding HotSpot assay, to directly test the in vitro methylation of nucleosomes. The HotSpot assay is more sensitive than the MTase-Glo and HTRF assays, but of course requires appropriate facilities and the ability to work with radioisotopes. Finally, a surface plasmon resonance screen was developed using a truncated construct of NSD2 to evaluate the direct binding of the identified compounds to the catalytic domain of the enzyme. With one primary and three secondary assays in hand, the investigators screened a library of over 16,000 compounds; 48 compounds made it through the first two indirect screens and filters, with five selected compounds (DA3003-1, PF-03882845, chaetocin, TC LPA5 4, and ABT-199) evaluated in the final two direct screens. To further characterize these lead compounds, an impressive specificity screen was established using 37 different methyltransferases. The five lead compounds were not very specific for NSD2, nor were they very effective in reducing H3K36me2 levels in U2OS cells. Indeed, for all compounds tested, the reduction in H3K36me2 signal correlated with cytotoxicity. Knockdown of NSD2 does not reduce the proliferation rate of U2OS cells, which suggests that the cytotoxicity observed with these compounds is likely due to off-target effects. Thus, these particular compounds are unlikely to advance further. However, this work does establish a solid primary screening approach for NSD2 inhibitors, along with a notable set of orthogonal/counter/specificity screens to be used for an expanded screen and for use by other investigators. The efforts by Coussens et al. (8Coussens N.P. Kales S.C. Henderson M.J. Lee O.W. Horiuchi K.Y. Wang Y. Chen Q. Kuznetsova E. Wu J. Chakka S. Cheff D.M. Cheng K.C.-C. Shinn P. Brimacombe K.R. Shen M.

However, NSD2 also harbors a number of domains that can potentially “read” the histone code, including four PHD fingers and two PWWP domains that could also serve as targets. Indeed, its N-terminal PWWP1 domain of NSD2 recognized the same mark that it deposits. Thus, the PWWP1 domain is critical for the recruitment of this enzyme to chromatin and for the propagation of the H3K36me2 mark, as it can read the H3K36me2 mark on one nucleosome and deposit the same mark on an adjacent nucleosome, thus spreading this modification (10Sankaran S.M. Wilkinson A.W. Elias J.E. Gozani O. A PWWP domain of histone-lysine N-methyltransferase NSD2 binds to dimethylated Lys-36 of histone H3 and regulates NSD2 function at chromatin.J. Biol.

A small molecule antagonist of the PWWP1 domain of NSD2 may thus function similarly to an inhibitor of its enzyme activity. Efforts toward developing compounds that block PWWP domain reader functions are underway, and a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and the Structural Genomic Consortium (SGC) has recently identified a small molecule probe called BI-9321 that inhibits the PWWP1 domain of NSD3. Although the PWWP1 domains of NSD2 and NSD3 are highly related, and both read the H3K36me2 mark, the BI-09321 chemical probe blocks the binding activity of only the NSD3 PWWP1 domain. Analogs of this compound may display specificity for the NSD2 PWWP1 domain. The BI-09321 compound is currently available to investigators through the SGC (https://www.thesgc.org/node/633667). 3Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. NSD2 remains a very desirable therapeutic target, and, despite attempts by a number of research groups, no high-quality chemical probes have yet been developed. Using the appropriate nucleosome-based screens developed by Coussens et al. (8Coussens N.P. Kales S.C. Henderson M.J. Lee O.W. Horiuchi K.Y. Wang Y. Chen Q. Kuznetsova E. Wu J. Chakka S. Cheff D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2888905515,"Domains are distinct units within proteins that typically can fold independently into recognizable three-dimensional structures to facilitate their functions. The structural and functional independence of protein domains is reflected by their apparent modularity in the context of multi-domain proteins. In this work, we examined the coupling of evolution of domain sequences co-occurring within multi-domain proteins to see if it proceeds independently, or in a coordinated manner. We used continuous information theory measures to assess the extent of correlated mutations among domains in multi-domain proteins from organisms across the tree of life. In all multi-domain architectures we examined, domains co-occurring within protein sequences had to some degree undergone concerted evolution. This finding challenges the notion of complete modularity and independence of protein domains, providing new perspective on the evolution of protein sequence and function."
