https://openalex.org/W2951066214,"A cognitive map has long been the dominant metaphor for hippocampal function, embracing the idea that place cells encode a geometric representation of space. However, evidence for predictive coding, reward sensitivity and policy dependence in place cells suggests that the representation is not purely spatial. We approach this puzzle from a reinforcement learning perspective: what kind of spatial representation is most useful for maximizing future reward? We show that the answer takes the form of a predictive representation. This representation captures many aspects of place cell responses that fall outside the traditional view of a cognitive map. Furthermore, we argue that entorhinal grid cells encode a low-dimensionality basis set for the predictive representation, useful for suppressing noise in predictions and extracting multiscale structure for hierarchical planning."
https://openalex.org/W2760498857,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A), installed by the Mettl3/Mettl14 methyltransferase complex, is the most prevalent internal mRNA modification. Whether m6A regulates mammalian brain development is unknown. Here, we show that m6A depletion by Mettl14 knockout in embryonic mouse brains prolongs the cell cycle of radial glia cells and extends cortical neurogenesis into postnatal stages. m6A depletion by Mettl3 knockdown also leads to a prolonged cell cycle and maintenance of radial glia cells. m6A sequencing of embryonic mouse cortex reveals enrichment of mRNAs related to transcription factors, neurogenesis, the cell cycle, and neuronal differentiation, and m6A tagging promotes their decay. Further analysis uncovers previously unappreciated transcriptional prepatterning in cortical neural stem cells. m6A signaling also regulates human cortical neurogenesis in forebrain organoids. Comparison of m6A-mRNA landscapes between mouse and human cortical neurogenesis reveals enrichment of human-specific m6A tagging of transcripts related to brain-disorder risk genes. Our study identifies an epitranscriptomic mechanism in heightened transcriptional coordination during mammalian cortical neurogenesis."

Technical variation in metagenomic analysis must be minimized to confidently assess the contributions of microbiota to human health. Here we tested 21 representative DNA extraction protocols on the same fecal samples and quantified differences in observed microbial community composition. We compared them with differences due to library preparation and sample storage, which we contrasted with observed biological variation within the same specimen or within an individual over time. We found that DNA extraction had the largest effect on the outcome of metagenomic analysis. To rank DNA extraction protocols, we considered resulting DNA quantity and quality, and we ascertained biases in estimates of community diversity and the ratio between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We recommend a standardized DNA extraction method for human fecal samples, for which transferability across labs was established and which was further benchmarked using a mock community of known composition. Its adoption will improve comparability of human gut microbiome studies and facilitate meta-analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2764232556,"Frequent loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1, a master regulator of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway, accelerate mutant KRAS driven lung carcinogenesis, but also impose a dependency of these tumors on glutaminolysis. Using a precision medicine–based approach, this work uncovers a metabolic vulnerability of KRAS–KEAP1-mutant lung cancers that can be therapeutically exploited using currently available glutaminase inhibitors and provides a scientific rationale for patient selection in clinical trials. Treating KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a major challenge in cancer treatment given the difficulties associated with directly inhibiting the KRAS oncoprotein1. One approach to addressing this challenge is to define mutations that frequently co-occur with those in KRAS, which themselves may lead to therapeutic vulnerabilities in tumors. Approximately 20% of KRAS-mutant LUAD tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in the KEAP1 gene encoding Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (refs. 2, 3, 4), a negative regulator of nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2; hereafter NRF2), which is the master transcriptional regulator of the endogenous antioxidant response5,6,7,8,9,10. The high frequency of mutations in KEAP1 suggests an important role for the oxidative stress response in lung tumorigenesis. Using a CRISPR–Cas9-based approach in a mouse model of KRAS-driven LUAD, we examined the effects of Keap1 loss in lung cancer progression. We show that loss of Keap1 hyperactivates NRF2 and promotes KRAS-driven LUAD in mice. Through a combination of CRISPR–Cas9-based genetic screening and metabolomic analyses, we show that Keap1- or Nrf2-mutant cancers are dependent on increased glutaminolysis, and this property can be therapeutically exploited through the pharmacological inhibition of glutaminase. Finally, we provide a rationale for stratification of human patients with lung cancer harboring KRAS/KEAP1- or KRAS/NRF2-mutant lung tumors as likely to respond to glutaminase inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2758815122,"As organisms age, cells accumulate genetic and epigenetic errors that eventually lead to impaired organ function or catastrophic transformation such as cancer. Because aging reflects a stochastic process of increasing disorder, cells in an organ will be individually affected in different ways, thus rendering bulk analyses of postmitotic adult cells difficult to interpret. Here, we directly measure the effects of aging in human tissue by performing single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2,544 human pancreas cells from eight donors spanning six decades of life. We find that islet endocrine cells from older donors display increased levels of transcriptional noise and potential fate drift. By determining the mutational history of individual cells, we uncover a novel mutational signature in healthy aging endocrine cells. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from primary cells to derive insights into genetic and transcriptional processes that operate on aging human tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2756634427,"Lung alveoli, which are unique to air-breathing organisms, have been challenging to generate from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in part because there are limited model systems available to provide the necessary developmental roadmaps for in vitro differentiation. Here we report the generation of alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2s), the facultative progenitors of lung alveoli, from human PSCs. Using multicolored fluorescent reporter lines, we track and purify human SFTPC+ alveolar progenitors as they emerge from endodermal precursors in response to stimulation of Wnt and FGF signaling. Purified PSC-derived SFTPC+ cells form monolayered epithelial ""alveolospheres"" in 3D cultures without the need for mesenchymal support, exhibit self-renewal capacity, and display additional AEC2 functional capacities. Footprint-free CRISPR-based gene correction of PSCs derived from patients carrying a homozygous surfactant mutation (SFTPB121ins2) restores surfactant processing in AEC2s. Thus, PSC-derived AEC2s provide a platform for disease modeling and future functional regeneration of the distal lung."

Hung et al. found that release of the neuropeptide oxytocin in the ventral tegmental area of the brain increased prosocial behaviors in mice (see the Perspective by Preston). Optogenetic manipulation of oxytocin release influenced sociability in a context-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W2762425175,"The Microbiome Quality Control project consortium reports outcomes of a baseline study (MBQC) that will guide future improvements in reproducibility of microbiome analyses. In order for human microbiome studies to translate into actionable outcomes for health, meta-analysis of reproducible data from population-scale cohorts is needed. Achieving sufficient reproducibility in microbiome research has proven challenging. We report a baseline investigation of variability in taxonomic profiling for the Microbiome Quality Control (MBQC) project baseline study (MBQC-base). Blinded specimen sets from human stool, chemostats, and artificial microbial communities were sequenced by 15 laboratories and analyzed using nine bioinformatics protocols. Variability depended most on biospecimen type and origin, followed by DNA extraction, sample handling environment, and bioinformatics. Analysis of artificial community specimens revealed differences in extraction efficiency and bioinformatic classification. These results may guide researchers in experimental design choices for gut microbiome studies."
https://openalex.org/W2762486448,"In the quest for a functional cure or the eradication of HIV infection, it is necessary to know the sizes of the reservoirs from which infection rebounds after treatment interruption. Thus, we quantified SIV and HIV tissue burdens in tissues of infected nonhuman primates and lymphoid tissue (LT) biopsies from infected humans. Before antiretroviral therapy (ART), LTs contained >98% of the SIV RNA+ and DNA+ cells. With ART, the numbers of virus (v) RNA+ cells substantially decreased but remained detectable, and their persistence was associated with relatively lower drug concentrations in LT than in peripheral blood. Prolonged ART also decreased the levels of SIV- and HIV-DNA+ cells, but the estimated size of the residual tissue burden of 108 vDNA+ cells potentially containing replication-competent proviruses, along with evidence of continuing virus production in LT despite ART, indicated two important sources for rebound following treatment interruption. The large sizes of these tissue reservoirs underscore challenges in developing 'HIV cure' strategies targeting multiple sources of virus production."
https://openalex.org/W2758479384,"To further our understanding of the genetic etiology of autism, we generated and analyzed genome sequence data from 516 idiopathic autism families (2,064 individuals). This resource includes >59 million single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 9,212 private copy number variants (CNVs), of which 133,992 and 88 are de novo mutations (DNMs), respectively. We estimate a mutation rate of ∼1.5 × 10−8 SNVs per site per generation with a significantly higher mutation rate in repetitive DNA. Comparing probands and unaffected siblings, we observe several DNM trends. Probands carry more gene-disruptive CNVs and SNVs, resulting in severe missense mutations and mapping to predicted fetal brain promoters and embryonic stem cell enhancers. These differences become more pronounced for autism genes (p = 1.8 × 10−3, OR = 2.2). Patients are more likely to carry multiple coding and noncoding DNMs in different genes, which are enriched for expression in striatal neurons (p = 3 × 10−3), suggesting a path forward for genetically characterizing more complex cases of autism."

Although engineered symbiotic bacteria have been shown to render mosquitoes resistant to the parasite, the challenge remains to effectively introduce such bacteria into mosquito populations. We describe a Serratia bacterium strain (AS1) isolated from Anopheles ovaries that stably colonizes the mosquito midgut, female ovaries, and male accessory glands and spreads rapidly throughout mosquito populations. Serratia AS1 was genetically engineered for secretion of anti-Plasmodium effector proteins, and the recombinant strains inhibit development of Plasmodium falciparum in mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W2757007104,"The transcription factor NRF2 is a master regulator of the cellular antioxidant response, and it is often genetically activated in non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) by, for instance, mutations in the negative regulator KEAP1. While direct pharmacological inhibition of NRF2 has proven challenging, its aberrant activation rewires biochemical networks in cancer cells that may create special vulnerabilities. Here, we use chemical proteomics to map druggable proteins that are selectively expressed in KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells. Principal among these is NR0B1, an atypical orphan nuclear receptor that we show engages in a multimeric protein complex to regulate the transcriptional output of KEAP1-mutant NSCLC cells. We further identify small molecules that covalently target a conserved cysteine within the NR0B1 protein interaction domain, and we demonstrate that these compounds disrupt NR0B1 complexes and impair the anchorage-independent growth of KEAP1-mutant cancer cells. Our findings designate NR0B1 as a druggable transcriptional regulator that supports NRF2-dependent lung cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2757764473,"Flexible association comes at a price The CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system is guided to its target DNA sequence by a small RNA that must search the genome to find its target site. To allow the guide RNA to bind, Cas9 must unwind the DNA at each location that it searches. Jones et al. used single-molecule fluorescence methods and bulk biochemistry to show that Cas9 takes 6 hours to find its target sequence, with each potential target bound for less than 30 ms. Overall, the CRISPR-Cas9 system pays for its flexible association mechanism with slow kinetics, but this can be overcome by using high concentrations of Cas9 and guide RNA.

https://openalex.org/W2761896392,"Histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) is an evolutionarily conserved feature of enhancer chromatin catalyzed by the COMPASS-like methyltransferase family, which includes Trr in Drosophila melanogaster and MLL3 (encoded by KMT2C) and MLL4 (encoded by KMT2D) in mammals. Here we demonstrate that Drosophila embryos expressing catalytically deficient Trr eclose and develop to productive adulthood. Parallel experiments with a trr allele that augments enzyme product specificity show that conversion of H3K4me1 at enhancers to H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 is also compatible with life and results in minimal changes in gene expression. Similarly, loss of the catalytic SET domains of MLL3 and MLL4 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) does not disrupt self-renewal. Drosophila embryos with trr alleles encoding catalytic mutants manifest subtle developmental abnormalities when subjected to temperature stress or altered cohesin levels. Collectively, our findings suggest that animal development can occur in the context of Trr or mammalian COMPASS-like proteins deficient in H3K4 monomethylation activity and point to a possible role for H3K4me1 on cis-regulatory elements in specific settings to fine-tune transcriptional regulation in response to environmental stress."
https://openalex.org/W2758914079,"Imaging a microscopic power struggle Strongly interacting fermions in a two-dimensional lattice form a checkerboard pattern, with spins of opposite directions occupying neighboring sites of the lattice. When an external magnetic field is applied, the situation becomes more complicated—should the spins align with the field, or try to preserve the checkerboard order? Brown et al. studied this problem using 6 Li atoms in an optical lattice with unequal numbers of two spin components; the imbalance between the two played the role of an effective magnetic field. With the field applied, the checkerboard pattern correlations of the spin component perpendicular to the field became stronger than those of the spin component parallel to the field, indicating that the system was approaching the so-called canted antiferromagnetic state.

Here we show that, although metabolic switching occurs during early mesoderm and endoderm differentiation, high glycolytic flux is maintained and, in fact, essential during early ectoderm specification. The elevated glycolysis observed in hPSCs requires elevated MYC/MYCN activity. Metabolic switching during endodermal and mesodermal differentiation coincides with a reduction in MYC/MYCN and can be reversed by ectopically restoring MYC activity.

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are thought to generate most of their energy by oxidation of glucose through the glycolytic pathway, consequently producing high levels of secreted lactate (Ryall et al., 2015aRyall J.G.

This “metabolic switch,” marked by a shift in dependency of glycolysis to OxPhos, is based on studies where glycolytic rates for hPSCs are compared with fully differentiated somatic cell lines, with only limited analysis of events following exit from pluripotency and commitment to the embryonic germ layers. The question of whether elevated aerobic glycolysis is required for maintenance of pluripotency has been addressed by two groups (Gu et al., 2016Gu W. Gaeta X. Sahakyan A. Chan A.B. Hong C.S. Kim R.

In these studies, inhibition of glycolysis was shown to promote spontaneous differentiation (Gu et al., 2016Gu W. Gaeta X. Sahakyan A. Chan A.B. Hong C.S. Kim R. Braas D. Plath K. Lowry W.E.

Besides having a role in energy generation, glycolytic flux in hPSCs generates elevated levels of acetate and acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), which contribute to an epigenetic landscape required for maintenance of pluripotency (Moussaieff et al., 2015bMoussaieff A.

This observation provides a rationale to explain why hPSCs utilize aerobic glycolysis and is based on the concept that pluripotent cells have highly acetylated, open chromatin in contrast to differentiated cells, where it is more compacted. Establishment of aerobic glycolysis is also important for reprogramming of fibroblasts to the pluripotent state (Folmes et al., 2011Folmes C.D.L. Nelson T.J. Martinez-Fernandez A. Arrell D.K.

The findings in these reports have been interpreted to indicate that metabolic switching is causative for the establishment of pluripotency rather than being correlative. The mechanism by which metabolic switching occurs as hPSCs exit pluripotency is obscure and has not been addressed previously. Because metabolism is intimately linked to cell fate (Ryall et al., 2015aRyall J.G. Cliff T. Dalton S. Sartorelli V.

Metabolic switches linked to pluripotency and embryonic stem cell differentiation.Cell Metab. 2015; 21: 349-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), this reflects a large knowledge gap and highlights why it is critical to define the roles of these pathways in greater detail. Using measurements of extracellular acidification rates (ECARs) and oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) as readouts for glycolysis and OxPhos, respectively, we find that, although definitive endoderm (DE) and mesoderm (Meso) undergo metabolic switching following exit from pluripotency, nascent ectoderm retains elevated glycolytic flux. This was confirmed using heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of cells labeled with 13C-glucose. Metabolic switching is therefore not a pre-requisite for pluripotency exit as previously proposed (Gu et al., 2016Gu W. Gaeta X. Sahakyan A. Chan A.B. Hong C.S. Kim R. Braas D. Plath K. Lowry W.E.

While investigating the mechanism of metabolic switching, we found that transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes underpins the switch during the early stages of pluripotent cell differentiation. This transcriptional program is orchestrated by the MYC transcription factor family. In hPSCs, MYC and MYCN maintain the transcription required for elevated glycolysis, but both factors are lost during DE and Meso differentiation, resulting in metabolic switching. In ectoderm, however, expression of MYCN is retained, allowing elevated glycolytic activity to be sustained. These findings indicate that MYC transcription factors serve as lineage-specific regulators of metabolic activity and serve as developmental regulators by coupling metabolic flux to cell fate decisions. The loss of aerobic glycolysis is believed to be an obligatory event during the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (Gu et al., 2016Gu W. Gaeta X. Sahakyan A. Chan A.B. Hong C.S. Kim R.

This process, however, has only been evaluated in a limited number of differentiation models, raising questions about the coupling between metabolism, pluripotency exit, and transition toward the three embryonic germ layers. To address this, we differentiated WA09 hESCs to DE, Meso, and two nascent ectoderm progenitor cell types: neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and early neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) (Figure 1A). Primary human fibroblasts (Fibs) and their derivative iPSCs were included in the analysis as a source of fully differentiated and reprogrammed cells, respectively. Compared with Fibs, hPSCs (WA07, WA09, and hiPSCs) exhibited elevated ECARs after glucose stimulation (Figures 1B and 1C), consistent with them generating high levels of lactate. A high concentration of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, 50 mM) was used to completely inhibit glycolysis and verify that changes in ECAR measurements are solely due to glycolytic flux (Jan et al., 2016Jan C.-I.

Oligomycin had little effect on ECARs in hPSCs (Figure 1B), indicating that energy generation was largely independent of respiratory function and that hPSCs operate near their maximal glycolytic capacity (Figure 1C). Furthermore, Fibs showed higher rates of oligomycin-sensitive oxygen consumption, consistent with their greater dependency on OxPhos (Figures 1D and 1E). ECARs in DE and Meso showed only a minor response to glucose, indicative of low glycolytic rates (Figures 1C and 1F). Oligomycin increased ECARs in DE and Meso, as seen for Fibs (Figures 1C and 1F), indicating that glycolytic flux increases in response to respiratory inhibition. However, the glycolytic capacity for DE, Meso, and Fibs was less than that of hPSCs (Figures 1C and 1F). DE and Meso also showed elevated rates of OxPhos relative to hPSCs and were comparable with Fibs (Figures 1D and 1G). These observations are consistent with DE and Meso having undergone metabolic switching. All ECAR and OCR measurements were made in the same growth factor-free medium. The germ layer-specific differences in metabolic fluxes that we observed were therefore unlikely to be caused by culture conditions. When ECARs for ectoderm cells were assayed, we were surprised to see that NPC and NCSC precursors retained elevated levels of glycolytic activity following exit from pluripotency (Figures 1C and 1F). Nascent ectoderm also displays near-maximal glycolytic capacity (Figure 1C) and low levels of OxPhos (Figure 1E), as also observed in hPSCs. These metabolic parameters indicate that metabolic switching does not occur as hPSCs transition to early ectoderm. Confirmation of hESC status and differentiation into the three germ layers is shown in Figures S1A and S1B. DE, Meso, and NPC RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from cells used in this study cluster with corresponding cell types generated by other laboratories (Bernstein et al., 2010Bernstein B.E.

This indicates that the cells used here are comparable with others generated by the field. Doubling times of hESCs and their differentiated derivatives do not vary greatly (Figure S1D), although the percentage of G0/G1 in early germ layer derivatives is increased relative to hESCs (Figure S1E). This indicates that differences in growth rates are not a major factor in determining differences in metabolic activity in PSCs and the three germ layers. Using ECARs and OCRs, we show that metabolic switching only occurs in DE and Meso following exit from pluripotency. In contrast, NPCs and NCSCs retain high glycolytic rates, elevated glycolytic capacity, and low oxygen consumption rates. These observations raise questions about the general assumption that metabolic switching is an obligatory step for pluripotency exit. To confirm that DE and Meso, but not ectoderm, undergo metabolic switching following pluripotency exit, we performed metabolic labeling with uniformly labeled 13C-glucose, followed by NMR-based fluxome analysis. This approach provides a quantitative, temporal description of the metabolic landscape in pluripotency and the three hESC-derived germ layers. Because metabolic switching during early hESC differentiation is associated with decreased glycolysis and lactate production, we focused on this pathway for 13C flux analysis. Cells were labeled over 0–4 hr with 13C-glucose and H,C-HSQC NMR spectroscopy was performed on polar and non-polar fractions and media for each cell type (Figure 2A). This time course allowed us to directly track the fate of 13C, the source of metabolites contributing to fluxomes and pathway utilization without the problems associated with longer periods of metabolic labeling. Representative spectra are shown in Figures 2B and 2C. After labeling with 13C-glucose for different times, levels of 13C-labeled metabolites were determined (Figure 2D) and displayed as a heatmap relative to levels in hESCs at equivalent time intervals (Figure 2E), highlighting the similar metabolic profiles of NPCs and PSCs. This analysis includes quantitation of metabolites in the glycolytic pathway, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and generation of glutathione, acetate, glycogen, and amino acids. As an example, lactate levels over a 4-hr 13C-glucose labeling time course are at least 50-fold higher for hPSCs and NPCs compared with Fibs and the two other hPSC-derived germ layers (Figure 2D). This analysis also identifies potential points of differential metabolic regulation between cell types. For example, hexokinase (HK) activity is saturated in DE and Meso, as indicated by the accumulation of intracellular glucose relative to glucose 6-phosphate (Figure 2D). This is not observed in hPSCs and ectoderm, indicating that HK activity is a potential point of metabolic regulation during development. This analysis indicates that rates of metabolite accumulation associated with glycolysis are high in hPSCs and ectoderm but significantly lower in Meso and DE. Lactate, acetate, and alanine accumulation showed similar trends (Figure 2D). hESCs and ectoderm cells have a greater flux of carbon, in nanomoles per hour standardized to 25 million cells, for glycolytic intermediates, lactate, alanine, acetyl-CoA, and acetate (Figure S2A). This was determined by calculating the carbon flux for each metabolite over 4 hr. These data are consistent with the ECAR analysis in Figure 1, showing that ectoderm does not undergo metabolic switching following exit from pluripotency. To determine when metabolic switching occurs in the ectoderm lineage, we evaluated metabolic flux as NPCs transition to midbrain floor plate precursors, as determined by the expression of FOXA2 and LMX1A (Figure S2B) and loss of PAX6 (Figure S2C; Kirkeby et al., 2012Kirkeby A. Grealish S. Wolf D.A. Nelander J. Wood J. Lundblad M. Lindvall O. Parmar M.

Buch A. et al.Dopamine neurons derived from human ES cells efficiently engraft in animal models of Parkinson’s disease.Nature. 2011; 480: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Metabolic switching in the ectoderm lineage occurs after NPC identity is lost (day 10) (Figures S2B–S2D), coinciding with the loss of MYCN and induction of FOXA2. This shows that ectoderm is capable of metabolic switching but that it occurs under a different developmental timeline than DE and Meso. Metabolites for the TCA cycle were also determined (Figure 2E). This analysis indicates that flux through the TCA cycle is elevated in Meso and DE relative to hPSCs and ectoderm. These data show that metabolic switching is clearly linked to specific cell fate transitions and not a result of differences in differentiation rates along different lineages. The proliferation rates and cell cycle profiles for each germ layer are comparable (Figures S1D and S1E), ruling out the possibility that metabolic differences are due to cell division requirements. Overall, these observations raise important questions about the role of metabolic regulation in cell fate decisions (Discussion). These observations confirm that metabolic switching does not occur during early ectoderm germ layer formation following exit from pluripotency and only occurs in Meso and DE. In summary, metabolic switching is not an absolute requirement for exit from the pluripotent state but is associated with specific cell fate decisions associated with the formation of Meso and DE. The results so far show that metabolic switching occurs in Meso and DE, but not nascent ectoderm, following pluripotency exit. We then asked whether elevated aerobic glycolysis was important for maintenance of pluripotency and specification of early ectoderm. For these experiments, we used two inhibitors of glycolysis, 2-DG and 3-bromo pyruvate (BrPA), to adjust glycolytic flux, followed by measurement of 13C-lactate, 13C-acetate, and 13C-alanine levels following 13C-glucose labeling (Figure 3A). Using these metabolites as readouts, inhibitor levels were titrated so that glycolytic flux was reduced to a level comparable with Meso and DE while avoiding cytotoxicity. Under these conditions, inhibitors promoted loss of pluripotency, as indicated by a decrease in the percentage of OCT4+ and SOX2+ cells and NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 transcripts within 3 days of treatment (Figures 3B–3D; Figure S3A). Although DE and Meso markers increased under these conditions, ectoderm markers remained low (Figure S3B). This result is consistent with previous reports showing that elevated glycolytic flux is required for maintenance of hPSCs (Gu et al., 2016Gu W. Gaeta X. Sahakyan A. Chan A.B. Hong C.S. Kim R.

To address this issue further, directed differentiation to the three germ layers was performed under conditions where aerobic glycolysis was inhibited with 2-DG and BrPA. As anticipated from the previous experiment, treatment with these inhibitors had no effect on DE (Figures 3E–3G; Figure S3A) or Meso differentiation (Figures S3C–S3E). Under ectoderm differentiation conditions, however, glycolytic inhibition significantly reduced the upregulation of PAX6, SOX1, and SOX2 in NPCs (Figures 3H–3J) and PAX3, SOX1, and SOX2 NCSCs (Figure 3K). In the presence of 2-DG and BrPA, the percentage of SOX1+ cells was reduced to 8.8% and 22.0%, respectively, whereas the percentage of PAX6+ cells was <1% under both conditions (Figures 3H and 3I). We used three approaches to rule out off-target effects for these inhibitors. First, the ectoderm differentiation defect (+2-DG/+BrPA) was rescued by restoring glycolytic flux with galactose- and fructose-containing media (Figures S3F–S3H). Both of these carbon sources enter glycolysis downstream of the HK step, bypassing the effect of inhibitors in this pathway. Growth on galactose and fructose under these conditions had only a minor effect on growth rates (Figure S3F) and cell cycle profiles (Figure S4A), and NPC lineage markers were maintained, indicating that galactose and fructose rescued the effects of inhibitor alone (Figures S3H and S3I). Second, the pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibitor dichloroacetic acid (DCA) was used to activate OxPhos and suppress aerobic glycolysis in hESCs and NPCs (Figure S4B). Consequently, DCA treatment induced a loss of pluripotency (Figures S4C–S4E), resulting in the generation of Meso and DE but not ectoderm lineages (Figures S4F–S4N). Finally 2-DG, BrPA, and DCA inhibited the formation of ectoderm, but not endoderm and mesoderm, in embryoid bodies differentiated from hESCs (Figure S5). Maintenance of elevated glycolytic flux is therefore required for the initial stages of ectoderm differentiation. Next we set out to understand the mechanism underpinning elevated glycolysis in hPSCs and regulatory steps that control metabolic switching during lineage specification. From the flux analysis, we noted high activities of two key glycolytic enzymes, HK and pyruvate kinase (PK) (Figure 2D), and the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Figure 2D). All three enzymes have been implicated in metabolic switching in cancer cells (Christofk et al., 2008Christofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Ramanathan A. Gerszten R.E. Wei R.

We employed a pharmacogenetic approach to silence either parvalbumin (PV)- or somatostatin (SOM)-expressing interneurons while MEC cells were recorded in freely moving mice. PV-cell silencing antagonized the hexagonally patterned spatial selectivity of grid cells, especially in layer II of MEC. The impairment was accompanied by reduced speed modulation in colocalized speed cells. Silencing SOM cells, in contrast, had no impact on grid cells or speed cells but instead decreased the spatial selectivity of cells with discrete aperiodic firing fields. Border cells and head direction cells were not affected by either intervention. The findings point to distinct roles for PV and SOM interneurons in the local dynamics underlying periodic and aperiodic firing in spatially modulated cells of the MEC. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

We sought to develop a complementary pharmacological approach whereby proteasome-mediated FLT3 degradation could be promoted by inhibitors of the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) responsible for cleaving ubiquitin from FLT3. Because the relevant DUBs for FLT3 are not known, we assembled a focused library of most reported small-molecule DUB inhibitors and carried out a cellular phenotypic screen to identify compounds that could induce the degradation of oncogenic FLT3. Subsequent target deconvolution efforts allowed us to identify USP10 as the critical DUB required to stabilize FLT3. Targeting of USP10 showed efficacy in preclinical models of mutant-FLT3 AML, including cell lines, primary patient specimens and mouse models of oncogenic-FLT3-driven leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2761259115,"The mammalian brain contains dedicated circuits for both the learned expression and suppression of fear. These circuits require precise coordination to facilitate the appropriate expression of fear behavior, but the mechanisms underlying this coordination remain unclear. Using a combination of chemogenetics, activity-based neuronal-ensemble labeling and in vivo electrophysiology, we found that fear extinction learning confers on parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) a dedicated role in the selective suppression of a previously encoded fear memory and BLA fear-encoding neurons. In addition, following extinction learning, PV interneurons enable a competing interaction between a 6-12 Hz oscillation and a fear-associated 3-6 Hz oscillation within the BLA. Loss of this competition increases a 3-6 Hz oscillatory signature, with BLA→medial prefrontal cortex directionality signaling the recurrence of fear expression. The discovery of cellular and oscillatory substrates of fear extinction learning that critically depend on BLA PV interneurons could inform therapies aimed at preventing the pathological recurrence of fear following extinction learning."
https://openalex.org/W2756634820,"Confidence and actions are normally tightly interwoven-if I am sure that it is going to rain, I will take an umbrella-therefore, it is difficult to understand their interplay. Stimulated by the ego-dystonic nature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), where compulsive actions are recognized as disproportionate, we hypothesized that action and confidence might be independently updated during learning. Participants completed a predictive-inference task designed to identify how action and confidence evolve in response to surprising changes in the environment. While OCD patients (like controls) correctly updated their confidence according to changes in the environment, their actions (unlike those of controls) mostly disregarded this knowledge. Therefore, OCD patients develop an accurate, internal model of the environment but fail to use it to guide behavior. Results demonstrated a novel dissociation between confidence and action, suggesting a cognitive architecture whereby confidence estimates can accurately track the statistic of the environment independently from performance."
https://openalex.org/W2759905027,"Environmental illumination spans many log units of intensity and is tracked for essential functions that include regulation of the circadian clock, arousal state, and hormone levels. Little is known about the neural representation of light intensity and how it covers the necessary range. This question became accessible with the discovery of mammalian photoreceptors that are required for intensity-driven functions, the M1 ipRGCs. The spike outputs of M1s are thought to uniformly track intensity over a wide range. We provide a different understanding: individual cells operate over a narrow range, but the population covers irradiances from moonlight to full daylight. The range of most M1s is limited by depolarization block, which is generally considered pathological but is produced intrinsically by these cells. The dynamics of block allow the population to code stimulus intensity with flexibility and efficiency. Moreover, although spikes are distorted by block, they are regularized during axonal propagation."

We analyzed the data for the period between the northwest and southeast monsoon 2007–2011. A pelagic hotspot index was constructed from a model of multi-spectrum satellite-based oceanographic data in relation to skipjack fishing performance. Results showed that skipjack catch per unit efforts (CPUEs) increased significantly in areas of highest pelagic hotspot indices. The distribution and dynamics of habitat hotspots were detected by the synoptic measurements of SST, SSHA and Chl-a ranging from 29.5° to 31.5°C, from 2.5 to 12.5 cm and from 0.15 to 0.35 mg m-3, respectively. Total area of hotspots consistently peaked in May. Validation of skipjack CPUE predicted by our model against observed data from 2012 was highly significant. The key pelagic habitat corresponded with the Chl-a front, which could be related to the areas of relatively high prey abundance (enhanced feeding opportunity) for skipjack. We found that the area and persistence of the potential skipjack habitat hotspots for the 5 years were clearly identified by the 0.2 mg m-3 Chl-a isopleth, suggesting that the Chl-a front provides a key oceanographic indicator for global understanding on skipjack tuna habitat hotspots in the western tropical Pacific Ocean, especially within Coral Triangle tuna."

https://openalex.org/W2764110000,"Both humans and mice lacking functional growth hormone (GH) receptors are known to be resistant to cancer. Further, autocrine GH has been reported to act as a cancer promoter. Here we present the first example of a variant of the GH receptor (GHR) associated with cancer promotion, in this case lung cancer. We show that the GHRP495T variant located in the receptor intracellular domain is able to prolong the GH signal in vitro using stably expressing mouse pro-B-cell and human lung cell lines. This is relevant because GH secretion is pulsatile, and extending the signal duration makes it resemble autocrine GH action. Signal duration for the activated GHR is primarily controlled by suppressor of cytokine signalling 2 (SOCS2), the substrate recognition component of the E3 protein ligase responsible for ubiquitinylation and degradation of the GHR. SOCS2 is induced by a GH pulse and we show that SOCS2 binding to the GHR is impaired by a threonine substitution at Pro 495. This results in decreased internalisation and degradation of the receptor evident in TIRF microscopy and by measurement of mature (surface) receptor expression. Mutational analysis showed that the residue at position 495 impairs SOCS2 binding only when a threonine is present, consistent with interference with the adjacent Thr494. The latter is key for SOCS2 binding, together with nearby Tyr487, which must be phosphorylated for SOCS2 binding. We also undertook nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy approach for structural comparison of the SOCS2 binding scaffold Ile455-Ser588, and concluded that this single substitution has altered the structure of the SOCS2 binding site. Importantly, we find that lung BEAS-2B cells expressing GHRP495T display increased expression of transcripts associated with tumour proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastases (TWIST1, SNAI2, EGFR, MYC and CCND1) at 2 h after a GH pulse. This is consistent with prolonged GH signalling acting to promote cancer progression in lung cancer."

Here, we show that PTEN deletion in HCT116 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells leads to suppression of CHK1 and CHK2 activation in response to irradiation, impaired G2 checkpoint proficiency and radiosensitization. These defects are associated with reduced expression of MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1, components of the apical MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) DNA damage response complex. Consistent with reduced MRN complex function, PTEN-deficient cells fail to resect DNA double-strand breaks efficiently after irradiation and show greatly diminished proficiency for DNA repair via the error-free homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway. MRE11 is highly unstable in PTEN-deficient cells but stability can be significantly restored by inhibiting mTORC1 or p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), downstream kinases whose activities are stimulated by AKT, or by mutating a residue in MRE11 that we show is phosphorylated by p70S6K in vitro. In primary human fibroblasts, activated AKT suppresses MRN complex expression to escalate RAS-induced DNA damage and thereby reinforce oncogene-induced senescence. Taken together, our data demonstrate that deregulation of the PI3K-AKT/ mTORC1/ p70S6K pathways, an event frequently observed in cancer, exert profound effects on genome stability via MRE11 with potential implications for tumour initiation and therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2760907457,"Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) is considered an attractive target for anticancer immunotherapy. TLR5 agonists, bacterial flagellin and engineered flagellin derivatives, have been shown to have potent antitumor and metastasis-suppressive effects in multiple animal models and to be safe in both animals and humans. Anticancer efficacy of TLR5 agonists stems from TLR5-dependent activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) that mediates innate and adaptive antitumor immune responses. To extend application of TLR5-targeted anticancer immunotherapy to tumors that do not naturally express TLR5, we created an adenovirus-based vector for intratumor delivery, named Mobilan that drives expression of self-activating TLR5 signaling cassette comprising of human TLR5 and a secreted derivative of Salmonella flagellin structurally analogous to a clinical stage TLR5 agonist, entolimod. Co-expression of TLR5 receptor and agonist in Mobilan-infected cells established an autocrine/paracrine TLR5 signaling loop resulting in constitutive activation of NF-κB both in vitro and in vivo. Injection of Mobilan into primary tumors of the prostate cancer-prone transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice resulted in a strong induction of multiple genes involved in inflammatory responses and mobilization of innate immune cells into the tumors including neutrophils and NK cells and suppressed tumor progression. Intratumoral injection of Mobilan into subcutaneously growing syngeneic prostate tumors in immunocompetent hosts improved animal survival after surgical resection of the tumors, by suppression of tumor metastasis. In addition, vaccination of mice with irradiated Mobilan-transduced prostate tumor cells protected mice against subsequent tumor challenge. These results provide proof-of-concept for Mobilan as a tool for antitumor vaccination that directs TLR5-mediated immune response toward cancer cells and does not require identification of tumor antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2763750244,"Measuring cellular microstructures non-invasively and achieving specificity towards a cell-type population within an interrogated in vivo tissue, remains an outstanding challenge in brain research. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) provides an opportunity to achieve cellular specificity via the spectral resolution of metabolites such as N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) and myo-Inositol (mI), which are considered neuronal and astrocytic markers, respectively. Yet the information typically obtained with MRS describes metabolic concentrations, diffusion coefficients or relaxation rates rather than microstructures. Understanding how these metabolites are compartmentalized is a challenging but important goal, which so far has been mainly addressed using diffusion models. Here, we present direct in vivo evidence for the confinement of NAA and mI within sub-cellular components, namely, the randomly oriented process of neurons and astrocytes, respectively. Our approach applied Relaxation Enhanced MRS at ultrahigh (21.1 T) field, and used its high 1H sensitivity to measure restricted diffusion correlations for NAA and mI using a Double Diffusion Encoding (DDE) filter. While very low macroscopic anisotropy was revealed by spatially localized Diffusion Tensor Spectroscopy, DDE displayed characteristic amplitude modulations reporting on confinements in otherwise randomly oriented anisotropic microstructures for both metabolites. This implies that for the chosen set of parameters, the DDE measurements had a biased sensitivity towards NAA and mI sited in the more confined environments of neurites and astrocytic branches, than in the cell somata. These measurements thus provide intrinsic diffusivities and compartment diameters, and revealed subcellular neuronal and astrocytic morphologies in normal in vivo rat brains.

The binding of nitric oxide (NO) to the heme cofactor of heme-nitric oxide/oxygen binding (H-NOX) proteins can lead to the dissociation of the heme-ligating histidine residue and yield a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex, an important step for NO-dependent signaling. In the five-coordinate nitrosyl complex, NO can reside on either the distal or proximal side of the heme, which could have a profound influence over the lifetime of the in vivo signal. To investigate this central molecular question, we characterized the Shewanella oneidensis H-NOX (So H-NOX)–NO complex biophysically under limiting and excess NO conditions. The results show that So H-NOX preferably forms a distal NO species with both limiting and excess NO. Therefore, signal strength and complex lifetime in vivo will be dictated by the dissociation rate of NO from the distal complex and the rebinding of the histidine ligand to the heme."
https://openalex.org/W2761429414,"Objectives We studied the frequency and risk factors for loss of long-term non-progressor (LTNP) and HIV controller (HIC) status among patients identified as such in 2005 in the French Hospital Database on HIV (FHDH-ANRS CO4). Methods We selected patients who were treatment-naïve and asymptomatic in 2005 (baseline). Those with ≥8 years of known HIV infection and a CD4 cell nadir ≥500/mm3 were classified as LTNP and those with ≥10 years of known HIV infection and 90% of plasma viral load (VL) values ≤500 copies/ml in the absence of cART as HIC. cART initiation without loss of status and death from non AIDS-defining causes were considered as competing events. Results After 5 years of follow-up, 33% (95%CI; 27–42) of 171 LTNP patients and 17% (95%CI; 10–30) of 72 HIC patients had lost their status. In multivariable analyses, loss of LTNP status was associated with lower baseline CD4 cell counts and CD4/CD8 ratios. Only VL was significantly associated with loss of HIC status after adjustment for the baseline CD4 cell count, the CD4/CD8 ratio, and concomitant LTNP status. The hazard ratio for loss of HIC status was 5.5 (95%CI, 1.5–20.1) for baseline VL 50–500 vs ≤50 cp/mL, after adjustment for the baseline CD4 cell count. Conclusions One-third of LTNP and one-fifth of HIC patients lost their status after 5 years of follow-up, raising questions as to the possible benefits and timing of ART initiation in these populations."
https://openalex.org/W2761652353,"Recently, we reported that the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, controls leukocyte migration through interaction with the cytoskeleton remodeling effector, VAV, and direct methylation of the cytoskeletal regulatory protein, Talin. However, it is unclear whether this extranuclear, epigenetic-independent function of EZH2 has a profound impact on the initiation of cellular transformation and metastasis. Here, we show that EZH2 increases Talin1 methylation and cleavage, thereby enhancing adhesion turnover and promoting accelerated tumorigenesis. This transforming capacity is abolished by targeted disruption of EZH2 interaction with VAV. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that EZH2 in the cytoplasm is closely associated with cancer stem cell properties, and that overexpression of EZH2, a mutant EZH2 lacking its nuclear localization signal (EZH2ΔNLS), or a methyl-mimicking Talin1 mutant substantially promotes JAK2-dependent STAT3 activation and cellular transformation. Taken together, our results suggest a critical role for the VAV interaction-dependent, extranuclear action of EZH2 in neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2762722092,"It is of interest to apply plant tissue culture to generate plants resistant to toxic effects of cadmium (Cd) on plant growth. Callus cultures were initiated from leaf explants of micropropagated potato plantlets (Solanum tuberosum L., cv. Iwa) for in vitro selection comprising 18 different Cd treatments varying in Cd exposure timing and duration. Plantlets regenerated from two different lines of Cd-selected calli, L9 and L11, were found to exhibit enhanced resistance to 218 μM Cd compared to control (source plantlets for leaf explants used to initiate callus cultures for Cd resistance). In response to 218 μM Cd, L11 plantlets had lower levels of lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide than control and L9 plantlets. In addition, antioxidative enzyme activities in L11 were generally higher than control. L11 also had a higher level of proline than control."
https://openalex.org/W2762741685,"Background Family members of critically ill patients report high levels of conflict with clinicians, have poor understanding of prognosis, struggle to make decisions, and experience substantial symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress regardless of patient survival status. Efficient interventions are needed to prepare these families to act as patient proxies. Objectives To assess a brief “patient activation” intervention designed to set expectations and prepare families of adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients to communicate effectively with the clinical team. Design Phase I study of acceptability and immediate side effects. Setting and participants 122 healthcare proxies of 111 consecutive patients with a stay of ≥24 hours in the Johns Hopkins Hospital Medical ICU (MICU), in Baltimore, Maryland. Intervention Reading aloud to proxies from a booklet (Flesch-Kincard reading grade level 3.8) designed with multidisciplinary input including from former MICU proxies. Results Enrolled proxies had a median age of 51 years old with 83 (68%) female, and 55 (45%) African-American. MICU mortality was 18%, and 37 patients (33%) died in hospital or were discharged to hospice. Among proxies 98% (95% CI: 94% - 100%) agreed or strongly agreed that the intervention was appropriate, 98% (95% CI: 92% - 99%) agreed or strongly agreed that it is important for families to know the information in the booklet, and 54 (44%, 95% CI 35%– 54%) agreed or strongly agreed that parts of the booklet are upsetting. Upset vs. non-upset proxies were not statistically or substantially different in terms of age, sex, education level, race, relation to the patient, or perceived decision-making authority. Conclusions This patient activation intervention was acceptable and important to nearly all proxies. Frequently, the intervention was simultaneously rated as both acceptable/important and upsetting. Proxies who rated the intervention as upsetting were not identifiable based on readily available proxy or patient characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2761143850,"Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder. Inflammation and oxidative stress are involved in the etiopathogenesis of rosacea and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to investigate the association between rosacea and CKD.This population-based cohort study identified 277 patients with rosacea in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database during 2001-2005. These patients were matched for age, sex, and comorbidities with 2216 patients without rosacea. All subjects were individually followed-up for 8-12 years to identify those who subsequently developed CKD.The incidence rates of CKD per 1000 person-years were 16.02 in patients with rosacea and 10.63 in the non-rosacea reference population. After adjusting for other covariates and considering the competing risk of mortality, patients with rosacea remained at increased risk of CKD (adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio (aSD-HR) 2.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-3.82). The aSD-HRs (95% CI) for CKD were 1.82 (0.83-4.00) and 2.53 (1.11-5.75) for patients with mild and moderate-to-severe rosacea, respectively.Rosacea is an independent risk factor for CKD. High rosacea severity and old age further increased CKD risk in patients with rosacea. Careful monitoring for CKD development should be included as part of integrated care for patients with rosacea."

https://openalex.org/W2764238526,"The growing interest in personalized medicine requires making inferences from descriptive indexes estimated from individual recordings of physiological signals, with statistical analyses focused on individual differences between/within subjects, rather than comparing supposedly homogeneous cohorts. To this end, methods to compute confidence limits of individual estimates of descriptive indexes are needed. This study introduces numerical methods to compute such confidence limits and perform statistical comparisons between indexes derived from autoregressive (AR) modeling of individual time series. Analytical approaches are generally not viable, because the indexes are usually nonlinear functions of the AR parameters. We exploit Monte Carlo (MC) and Bootstrap (BS) methods to reproduce the sampling distribution of the AR parameters and indexes computed from them. Here, these methods are implemented for spectral and information-theoretic indexes of heart-rate variability (HRV) estimated from AR models of heart-period time series. First, the MS and BC methods are tested in a wide range of synthetic HRV time series, showing good agreement with a gold-standard approach (i.e. multiple realizations of the ""true"" process driving the simulation). Then, real HRV time series measured from volunteers performing cognitive tasks are considered, documenting (i) the strong variability of confidence limits' width across recordings, (ii) the diversity of individual responses to the same task, and (iii) frequent disagreement between the cohort-average response and that of many individuals. We conclude that MC and BS methods are robust in estimating confidence limits of these AR-based indexes and thus recommended for short-term HRV analysis. Moreover, the strong inter-individual differences in the response to tasks shown by AR-based indexes evidence the need of individual-by-individual assessments of HRV features. Given their generality, MC and BS methods are promising for applications in biomedical signal processing and beyond, providing a powerful new tool for assessing the confidence limits of indexes estimated from individual recordings."
https://openalex.org/W2762009289,"In recent years, analyzing genome-wide expression profiles to find genetic markers has received much attention as a challenging field of research aiming at unveiling biological mechanisms behind complex disorders. The identification of reliable and reproducible markers has lately been achieved by integrating genome-scale functional relationships and transcriptome datasets, and a number of algorithms have been developed to support this strategy. In this paper, we present a promising and easily applicable tool to accomplish this goal, namely CytoGTA, which is a Cytoscape plug-in that relies on an optimistic game theoretic approach (GTA) for identifying subnetwork markers. Given transcriptomic data of two phenotype classes and interactome data, this plug-in offers discriminative markers for the two classes. The high performance of CytoGTA would not have been achieved if the strategy of GTA was not implemented in Cytoscape. This plug-in provides a simple-to-use platform, convenient for biological researchers to interactively work with and visualize the structure of subnetwork markers. CytoGTA is one of the few available Cytoscape plug-ins for marker identification, which shows superior performance to existing methods."
