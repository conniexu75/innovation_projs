Since ADP-ribose can be formed from NAD and NAD is elevated during oxidative stress, we studied whole cell currents and increases in the intercellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+] i ) in long transient receptor potential channel 2(LTRPC2)-transfected HEK 293 cells after stimulation with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Cation currents carried by monovalent cations and Ca2+ were induced by H2O2 (5 mm in the bath solution) as well as by intracellular ADP-ribose (0.3 mm in the pipette solution) but not by NAD (1 mm). H2O2-induced currents developed slowly after a characteristic delay of 3–6 min and receded after wash-out of H2O2. [Ca2+] i was rapidly increased by H2O2 inLTRPC2-transfected cells as well as in control cells; however, in LTRPC2-transfected cells, H2O2 evoked a second delayed rise in [Ca2+] i . A splice variant of LTRPC2 with a deletion in the C terminus (amino acids 1292–1325) was identified in neutrophil granulocytes. This variant was stimulated by H2O2 as the wild type. However, it did not respond to ADP-ribose. We conclude that activation of LTRPC2 by H2O2 is independent of ADP-ribose and that LTRPC2 may mediate the influx of Na+ and Ca2+during oxidative stress, such as the respiratory burst in granulocytes.

Plant T.D. Schultz G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Its function may not be confined to that of a Ca2+-permeable ion channel widely expressed in several cell types but may extend to the role of an enzyme, as has been shown for its relative TRP-phospholipase C interacting kinase (2Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). LTRPC2 contains a Nudix box in its C terminus (3Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The protein NUDT9 that is homologous to the C terminus of LTRPC2 is a specific ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase degrading ADP-ribose (3Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). A similar function may be attributed to LTRPC2. Alternatively, the Nudix box may serve as a regulatory ADP-ribose-binding site because ADP-ribose has been shown to stimulate the channel activity of LTRPC2 (3Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Therefore, ADP-ribose can be thought of as a novel second messenger regulating Ca2+influx. However, the stimuli and signaling pathways leading to elevated levels of ADP-ribose have not been elucidated in detail. ADP-ribose can be generated from cyclic ADP-ribose (5Howard M. Grimaldi J.C.

Bertocchini F. Schindler H. Sorrentino V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2790-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, ADP-ribose can be produced from NAD (13Berthelier V. Tixier J.M. Muller-Steffner H. Schuber F. Deterre P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Ziegler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1550-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This links ADP-ribose to the redox state of the cell and may lead to the assumption that ADP-ribose and ADP-ribose-induced Ca2+influx play a role during oxidative stress because a characteristic feature of oxidative stress is an increased ratio of NAD to NADH (15Wilson H.L. Dipp M. Thomas J.M. Lad C. Galione A. Evans A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11180-11188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this context, it is of interest that NAD has been reported to be a further stimulus of LTRPC2 channels (16Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Yokoi H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. Science. 2001; 293: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 17Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E. Nishida M. Yoshida T. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Mori E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Kurose H. Okada Y. Imoto K. Mori Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). To study the role of LTRPC2 in oxidative stress, we used an experimental model in which a strong oxidant, H2O2, was applied toLTRPC2-transfected cells. Indeed, H2O2 evoked cation influx and increased [Ca2+] i . Furthermore, we studied the effects of H2O2 on splice variants of LTRPC2 identified in HL-60 cells and neutrophil granulocytes. One splice variant was activated by H2O2 as the wild type but did not respond to ADP-ribose, in contrast to the wild type. Thus, oxidative stress leads to the activation of LTRPC2. Channel activation, however, does not need to be directly mediated by ADP-ribose. For cloning of LTRPC2(formerly named TRPC7 (18Nagamine K. Kudoh J. Minoshima S. Kawasaki K. Asakawa S. Ito F. Shimizu N. Genomics. 1998; 54: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar)) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, total RNA was isolated from 1 to 2 × 107 undifferentiated HL-60 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Groningen, the Netherlands). mRNA was extracted with 15 μl of Oligotex (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 500 ng of HL-60 mRNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen) using 500 ng of oligo(dT) primer or 2 pmol of gene-specific primer. Two adjacent cDNA segments of LTRPC2 that combined to the total open reading frame of LTRPC2 were separately amplified by two PCR reactions. In the first one, primers were chosen to amplify the region between the start codon and the SphI site at position 2736 (the 5′-segment coding for the N terminus of LTRPC2, 2.5 kb). In the second, the region between the mentionedSphI site and the stop codon was amplified (the 3′-segment coding for the C terminus of LTRPC2, 3.2 kb). The PCR conditions were: 10 min of initial denaturation at 95 °C; 35 cycles at 95 °C for 1.5 min, 60 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 2 min; final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR reaction mixture contained 0.4 μm of the respective primer, 200 μm of each dNTP, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5–1 μl of cDNA and 1.25 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Both cDNA segments of LTRPC2 were prepared for TA-cloning by adding adenosine tails with 1 μl of Taqpolymerase (AmpliTaq Gold, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Specifically, cDNA segments were dissolved in a total volume of 50 μl containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 10 mmdATP and incubated at 72 °C for 30 min with the polymerase that had been preincubated in buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the TA cloning (Invitrogen) was carried out. The 5′-segment was subcloned into pBluescript SK(−) by use of theSpeI and XhoI sites of the multiple cloning site of the vector. The 3′-segment was dissected with the endonucleasesSphI and SpeI. Subsequently, ligation of the two segments was performed with T4 ligase (Invitrogen) at theSphI sites of the segments and the SpeI site of the multiple cloning site of pBluescript SK(−). The resulting 5.2-kb insert was directionally cloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid construct pcDNA3-EGFP (modified as reported in Ref. 19Halaszovich C.R. Zitt C. Jüngling E. Lückhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37423-37428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) by use of the KpnI and XbaI sites of the multiple cloning sites of the pcDNA3-EGFP construct. Thus, the LTRPC2 variant is under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is under control of the simian virus 40 promoter. DNA sequencing was performed with a Big-DYE terminator kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A sequence alignment of our clone withLTRPC2 (originally named TRPC7, accession number AB001535(18Nagamine K. Kudoh J. Minoshima S. Kawasaki K. Asakawa S. Ito F. Shimizu N. Genomics. 1998; 54: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar)) indicated that we had obtained a variant with a deletion in the N terminus as well as in the C terminus (see Fig. 1). Additionally, several nucleotides are changed, resulting in the exchange of two amino acids (S1088N and D1292E). The details were submitted to GenBankTM under accession number AJ417076. Thus, the initial cloning yielded the LTRPC2-ΔNΔC form of LTRPC2 (see below, Fig. 1 and “Results”). Venous human blood (70 ml) was taken from healthy volunteers of either sex (aged 25–35). Neutrophil granulocytes were isolated by dextran sedimentation, centrifugation through a Ficoll cushion, and separation with magnetically labeled antibodies. The isolation of total RNA (from 2.5–5 × 107granulocytes) and extraction of mRNA were performed as described for HL-60 cells. For the first-strand cDNA synthesis, oligo(dT) primer were used. For expression studies of LTRPC2 with the short and long forms of either terminus in HL-60 cells and neutrophil granulocytes, the same PCR conditions were used as described above with 0.5 μl of cDNA in a total volume of 20 μl and an annealing temperature of 63 °C (see Fig. 1 for primer sequences). Nested PCRs were performed in the same conditions as usual with 1 μl of the first PCR solution diluted 1:10. We refer to the full-length form of LTRPC2, as originally reported (18Nagamine K. Kudoh J. Minoshima S. Kawasaki K. Asakawa S. Ito F. Shimizu N. Genomics. 1998; 54: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), as LTRPC2. The variant with the deletion in the N terminus (LTRPC2-Δ538–557) is named LTRPC2-ΔN. The variant with the deletion in the C terminus (LTRPC2-Δ1292–1325) is named LTRPC2-ΔC. The variant with both deletions (LTRPC2-Δ538–557, Δ1292–1325) is named LTRPC2-ΔNΔC. References to positions refer to the full-length form. Since we had initially cloned the cDNA for the LTRPC2 variant, in which the N terminus as well as the C terminus represent shortened forms of the originally described full-length form of LTRPC2, we had to insert the missing cDNA parts of either terminus to obtain the other variants. For completion of the N terminus, the following restriction sites upstream and downstream of the missing cDNA part were chosen for directional cloning: an XmnI site at position 1962 and an SphI site at position 2736. A segment between these sites including the missing part was amplified with three subsequent PCR reactions. The first one was designed to produce a segment starting at the XmnI restriction site, extending through nucleotide 2055 of LTRPC2 (after which the missing part starts) and additionally containing 40 nucleotides of the missing part. Accordingly, the following primers (Pa, Pb) were chosen: sense (Pa), 5′-TGTGAAGCTCTTCCTGGACG-3′; and antisense (Pb), 5′-CGCGCAACGCGGGCGCTCGGGATCCTCCACCAGCACCTTTTGCAGCTTGCT-3′. The second PCR was designed to produce a segment starting with the last 40 nucleotides of the missing part and extending to the SphI restriction site. The chosen primers (Pc, Pd) were: sense (Pc), 5′-CCGAGCGCCCGGCTTGCGCGCCCGCGGCGCCCCGCCTGCACATGCACCACG-3′; and antisense (Pd), 5′-CTGCATGCACAGGGTCACACG-3′. The template for the first and second PCR was LTRPC2-ΔN-ΔC cloned in pBluescript SK(−). Since the missing cDNA part of the N terminus contains 60 nucleotides, there was an overlap of 20 nucleotides between the amplification products of the first and second PCR. This let these products anneal during the third PCR when they were used as templates. The primers were Pa and Pd. The idea of this PCR was that during the first cycle, both complementary strands would be elongated up to the respective restriction site and then completely amplified during the following cycles. Indeed, the PCR yielded the desired cDNA product coding for the restriction sites and for the whole part of the N terminus missing in LTRPC2-ΔNΔC. This segment was substituted for the corresponding region of the LTRPC2-ΔNΔC cDNA in pBluescript SK(−). The new construct corresponds toLTRPC2-ΔC, which was inserted into the pcDNA3-EGFP vector construct as described above. For cloning of the LTRPC2 cDNA constructs encoding the long form of the C terminus, a NotI restriction site at position 4298 was chosen. A PCR was performed with cDNA from HL-60 cells as template and the following primer pair (Pe, Pf): sense (Pe), 5′-GCGGCCGCCATGGACCCCATGGGAGACACCCTGGAGCCACTGTCCACGATCCAGTACAACGTGGTGGATGGCCTGAGGGACCGCCG-3′; and antisense (Pf), 5′-GCATACTAGTCAGTCAGTAGTGAGCCCCG-3′. Pe contains the NotI restriction site, the following sequence up to the missing part, and 60 nucleotides (from a total of 102 nucleotides) of the missing part. Pf contains the stop codon and an SpeI restriction site not present in the original LTRPC2 gene. The amplification product with 650 bp encodes the full 3′-segment, from the NotI restriction site to the stop codon, and an additional SpeI restriction site. This product was used to create the cDNA of the LTRPC2 variant with the complete 3′-segment coding for LTRPC2-ΔN, in pBluescript SK(−) as well as in pcDNA3-EGFP. Finally, the full-length LTRPC2 cDNA was cloned by cutting LTRPC2-ΔN and LTRPC2-ΔC(both in pBluescript SK(−)) at the mentioned XbaI andSphI restriction sites and subsequent ligation of the fragments coding for the long version of the N and C terminus, respectively. Insertion into pcDNA3-EGFP was performed as described above. All PCR products were sequenced prior to further use, and all constructs were sequenced at the transition sites. All procedures were performed in accordance with the respective manufacturer's instructions, if not indicated otherwise. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Biochrom), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma), and 4 mm l-glutamine (Biochrom). Cells were plated onto polylysine (0.1 μg/μl, Sigma)-coated glass coverslips for 24 h and then transiently transfected with one of the described pcDNA3-EGFP channel vector constructs (5 μg) and TransFast transfection reagent (7.5 μl; Promega, Mannheim, Germany). As controls, cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of “empty” vector construct and 3.75 μl of TransFast transfection reagent. Electrophysiological and fluorimetric studies were carried out 24–48 h after transfection in cells visibly positive for EGFP. Transfected cells were studied with the patch clamp technique in the whole cell mode, using a EPC 9 equipped with a personal computer with Pulse and X chart software (HEKA, Lamprecht, Germany). The standard extracellular bath solution contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, pH adjusted with KOH to 7.4. For Na+-free solutions, Na+ was replaced by NMDG (150 mm) and the titration was performed with HCl. For the NMDG solutions with Ca2+, NMDG was partly replaced with CaCl2 (11.2 mm), preserving an osmolarity of about 300 mosmol/liter. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 145 Cs-glutamate, 8 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 Cs-EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 (CsOH). In some experiments, the pipette solution additionally contained ADP-ribose (0.3 mm) or NAD (final concentration of 1 mm, added to the pipette solution from a stock of 70 mm in ethanol). Cells were held at a potential of −60 mV, and current voltage (I-V) relations were obtained from voltage ramps from −90 to +60 mV applied over 400 ms. Transfected HEK 293 cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips were loaded with fura-2 by incubation in fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (2 μm,Calbiochem) for 30 min at 37 °C in a buffer consisting of (in mm): 138 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 1 Na2HPO4, 5 NaHCO3, 5.5d-glucose, 20 HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH), supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Loaded cells were washed twice and then kept in a buffer consisting of 138 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5.5 d-glucose, 1.6 CaCl2, and 20 HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH). Experiments were performed using a digital fluorescence imaging system (T.I.L.L. Photonics, München, Germany). Cells were visualized with a ×40 oil immersion objective (Zeiss). Emitted fluorescence was recorded after filtering through a 510-nm band pass filter over manually defined regions of interest. Excitation was performed at intervals of 2.5 s with wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm for 4 ms each, yielding the emitted fluorescence signalsF 340 and F 380. Bath solutions containing H2O2 (5–30 mm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were freshly prepared daily and stored in the dark until application. Fura-2/AM was kept in a stock solution of dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 1 mm stored at −20 °C until use. Unless otherwise indicated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The experiments were carried out at room temperature (21–23 °C). Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance between groups was assessed with the Student's t test. Ap < 0.05 was considered significant. We clonedLTRPC2 (formerly LTRPC7) from undifferentiated HL-60 cells. Initially, we obtained a clone that differs from the original sequence (18Nagamine K. Kudoh J. Minoshima S. Kawasaki K. Asakawa S. Ito F. Shimizu N. Genomics. 1998; 54: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) by two deletions, from amino acids 538 to 557 and from 1292 to 1325 (Fig. 1). Additionally, two amino acids are exchanged (S1088N and D1291E). According to the structure model of TRP channels (20Hardie R.C. Minke B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 643-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), the one deletion is located in the cytosolic N terminus and the other one in the cytosolic C terminus of LTRPC2. We refer to the clone with the two deletions as LTRPC2-ΔNΔC (see “Experimental Procedures”). To test whether HL-60 cells and neutrophil granulocytes express not only LTRPC2-ΔNΔC but also LTRPC2 variants with the originally reported longer forms of the N terminus and the C terminus, we performed reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments with the three primer pairs indicated in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows that mRNA coding for both forms of the N terminus and for both forms of the C terminus is expressed in HL-60 cells (Fig. 2 A) as well as in neutrophil granulocytes (Fig. 2 B). Specifically, lanes 1 and4 of Fig. 2 show two different PCR products from primers P1 and P2 that demonstrate mRNA encoding the short and the long form of the C terminus. Lanes 2 and 5 show a PCR product that can only be formed if mRNA coding for the long form of the N terminus is present. Lanes 3 and 6 indicate the additional presence of the short form because of the size of the PCR product; note that the PCR product indicative of the long form of the N terminus is not visible in lanes 3 and 6but was demonstrated in a nested PCR (lane 7). Sequence analysis of all the fragments shown in Fig. 2 confirmed that they represent the expected PCR products. Therefore, mRNA encoding different variants of LTRPC2 exists in HL-60 cells and neutrophil granulocytes. The HL-60 cells from which the mRNA was normally extracted were not differentiated to the granulocytic phenotype. However, mRNA coding for LTRPC2 was also demonstrated (data not shown) in HL-60 cells differentiated with dibutyryl-cAMP, a cell culture model for neutrophil granulocytes (21Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no analysis of the expressed variants was performed. For functional studies of the LTRPC2 variants, we created four cDNA constructs coding for: (i) the full-length form of LTRPC2 with both the N terminus and the C terminus in its originally described long form; (ii) LTRPC2-ΔN (i.e. with the short form of the N terminus; for details, see Fig. 1 and “Experimental Procedures”); (iii) LTRPC2-ΔC; and (iv) LTRPC2-ΔNΔC. Each construct was transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells and electrophysiologically studied with the patch clamp technique in the whole cell mode. None of the expressed variants of LTRPC2 produced cation inward currents different from controls (vector-transfected cells identified by EGFP fluorescence) when the standard pipette solution was used (Fig.3 A). However, when ADP-ribose (0.3 mm) was present in the pipette solution in experiments with cells expressing the full-length form of LTRPC2 (Fig.3 B), we consistently observed an inward current that gradually developed within a few minutes after obtaining the whole cell configurations. The time elapsed before the full response to ADP-ribose occurred varied between 0.5 and 8 min. This variability is probably caused by variable diffusion times of ADP-ribose from the pipette into the cytosol and by metabolism of ADP-ribose to products that do not activate LTRPC2 (3Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar); metabolism is expected to delay activation of LTRPC2 particularly when diffusion is already slow. The ADP-ribose-induced inward current was abolished when extracellular Na+ was substituted with the large impermeable cation NMDG (Fig. 3 B). When Ca2+ (10 mm) was added to NMDG, a small inward current was restituted (Fig. 3,C and D). These data indicate that LTRPC2 enables non-selective cation currents carried mainly by Na+, but to a small part also by Ca2+, in the inward direction and carried by Cs+ in the outward direction under our experimental conditions. Our results with LTRPC2 are essentially identical with those recently reported (3Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), where also a full-length form of LTRPC2 was used. However, when we extended the analysis to the other three forms of LTRPC2, we did not find ADP-ribose-induced currents (Fig. 4). Slightly enhanced current density levels after extended dialysis with ADP-ribose in some experiments (Fig. 4) cannot be attributed to an effect of ADP-ribose, because small current increases developed over time also in control cells in the absence of intracellular ADP-ribose (see Fig.3 A). Furthermore, co-transfection of cells with two vectors coding for LTRPC2-ΔC and LTRPC2-ΔN, respectively, failed to result in ADP-ribose-induced currents (n = 4, data not shown). Thus, stimulation with ADP-ribose was exclusively found for the full-length form of LTRPC2. As a model of oxidative stress, we tested the effects of extracellular H2O2 on the four LTRPC2 variants. Fig.5 A shows a representative experiment with a cell expressing LTRPC2 in which H2O2 was added to the bath to a final concentration of 5 mm. After a delay of 4 min, an inward current developed gradually that was blocked by NMDG and was partly carried by Ca2+. After wash-out of H2O2, the current initially increased further but then declined almost to base-line levels, although a small NMDG-sensitive current was still present. Re-addition of H2O2 led to a second current rise. When the cells were exposed to H2O2 over more extended times than in Fig. 5, the inward currents reached a plateau after about 15 min. Stimulation of currents with H2O2 after a characteristic delay was consistently observed in 10 out of 10 cells expressing LTRPC2. The mean increase in current density was from −0.9 ± 0.75 to −20.3 ± 18.8 pA/pF (Fig.6). H2O2-induced increases in currents were completely abolished when the pipette solution contained the radical scavenger mannitol (10 mm). This result was obtained in 5 cells when H2O2was applied for 10 min. Although we normally used a concentration of 5 mmH2O2, currents were induced by H2O2 concentrations of 1 mm(n = 2) as well. Raising the H2O2 concentration to 30 mmresulted in current increases that were nearly irreversible over the time of the experiments, although the currents were still blocked by NMDG. In control cells (Fig. 6) and in cells expressing either LTRPC2-ΔN (Figs. 5 B and 6) or LTRPC2-ΔNΔC (Fig. 6), no current increase was induced by H2O2 (5 or 30 mm). However, in cells expressing the variant LTRPC2-ΔC that was insensitive for ADP-ribose, H2O2 was similarly effective (Fig. 5 C) as in cells expressing the full-length form of LTRPC2. The currents through either form of LTRPC2 could not be discriminated by current density, time course after addition or removal of H2O2, or by selectivity for Ca2+ over Na+ (Figs. 5 C and6). Since the extent by which the currents through LTRPC2 were carried by Ca2+ was low, we studied with a different approach whether stimulation of LTRPC2 with H2O2 evokes increases in [Ca2+] i . Ca2+ transients inLTRPC2-transfected cells were followed in a digital imaging system after loading of the cells with the fluorescent Ca2+indicator fura-2. After exposure to a bath containing 5 mmH2O2, all cells (LTRPC2-transfected as well as controls) responded with an initial rise in [Ca2+] i (Fig. 7). [Ca2+] i returned quickly to resting levels. In cells transfected with LTRPC2 but not in control cells, a second increase in [Ca2+] i was observed after several minutes (Fig. 7 B). Such a second rise in [Ca2+] i after exposure to H2O2 was found in 11 out of 25LTRPC2-transfected cells in four independent experiments. This increase reached a plateau that remained fairly stable until the end of the experiment when further increases were elicited by ionomycin (10 μm in a buffer with 10 mmCa2+). However, a calibration of the fluorescence signal in terms of Ca2+ concentration was not done because many cells detached during the long time required for experiments with H2O2. No H2O2-induced second rise in [Ca2+] i was seen in any control cells (n = 23 in four experiments). Likewise, no such rise was seen in LTRPC2-transfected cells in the absence of H2O2 (n = 19 in four experiments). Similar results as with the full-length LTRPC2 were obtained with LTRPC2-ΔC (Fig. 7 C). Here, the second rise in [Ca2+] i occurred in 17 out of 41LTRPC2-ΔC-transfected cells in five experiments and not in any control cell (n = 9). As LTRPC2 has been reported to be stimulated by intracellular NAD (16Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Yokoi H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. Science. 2001; 293: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), we also tested this compound which was applied to the cells by dialysis through the patch pipette. However, LTRPC2 did not respond to NAD with an increase in currents (Fig. 8 A;n = 7). These negative findings were confirmed with the other three forms of LTRPC2 and in controls (n = 4–5). To demonstrate that the lack of NAD effects was not a problem of LTRPC2 expression, we applied H2O2 (5 mm) to cells that had been dialyzed with NAD for 5 min without showing any indication of a developing current. After a further delay of 2 min, a gradually increasing current was observed (Fig. 8 B). Essentially the same finding as in cells expressing LTRPC2 was obtained in cells expressing LTRPC2-ΔC (n = 2). Thus, stimulation with H2O2 was independent of the presence of NAD in the pipette solution, whereas NAD alone did not stimulate currents through LTRPC2. Furthermore, we tested whether stimulation by H2O2 was independent of ADP-ribose (Fig. 8 C). Cells expressing LTRPC2-ΔC were patched with ADP-ribose (0.3 mm) present in the pipette solution. A time of 5 min was allowed during which ADP-ribose failed to induce currents, as in the previous experiments (Fig. 4). Then, H2O2 was applied extracellularly. Again, after a delay of 2 min, the typical H2O2-induced currents were observed (n = 3) that were slowly increasing and blocked by the impermeable cation NMDG (Fig. 8 C). The present study found that the non-selective cation channel LTRPC2 was activated by H2O2. This is a alternative mode of activation for this channel that has previously been demonstrated to be activated by ADP-ribose (3Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). A splice variant of LTRPC2, LTRPC2-ΔC, identified in HL-60 cells and in neutrophil granulocytes, was differentially sensitive for the two stimuli because it was exclusively activated by H2O2. Thus, LTRPC2-ΔC reveals some information on the structural requirements for ADP-ribose sensitivity and provides evidence that both stimuli act by distinct mechanisms. NAD has recently been reported to stimulate LTRPC2 (16Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Yokoi H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. Science. 2001; 293: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 17Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E. Nishida M. Yoshida T. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Mori E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Kurose H. Okada Y. Imoto K. Mori Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). However, we did not see activation of any form of LTRPC2 by NAD, which does not support the idea that this substance activates LTRPC2 directly. Since ADP-ribose is a metabolite of NAD (13Berthelier V. Tixier J.M. Muller-Steffner H. Schuber F. Deterre P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Ziegler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1550-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that NAD is converted to ADP-ribose under some experimental conditions to a sufficient extent to stimulate LTRPC2; however, this may depend on very subtle details and obviously did not occur in our experiments. When we started the functional characterization of LTRPC2, we reasoned that both NAD and ADP-ribose may be mediators of oxidative stress because the intracellular concentrations of NAD and, consequently, of ADP-ribose may be increased when the redox potential of the cell is altered such that the equilibrium of NAD to NADH is shifted in favor of NAD. The same phenomenon is expected to occur whenever a strong membrane-permeant oxidant such as H2O2 is applied. Indeed, H2O2 induced a consistent activation of LTRPC2, even though the amplitude of the resulting currents was lower than under stimulation with ADP-ribose. The stimulation by H2O2 was prevented by intracellular mannitol, a radical scavenger (22Suzuki J. Imaizumi S. Kayama T. Yoshimoto T. Stroke. 1985; 16: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting that H2O2 acts by generation of free radicals in the cell interior. However, the experiments with LTRPC2-ΔC are not in line with our original hypothesis that the effects of oxidative stress are mediated by ADP-ribose because this compound proved ineffective on this splice variant of LTRPC2, in distinct contrast to H2O2 that activated LTRPC2-ΔC to the same extent as wild-type LTRPC2. Therefore, it appears that oxidative stress can stimulate LTRPC2 by different mechanisms, either mediated by or independent of ADP-ribose. The various variants of LTRPC2, characterized by deletions of 20 or 34 amino acids in the N terminus and C terminus of the channel, provide information on structural requirements for the channel function of LTRPC2. The deletion in the C terminus that abolished the effects of ADP-ribose is distant from the Nudix box. Therefore, the presence of a Nudix box alone is not sufficient to predict ADP-ribose sensitivity of a channel. On the contrary, subtle additional structural details decide whether channels are sensitive or completely insensitive for ADP-ribose. The N-terminal deletion prevented the response to both ADP-ribose and H2O2. The variants with the short form of the N terminus may not even form functional ion channels. Alternatively, they may be used to control the expression of the other variants, as has been reported for partial sequences of another member of the TRP family, TRPM4 (23Xu X.Z. Moebius F. Gill D.L. Montell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10692-10697Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Our study suggests that LTRPC2 in both its active forms plays an important role in various tissues because it enables Ca2+influx in response to oxidants. The consequences of oxidative stress are not confined to nonselective cell damage by mechanisms like lipid peroxidation. Evidence has been provided that specific cellular responses are induced, including activation of transcription factors like the nuclear factor-κB and the activator protein-1, phospholipase D, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, or receptor tyrosine kinases (24Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 25Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A.

Ca2+ has been attributed an important function for many of these processes (28Conrad P.W. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 475: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ito Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of the Ca2+-permeable channel LTRPC2 may be a distinct mechanism by which specific cells are capable of reacting to damaging oxidants. It is noteworthy that cation channels with similar biophysical properties (30Herson P.S. Ashford M.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501: 59-66Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as LTRPC2 (3Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) were activated by H2O2 in an insulin-secreting pancreatic cell line. H2O2 altered the redox state of the cells and mimicked the diabetes-inducing toxic effects of alloxan. The role of oxidant-mediated activation of LTRPC2 may be of particular relevance for neutrophil granulocytes in which we have demonstrated expression of LTRPC2. One of the characteristic responses of these cells after activation by chemokines is the respiratory burst during which superoxide anions and other free radicals are generated at high concentrations (31Cohen M.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1994; 18: S170-S179Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since depolarization and increases in [Ca2+] i are among the key responses of neutrophil granulocytes to chemokines (32Krause K.H. Demaurex N. Jaconi M. Lew D.P. Blood Cells. 1993; 19: 165-173PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schorr W. Swandulla D. Zeilhofer H.U. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 897-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Walz A. Meloni F. Clark-Lewis I. von Tscharner V. Baggiolini M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 50: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), an H2O2-sensitive pathway for Na+ and Ca2+ represents part of a positive feedback loop leading to massive cation influx and Ca2+ load during the respiratory burst. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates activation of the cation channel LTRPC2 by H2O2, leading to influx of Na+ and Ca2+ into LTRPC2-expressing cells. A splice variant found in neutrophil granulocytes with a deletion in the C terminus demonstrates that H2O2 uses a different mode of channel activation than ADP-ribose. Thus, LTRPC2 represents a cation channel that links the redox state of the cell to Ca2+ homeostasis, as has also been reported by Haraet al. (17Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E. Nishida M.

These two independent pathways converge on the same set of genomic cis-elements within theA.S. promoter referred to as nutrient-sensing response elements (NSRE) 1 and 2, both of which are necessary for gene activation. The NSRE-1 sequence was used to screen ATF/CREB family members by electrophoresis mobility shift assays and supershift by specific antibodies. The results indicated that ATF4 binds to the NSRE-1 sequence and that the amount of the ATF4 complex was increased when extracts from amino acid-deprived or glucose-deprived cells were tested. Using electrophoresis mobility shift assay experiments and a probe that contained both NSRE-1 and NSRE-2, mutation of the NSRE-1 sequence completely prevented formation of the ATF4-containing complexes, whereas mutation of the NSRE-2 sequence did not. Overexpression of ATF4 increased A.S. promoter-driven transcription, whereas an inhibitory dominant negative ATF4 mutant blocked both basal and starvation-enhanced transcription. Collectively, the results provide both in vitro and in vivoevidence for a role of ATF4 in the transcriptional activation of theA.S. gene in response to nutrient deprivation.

However, the role of amino acid availability in controlling other fundamental cellular processes has not been as extensively investigated (reviewed in Refs. 1Jousse C. Bruhat A. Fafournoux P. Curr.

A number of specific mRNAs, proteins, and cellular activities are induced following amino acid deprivation (reviewed in Refs. 2Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem.

Arfin and co-workers (4Arfin S.M. Simpson D.R. Chiang C.S. Andrulis I.L. Hatfield G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2367-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Andrulis I.L.

Induction of A.S. activity also occurred in temperature-sensitive Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants for asparaginyl-, leucyl-, methionyl-, and lysyl-tRNA synthetases (5Andrulis I.L. Hatfield G.W. Arfin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10629-10633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, starvation of several different cell types, for a wide range of individual amino acids, causes the accumulation of A.S. mRNA, illustrating that this sensing mechanism broadly detects amino acid limitation (6Gong S.S.

More recently, Barbosa-Tessmann et al. (10Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S. Schuster S.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the human A.S. gene is also induced by glucose deprivation and that this activation is mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ERSR), also known as the unfolded protein response pathway in yeast (13Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In vivo footprinting and mutagenesis demonstrated that the promoter sequence 5′-TGATGAAAC-3′ (nt −68 to −60), the region first identified by Guerrini et al. (9Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), was also responsible for induction of the A.S. transcription following activation of the ERSR pathway (12Barbosa-Tessmann I.P.

The ERSR activation demonstrates that thisA.S. promoter sequence serves in a broader capacity than simply as an AARE and, to reflect this broader substrate-detecting capability, this sequence is referred to as the nutrient-sensing response element-1 (NSRE-1). A second element (5′-GTTACA-3′, nt −48 to −43), 11 nucleotides downstream from NSRE-1, is also required for activation and is referred to as NSRE-2. To underscore the collective function of these two sequences, the term nutrient-sensing response unit has been coined. Siu et al. (14Siu F.Y. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48100-48107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) binds to the NSRE-1 sequence in vitro and when overexpressed activates transcription of an A.S. promoter-driven reporter. Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative C/EBPβ isoform blocked both basal and nutrient-regulated transcription. The NSRE-1 sequence is highly similar to an element in the human chop gene (5′-TGATGCAAT-3′, −301 to −310) that functions as an AARE (15Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and has been termed a C/EBP-ATF composite site (16Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Fawcett T.W. Martindale J.L. Guyton K.Z. Hai T. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). These sites appear to bind to C/EBP-ATF heterodimers. For the human chop gene, ATF2 binds to this site and mediates the amino acid responsiveness (15Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The ATF member that binds to the A.S. NSRE-1 sequence has not been identified previously. The present studies were designed to determine whether an ATF family member binds to the NSRE-1 of the A.S. promoter, and if so, to establish its role with regard to induction of the gene by the AAR and ERSR pathways. Using electrophoresis mobility shift analysis (EMSA), the data show that ATF4 binds this element in vitro, but ATF1, ATF2, and ATF3 do not. Previous experiments had also indicated that ATF2 does not bind to the NSRE-1 sequence (14Siu F.Y. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48100-48107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for ATF4 caused a supershift of an NSRE-1 complex, and the abundance of that shifted complex was increased when extracts from amino acid-deprived (AAR) or glucose-deprived (ERSR) cells were used. Mutation of the NSRE-1 sequence, but not that of NSRE-2, caused loss of ATF4 binding. Overexpression of ATF4 caused increased basal transcription from the A.S. promoter, whereas expression of a dominant negative of the ATF4 mutant in HepG2 cells blocked transcriptional induction driven by the A.S. promoter following activation of either the AAR or the ERSR pathway. Collectively, the results demonstrate that ATF4, along with C/EBPβ, acts via the NSRE-1 sequence to regulate A.S. gene transcription in response to nutrient stress. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM), pH 7.4, supplemented to contain 25 mm NaHCO3, 4 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml penicillin G, 28.4 μg/ml gentamycin, 0.023 μg/mlN-butyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air incubator. For HepG2 cells, a batch transfection protocol was performed (11Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S.

The cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes (2.65 × 106 cells) for 24 h before transfection. Transfection was performed with Superfect reagent (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) at a ratio of 6 μl of Superfect to 1 μg of DNA. For each transfection, 5 μg of theA.S. −173/+51 promoter/growth hormone reporter plasmid was used along with 5 μg of the co-transfection control plasmid, which was the pcDNA3.1 vector containing LacZgene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Transfection was performed as described previously (11Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

The cells were then transferred to fresh complete MEM, glucose-free MEM, or histidine-free MEM for 12 h, each supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Using this batch transfection protocol, cells exposed to the different media conditions arose from the same initial transfection dish. Each experiment was repeated with multiple batches of cells. Total cellular RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit according to the procedure described by the supplier (QIAGEN).32P-Radiolabeled cDNA probe synthesis for growth hormone, glutamate dehydrogenase, and LacZ, as well as the Northern analyses, were performed as described (18Aslanian A.M. Fletcher B.S. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The cDNA probe for human ATF4 (nt 853–1933) was generated by reverse transcript-PCR and then subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. The plasmids containing rat ATF4 wild-type sequence and a mouse dominant negative ATF4 mutant were generously provided by Dr. Jawed Alam (21He C.H. Gong P., Hu, B. Stewart D. Choi M.E. Choi A.M. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The rat ATF4 cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen), and its expression was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The mouse dominant negative ATF4 expression vector was created by first cloning the wild-type sequence into the pEF/Myc/mito vector (Invitrogen), and then six amino acid substitutions (292RYRQKKR298 to292GYLEAAA298) were made within the DNA-binding domain (19Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells incubated for 16 h in complete MEM, MEM lacking glucose, or MEM lacking histidine. Nuclear extracts were prepared from four 150-mm dishes of cells, and all steps were performed at 4 °C. The nuclear extract isolation procedure and the EMSA protocol have been described previously (14Siu F.Y. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol.

All experiments were repeated with at least two independently prepared nuclear extracts. EMSA was performed as described previously (14Siu F.Y. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48100-48107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), using32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the A.S.promoter sequence −79 to −53, nuclear extract from histidine-deprived cells, and antibodies for ATF1–4 and C/EBPβ. After exposure to film, a parallel gel was aligned with the autoradiographic film, and a 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 gel piece was excised for each area of the gel that aligned with the supershifted complexes of ATF4 and C/EBPβ. For ATF4, two gel pieces were obtained, one each for the upper and lower shifted complexes. Given that the ATF2 antibody did not produce any supershifted complexes, a gel fragment aligning to the upper complex of ATF4 was cut from the ATF2 EMSA lane to be used as a negative control. The EMSA-derived gel pieces were placed into individual wells of a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel along with 50 μl of sample dilution buffer (0.125 M Tris (pH 6.8), 1% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 30 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 715 mm2-mercaptoethanol). The supershifted complexes were then subjected to electrophoresis, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with C/EBPβ antibody at a dilution of 1:5000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as the secondary antibody and was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was then exposed on Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Two separate cis-elements, NSRE-1 and NSRE-2, are both required for induction of the A.S. gene in response to activation of the AAR or ERSR pathways (12Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NSRE-1 sequence is similar to an element within the chop gene termed a C/EBP-ATF composite binding site (16Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Fawcett T.W. Martindale J.L. Guyton K.Z. Hai T. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was likely that an ATF family member also binds to and functions through NSRE-1. EMSA was performed to determine whether ATF4 was present in human HepG2 hepatoma cells and, if so, whether it exhibited affinity for the A.S. NSRE-1 sequence. The radiolabeled NSRE-1 oligonucleotide probe (nt −79 to −53 of the humanA.S. proximal promoter) containing the NSRE-1 sequence (Fig.1) resulted in three distinct complexes (Fig. 2, A–C). All three complexes appeared to be specific (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and2) and were increased in amount when extracts from histidine-deprived cells were tested (Fig. 2, compare lanes 3 and 6). Complex A was at or below a detectable level in the MEM-incubated control cells (Fig. 1, lane 3) but was increased substantially by amino acid limitation (Fig. 2, lane 6). Complex B was only slightly increased by histidine starvation, whereas complex C was increased significantly. Antibodies specific for ATF1 caused no supershift, and for ATF3 antibody, there was a small but detectable amount of shift of the starvation-induced complex (data not shown). ATF2 is responsible for binding to the amino acid response element in the human chop gene and mediates activation following amino acid starvation (15Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Confirming earlier work, incubation with antibody specific for ATF2 did not cause any of the NSRE-1 complexes to be supershifted (Fig. 2, compare lane 3 versus lane 4 for MEM and lane 6 versus lane 7 for −His). Given that ATF4 mRNA translation is enhanced by amino acid deprivation (20Harding H.P. Novoa I., I Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar), ATF4 was a potential regulator of A.S. transcription. Inclusion of ATF4 antibody resulted in a nearly complete loss of complex A that ran as two new supershifted complexes (Fig. 2, contrast lanes 6 and8).Figure 2The human A.S. promoter NSRE-1 sequence binds ATF4, but not ATF2, transcription proteins.Nuclear extracts prepared from HepG2 cells maintained for 16 h in complete MEM (MEM), histidine-free MEM (−HIS), or MEM lacking glucose (−GLC) were incubated with32P-radiolabeled NSRE-1 oligonucleotide (see the legend for Fig. 1). Lane 1 (NS) illustrates the effect of including an unrelated sequence (5′-TTGTCGACCTCACAGTGGCTGCTATGTATGC-3′) as a nonspecific, unlabeled competitor at a 100-fold excess. Lane 2 (SP) represents a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled NSRE-1 oligonucleotide itself. Where indicated, the incubation protocol included no antibody (None) or an antibody specific for either ATF2 or ATF4. Thearrows labeled A–C denote specific complexes that were increased in amount when extracts from histidine- or glucose-deprived cells were tested, and the asterisksindicate two supershifted complexes arising from the ATF4 antibody. The autoradiographic film shown is representative of at least two separate experiments using independently prepared nuclear extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the abundance of the ATF4-containing NSRE-1 complex was increased following activation of the ERSR pathway, HepG2 cells were incubated with or without glucose for 16 h, and then nuclear extracts were prepared (Fig. 2). EMSA illustrated that these extracts, when incubated with 32P-labeled NSRE-1 oligonucleotide, formed the same nutrient-regulated complexes (labeled A–C) as those observed with extracts from histidine-deprived cells (Fig. 2, compare lanes 6 and 9). Furthermore, ATF4 antibody caused a supershift of complex A (Fig. 2, compare lanes 9 and 11) in the same manner as that seen for the histidine-free extracts (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and8). To compare competition between NSRE-1 and a consensus CREB/ATF sequence, EMSA experiments were performed with radiolabeled NSRE-1 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotide as inhibitor (Fig. 3). To permit easier detection of all three complexes, extracts from histidine-deprived cells were used throughout. Increasing concentrations of unlabeled NSRE-1 blocked formation of all three. A 100-fold excess of unlabeled NSRE-1 also completely blocked formation of the ATF4-containing complexes (Fig. 3, compare lanes 12 and 13). In contrast, an oligonucleotide containing a consensus CREB/ATF sequence exhibited some competition for binding but was not nearly as effective as NSRE-1 itself (Fig. 3, lanes 7–11 and lanes 13 and 14). These data, along with our previous results for C/EBPβ (14Siu F.Y. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48100-48107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), indicate that the C/EBPβ-ATF4 heterodimer has a strong affinity for the NSRE-1 site and are consistent with NSRE-1 being a C/EBP-ATF composite site rather than specific for the ATF family. In vivo footprinting of the A.S.promoter region revealed that the guanine nucleotides at −67 and −64 within the NSRE-1 sequence showed enhanced protection from dimethyl sulfate modification in cells incubated in either histidine- or glucose-depleted media (12Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with those results, mutation of individual nucleotides from −68 to −60 blocked nutrient-dependent transcription of a transiently transfectedA.S. promoter/reporter construct (12Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if ATF4 action at NSRE-1 is critical for nutrient control, then mutation of these nucleotides should prevent ATF4 protein binding. To test this hypothesis, the 32P-labeled wild-type NSRE-1 sequence was compared with four other radiolabeled probes that each had a single nucleotide mutated, nt −67, −64, −62, or −60, respectively (Fig.4). Using extracts from histidine-deprived cells, it was observed that mutation of any one of these four nucleotides within the NSRE-1 sequence completely prevented formation of the inducible ATF4-containing protein-DNA complex A (Fig.4, compare lane 2 with lanes 3–6). The increase in A.S. mRNA content following amino acid deprivation is dependent on de novo protein synthesis (6Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 745-750Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), consistent with the hypothesis that production of one or more upstream regulators is required prior to transcriptional induction of the A.S.gene itself. To determine whether ATF4 binding activity was dependent on de novo synthesis, nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells that had been incubated in complete MEM or MEM lacking histidine, each with or without 0.1 μm cycloheximide. These extracts were then tested by EMSA for the formation of starvation-induced and ATF4-containing protein-DNA complexes (Fig.5). Inhibition of protein synthesis was completely blocked in the formation of the amino acid-regulated complexes (e.g. in Fig. 5, compare lane 3 withlane 7). Furthermore, when the nuclear extracts derived from control and cycloheximide-treated cells were incubated with ATF4 antibody and then monitored for the presence of shifted complexes, the results clearly document that de novo protein synthesis is required for formation of the ATF4-containing complex (Fig. 5, comparelane 4 with lane 8). To provide evidence that ATF4 and C/EBPβ can bind simultaneously to the NSRE-1 site, an EMSA reaction that included ATF4, ATF2, or C/EBPβ antibody was used to generate shifted complexes (Fig.6 A). The shifted bands induced by ATF4 or C/EBPβ were cut out of the gel, and then each gel plug was placed into separate wells of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis and transfer, the blot was probed with antibody specific for C/EBPβ (Fig. 6 B). Although the lower ATF4-containing complex did not react with the anti-C/EBPβ (Fig.6 B, lane 2), C/EBPβ immunoreactivity was clearly evident for the upper ATF4-containing complex (Fig.6 B, lane 1). The EMSA complex supershifted by C/EBPβ antibody was also cut out (Fig. 6 A) and run on the same SDS gel as a positive control (Fig. 6 B, lane 4). In contrast, the gel region corresponding to where the upper ATF4 band would be was cut out from an EMSA lane resulting from an ATF2 antibody incubation (not shown) and used as a negative control. As expected, this gel region showed no C/EBPβ content (Fig.6 B, lane 3). When an oligonucleotide probe (NSRE-1/2) was prepared that corresponded to theA.S. promoter region containing both the NSRE-1 and NSRE-2 sequences (Fig. 1), several complexes could be detected by EMSA (Fig.7). One of these complexes, labeledA, was enhanced in abundance when extracts from histidine-deprived cells were tested (Fig. 7, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 4 and 5), and anti-ATF4 caused a supershift of complex A that was readily visible in the histidine-depleted cell extracts (Fig. 7, lane 6). Incubation with ATF2 antibody served as a negative control. To investigate whether or not NSRE-2 contributed to ATF4 binding, a block of nucleotides within either the NSRE-1 or the NSRE-2 core sequence was mutated to a sequence that previous functional assays had shown would block regulated transcription (12Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the NSRE-1 sequence, in the presence of a wild-type NSRE-2 sequence, completely eliminated the starvation-inducible complexes and consequently, the anti-ATF4 supershifted complexes (Fig. 7, lanes 7–12). In contrast, mutation of the NSRE-2 site and retention of the wild-type NSRE-1 sequence still permitted formation of the amino acid-regulated and ATF4-containing complexes (Fig. 7, lanes 13–18). Therefore, although both cis-elements are absolutely required for nutrient-regulated transcription (12Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a non-functional NSRE-2 sequence does not prevent ATF4 binding to the NSRE-1 sitein vitro. The EMSA analysis suggested the possibility that the amount of active ATF4 in the nucleus is increased by amino acid or glucose deprivation. This is consistent with the observation that the translation of the ATF4 mRNA is enhanced by nutrient starvation (20Harding H.P. Novoa I., I Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar), but the effect of amino acid deprivation on ATF4 mRNA content has not been reported. HepG2 cells were incubated in MEM, MEM lacking either histidine or glucose, or amino acid-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) for 16 h, and then RNA was isolated for Northern analysis (Fig. 8). The ATF4 mRNA content was increased within 2 h of removing all amino acids or just histidine from the medium, and it reached a value of 2.5–3-fold at 12 h (Fig. 8, A and B). Glucose deprivation was less effective in stimulating the ATF4 mRNA level, but the content was elevated by about 2-fold. To document that these increases were statistically significant, in a separate set of experiments, multiple plates of cells were incubated in each of the four media for 12 h, and then the mRNA was analyzed (Fig.8 C). Results similar to the time course were obtained with statistically significant increases of 2–3-fold for amino acid limitation. Parallel experiments using immunoblotting showed that the amount of ATF4 protein also increased following nutrient deprivation (data not shown), confirming earlier reports (20Harding H.P. Novoa I., I Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). As mentioned, the ATF4 protein level is increased following amino acid deprivation through translational control (20Harding H.P. Novoa I., I Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar), an observation that is consistent with the fact that increased transcription from the A.S. gene is dependent onde novo protein synthesis (6Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 745-750Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). If ATF4 synthesis represents an upstream step in the AAR pathway, as the data from this report and others suggest, it was important to further characterize the increase in ATF4 mRNA. To determine whether de novoprotein synthesis was required, cells were incubated in amino acid-free medium with or without cycloheximide (Fig.9 A). The time-dependent increase in ATF4 mRNA was not affected by blocking protein synthesis. To investigate the role of de novo protein synthesis on the turnover of the ATF4 mRNA, cells were incubated in amino acid-free medium for 6 h to elevate the ATF4 mRNA content and then transferred to amino acid-complete MEM with or without 0.1 mm cycloheximide (Fig. 9, Band C). A relatively rapid decay of the mRNA was observed in the absence of the inhibitor, but blockade of protein synthesis completely prevented the mRNA decay, demonstrating the need for one or more newly synthesized proteins and suggesting the potential involvement of additional regulatory steps in ATF4 expression. To establish an estimate of the half-life for the ATF4 mRNA during the decay process that occurred after refeeding, HepG2 cells were incubated for 18 h in amino acid-free medium. Then after transfer of these starved cells to amino acid-complete MEM, RNA was collected at specific time points and analyzed for ATF4 mRNA (Fig.10 A). Consistent with the data of Fig. 9, refeeding resulted in a rapid decay of ATF4 mRNA with an estimated half-life of less than 2 h (Fig.10 B). To evaluate mRNA stability as a possible mechanism for the starvation induction, cells were incubated in histidine-free medium to induce ATF4 mRNA content and then transferred to either fresh histidine-free medium or amino acid-complete MEM, both containing 5 μm actinomycin D (Fig.11). The rate of decay was much less in the presence of the RNA synthesis inhibitor than in its absence (compare Figs. 10 and 11), but analyzing the results graphically, it was clear that the rate of turnover was no different in the presence or absence of histidine. These results suggest that histidine deprivation does not cause an elevation in the ATF4 mRNA content by increasing mRNA stability. If not stabilization, then de novo RNA synthesis would be the likely mechanism for ATF4 mRNA induction. To test this possibility, HepG2 cells were incubated for 0–12 h in medium lacking all amino acids or just histidine in the presence or absence of 5 μm actinomycin D (Fig. 11 C). The RNA synthesis inhibitor prevented completely the increase in ATF4 mRNA accumulation in response to amino acid limitation.Figure 11Effect of amino acid deprivation on ATF4 mRNA turnover. HepG2 cells were incubated in MEM lacking histidine for 12 h (panel A, first lane;t = 0 h) and then transferred to fresh MEM lacking histidine or to amino acid-complete MEM, both containing 5 μm actinomycin D (Act D). At the times indicated in panel A, RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern analysis (20 μg of RNA/lane) for ATF4 or glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) mRNA. The data were quantified, expressed as a percent of the value obtained for t = 0 (12 h of histidine deprivation), and then plotted as the semi-log to estimate the decay rate (panel B). For the data inpanel C, HepG2 cells were incubated in complete MEM or in MEM lacking histidine without or with 5 μm actinomycin D. At the times indicated, RNA was isolated, and Northern analysis was performed to measure ATF4 or L7a mRNA content. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HepG2 cells were transiently co-transfected with a GH reporter gene driven by the A.S.proximal promoter (−173/+51) and a plasmid containing either the activating form of ATF4 or an inhibitory dominant negative mutant (21He C.H.

The control cells were transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 vector (control), and the transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfection with the LacZ gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. After 36 h, the cells were transferred to complete MEM or MEM lacking either histidine or glucose for 12 h prior to the isolation of RNA for Northern analysis (Fig.12 A). Expression of ATF4 was confirmed by Northern blotting. The data are expressed as the fold induction relative to the pcDNA3.1-transfected cells (control) incubated in complete MEM. Consistent with previously published functional analysis (11Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31139-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), A.S. promoter-driven transcription was increased in both the histidine- (5.3-fold) and the glucose-deprived (3.5-fold) control cells that did not receive exogenous ATF4 (Fig. 12 B). Overexpression of the ATF4 wild-type (Fig. 12 B) caused an increase in the basal (MEM) transcription (4.9-fold), and although relatively modest, a further enhancement of the increase following histidine (5.3-foldversus 8.3-fold) or glucose (3.5-fold versus4.3-fold) starvation. In contrast, after transfection with the dominant negative ATF4 mutant, a 50% inhibition of the basal (in MEM) A.S.-driven transcription was observed, and there was a blockade of the induction by either histidine (5.3-fold versus 1.6-fold) or glucose (3.5-fold versus 1.8-fold) deprivation (Fig.12 B, DN). Collectively, these data are consistent with the in vitro EMSA studies described above and document that ATF4 serves in vivo as a mediator of the nutrient-sensing response pathway. The data described in this report demonstrate that ATF4 binds to the NSRE-1 cis-element within the proximal promoter of the human A.S. gene and activates transcription in response to nutrient deprivation. Two cis-elements, NSRE-1 and NSRE-2, are required for increased transcription of the A.S. gene following activation of either the AAR or the ERSR pathways (10Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L.

We have coined the phrase nutrient-sensing response unit to describe this combination of elements that function together to sense nutrient availability and modulate the transcription of this gene accordingly. The ATF family of transcription proteins represents a subclass of the basic leucine zipper family, and ATF members are known to heterodimerize with the C/EBP basic leucine zipper subgroup. The humanchop gene 5′ upstream region contains an AARE (5′-TGATGCAAT-3′) that differs from the A.S. NSRE-1 sequence by only two nucleotides, and this element has been shown to be a C/EBP-ATF composite site (16Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Fawcett T.W. Martindale J.L. Guyton K.Z. Hai T. Holbrook N.J. Biochem.

Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) demonstrated that although both C/EBPβ and ATF2 bind this sequence in vitro, when knockout cell lines for these two proteins were tested, amino acid-dependent expression of the chop gene was blocked in the ATF2−/− cells but not in those cells lacking C/EBPβ. Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative form of ATF2 suppressed the starvation-dependent transcription from achop promoter/luciferase reporter construct (15Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Our EMSA experiments document that ATF2 does not bind to the A.S.NSRE-1 sequence despite the fact that a positive control with a CREB/ATF consensus oligonucleotide demonstrates that the HepG2 nuclear extracts contain ATF-2 (data not shown). However, the data do illustrate that ATF4 contributes to the regulation of theA.S. gene by signaling nutrient deprivation and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The known characteristics of A.S. regulation are consistent with the present observations indicating a role for ATF4. In vivofootprinting documented that nutrient limitation caused an increase in protein binding at NSRE-1 (12Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the results in this report show that ATF4 binding is increased when nuclear extracts from either histidine-deprived (AAR pathway) or glucose-deprived (ERSR pathway) cells are tested. Following nutrient limitation, there is a lag of about 4 h prior to a significant increase in A.S. mRNA content (7Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 745-750Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S. Schuster S.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the increased abundance of A.S. mRNA is dependent onde novo protein synthesis (7Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 745-750Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Hutson R.G. Warskulat U. Kilberg M.S. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 15: 327-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Those results indicate that synthesis of a regulatory protein is required prior to activation of A.S. gene transcription. Consistent with those observations, inhibition of protein synthesis blocked the starvation-dependent enhancement in protein-DNA complex formation as assayed by EMSA and completely prevented the increase in nuclear extract ATF4 binding activity. These results are also consistent with the observation that synthesis of ATF4 is translationally enhanced by amino acid or glucose deprivation (20Harding H.P. Novoa I., I Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the present data extend our knowledge of how ATF4 expression is controlled by documenting: 1) that ATF4 mRNA is also elevated in response to amino acid and glucose limitation and 2) that the increase in ATF4 mRNA is likely the result of transcriptional activation of the gene rather than mRNA stabilization. Two observations indicate that ATF4 functions in vivo to modulate transcription of the human A.S. gene. First, the basal rate of A.S. promoter-driven transcription was induced significantly in ATF4 overexpressing cells, and the induction by nutrient deprivation was enhanced further when exogenous ATF4 was expressed. Second, expression of a dominant negative ATF4 mutant caused an inhibition of basal transcription and blocked activation of theA.S. promoter following either histidine or glucose deprivation. Collectively, the data provide strong support for the proposed role of ATF4 as a transcriptional regulator for the NSR pathway that, in the case of the A.S. gene, represents a convergence of the AAR and the ERSR pathways. The basis of metabolite control of transcription in mammalian cells is not well understood for most molecules, including amino acids. Through the identification of the corresponding transcription proteins responsible for regulation of specific nutrient-regulated target genes, one can progress backwards up the signal transduction pathway to reveal the individual steps required. For the human A.S. gene, this strategy has demonstrated the interesting observation that two independent metabolic sensing pathways, one that detects amino acid limitation and one that detects endoplasmic reticulum stress, converge at some point and ultimately act on the A.S. promoter through a common set of genomic elements (11Barbosa-Tessmann I.P.

With the identification of ATF4 as the C/EBPβ heterodimer partner and the observation that both theATF4 and the C/EBPβ genes are also transcriptionally regulated by nutrient availability, additional steps within this metabolite control pathway have been revealed.

The K(m) and V(max) of the enzyme for beta-carotene were 7 microm and 10 nmol retinal/mg x min, respectively, values that corresponded to a turnover number (k(cat)) of 0.66 min(-1) and a catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of approximately 10(5) m(-1) x min(-1). The enzyme existed as a tetramer in solution, and substrate specificity analyses suggested that at least one unsubstituted beta-ionone ring half-site was imperative for efficient cleavage of the carbon 15,15'-double bond in carotenoid substrates. High levels of BCO mRNA were observed along the whole intestinal tract, in the liver, and in the kidney, whereas lower levels were present in the prostate, testis, ovary, and skeletal muscle. The current data suggest that the human BCO enzyme may, in addition to its well established role in the digestive system, also play a role in peripheral vitamin A synthesis from plasma-borne provitamin A carotenoids."

Moreover, it has been shown that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK signaling is involved in the stimulation of osteoblast-related gene expression by extracellular matrix-integrin receptor interaction as well as mechanostressing (18Takeuchi Y.

We have previously also shown, using an established system for applying calibrated stretch, that a low level continuous mechanical strain of human periodontal ligament (hPDL) osteoblastic cells (i.e. osteoblast-like cells capable of undergoing osteoblast differentiation in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli) (20Arceo N.

Physiol. 2002; 190: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).These observations, combined with recent data indicating that MAPK pathways can activate Cbfa1 in vitro (25Xiao G. Jiang D. Thomas P. Benson M.D. Guan K. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4453-4459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) prompted us to explore whether and how the expression and activation profile of Cbfa1 are affected after mechanical loading of hPDL osteoblastic cells, as well as whether and to what extent MAPKs contribute to the process. We demonstrate that both the gene and Cbfa1 protein are key targets of mechanical stimulation in these cells, in a biologically relevant, ERK-catalyzed manner. These findings establish an important link between bone-specific transcription factor function and mechanotransduction in human osteoblasts which may be useful to plan strategies of noninvasive therapy based on mechanical strain-facilitated osteoinduction in situations such as fracture healing and distraction osteogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first indication that a physical stimulus such as mechanical stress elicits a direct effect on a tissue-specific transcriptional regulator.DISCUSSIONBone has evolved primarily to serve mechanical needs. During evolution, bone has optimized its load-bearing role by adapting its architecture and function to mechanical forces. In the present study we provide evidence that Cbfa1, a pivotal transcriptional regulator of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, is a key target of mechanical stimulation in hPDL osteoblastic cells, i.e. a cell type constantly “sensing” mechanical strain under physiological conditions and able to differentiate to participate actively in restoring the PDL and in remodeling of the surrounding bony tissue (45Lekic P. McCulloch C.A. Anat. Rec. 1996; 245: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We document that mRNA and protein levels, as well as the DNA binding activity of Cbfa1, are increased after a physical signal such as mechanical stretch. We also demonstrate that the force-ignited Cbfa1 induction is “funneled” via specific MAPK pathways. Our novel finding that Cbfa1 and activated ERK (most likely ERK2) physically associate in vivo further substantiates the critical role assigned to MAPK cascades in the osteoblast differentiation process in general (13Hipskind R.A. Bilbe G. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D804-D816Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14Lou J., Tu, Y., Li, S. Manske P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 46Karsenty G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that mechanical stimulation may promote the differentiation of osteoblasts by targeting this crucial transcription factor. Osteoblasts have been aptly called sophisticated fibroblasts (47Ducy P. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), in regard for limited number of exclusive osteoblastic genes. Cbfa1 can stimulate the transcription of such osteoblast-specific genes through cognate binding sites in their promoter regions (2Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3605) Google Scholar, 5Jimenez M.J. Balbin M. Lopez J.M. Alvarez J. Komori T. Lopez-Otin C. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7101-7107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Because mechanical stress results in augmentation of Cbfa1 levels and potentiation of its DNA binding capacity, it is plausible that the aforementioned genes may be physical end points of mechanical stimulation. This interpretation is supported by previous studies showing that many of these genes are induced under various conditions of mechanical stress (35Pavlin D. Dove S.B. Zadro R. Gluhak-Heinrich J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2000; 67: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 49Zaman G. Dallas S.L. Lanyon L.E. Calcif.

Scott J.E. Yen E.H. Arch. Oral Biol. 1995; 40: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Induction of Cbfa1 expression in osteoblastic cells has been reported after stimulation with several growth factors, including transforming growth factor-β1, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, BMP-7, or the BMP-4/7 heterodimer (2Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3605) Google Scholar, 52Lee M.H. Javed A. Kim H.J. Shin H.I. Gutierrez S. Choi J.Y.

Bone. 1998; 22: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). All of these secreted molecules transduce their signals through receptor protein Ser/Thr kinases that promote the phosphorylation of SMAD proteins, leading to their nuclear accumulation whereby they regulate transcription of target genes (55Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the kinetics of Cbfa1 mRNA expression after mechanical stimulation revealed that it increases sharply at 0.5 h and remains elevated thereafter. This immediate response of Cbfa1 expression is not likely to involve an indirect autocrine mechanism; the time required for synthesis, secretion, and ultimately action of the aforementioned growth factors is far beyond the time frame in which maximal Cbfa1 up-regulation was observed in our system. For instance, Lee et al. (53Lee K.-S. Kim Y.-J., Li, Q.-L. Chi X.-Z. Ueta C. Komori T. Wozney J.M. Kim E.-G. Choi J.-Y. Ryoo H.-M. Bae S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8783-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) have shown that Cbfa1 mRNA levels reach a maximum 2 h after transforming growth factor-β1 or BMP-2 stimulation and decrease gradually thereafter. The above consideration is in accordance with our previous studies indicating that mechanical stretch induces DNA synthesis in hPDL cells by a mechanism that seems to be direct and not mediated through autocrine growth factor action (27Kletsas D. Basdra E.K. Papavassiliou A.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We note, however, that our data cannot exclude a parallel contribution of autocrine growth factors which might be responsible for the sustained induction of Cbfa1 expression after mechanical stress.Until recently, the only factor that has been shown to control Cbfa1 expression directly is Cbfa1 itself (39Ducy P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This has been based on the fact that the Cbfa1 gene promoter contains functional Cbfa1 binding (OSE2) sites and, moreover, that overexpression of a dominant negative form of Cbfa1 in mature osteoblastic cells leads to a decrease of the endogenous protein (8Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 56Drissi H. Luc Q. Shakoori R., De Sousa Lopes S.C. Choi J.-Y. Terry A., Hu, M. Jones S. Neil J.C. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Such an autoregulatory mechanism is consistent with our data and could explain to a large degree the observed induction of Cbfa1 after mechanical stimulation. Conceivably, the rapid activation of (ERK) MAPKs by the mechanical stimulus promotes the phosphorylation and hence activation of preexisting Cbfa1 molecules, which, in turn, bind to OSE2 elements in the Cbfa1 promoter thereby enhancing expression of its own gene. This scenario is supported by the kinetics of induction of Cbfa1 binding activity, which is indicative of an immediate-early response, as well as by the MAPK inhibition analyses. Modulation of Cbfa1 binding activity via phosphorylation has been documented recently in vitro (25Xiao G. Jiang D. Thomas P. Benson M.D. Guan K. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4453-4459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Our combined in-gel kinase and coimmunoprecipitation data provide strong evidence that phosphorylation of Cbfa1 by ERK MAPK(s) also occurs in vivo. Interestingly, it was reported that increased Cbfa1 binding activity aftera 2-integrin-collagen interaction produced no significant alterations in Cbfa1 levels (57Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This observation does not necessarily contradict our hypothesis. A possible explanation for this discrepancy might be, for example, differences in several parameters such as cellular context and the nature of stimulus culminating in Cbfa1 expression. Specifically, in the aforementioned study relatively mature osteoblasts were employed, which express Cbfa1 even in the absence of differentiating stimuli. By contrast, hPDL preosteoblasts express marginal amounts of Cbfa1 under basal conditions; a dual input on the level of transcription and phosphorylation of Cbfa1, presumably involving the coordinate (or hierarchical) action of stretch-induced ERK/JNK MAPKs, is apparently required to initiate a program of osteoblast differentiation in these cells.It is likely that additional factors, besides MAPKs, may participate in the stretch-elicited up-regulation of Cbfa1 expression and activity. An obvious candidate is the AP-1 transcriptional complex. Indeed, inspection of the human Cbfa1 promoter region reveals a canonical AP-1 binding site juxtaposed with Cbfa1 binding sites, therefore leaving open the possibility that it participates in the transcriptional control of the Cbfa1 gene. In this regard, it has been demonstrated that Cbfa1 and AP-1 interact physically and thus regulate collagenase-3 expression (58Hess J. Porte D. Munz C. Angel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20029-20038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). As a corollary, we have recently shown an induction of AP-1 binding activity in hPDL cells, as early as 15 min after the application of stretch (23Peverali F.A. Basdra E.K. Papavassiliou A.G. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 68-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have observed that the major AP-1 components (and immediate-early gene products), c-Jun and c-Fos, are rapidly up-regulated after mechanical stretching of these cells. Importantly, the presence of MAPK inhibitors abrogates this inductive effect (24Kletsas D. Basdra E.K. Papavassiliou A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The possibility of a mechanical signal-facilitated Cbfa1-AP-1 “cross-talk” is currently under investigation in our system.Collectively, our study provides novel information for a molecular link between mechanical stimulation and osteoblast differentiation through the induction of expression and DNA binding potential of Cbfa1. Because Cbfa1 controls directly the rate of bone formation by differentiated osteoblasts, identifying stimuli that increase its expression and/or potency in these cells may lead to novel therapeutics to prevent and/or treat bone loss diseases. In this vein, the bone generating capacity of small physical signals, such as the low amplitude mechanical strain employed in the present study, suggests that biomechanical intervention might help to strengthen bone in bone degenerative diseases (e.g. osteoporosis) without the side effects associated with pharmacological treatment. In addition to being noninvasive and inducing a therapeutic response from the bone tissue itself, low intensity mechanical signals incorporate all aspects of a complex remodeling cycle ultimately improving bone quantity and quality (59Rubin C. Turner A.S. Bain S. Mallinckrodt C. McLeod K. Nature. 2001; 412: 603-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Mechanical stress has been long recognized to be an important regulatory factor in bone homeostasis and a determinant of skeletal morphology during development and in postnatal life (1Lanyon L.E. J. Biomech. 1987; 20: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Given its influence on and interactions with all other modulators of bone growth, mineralization, and remodeling, there is great interest in understanding the effect of mechanical loading on osteoblast differentiation and function. Despite extensive investigations, information regarding the precise molecular events that govern transformation of mechanical signals into biochemical responses culminating in genetic reprograming of bone cells still remains sparse and inconsistent.

Moreover, it has been shown that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK signaling is involved in the stimulation of osteoblast-related gene expression by extracellular matrix-integrin receptor interaction as well as mechanostressing (18Takeuchi Y.

We demonstrate that both the gene and Cbfa1 protein are key targets of mechanical stimulation in these cells, in a biologically relevant, ERK-catalyzed manner. These findings establish an important link between bone-specific transcription factor function and mechanotransduction in human osteoblasts which may be useful to plan strategies of noninvasive therapy based on mechanical strain-facilitated osteoinduction in situations such as fracture healing and distraction osteogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first indication that a physical stimulus such as mechanical stress elicits a direct effect on a tissue-specific transcriptional regulator.

This modification reaction is dependent on a family of related histone deacetylases (HDACs), which function as key components of large multiprotein complexes involved in the development of normal and neoplastic cells. The mechanisms regulating HDACs and their roles in such processes are not understood, and these form the major focus for the current study. Here, in the course of assessing possible post-translational modifications of HDAC1, we demonstrated that HDAC1 is a substrate for SUMO-1 (smallubiquitin-related modifier) modificationin vitro and in vivo. The HDAC1 lysines targeted for modification were identified as C-terminal Lys-444 and Lys-476, which are also present in mammalian HDAC2 and lower vertebrate HDAC1/2 orthologs yet absent from other HDAC family members, pointing to a means of differential regulation among HDAC proteins. Mutation of these target residues (lysine to arginine substitution) profoundly reduced HDAC1-mediated transcriptional repression in reporter assays without affecting HDAC1 ability to associate with mSin3A and eliminated HDAC1-induced cell cycle and apoptotic responses upon overexpression. Together, the results demonstrate that HDAC1 is modified by SUMO-1, and this modification can dramatically affect HDAC1 activity in a number of surrogate biological assays.

Prominent among these modifications is the acetylation/deacetylation of histone tails and their apparent pervasive roles in diverse cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and transformation (1Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Deacetylation of the N terminus of histone tails by histone deacetylases (HDACs)1 has been shown to inhibit transcriptional activation, supporting the prevailing model that this modification converts chromatin into a “closed conformation,” which impedes progression of the transcriptional machinery along the DNA (2Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Recently, specific inhibitors of histone deacetylation have been shown to affect growth or survival of transformed cells (3Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) and to exhibit clinical efficacy in human hematopoietic malignancies (4Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Rifkind R.A. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2001; 13: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). These anti-neoplastic effects are presumably mediated in part by modulating the transcriptional regulation of many genes and trans-acting proteins governing growth and differentiation (5Archer S.Y. Meng S. Shei A. Hodin R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6791-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). To date, the mammalian genome contains at least 10 HDACs that fall into one of two classes: class I HDACs 1–3 and 8 with structural relatedness to the yeast HDAC ortholog, rpd3; and class II HDACs 4–7, 9 and 10 bearing relatedness to the yeast protein, hda1 (6Bertos N.R.

HDACs 1 and 2 have been shown to be integral components of at least three distinct multiprotein co-repressor complexes: mSin3, NuRD, and CoRest. The mSin3 complex contains mSin3A and mSin3B, RbAp46 and RbAp48, SAP30 and SAP18, and mSds3 and is recruited to specific gene targets via direct interaction between mSin3 and sequence-specific transcription factors such as Mad (Mxi1) family members (Refs. 10Knoepfler P.S. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1999; 99: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar and11Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H. Potes J. Muhle R. Lee H.C. Hou H., Jr. Chen K. DePinho R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2743-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and references therein). Tethering the mSin3 complex recruits HDAC activity to specific promoters and is thought to result in the local deacetylation of histone N-terminal tails and active repression of gene transcription (12Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). Another HDAC1/2-containing complex is NuRD, comprised of Mi-2, MBD3, MTA2, and also RbAP46 and RbAp48. In addition to HDAC activity, this complex exhibits ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activity and is believed to participate in the stable repression of several genomic loci (13Tong J.K. Hassig C.A. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 14Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Vermaak D. Wolffe A.P. Curr.

Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Finally, a new HDAC1/2-containing complex, the CoRest complex, was recently described and appears to play an important role in the active repression of genes essential to the neural phenotype (17You A. Tong J.K. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Beyond recruitment to specific co-repressor complexes, the mechanisms governing HDAC1 activity are not well understood. Here we examined whether HDAC1 is subject to post-translational modifications and whether such modification correlates with altered HDAC1 activity and association with the mSin3 co-repressor. Given the lysine-rich nature of HDAC1, we focused on covalent modifications by ubiquitin or SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier) modifications known to target lysine residues. SUMO-1 is a 16-kDa protein bearing 18% identity with ubiquitin and requiring a conjugation machinery similar to that of ubiquitin: E1-activating enzymes (Aos1/Uba1), E2-conjugating enzymes (mUbc9), and E3 ligases (18Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 19Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The number of substrates modified by SUMO-1 has grown considerably, and in each instance SUMO-1 modification has been shown to exert profound and varied effects on the target protein including inhibition of ubiquitination, control of localization to subcellular compartments, and/or modulation of enzymatic activity (18Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 19Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that specific lysine residues present in the HDAC1 C terminus are modified by both ubiquitin and SUMO-1 and that mutational analysis of these target residues can exert a significant impact on HDAC1 activity in a series of surrogate functional assays. For endogenous HDAC1 detection the anti-HDAC1 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and diluted 1:2000. Endogenous mSin3A was detected using the anti-mSin3A antibody K20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:200). FLAG-tagged constructs were detected using the M2 antibody (Sigma; diluted 1:2000). The mouse HDAC1-FLAG expression vector provided by Eric Verdin (20Bartl S. Taplick J. Lagger G. Khier H. Kuchler K. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was utilized in both transfection and in vitro translation studies. HDAC1 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids encoding UbiHIS, SUMO-1HIS, SUMO-1-HA and GST-mUbc9 were kindly provided by Drs. Dirk Bohman and Anne Dejean. GST-SUMO-1-encoding plasmid was generated by cloning a PCR-generated SUMO-1 fragment in which the two C-terminal glycines of SUMO-1 are removed and placed in-frame with bridging oligonucleotides into the pGEX-5X vector (Promega). HDAC1 and HDAC1 mutant cDNAs were fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain (residues 1–147) in pGAL0 using appropriate primers and PCR and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The retroviruses were generated by cloning HDAC1 and HDAC1 mutant into a modified pBABE containing an IRES-GFP cassette. 293T cells and NIH 3T3 cells were grown using standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reporter assays, 7 × 104 cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of tk-(GAL4)5-luc reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of pGAL4 or derivatives, and 0.1 μg of pCMX-LacZ. Trichostatin A (TSA) was purchased from Sigma, and cells were treated with 100 ng/μl for 16 h. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) and normalized for transfection efficiency using galactosidase activity. Retroviral infections were performed using standard procedures. For immunoprecipitation cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40, incubated for 3 h with anti-FLAG antibody and protein-A/G Plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz), and extensively washed in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40. In vitro modification assays were performed as described by Desterroet al. (21Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). In vivo modification assays were performed as described by Muller et al. (22Muller S. Berger M. Lehembre F. Seeler J.S. Haupt Y. Dejean A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13321-13329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) after transfection of 293T cells with the appropriate plasmids. In the course of investigating possible modes of HDAC1 regulation, Western blot analysis of NIH 3T3 whole cell extracts revealed a prominent anti-HDAC1 immunoreactive band measuring 55 kDa as expected for the wild-type HDAC1 as well as a slower migrating form of ∼70 kDa (Fig.1 a). This size differential prompted us to test whether HDAC1 is a target for modification by the 16-kDa ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1. An established in vitro modification assay (21Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) was employed in which the putative substrates are produced and labeled in vitro and are incubated with purified components of the SUMO-1 modification machinery in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system and GST-SUMO-1. The E1 enzymes are provided by a purified fraction of HeLa cells, and the E2 activity is provided by the addition of GST-mUbc9 protein. As shown in Fig. 1 b, in vitro modification of HDAC1 gives rise to the appearance of two larger forms of HDAC1, the first one migrating at ∼105 kDa and the second one at ∼150 kDa (lane 2). These sizes are consistent with those of HDAC1 modified by one or two molecules of GST-SUMO-1, respectively. The identity of the modification is further supported by the fact that it did not occur in the absence of SUMO-1 (Fig. 1 b, lane 3). To confirm SUMO-1 modification of HDAC1 in vivo, 293T cells were transfected with a vector expressing a FLAG-tagged HDAC1 (HDAC1FLAG) protein with or without a vector expressing His-tagged SUMO-1 (SUMO-1HIS). SUMO-1HIS-modified proteins were then purified by chromatography on nickel-charged agarose beads. Transfection of HDAC1FLAG alone resulted in the pull-down of a modest amount of the unmodified protein as revealed by an anti-FLAG antibody, which was most likely due to the presence of histidine repeats in the HDAC1 N terminus (Fig. 1 c, lane 1). Co-transfection with SUMO-1HIS resulted in the pull-down of the wild-type band as well as two slower migrating bands, corresponding in size to HDAC1FLAG modified by one or two SUMO-1HIS molecules and consistent with the above in vitro observations (Fig. 1 b). In a separate series of studies we also documented that co-transfection of HDAC1FLAG and His-tagged ubiquitin results in the appearance of a characteristic ladder of modified forms revealed by an anti-FLAG antibody, suggesting that HDAC1 can also be efficiently ubiquitinated in vivo (Fig. 1 c, lane 3). This latter finding is consistent with the known regulation of HDAC1 stability via a proteasome-dependent mechanism (23Zhou Q. Melkoumian Z.K. Lucktong A. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Strobl J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35256-35263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, HDAC1 is subject to modification by SUMO-1 and ubiquitin. To map these modifications, we generated a series of HDAC1 deletion mutants (Fig.2 a) and assayed for ubiquitin or SUMO-1 modification. As shown in Fig. 2 b, co-transfection of these mutants along with His-tagged ubiquitin showed that the HDAC1 deletion mutants were modified by ubiquitin to varying extents; mutants represented in lanes 3 and 4 were weakly modified, and the HDAC1Δ432–482 mutant in lane 8 was not modified. This C-terminal deleted region is rich in lysines (15 of the 51 amino acid residues are lysines), and as mentioned above lysines are the residues targeted for ubiquitin or SUMO-1 modification. The target overlap for ubiquitination and SUMOylation reported elsewhere (21Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) prompted us to test whether HDAC1Δ432–482 was SUMOylated in vivo (Fig. 2 c). As observed with ubiquitin, this mutant was not modified by SUMO-1 (lane 3) in contrast to all other deletion mutants represented (Fig.2 c and data not shown). Because HDAC1 nuclear localization signals have been reported to reside within the C terminus (residues 438–445) (24Taplick J. Kurtev V. Kroboth K. Posch M. Lechner T. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility of subcellular mislocalization as a basis for the lack of SUMOylation of HDAC1Δ432–482. Indeed, this mutant was found to be exclusively cytoplasmic whereas wild-type HDAC1 is predominantly nuclear (data not shown). However, HDAC1Δ432–482 remained refractory to SUMO-1 modification in the in vitro modification assay (lane 8) in which nuclear localization is not a prerequisite for modification, whereas all other mutants were modified efficiently in this system (Fig. 2 d and data not shown). Taken together, these results establish the HDAC1 C terminus as a prominent target for modification by both ubiquitin and SUMO-1. Because SUMO-1 and ubiquitin are covalently linked to lysine in the modified substrate, a series of lysine to arginine substitution mutants were generated. Although this change is conservative, arginine can not serve as a substrate for SUMO-1 modification. As shown in Fig.2 e, HDAC1 single mutants K444R and K476R exhibit less modification by SUMO-1 in the in vitro modification assay compared with the wild-type protein or other point mutants (comparelanes 4 and 10 to lanes 2,6, and 8). In an independent experiment, the HDAC1 double mutant K444R/K476R was a poor substrate forin vitro modification (lane 14). When assayedin vivo, the double mutant showed near complete loss of SUMO-1 modification (Fig. 2 f, lane 4), while single point mutants were capable of modification by SUMO-1 (lanes 5 and 6). The ability of Lys-476 to be modified in vivo in the K444R mutant is noteworthy given that residue 444 resides within the nuclear localization signals, which suggests that the mutant is still properly targeted within the cell. The amino acid sequences surrounding these lysine residues (VKTE and VKEE for Lys-444 and -476, respectively) correspond to the reported consensus sequence defined for modification by SUMO-1, (I/V/L)KXE (25Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Of note, the C-terminal portions and specifically these SUMO-1 consensus sequences are conserved in mammalian HDAC2 but are not present in remaining HDACs including the other class I HDACs, HDAC3 and HDAC8. These SUMO-1 consensus sequences are present in Xenopus but absent in theCaenorhabditis, Drosophila, and Yeast orthologs, a finding that raises the possibility that SUMO-1 modification of HDAC1 represents a level of regulation specific to higher eukaryotes. This theme is similar to that reported for other SUMO-1 modified proteins such as RanGAP1, a finding that may relate to the need for a more exquisite level of regulation of RanGAP1 nuclear import functions in higher eukaryotes (19Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Although a growing number of SUMO-1 substrates have been reported, the functional impact of this modification has been shown to be varied and complex and in most cases not well understood. For example, previous studies have shown that SUMO-1 can compete with ubiquitin for modification of the same lysine and inhibit ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of target proteins such as IκBα (21Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Along these lines, since HDAC1 is subject to modification by SUMO-1 and ubiquitin, this prompted an assessment of whether the lysines defined above as SUMO-1 targets are also the attachment sites for ubiquitin. In the in vivoubiquitination assay (as described for Fig. 1 c), the double mutant K444R/K476R showed robust ubiquitination as reflected by a prominent ladder of ubiquitin conjugates (Fig.3 a, lane 2). Significantly, HDAC1 half-life was not affected by SUMO-1 overexpression or by the double Lys→Arg substitution (data not shown). Thus, these results suggest that SUMO-1 does not compete with ubiquitination of HDAC1 on a level that affects protein stability. Next, prompted by the capacity of SUMO-1 modification to modulate the activity of some transcription factors such as p53 or c-Jun (22Muller S. Berger M. Lehembre F. Seeler J.S. Haupt Y. Dejean A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13321-13329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 26Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar,27Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether SUMO-1 modification impacts HDAC1-mediated repressor activity. As reported previously (28Hassig C.A. Tong J.K. Fleischer T.C. Owa T. Grable P.G. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), HDAC1 fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain has been shown to act as a repressor of reporter genes driven by a minimal promoter harboring GAL4 binding sites (Fig. 3 b). The activity of the double point mutant (K444R/K476R) was reduced to ∼60% of the activity of the GAL4-HDAC1 control (Fig. 3 b). Addition of TSA, a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase activity, strongly reduced HDAC1-mediated transcriptional repression to a level equivalent to that observed for HDAC1 K444R/K476R without TSA. Also, TSA addition had no effect on HDAC1 K444R/K476R-mediated transcriptional repression. These activity profiles are consistent with the view that the residues subject to SUMO-1 modification are necessary for the full repressive activity of HDAC1. Because histone deacetylase activity is responsible for HDAC1-mediated repression (28Hassig C.A. Tong J.K. Fleischer T.C. Owa T. Grable P.G. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and TSA had no effect on HDAC1 K444R/K476R-mediated repression, this finding implies that SUMO-1 modification modulates the biological effects of HDAC1 by potentiating its histone deacetylase activity. Several lines of evidence have indicated a role for HDAC1 in cell cycle regulation. First, HDAC1 has been shown to associate with several proteins involved in cell cycle progression (29Luo J., Su, F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 30Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Second, use of HDAC inhibitors leads to growth arrest and apoptosis in transformed cells (see Ref. 3Marks P.A.

Finally, deregulation of HDAC1 recruitment has been involved in the pathogenesis of neoplasia (33Lin R.J. Nagy L. Inoue S. Shao W. Miller W.H., Jr. Evans R.M.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2549-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Thus, to assess the impact of impaired SUMOylation of HDAC1 on its cell cycle effects, stable NIH 3T3 cell lines were generated that overexpressed HDAC1 or the HDAC1 K444R/K476R mutant. Robust expression of the wild-type and mutant HDAC1 was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 c, left panel). Notably, wild-type HDAC1 and HDAC1 K444R/K476R were able to associate with endogenous mSin3A to the same extent, suggesting that the integrity of the mSin3/HDAC complex is not affected by SUMO-1 modification of HDAC1 (Fig. 3 c, left panel). The cell cycle distribution by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed a significant biphasic arrest and increased sub-G0 fraction in the wild-type HDAC1 transfectants. This profile is similar to that reported by Bartl et al. (20Bartl S. Taplick J. Lagger G. Khier H. Kuchler K. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that overexpression of HDAC1 results in prolongation of the G2and M phases in Swiss 3T3 cells. Significantly, this prominent biological perturbation was completely absent in the double mutant transfectants (Fig. 3 c, right panel). Interestingly, both wild-type HDAC1 and the double mutant were localized predominantly in the nucleus, ruling out the possibility that the lack of effect observed in the double mutant results of the alteration of HDAC1 nuclear localization signals (data not shown). Although the precise physiological implications of this cell cycle finding are not clear, these results indicate that SUMO-1 modification is necessary for HDAC1 to remain fully functional in this surrogate assay. Furthermore, these results imply that tight regulation of HDAC1 activity is necessary for proper cell cycle progression, although it should be emphasized that the results were derived from an experimental circumstance of enforced HDAC1 expression that is well above physiological levels. Modulation of HDAC1 activity by post-translational modifications or protein association has been reported previously. Indeed, retention of its catalytic activity correlates with phosphorylation of HDAC1 (36Pflum M.K.H. Tong J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47733-47741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and with physical association with the mSin3-associated protein mSds3 (11Alland L. David G. Shen-Li H.

Such observations should motivate investigations focused on the interplay between HDAC1 phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and association with its known partners particularly in the setting of cell cycle progression, cancer, and stress conditions. Finally, the identification of the SUMO-1 E3 ligase that triggers HDAC1 modification should allow for the determination of the molecular switches that induce its association with HDAC1.

They have been proposed to be possible targets for the design of novel chemotherapeutics against human pathogens such as fungi and protozoan parasites as mammals were not thought to possess chitin-processing enzymes. Recently, a human chitotriosidase was described as a marker for Gaucher disease with plasma levels of the enzyme elevated up to 2 orders of magnitude. The chitotriosidase was shown to be active against colloidal chitin and is inhibited by the family 18 chitinase inhibitor allosamidin. Here, the crystal structure of the human chitotriosidase and complexes with a chitooligosaccharide and allosamidin are described. The structures reveal an elongated active site cleft, compatible with the binding of long chitin polymers, and explain the inactivation of the enzyme through an inherited genetic deficiency. Comparison with YM1 and HCgp-39 shows how the chitinase has evolved into these mammalian lectins by the mutation of key residues in the active site, tuning the substrate binding specificity. The soaking experiments with allosamidin and chitooligosaccharides give insight into ligand binding properties and allow the evaluation of differential binding and design of species-selective chitinase inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2162427919,"Nitric oxide is a key element in host defense against invasive pathogens. The periplasmic cytochrome cnitrite reductase (NrfA) of Escherichia coli catalyzes the respiratory reduction of nitrite, but in vitro studies have shown that it can also reduce nitric oxide. The physiological significance of the latter reaction in vivo has never been assessed. In this study the reduction of nitric oxide byEscherichia coli was measured in strains active or deficient in periplasmic nitrite reduction. Nrf+ cells, harvested from cultures grown anaerobically, possessed a nitric-oxide reductase activity with physiological electron donation of 60 nmol min−1· mg dry wt−1, and an in vivo turnover number of NrfA of 390 NO⋅ s−1was calculated. Nitric-oxide reductase activity could not be detected in Nrf− strains. Comparison of the anaerobic growth of Nrf+ and Nrf− strains revealed a higher sensitivity to nitric oxide in the NrfA− strains. A higher sensitivity to the nitrosating agentS-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) was also observed in agar plate disk-diffusion assays. Oxygen respiration by E. coli was also more sensitive to nitric oxide in the Nrf− strains compared with the Nrf+ parent strain. The results demonstrate that active periplasmic cytochromec nitrite reductase can confer the capacity for nitric oxide reduction and detoxification on E. coli. Genomic analysis of many pathogenic enteric bacteria reveals the presence ofnrf genes. The present study raises the possibility that this reflects an important role for the cytochrome cnitrite reductase in nitric oxide management in oxygen-limited environments. Nitric oxide is a key element in host defense against invasive pathogens. The periplasmic cytochrome cnitrite reductase (NrfA) of Escherichia coli catalyzes the respiratory reduction of nitrite, but in vitro studies have shown that it can also reduce nitric oxide. The physiological significance of the latter reaction in vivo has never been assessed. In this study the reduction of nitric oxide byEscherichia coli was measured in strains active or deficient in periplasmic nitrite reduction. Nrf+ cells, harvested from cultures grown anaerobically, possessed a nitric-oxide reductase activity with physiological electron donation of 60 nmol min−1· mg dry wt−1, and an in vivo turnover number of NrfA of 390 NO⋅ s−1was calculated. Nitric-oxide reductase activity could not be detected in Nrf− strains. Comparison of the anaerobic growth of Nrf+ and Nrf− strains revealed a higher sensitivity to nitric oxide in the NrfA− strains. A higher sensitivity to the nitrosating agentS-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) was also observed in agar plate disk-diffusion assays. Oxygen respiration by E. coli was also more sensitive to nitric oxide in the Nrf− strains compared with the Nrf+ parent strain. The results demonstrate that active periplasmic cytochromec nitrite reductase can confer the capacity for nitric oxide reduction and detoxification on E. coli. Genomic analysis of many pathogenic enteric bacteria reveals the presence ofnrf genes. The present study raises the possibility that this reflects an important role for the cytochrome cnitrite reductase in nitric oxide management in oxygen-limited environments. cytochrome c nitrite reductase S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine S-nitrosoglutathione minimal salt Nitrogen monoxide (nitric oxide or NO⋅) has long been recognized as a free intermediate in the denitrification reactions of the nitrogen cycle, in which bacteria reduce nitrate or nitrite to gaseous nitrogen oxides and dinitrogen (1Richardson D.J. Watmough N.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Watmough N.J. Butland G. Cheesman M.R. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 456-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The bacteria that participate in denitrification can utilize the NO⋅ free radical as a substrate for an energy-conserving respiratory electron transport pathway that terminates in an integral membrane nitric-oxide reductase that is a member of the heme-copper oxidase superfamily (3Gronberg K.L. Roldan M.D. Prior L. Butland G. Cheesman M.R. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Thomson A.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13780-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 4Hendriks J. Warne A. Gohlke U. Haltia T. Ludovici C. Lubben M. Saraste M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13102-13109Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This enzyme is also found in many non-denitrifying bacteria, including the phototroph Rhodobacter capsulatus (5Bell L.C. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and may play a role in detoxifying NO⋅ produced by other bacteria in the organism's environment (2Watmough N.J. Butland G. Cheesman M.R. Moir J.W. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 456-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Richardson D.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In the last decade it has also become clear that NO⋅ is a key component of the host defense response to invasion by pathogenic bacteria (7Snyder S.H. Bredt D.S. Sci. Am. 1992; 266 (, 74–77): 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). For example, NO⋅ is produced by macrophages through the activity of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, which converts l-arginine to cytotoxic NO⋅. The NO⋅ can, in turn, form a number of other reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, including NO+, NO−, NO2−, and ONOO−, all of which can have bactericidal or bacteristatic effects on phagocytosed organisms (7Snyder S.H. Bredt D.S. Sci. Am. 1992; 266 (, 74–77): 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 8Marletta M.A. Yoon P.S. Iyengar R. Leaf C.D. Wishnok J.S.

Studies indicate that many pathogenic bacteria may have one or more means of removing NO⋅ from their environment. For example, in oxic environments the denitrosylase reaction of flavohemoglobin, which can turnover at 600–700 NO⋅ s−1, may play a role in NO⋅ resistance in Escherichia coli andSalmonella typhimurium (9Poole R.K. Hughes M.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 10Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Gardner P.R. Dou Y. Olson J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 748-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The anaerobic reduction of NO⋅ to N2O by E. coli flavohemoglobin has also been demonstrated (11Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). However, this reaction is rather slow compared with the aerobic reaction. Its importance in anaerobic NO⋅ detoxification in E. coli has recently been questioned, and a NO⋅-inducible cytoplasmic NADH-dependent flavorubredoxin has been implicated in NO⋅ reduction (15Gardner A.M. Helmick R.A. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8172-8177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 16Gardner A.M. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8166-8171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Respiratory detoxification of NO⋅ by pathogens may also be important. For example, analysis of the genome sequences of some pathogens, such as Neisseria meningitidis, has revealed genes for a respiratory NO⋅ reductase of the heme-copper oxidase family that have been well characterized in denitrifying bacteria (6Richardson D.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In the latter bacteria, these enzymes can turnover NO⋅ at around 50–100 s−1 (3Gronberg K.L. Roldan M.D. Prior L. Butland G. Cheesman M.R. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Thomson A.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13780-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 4Hendriks J. Warne A. Gohlke U. Haltia T. Ludovici C. Lubben M. Saraste M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13102-13109Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and so they could potentially provide a pathogen with an effective means of rapidly removing NO⋅ in oxygen-limited environments. The site of NO⋅ reduction is likely to be toward the periplasmic face of the membrane, which would help to detoxify the reactive radical before it enters the cell. Respiratory nitric-oxide reductases are absent from many enteric pathogens, such as Escherichia and Salmonellaspecies. However, analysis of the genome sequences of many pathogenic enteric bacteria has revealed the presence of anrfA 1 gene encoding a pentaheme periplasmic cytochrome c nitrite reductase (17Potter L. Angove H. Richardson D. Cole J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2001; 45: 51-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This respiratory enzyme catalyzes the six-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia and is normally expressed under anoxic or micro-oxic growth conditions in the presence of nitrate and nitrite (18Darwin A. Hussain H. Griffiths L. Grove J. Sambongi Y. Busby S. Cole J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Stewart V. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 20Rabin R.S. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3259-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structures of NrfA from E. coli,Wolinella succinogenes, and Sulfospirillum deleyianum have recently been solved and are leading to a greater understanding of the enzymatic mechanism for nitrite reduction (21Bamford V.A. Angove H.C. Seward H.E. Thomson A.J. Cole J.A. Butt J.N. Hemmings A.M. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Einsle O. Messerschmidt A.

Kroneck P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39608-39616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Perhaps significantly, it has been recognized for a number of years that NrfA can also catalyze the five-electron reduction of NO⋅ to NH4+, with turnover rates estimated at between 30 and 1000 s−1 (24Costa C. Macedo A. Moura I. Moura J.J., Le Gall J. Berlier Y. Liu M.Y. Payne W.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this reaction has never been investigated, yet it is clearly possible that in oxygen-limited environments NrfA contributes to the removal of potentially cytotoxic NO⋅. In the case of pathogenic enteric bacteria, it is recognized that low oxygen tensions are encountered during infection. It is notable that S. typhi mutants deficient in anaerobic respiration have impaired ability to replicate within epithelial cells (25Contreras I. Toro C.S. Troncoso G. Mora G.C. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2665-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In order to assess the contribution that NrfA can make to NO⋅ consumption and detoxification in enteric bacteria, strains of E. coli deficient in NrfA activity (26Darwin A. Tormay P. Page L. Griffiths L. Cole J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 1829-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were assessed for NO⋅ reduction and for sensitivity to NO⋅ and the nitrosating agent S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine. The results have demonstrated that NrfA can catalyze NO⋅ reduction with physiological electron donors in intact cells of E. coli and have shown that growth of mutants deficient in NrfA activity is more sensitive than that of the parent strain to NO⋅. This demonstrates, for the first time, a respiratory route for anoxic NO⋅ management in E. coli. This route of NO⋅ management may be widespread among other enteric bacteria. The strains used were E. coli JCB387 (ΔnirB), E. coliJCB352TR (ΔnirB nrf::mud1Aplac), and E. coli JCB362TR (ΔnirB nrf::mud1Aplac) (26Darwin A. Tormay P. Page L. Griffiths L. Cole J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 1829-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Aerobic cultures were grown either in LB medium (10 g of tryptone, 10 g of NaCl, 5 g of yeast extract per liter, pH 7.5) or on LB agar solidified with 1.5% w/v agar. Aerobic 20 ml cultures were grown overnight in 150 ml conical flasks shaken at 200 rpm. Anaerobic cultures were grown in minimal salts (MS) medium (27Pope N.R. Cole J.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 1279-1284PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% LB, 10 μm selenate, and 10 μm molybdate. The main carbon source was 0.4% (w/v) glycerol, and the terminal electron acceptors were 20 mm sodium nitrate and 40 mm sodium fumarate. For anaerobic growth on solid medium, 1.5% w/v agar was added to the MS media. To ensure there was no oxygen interference, liquid cultures were grown with no aeration in screw-cap bottles that were filled to the top; plates were secured in an anaerobic jar with an oxygen indicator and an anaerobic gas pouch that releases hydrogen and carbon dioxide (purchased from Oxoid). Ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) was added where appropriate. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C. Solid agar suspensions of E. coli were made by mixing 1 part of an overnight liquid culture with 9 parts melted 1.5% agar medium that had been sufficiently cooled (42 °C). Semisolid agar suspensions were created using 9 parts melted 0.3% agar medium instead of 1.5% agar medium. E. coli were grown anaerobically overnight, and 100 ml of each culture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm and resuspended in 10 ml of the spent medium. A Clarke-type oxygen electrode was polarized to detect nitric oxide, and 3 ml of the concentrated cell culture was put into the electrode chamber. The cells were allowed to consume the oxygen present in the chamber, and a known quantity of a saturated NO solution (2 mm) was added to the chamber in order to obtain a nitric oxide signal. The rate at which the cells consumed the nitric oxide was observed. During control experiments in which no E. colicells were present, glucose, glucose oxidase, and catalase were put into the chamber in order to consume the oxygen present. The electrode chamber was filled with 3 ml of 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl (pH 7.1). Glucose (to 16 mm), glucose oxidase (to 4 units ml−1), and catalase (to 20–25 units ml−1) were added. Once the oxygen had been consumed, known quantities of a saturated NO solution were added as described above. Agar suspensions of the E. coli to be tested were poured onto plates, and 4-mm Whatman paper disks that had been soaked with 15 μl of a 250 mm solution of the NO-releasing compound SNAP were placed carefully on the center of the plates. Plates were then incubated anaerobically overnight. Agar suspensions of the E. coli cells to be tested were poured into Hungate tubes and allowed to set. Known quantities of NO gas were then injected into the headspace of the tubes using a gas-tight Hamilton syringe. The tubes were then incubated overnight. Bacteria were grown anaerobically overnight and harvested by centrifugation; the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 10% of the original culture volume of sphaeroplast buffer (500 mm sucrose, 100 mm Tris, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and lysozyme was added to a concentration of 2 mg/ml. After 30 min at 37 °C, the sample was centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant periplasm was retained for analysis. Proteins present in the solubleE. coli extract were separated on SDS/15% PAGE. The gel was then stained for covalently bound heme (28Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Cultures (30 ml) that had been grown either aerobically or anaerobically were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 rpm in a Sigma desktop centrifuge. The bacterial pellet was washed twice by resuspension in 30 ml of ice-cold LB that had been precooled to prevent heat shock; centrifugation was as above. The washed bacteria were resuspended in 3 ml of 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8.0; 2.5 ml of this suspension was transferred to a 3-ml glass cuvette containing 25 μl of 100 mm methyl viologen and a magnetic flea. The top of the cuvette was sealed with a Suba-Seal septum into which two stainless steel needles had been inserted. The contents of the cuvette and the headspace were sparged with oxygen-free nitrogen gas for 15 min. The methyl viologen was reduced with a freshly prepared solution of 100 mm sodium dithionite dissolved in Hepes buffer that had been degassed with oxygen-free nitrogen for 20 min. When an optical density of 600 nm due to reduced methyl viologen was constant, the reaction was started by the addition of about 3 μl of 1 msodium nitrite; the rate of oxidation of methyl viologen was determined in an Aminco spectrophotometer. Cells were grown anaerobically overnight. 3 ml of cells were put into the chamber of a Clarke-type oxygen electrode, and the rate of oxygen consumption was observed. Once a steady rate of oxygen consumption had been established, a known quantity of an NO⋅-saturated solution (2 mm) was added to the chamber. Any resulting inhibition of oxygen consumption was observed. Anaerobic growth curves were carried out in sterilized 3 ml glass cuvettes. 50 ml of MS medium was inoculated with 0.5 ml of an overnight culture, and 3 ml aliquots were put into the cuvettes and sealed with sterilized Suba-Seals. The contents of the cuvettes were then sparged with oxygen-free nitrogen gas for 15 min. The OD600 of the cultures was taken every hour. Once the OD600 of the experimental cultures had reached 0.10, 50 μl of NO⋅ gas was injected into the cultures using a sterilized gas-tight Hamilton syringe. To assess whether NrfA can make a contribution to NO⋅ reduction inE. coli, NO⋅ consumption was assessed in twonrf::mud1Aplac insertion mutants, JCB352TR and JCB362TR, and the parent strain JCB387. These strains are all deficient in the cytoplasmic siroheme nitrite reductase, NirA. Their use thereby prevents any possible complication from contributions that this enzyme might make to nitrite and nitric oxide reduction. The Nrf− strains could not grow anaerobically on the non-fermentable carbon source glycerol with NO2− present as sole electron acceptor. Consequently all three strains were grown anaerobically with glycerol as the carbon and energy source and with nitrate and fumarate present as respiratory electron acceptors. The growth rate and final optical density of the Nrf− strains were both slightly less than the parent strain under these conditions (Fig.1). The expression of active NrfA was assessed using reduced methyl viologen (MV+) as a non-physiological electron donor. A MV+-dependent nitrite reductase activity of 100 nmol mg dry wt−1· min−1 was measured in JCB387, but no activity could be detected in either JCB352TR or JCB362TR (Fig. 1,inset). Having established that active NrfA was present in JCB387 and absent in JCB352TR and JCB362TR, cultures grown anaerobically on glycerol/nitrate/fumarate medium were assessed for NO⋅ reduction activity. Cells collected from late exponential-phase cultures were harvested, washed, and resuspended in glycerol-supplemented growth medium without electron acceptors. NO⋅ consumption was monitored using a Clarke-type electrode under anaerobic conditions. The JCB387 parent strain reduced NO⋅at a maximum rate of 300 nmol of NO⋅ per mg of protein min−1. This was comparable with the rates of nitrate, nitrite (not shown), and oxygen (Fig. 5) reduction by E. coli. It is also comparable with anaerobic NO⋅ respiration rates recorded in other bacteria that can express the respiratory NO⋅ reductase, such as Paracoccus denitrificans (29Carr G.J. Page M.D. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and R. capsulatus (5Bell L.C. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The time courses of NO⋅reduction were linear down to about 10 μm NO⋅, which suggests that the bacterial cells have a lowK s (high affinity) for this substrate under these assay conditions. The NO⋅ was not toxic to the JCB387 cells, because repeated pulses of NO⋅ over a 3-h period were also consumed at a similar rate. Measurement of ammonium accumulation in the assay medium following NO⋅ consumption revealed a nearest integer ratio of 1 mol of NO⋅ consumed per 1 mol of NH4+ produced. Consumption of NO⋅ was not observed in cells harvested from cultures grown under highly aerated conditions, which correlated with an absence of nrfexpression under these culture conditions. The anaerobic consumption of NO⋅ could not be detected when measured under comparable conditions in either of the two Nrf− strains, JCB352TR and JCB362TR (Fig.2). The slight downward drift of the electrode trace apparent in these experiments was also observed when cells were left out of the electrode chamber. In the parent strain JCB387, anaerobic NO⋅ reduction was also observed in the presence of 5 mm nitrite or in spent culture medium that contained nitrite. Under these conditions NO⋅ reduction was about 50% slower than when nitrite was absent. This was possibly a consequence of competition for the active site of NrfA between NO⋅ and NO2−.Figure 2A, nitric-oxide reductase activity inE. coli cells. Nitric oxide consumption was measured using a Clarke-type oxygen electrode polarized to detect nitric oxide.B, heme-staining gel used to estimate the quantity of NrfA in JCB387 cells; known quantities of purified NrfA were run alongside JCB387 periplasm. Quantification of NrfA in the cell extract was achieved via comparison of band intensity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results with the nitric oxide electrode clearly demonstrated that the Nrf-dependent respiratory electron transport system ofE. coli could account for significant rates of NO⋅reduction in anaerobic intact cell suspensions. Previous in vitro measurements of NO⋅ reduction by NrfA from a number of bacterial sources have yielded rates that lie in the range of 30–1000 NO⋅ s−1 (24Costa C. Macedo A. Moura I. Moura J.J., Le Gall J. Berlier Y. Liu M.Y. Payne W.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The large variation probably arises, at least in part, from the use of different non-physiological electron donors (e.g. dithionite or ascorbate). The present study has assessed NO⋅ consumption by NrfA in the intact cells with electron donation through a physiologically relevant route. Thein situ turnover number was estimated by quantifying NrfA in cells by comparing the intensity of the 52-kDa NrfA heme-staining band in periplasmic fractions of JCB387 to that of purified NrfA standards (Fig. 2 C). This yielded a value of 12.8 pmol of NrfA (mg of protein)−1 and allows the turnover rate for NO⋅ in the intact cell to be estimated at 390 s−1, which is within the range reported from the in vitro enzymatic assays. To assess whether NrfA can confer NO⋅ resistance during anaerobic growth of E. coli, NO⋅ was added to actively growing cultures during the early exponential phase of growth (Fig. 1 B). Anaerobic growth of the Nrf− strains, JCB352TR and JCB362TR, was more sensitive to NO⋅ than growth of the parent strain, JCB387. Thus, addition of less than 50 μmol ml−1 NO⋅ did not inhibit growth of any of the strains (data not shown). However, addition of 150 μmol ml−1 NO⋅ completely attenuated growth of the JCB352TR and JCB362TR but had no effect on the growth kinetics of JCB387 (Fig. 1 B). At higher NO⋅(200 nmol of NO⋅ ml−1), a transient 4-h growth inhibition of JCB387 was observed, but the culture recovered fully and thereafter exhibited normal growth kinetics (data not shown). Sensitivity to NO⋅ was also assessed during growth in Hungate tubes in semisolid agar. For JCB352TR and JCB362TR, clear zones were observed at the tops of the Hungate tubes in which 100 nmol of NO⋅ had been injected into the headspace (Fig. 3). By contrast, in the absence of NO⋅ the bacteria colonized the agar right up to the agar-gas interface. No clear zones were apparent in the presence of 100 nmol of NO⋅ in Hungate tubes containing JCB387. The clear zones observed with JCB352TR and JCB362TR could arise from either growth inhibition or bacterial taxis away from the chemotoxin NO⋅. Either way, the experiment demonstrates that the Nrf− strains are less able to manage NO⋅ than is a Nrf+ parent strain. Disk diffusion sensitivity assays were used to compare the growth sensitivity of the Nrf mutants, strains JCB352TR and JCB362TR, and the parental strain, JCB387, to SNAP and SNOG during both aerobic and anaerobic growth. Under both conditions, the mutant strains were far more sensitive than the parent to SNAP (Fig.4, only anaerobically incubated plates are shown). The ability of NrfA to protect the parental strain even on aerobically incubated plates indicated that at least parts of the bacterial colonies were sufficiently oxygen-depleted to allow Nrf activity to be expressed. This was confirmed by showing that bacteria scraped from these plates could catalyze nitrite reduction by methyl viologen. No zones of growth inhibition by SNOG were observed for any of the strains. This is consistent with a recent report that E. coli can metabolize and hence detoxify SNOG (30Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). NO⋅ can bind to metal centers in respiratory enzymes, including oxidases, resulting in inhibition (12Hausladen A. Gow A. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10108-10112Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,31Butler C.S. Seward H.E. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16259-16266Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The effect of NO⋅ on oxygen utilization was investigated by adding NO⋅ to cell suspensions respiring oxygen monitored by a Clarke-type electrode. All three strains respired oxygen at similar rates (120 nmol of O2 min−1· mg dry wt−1) (Fig. 5). Previous studies of NO⋅ inhibition of oxygen respiration have demonstrated that sensitivity is highest at low oxygen concentrations (12Hausladen A. Gow A. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10108-10112Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus in the present experiments care was made to compare the effect of NO⋅ on oxygen respiration in JCB387, JCB352TR, and JCB362TR at similar oxygen concentrations, around 150–175 nmol ml−1 O2(63–74% air saturation). Addition of 30 nmol ml−1NO⋅ to the JCB387 strain did not inhibit oxygen uptake (Fig. 5). However, the same quantity of NO⋅ added to either of the Nrf− strains, JCB352TR or JCB362TR, strongly attenuated NO⋅ reduction (Fig.5). Addition of NO⋅ over the range of 30 nmol ml−1to 100 nmol ml−1 established that the period of inhibition was proportional to the amount of NO⋅ added (not shown). At concentrations greater than 100 nmol ml−1, NO⋅reversible inhibition of oxygen uptake by JCB387 was also observed, but the experiment clearly shows that oxygen respiration is more sensitive to NO⋅ addition in JCB352TR or JCB362TRthan in JCB387. Many enteric bacteria will encounter nitric oxide when living within a host or living outside a host. For example, enteric bacteria present in soils, sediments, and water systems will encounter NO⋅ generated by denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria. Enteric bacteria in the gut will encounter NO⋅ generated by denitrifying bacteria from gut nitrates. Pathogenic enteric bacteria infecting mammalian cells will encounter NO⋅ produced by the oxidation ofl-arginine by the nitric-oxide synthase. Genome analysis of many enteric bacteria has revealed the presence of a nrfAhomologue (17Potter L. Angove H. Richardson D. Cole J. Adv. Microb.

The present study has raised the possibility that NrfA could play a role in protecting bacteria against the lethal effects of NO⋅. nrfA expression is highest following exposure to anaerobic environments (18Darwin A. Hussain H. Griffiths L. Grove J. Sambongi Y. Busby S. Cole J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Stewart V. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3259-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and so it is likely that active NrfA will be present following passage through the gut where the organism will also be exposed to NO⋅. Furthermore, the oxygen electrode experiments of this study have shown that expression of nrffollowing anaerobic growth still allows protection of oxygen respiration in oxic environments. Thus if bacteria phagocytosed by macrophages have active NrfA, this could consume NO⋅ produced by nitric-oxide synthase and thereby minimize the formation of reactive nitrogen species. In the case of E. coli, other significant mechanisms of NO⋅ resistance have been reported, namely the aerobic and anaerobic reactions of flavohemoglobin (9Poole R.K. Hughes M.N. Mol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, recent research has also revealed the presence of an important inducible system involved in the reduction and detoxification of NO⋅ inE. coli (15Gardner A.M. Helmick R.A. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8172-8177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 16Gardner A.M. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8166-8171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The system includes a transcription regulator controlling anaerobic NO⋅ reduction, a flavorubredoxin with an NO⋅-binding non-heme diiron center, and a NADH:flavorubredoxin oxidoreductase. The NO⋅ reductase activity of the flavorubredoxin efficiently removes NO⋅ in anaerobicE. coli. However, it is probable that many bacteria have multiple means for detoxifying NO⋅ in their environment, and those different mechanisms, rather than being functionally redundant, will be important in different environments. The Nrf system is particularly well suited to NO⋅ removal, because it is located in the periplasm and so can detoxify NO⋅ before it enters the cell. Also, the electron transfer step from quinol to NrfA is not thought to be coupled to the generation of a protonmotive force, and so the physiological turnover of NO⋅ will not be subject to respiratory control at the quinol-dehydrogenase step. To prevent complications in studying the contribution that Nrf can make to NO⋅ metabolism, we chose to use a mutant strain of E. coli deleted in the nirgene cluster that encodes a cytoplasmic siroheme nitrite reductase (32Harborne N.R. Griffiths L. Busby S.J. Cole J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2805-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This enzyme also reduces nitrite to ammonium and is switched on under anaerobic or micro-oxic conditions (20Rabin R.S. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3259-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It will now be intriguing both to assess whether Nir can also make a contribution to anoxic cytoplasmic NO⋅ metabolism and to extend the studies of the contribution nitrite reductases make to NO⋅ metabolism in other pathogenic bacteria that have nrf genes, which includeS. typhimurium and Campylobacter jejuni(17Potter L.

Here we investigate the voltage-dependent block of wild-type and mutant human ether-a-go-go related gene (HERG) K+ channels by the antimalarial compound chloroquine.

Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Mutation of HERG is a common cause of inherited long QT syndrome, a disorder of cardiac repolarization that predisposes affected individuals to torsade de pointes arrhythmia and sudden death (4Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). Acquired long QT syndrome is far more common than inherited long QT syndrome and is most often caused by block of HERG channels as a side effect of treatment with commonly used medications including antiarrhythmic, antihistamine, antibiotic, and psychoactive agents (5El-Sherif N. Caref E.B. Yin H. Restivo M. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 474-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar,6Roden D.M. Am. J. Cardiol. 1998; 82: 49I-57IAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although rare, treatment with the antimalarial drug chloroquine has also been associated with acquired arrhythmias. Prolonged therapy with chloroquine can lead to electrocardiographic changes including T-wave depression or inversion and prolonged QRS and QT intervals (7Sanghvi L. Mathur B.B. Circulation. 1965; 32: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Bustos M. Gay F. Diquet B. Thomare P. Warot D. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1994; 45: 83-86PubMed Google Scholar). Prolonged QT intervals caused by chloroquine can induce torsade de pointes (9Harris L. Downar E. Shaikh N.A. Chen T. Can. J. Cardiol. 1988; 4: 295-300PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fauchier J. Fauchier L. Babuty D. Cosnay P. Rouesnel P. Arch. Mal. Coeur Vaiss. 1993; 86: 757-767PubMed Google Scholar). At the cellular level, chloroquine decreases the maximum upstroke velocity due to block of sodium current and prolongs the duration of action potentials due to block of inward rectifier current (IK1) and IKr (11Sanchez-Chapula J.A. Salinas-Stefanon E. Torres-Jacome J. Benavides-Haro D.E. Navarro-Polanco R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 437-445PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of HERG channel block by chloroquine and other drugs may enable the rational design of new pharmaceuticals devoid of this unwanted side effect. The structural basis of HERG channel block by several potent drugs was recently investigated using alanine-scanning mutagenesis (12Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Mutation of several amino acid residues of the HERG channel reduced the block of HERG current by several chemically unrelated compounds. These key residues were located on the S6 domain or near the pore helix, and homology modeling predicted that they faced the central cavity of the channel. Binding to two residues in particular (Tyr-652 and Phe-656) was proposed to be the most important determinants of the binding site. A critical role for Phe-656 had been proposed previously (13Lees-Miller J.P. Duan Y. Teng G.Q. Duff H.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 367-374PubMed Google Scholar) for binding of the antiarrhythmic agent dofetilide and quinidine. Most HERG channel blockers that have been studied in detail (e.g.MK-499, dofetilide, and cisapride) are high affinity ligands and exhibit little or no voltage-dependent block. In contrast, blockade of HERG channels by low affinity ligands (e.g.chloroquine, quinidine) is characterized by significant voltage-dependent kinetics and steady state effects (11Sanchez-Chapula J.A. Salinas-Stefanon E. Torres-Jacome J. Benavides-Haro D.E. Navarro-Polanco R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 437-445PubMed Google Scholar). Two models have been proposed to explain voltage-dependent block of ion channels by drugs (14Hondeghem L.M. Katzung B.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1984; 24: 387-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The modulated receptor model proposes that the binding affinity (K d ) of a drug varies as a function of channel state. For example, many local anesthetic agents appear to preferentially block sodium channels in the open and/or inactivated state but have little affinity for the closed states that predominate at the resting membrane potential. However, the molecular basis for the apparent state-dependent change in binding affinity is poorly understood. An alternative hypothesis is the guarded receptor model that assumes a constant and state-independentK d but proposes that access to the binding site by charged drugs is prevented (“guarded”) by the activation gate (15Armstrong C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1966; 50: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 16Starmer C.F. Hollett M.D. J. Theor. Biol. 1985; 115: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 17Starmer C.F. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we characterize the block by chloroquine of WT and mutant HERG channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Our results suggest a molecular explanation for voltage-dependent block of HERG channels by chloroquine that further implicates the importance of the aromatic residues located on the S6 domains. We propose that block of HERG by chloroquine requires channel opening and sequential interaction with two aromatic residues (Phe-656 and Tyr-652) that face the central cavity of the HERG channel. This model incorporates features of both the guarded receptor and the modulated receptor hypotheses to describe the voltage-dependent block of HERG channels by chloroquine. Several HERG channel mutants (V625A, Y652A, and F656A) were chosen for study based on our previous finding (12Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) that these mutations decreased the potency of channel block by MK-499. These and additional (Y652F, Y652T, and Y652E) missense mutations were introduced into WT HERG cDNA by the megaprimer method (18Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (12Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pSP64 plasmid expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Before use in experiments, each construct was confirmed with restriction mapping and DNA sequencing of the PCR-amplified segment. G628C/S631C HERG was kindly provided by G.-Y. Tseng. Complementary RNAs for injection into oocytes were prepared with SP6 Cap-Scribe (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following linearization of the expression construct withEcoRI. Isolation and maintenance ofXenopus oocytes and cRNA injections were performed as described (19Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) and standard two microelectrode voltage clamp techniques (20Stuhmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) were used to record currents. Currents were recorded at room temperature (22–24 °C) 2–4 days after cRNA injection. Glass microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl, and their tips were broken to obtain resistances of 0.5 to 1 megohms. The external solution contained 96 mm NaMes, 2 mm KMes, 2 mm CaMes2, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.6 with methanesulfonic acid. Voltage commands were generated using pCLAMP software (version 6; Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Currents were not corrected for leak or endogenous currents, and capacitance transients were not nulled. To generate current-voltage (I-V) relationships, pulses were applied in 10-mV increments at a frequency of 0.05 Hz. Test potentials ranged from −70 to +40 mV and were applied from a holding potential of −80 mV. Deactivating (tail) currents were measured at −70 mV. The time-dependent block of current was determined by dividing current recorded during a 4-s pulse in the presence of drug (Idrug) by the current recorded before application of drug (Icontrol). The resulting ratio, Idrug/Icontrol, was fit with a single exponential function to obtain the time constant for the onset of HERG current blockade. Currents measured at the end of 4-s test pulses were used to measure steady state fractional block (“fraction blocked”), defined as the amplitude of current reduced by drug divided by control current amplitude. Chloroquine (Sigma) was dissolved in the external solution to obtain the desired drug concentrations. Oocytes were exposed to chloroquine solutions until steady state effects were achieved, usually in about 15 min. To determine the concentration-effect relationships, a single oocyte was exposed to cumulative concentrations of chloroquine. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Clampfit software (Axon Instruments) was used to perform nonlinear least squares kinetic analyses of time-dependent currents. The fractional block of current (y) was plotted as a function of drug concentration ([D]), and the data were fit with Hill Equation 1 to determine the concentration (IC50) required for 50% block of current magnitude and the Hill coefficient, h. y=[D]h/([D]h+IC50h)Equation 1 Statistical comparisons between experimental groups were performed using analysis of variance and Dunnett's method. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. The 1BL8 KcsA structure (21Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar) was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank and used as the template for an HERG homology model. Based on a BLAST search of protein crystal structures, the HERG channel turret (amino acids 572–609) was modeled after 3PRC (residues Met-10 to Met-45). The S5 domain was modeled using an alignment between the outer helix of KcsA and the putative S5 of HERG. The MOE program (Chemical Computing Group) was used to produce a homology model for the HERG monomer. Energy minimization was performed to eliminate close contacts but not to allow helix unfolding. The tetramer was constructed by copying the derived monomer conformation onto the KcsA tetramer. Low energy conformations of chloroquine were generated and docked using the Flexible Ligands Oriented on Grid procedure (22Miller M.D. Kearsley S.K. Underwood D.J. Sheridan R.P. J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des. 1994; 8: 153-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Currents were elicited by 4-s depolarizing pulses to potentials ranging from −70 to +40 mV. The step currents measured at the end of 4-s pulses and the tail currents measured on return to −70 mV were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by chloroquine (Fig.1, A and B). The I-V relationship for step currents peaked at −20 mV in control and at −30 mV in the presence of chloroquine. Block of step currents was pronounced at more depolarized test potentials (Fig. 1 C), indicating voltage-dependent block. The decrease in tail currents by chloroquine was also voltage-dependent (Fig.1 D), with greater block apparent at more depolarized potentials. For example, 5 μm chloroquine reduced peak tail currents on average by 1% at −50 mV and 36% at +40 mV. The time- and voltage-dependent block of WT HERG current by chloroquine was studied in greater detail using a concentration of 15 μm. Superimposed traces of currents recorded during a 4-s pulse to −50 mV or +10 mV, before and after addition of 15 μm chloroquine, are shown in Fig.2, A and B. Time-dependent block of current during the pulse made the rate of current activation appear faster, whereas delayed recovery from block initiated by repolarization slowed the rate of deactivation (Fig.2, A and B). The slower apparent rate of deactivation has been described for other compounds as a “foot in the door” effect, meaning that drug must first exit the central cavity of the channel before the activation gates (“door”) can close (23Yeh J.Z. Armstrong C.M. Nature. 1978; 273: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The ratio Idrug/Icontrol as a function of time during the pulse was used to estimate initial block and the onset rate of block (Fig. 2, C and D). The current ratio had an initial value of 1.0, indicating that channels completely recovered from block during the 16-s interval between test depolarizations. The time constants (τ) for the onset rate of block were voltage-dependent (17 ± 3 mV fore-fold change in τ, where e = 2.71828), decreasing with membrane depolarization from 420 ms at −50 mV to 140 ms at +40 mV (Fig. 2 E). Because the onset of block was relatively fast, steady state reduction of current by 15 μm chloroquine was adequately estimated using a 4-s pulse. Steady state fractional block of current varied as a function of test potential, decreasing from 0.18 at −50 mV to >0.7 at potentials positive to 0 mV (Fig. 2 F). These findings demonstrate that 15 μm chloroquine blocks open, but not closed, WT HERG channels and that steady state block was increased as a positive function of membrane potential. The hypothesis that chloroquine might preferentially bind to inactivated channels was tested with G628C/S631C HERG, a mutant channel that does not inactivate (24Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). G628C/S631C current was reduced by chloroquine in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3, A and B). Similar to WT HERG, the block of current conducted by mutant channels was increased as a positive function of voltage (Fig. 3 C). The IC50 for current block at +20 mV was 27.2 ± 2.7 μm (Fig. 3 D), 4-fold less sensitive than WT channels (p < 0.05). These findings indicate that although removal of inactivation reduced the steady state block of HERG, it did not affect the voltage dependence of block. Several residues located on the S6 and pore helix domains of HERG compose the putative binding site for methanesulfonanilide drugs such as MK-499 (IC50 = 34 nm). Mutation of Val-625 of the pore helix or Tyr-652 or Phe-656 of the S6 domain to Ala caused the most profound reductions in potency for block of HERG current by MK-499 (12Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Chloroquine is a weak blocker of HERG, so it was possible that the putative binding sites for this drug would differ from those determined previously for the high affinity ligand MK-499 (12Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the concentration-effect relationship for chloroquine on V625A, Y652A, and F656A HERG channels and compared the potency for block to WT channel current. For this measurement, current was measured at the end of a 4-s pulse to 0 mV for WT, V625A, and Y652A HERG channels. The reduction of current caused by exposure to 50 μm chloroquine was nearly identical for WT and V625A HERG channels (Fig. 4, A andB). Because the V625A mutation reduces K+selectivity of the HERG channel, the tail currents were inward at −70 mV. Unlike MK-499, where the V625A mutation reduced potency by 54-fold (12Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), this mutation did not alter the potency of channel block by chloroquine. The IC50 values were 8.4 ± 0.9 μm for WT and 7.2 ± 0.8 μm for V625A HERG (Fig. 4 C). Similar to our previous findings with MK-499, mutation of aromatic residues located in the S6 domain greatly reduced chloroquine potency. The IC50 for block of Y652A HERG was increased ∼500-fold relative to WT HERG (Fig. 4 C). To increase the amplitude of poorly expressing F656A mutant channels, tail currents were recorded at −140 mV instead of −70 mV (Fig. 4, D and E). By using this protocol, the IC50 for WT current was increased to 19.7 ± 1.7 μm. Block of F656A HERG was minimal at 0.5 mm, indicating a decrease in potency of nearly 3 orders of magnitude compared with WT HERG (Fig. 4 F;p < 0.01). These findings suggest that chloroquine blocks WT channels by interaction with Tyr-652 and Phe-656 residues located in the S6 domain, but it does not interact with Val-625 located at the base of the pore helix. The block of Y652A HERG channels was more prominent for weak than for strong membrane depolarization, a pattern opposite to that observed for WT current. Voltage-dependent block is obvious in the superimposed current traces of Fig.5, A and B, where 150 μm drug reduced steady state current by about 35% at a test potential of −30 mV but reduced current by only 5% at +20 mV. Furthermore, the apparent rate of Y652A HERG tail current deactivation was much faster in the presence of drug (Fig. 5, A andB), as opposed to the slowed deactivation associated with block of WT current (Fig. 2). The ratio Idrug/Icontrol during 4-s test pulses to −30 or +20 mV is plotted in Fig. 5, C and D. The current ratio had an initial value of 1, indicating that block occurred only after channels had opened. The time course of the current ratio was biphasic, with an initial rapid phase of block followed by a slower partial recovery from block. The time constants for the onset and recovery from block were strongly voltage-dependent and decreased at more depolarized potentials (Fig. 5 E). The voltage dependence for block onset (16 ± 3 mV/e-fold change in τ) was almost the same as measured for WT HERG. Steady state block of Y652A HERG, expressed as fractional block, was also voltage-dependent and varied from 0.7 at −50 mV to 0 at +40 mV (Fig. 5 F). These findings demonstrate that chloroquine blocked Y652A channels only after opening of the activation gate and that block decreases with increasing membrane depolarization. The increased rate of deactivation (Fig. 5,A and B) was likely caused by rapid re-block of mutant channels by drug in response to repolarization to −70 mV. In support of this interpretation, the rate of Y652A HERG deactivation was strongly dependent on chloroquine concentration (Fig. 5, Gand H). Chloroquine had qualitatively similar effects on Y652T and Y652E HERG channels (Fig. 6). The IC50measured at 0 mV was increased 500-fold for both mutant channels compared with WT channels. Fractional block by 150 μmchloroquine varied as a function of test potential, diminishing from 0.68 ± 0.04 at −30 mV to 0.01 ± 0.01 at +40 mV for Y652T HERG (n = 4), and from 0.72 ± 0.03 at −30 mV to 0.17 ± 0.03 to +40 mV for Y652E HERG (n = 5). Unblock of current observed with increasing depolarization suggests that the drug dissociates from a receptor site and either enters the cytosol or moves into a position within the central cavity that does not block K+ conduction. The results presented below suggest the second explanation is more likely. We next determined the effect of a more conserved amino acid substitution of Tyr-652. Phenylalanine only differs from tyrosine by the absence of an −OH. We had shown previously (12 that mutation of Tyr-652 to Phe had no significant effect on channel block by MK-499. In contrast to MK-499, the Y652F mutation reduced the potency of chloroquine by more than 10-fold. More surprising, however, was the finding that block of Y652F HERG current was nearly voltage-independent. Block was nearly the same when currents were elicited with a pulse to −50 or +10 mV, and the apparent rate of deactivation was only slightly faster in the presence of drug (Fig.7, A and B). Similar to WT and Y652A HERG channels, block of Y652F channels only occurred after the channels were opened (as indicated by the initial Idrug/Icontrol ratio of 1, Fig. 7, Cand D), and the rate of block onset was faster at more depolarized potentials (16 ± 3 mV/e-fold change in τ; Fig. 7 E). Steady state fractional block of Y652F channels was voltage-independent at potentials below 0 mV and only weakly voltage-dependent at potentials above +10 mV (Fig.7 F). These findings suggest an essential role for the −OH group of Tyr-652 in the voltage-dependent block of WT HERG by chloroquine. Block of HERG K+channels by chloroquine exhibits several features typical of an open channel blocker. First, there was no block of initial current in response to a depolarizing pulse, consistent with a lack of interaction with channels in the closed state. Second, the extent and rate of onset of block was voltage-dependent, increasing at more depolarized potentials. Third, slowed deactivation and tail current crossover in the presence of chloroquine suggested that when drug was bound to the channel it prevented closure of the activation gate. This is similar to the so-called foot in the door mechanism first hypothesized by Armstrong (23Yeh J.Z. Armstrong C.M. Nature. 1978; 273: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) to describe the kinetics of unblock of squid axon K+ channels by tetraethylammonium derivatives (25Armstrong C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 58: 413-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The inactivation-deficient mutant channel, G628C/S631C HERG, was about 4 times less sensitive to block by chloroquine. It is likely that the charged form of chloroquine is responsible for channel block because the alkylammoniums (N 2 and N 3 in Fig.8 C, inset) have pK a values of 8.4 and 10.8, respectively. The drug would be >99% charged at normal intracellular pH. Thus, the positively charged form of chloroquine preferentially blocks open HERG channels by a foot in the door mechanism, and block is enhanced by, but not dependent on, inactivation. Chloroquine blocked HERG current with a potency similar to that of quinidine (13Lees-Miller J.P. Duan Y. Teng G.Q. Duff H.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 367-374PubMed Google Scholar, 26Furukawa T.

All these compounds exhibit increased block with increasing membrane depolarization, and channels fully recover from block in less than a minute at a holding potential of −80 mV. In contrast, methanesulfonanilide drugs such as MK-499 and dofetilide are high affinity ligands with IC50 values in the 10–100 nm range and do not exhibit such obvious voltage-dependent block of current (32Snyders D.J. Chaudhary A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 949-955PubMed Google Scholar, 33Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Moreover, the recovery from block of HERG channels by methanesulfonanilides is extremely slow and incomplete (33Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 34Carmeliet E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 262: 809-817PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these kinetic differences, the amino acids that compose the binding site for low and high affinity blockers appear to be similar. The most important residue appears to be Phe-656 that is located in the S6 domain and faces the central cavity of the HERG channel pore. Mutation of Phe-656 to Val reduced the IC50 for block of HERG by 120-fold for dofetilide and 27-fold for quinidine (13Lees-Miller J.P. Duan Y. Teng G.Q. Duff H.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 367-374PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of Phe-656 to Ala caused a similar shift in the IC50 for cisapride (30-fold) and terfenadine (100-fold) but a much greater shift in the IC50 for MK-499 (650-fold) (12Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) and chloroquine (>500-fold, this study). Together these findings suggest that binding to Phe-656 is a crucial and perhaps first step in block of HERG by both low and high affinity ligands. This could occur by interaction of a positively charged amine (N2 or N3) of chloroquine with the negative electrostatic potential provided by the face of a Phe-656 residue. Such cation-π interactions (35Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar, 36Mecozzi S. West A.P., Jr. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10566-10571Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) have been shown to be important in other ligand-binding sites such as the acetylcholine receptor (37Zhong W. Gallivan J.P. Zhang Y., Li, L. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12088-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Tyr-652 is located one helical turn above Phe-656 in the S6 domain and also faces the central cavity of the channel pore. We found that mutation of Tyr-652 to Ala, Thr, or Glu increased the IC50for block by chloroquine of HERG by >500-fold. In a previous study (12Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) we also found that mutation of Val-625 to Ala, located at the base of the pore helix and adjacent to the K+ selectivity filter, reduced the potency of MK-499 but not cisapride or terfenadine. Chloroquine is more like these latter two drugs with respect to lack of interaction with Val-625. Thus, our findings with chloroquine provide further evidence that HERG channel blockers, despite significant structural diversity, interact principally with one or more aromatic residues of the S6 domain. Substitution of Tyr-652 with Ala or Phe only slightly altered the gating properties of HERG channels but markedly influenced voltage-dependent block. Block of WT HERG current by chloroquine was enhanced by progressive depolarization. In contrast, block of Y652A HERG current was diminished by increased depolarization, whereas block of Y652F current was relatively insensitive to voltage. Thus, substitution of a phenyl with a benzyl moiety (Y652F) eliminated the voltage dependence of HERG block, whereas removal of the aromatic group reversed the voltage dependence of block. Considering the evident importance of the −OH, we determined the effect of chloroquine on Y652T and Y652E HERG channels. Both mutations reduced the potency and reversed the voltage dependence of block by chloroquine similar to Y652A HERG. Thus, the voltage-dependent block of WT HERG cannot be explained by H-bonding of the drug with a −OH or −COOH group of non-aromatic amino acids. A possible explanation for the critical role of Tyr-652, but not simply an −OH group in voltage-dependent block of HERG, might be the cation-π interaction discussed above for Phe-656. Cation-π interactions are stronger for Tyr than Phe residues (35Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar), perhaps because the phenolic −OH assists in positioning the face of the aromatic ring in a preferred orientation for interaction with the cation (N2or N3 of chloroquine). Molecular modeling was used to define two energy-minimized dockings for chloroquine inside the central cavity of a homology model of the HERG channel (Fig. 8). It is important to note that 1) other ligand dockings are plausible, 2) the homology model is based on a static KcsA crystal structure, and 3) that the most important S6 residues comprising the putative binding sites (Tyr-652 and Phe-656) likely change orientation in response to channel gating. Despite these obvious limitations, the dockings illustrated in Fig. 8 provide a framework for the discussion of a model that we base primarily on experimental findings. As shown in Fig. 2 F, chloroquine blocks with relatively low potency to WT HERG channels in response to a weak depolarization from a holding potential of −80 mV. Low potency could result from an initial docking involving a cation-π interaction, followed by π-stacking of the quinoline of chloroquine between Phe-656 residues from multiple subunits as depicted in docking 1 (Fig. 8 B). The requirement for initial drug docking with Phe-656 could explain why the voltage dependence for the onset of channel block was nearly the same (∼17 mV/e-fold change in τ) regardless if the fractional block was a positive (WT), negative (Y652A, Y652E, Y652T), or independent (Y652F) function of transmembrane voltage. If docking to Phe-656 was prevented, for example by mutation of the residue to Ala, then channel block would be expected to be drastically reduced, as was observed (Fig. 4 F). Increased block of WT HERG in response to greater membrane depolarization could be explained by an enhanced occupancy of drug with a distinct higher affinity site. Based on our experimental findings with Tyr-652 mutant HERG channels, we propose that interaction with Tyr-652 mediates higher affinity binding, perhaps as shown for docking 2 depicted in Fig. 8 D. Although not explicitly predicted by this docking, our experimental findings further suggest that N3 may bind with Tyr-652 by a cation-π interaction. Decreased interaction of the drug molecule with multiple Phe-656 residues (docking 1) and enhanced interaction with Tyr-652 residues could be facilitated by an electrostatic effect on the positively charged drug as the membrane potential is progressively depolarized. Mutation of Tyr-652 to Ala would be expected to eliminate the higher affinity site, but depolarization might still provide an electrostatic effect that could cause movement of the charged drug further into the central cavity, away from the Phe-656 residues. Consistent with this interpretation, complete relief of Y652A and Y652T HERG channel block was observed in response to strong membrane depolarization (Figs. 5 F and 6 F). Blockade of Y652F HERG channels was relatively insensitive to transmembrane voltage. Perhaps mutation of Tyr-652 to Phe reduced the affinity of the depolarization-favored drug-binding site to a value similar to the affinity defined by interaction with multiple Phe-656 residues. In the absence of the Tyr −OH group, the interaction between drug and Phe-652 might be similar to the interaction that stabilizes binding of drug to Phe-656. Two sites with similar binding affinities could account for the lack of voltage-dependent block. Chloroquine slowed the apparent rate of WT HERG current deactivation but increased the rate of Tyr-652 mutant HERG current deactivation. Slowed deactivation and crossover of the tail currents of WT HERG channels are consistent with a foot in the door mechanism, where it is assumed that channels cannot close until the drug unbinds from the channel. The increase in the apparent rate of deactivation of Tyr-652 mutant HERG channels in the presence of drug is consistent with re-binding of drug to Phe-656 residues located lower in the cavity that would be favored upon membrane repolarization. In the case of Y652A channels, re-block presumably occurs by a drug molecule that is present in the central cavity but not bound to the S6 domain. The block of Y652A HERG channels by chloroquine was completely reversed by strong depolarization. This was a surprising result because an increase in membrane depolarization should favor movement of a positively charged drug further into the central cavity and either result in no change in block or perhaps an increased block as was observed for WT channels. Moreover, a single hydrated K+ ion located in the middle of the central cavity and coordinated by the pore helices is evidently vital for ion conduction in KcsA and presumably voltage-gated K+ channels (21Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5732) Google Scholar, 38Roux B. MacKinnon R. Science. 1999; 285: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and binding of the N-terminal inactivation peptide to S6 residues that line the channel pore induces inactivation (39Zhou M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 411: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). It may seem unexpected that Y652A HERG channels would conduct K+ ions normally if chloroquine was present within the central cavity. However, there is a precedent for such an effect in the L-type Ca2+ channel. Dihydropyridine antagonists block current conducted by α1cCa2+ channels by binding to several S6 residues that face the central cavity (40Peterson B.Z. Johnson B.D. Hockerman G.H. Acheson M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18752-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Dihydropyridine agonists interact with some of the same residues, yet cause an increase in Ca2+ channel conductance (41Hockerman G.H. Peterson B.Z. Sharp E. Tanada T.N. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14906-14911Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). There are at least two alternative explanations for the reverse voltage dependence of Y652A HERG channel block. For example, chloroquine might bind to a low affinity site located on the extracellular side of the channel pore and be increasingly knocked off by outward flux of K+ as the membrane potential was progressively depolarized. Alternatively, a strong depolarization could cause rotation of S6 and a reduction in binding affinity, allowing drug to diffuse back into the cytoplasm. This seems unlikely because the positive transmembrane potential would not favor the diffusion of a positively charged drug into the cytoplasm. Moreover, neither of these alternative mechanisms is compatible with the finding that block of Y652F by chloroquine was voltage-independent. In summary, we propose that depolarization-dependent HERG channel block by chloroquine is a multistep process that involves sequential binding of a drug molecule to low and high affinity sites that are accessible only when the channel is in the open state. Repolarization of the membrane promotes recovery from block, but channels can only close after drug has unbound from Tyr-652. This model incorporates features of both the guarded receptor hypothesis (requirement for channel opening) and the modulated receptor hypotheses (binding affinity that varies with voltage) to describe the voltage-dependent block of HERG channels by chloroquine.

https://openalex.org/W1971147345,"Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk/MAPK) is a critical signal transduction event for estrogen (E2)-mediated cell proliferation. Recent studies from our group and others have shown that persistent activation of Erk plays a major role in cell migration and tumor progression. The signaling mechanism(s) responsible for persistent Erk activation are not fully characterized, however. In this study, we have shown that E2 induces a slow but persistent activation of Erk in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. The E2-induced Erk activation is dependent on new protein synthesis, suggesting that E2-induced growth factors play a major role in Erk activation. When MCF-7 cells were treated with E2 in the presence of an anti-HER-2 monoclonal antibody (herceptin), 60–70% of E2-induced Erk activation is blocked. In addition, when untreated MCF-7 cells were exposed to conditioned medium from E2-treated cells, Erk activity was significantly enhanced. Furthermore Erk activity was blocked by an antibody against HER-2 or by heregulin (HRG) depletion from the conditioned medium through immunoprecipitation. In contrast, epidermal growth factor receptor (Ab528) antibody only blocked 10–20% of E2-induced Erk activation, suggesting that E2-induced Erk activation is predominantly mediated through the secretion of HRG and activation of HER-2 by an autoctine/paracrine mechanism. Inhibition of PKC-δ-mediated signaling by a dominant negative mutant or the relatively specific PKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin blocked most of the E2-induced Erk activation but had no effect on TGFα-induced Erk activation. By contrast inhibition of Ras, by inhibition of farnesyl transferase (Ftase-1) or dominant negative (N17)-Ras, significantly inhibited both E2- and TGFα-induced Erk activation. This evaluation of downstream signaling revealed that E2-induced Erk activation is mediated by a HRG/HER-2/PKC-δ/Ras pathway that could be crucial for E2-dependent growth-promoting effects in early stages of tumor progression.

In addition to steroid hormones, a host of polypeptide growth factors may also play an important role in the growth regulation of breast cancer by autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine mechanism(s) (6Reddy K.B.

Several groups, including ours, have confirmed that estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells synthesize and secrete growth factors in response to estrogen stimulation and that estrogen-independent breast cells secrete these growth factors constitutively (11Lippman M.E.

Because breast cancer cells have membrane receptors for several of the growth factors they secrete, it has been proposed that secreted growth factors produced by the cells can bind to receptors on the surface and activate Erk/MAPK by autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms (6Reddy K.B.

These pathways are initiated from various cell surface receptors, and may converge on the MAPK cascade, a module consisting of MAP kinase kinase (MEK) and MAPK (14Gomez N. Cohen P. Nature. 1991; 353: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 15Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Action of the MAPK cascade appears to be necessary for cell growth. Growth factor-regulated gene transcription and cell proliferation are blocked in mammalian cells by inhibiting MAPK activity (16Reddy K.B. Krueger J.S. Kondapaka S.B. Diglio C.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) or microinjection of dominantly interfering mutants of MAPK or of antisense RNA complementary to MAPK transcripts (17Frost J.A.

These studies indicate that MEK and MAPK are necessary components of cell growth.Many polypeptide growth factors exert their function by binding to cell surface receptors that have intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity. A large number of receptor tyrosine kinase subclasses have been described, among which the type I/ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases is of particular interest due to their frequent involvement in human cancer. Four members of this family are currently known: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ErbB-1, ErbB-2/HER-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4 (19Gullick W.J. Love S.B. Wright C. Barnes D.M. Gusterson B.

Co-expression of estrogen receptor α and ErbB receptors is commonly detected in normal and breast cancer cells (22Taverna D. Antoniotti S. Maggiora P. Dati C., De Bortoli M. Hynes N.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 56: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Aberrant expression of EGFR has been observed in various human tumors (23Gullick W.J. Br. Med. Bull. 1991; 47: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ErbB-2 in the presence or absence of gene amplification is frequently found in tumors arising at many sites, especially of the breast and ovary, where it correlates with poor patient prognosis (24Hynes N.E.

The PKC family is comprised of at least 12 serine/threonine kinases that participate in signal transduction events in response to specific hormonal and growth factor stimuli (31Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar). Differences in their structure and substrate requirements have permitted classification of the isoforms into three groups: 1) conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), which are Ca2+-dependent and activated by both phosphatidylserine and the second messenger diacylglycerol; 2) novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, and θ), which are Ca2+-independent and regulated by diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine; and 3) atypical PKCs (ζ and ι/λ), which are Ca2+-independent and do not require diacylglycerol for activation although phosphatidylserine regulates activity (32Newton A.C.

Sci. 2000; 21: 181-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The activity of PKC is several times higher in ER-negative breast cancer cell lines than ER-positive cell lines (34Fabbro D. Kung W. Roos W. Regazzi R. Eppenberger U. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2720-2725PubMed Google Scholar). Breast cancer biopsies exhibit higher levels of total PKC activity compared with the surrounding normal tissue (35O'Brian C. Vogel V.G. Singletary S.E. Ward N.E. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3215-3217PubMed Google Scholar). PKC-δ plays a major role in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)-induced Raf-MEK-Erk activation (36Morrison P.

Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we have shown that HER-2 and PKC-δ play a major role in E2-induced Erk activation. The results indicate that E2 activates Erk by an autocrine/paracine mechanism through activation of a HER-2/PKC-δ/Ras signaling pathway. In contrast, TGFα activates Erk by stimulating an EGFR/Ras pathway. These findings indicate that HER-2 and PKC-δ play a major role in estrogen-mediated signaling leading to Erk activation and cell proliferation.DISCUSSIONNormal mammary development and breast cancer growth are under the influence of steroid hormones, particularly E2. Despite accumulating evidence showing that the ER plays a central role in cell proliferation (25Pietras R.J. Arboleda J. Reese D.M. Wongvipat N. Pegram M.D. Ramos L. Gorman C.M. Parker M.G.

Commun. 1987; 146: 1502-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the signaling mechanisms responsible for Erk activation by E2 are not fully characterized. The current model is that E2 diffuses freely into the cytoplasm and enters the nucleus by passive diffusion (63Guiochon-Mantel A. Delabre K. Lescop P. Milgrom E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 56: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Upon activation by hormone binding, the ER interacts specifically with a cis-acting DNA sequence called the estrogen response element, which further facilitates the direct interaction of receptor dimers with promoter regions of target genes to enhance the synthesis and production of growth factors and other proteins (6Reddy K.B. Yee D. Hilsenbeck S.G. Coffey R.J. Osborne C.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1275-1282PubMed Google Scholar, 64Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Consistent with this classical dogma of steroid hormone action, we have shown that when MCF-7 cells were exposed to E2, it leads to slow (after 2 h of E2 exposure) but sustained activation of Erk up to 24 h. In addition to receptor-mediated (genomic) estrogenic effects, which take place starting ∼1–6 h following hormone treatment, some effects of E2 occur within seconds to minutes after E2 administration to cultured cells and are thought to be mediated, at least in part, by non-genomic ER (65Song R.X.

Metab. 2001; 12: 152-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). A non-genomic estrogenic effect in our study was discounted because of the delayed Erk activation in response to E2-stimuation of MCF-7 cells. In addition BSA-conjugated estrogen, which prevents E2 from entering the cell, was unable to activate estrogen response element-Luc reporter activity (data not shown). Furthermore, we have shown that E2-induced Erk activation can be blocked by antiestrogen (ICI 182,780) and an inhibitor of new protein synthesis, CHX.Erk activation in response to growth factors such as EGF and platelet-derived growth factor classically proceeds via a Ras-mediated cascade that involves Raf-1, MEK, and MAPK/Erk activation (16Reddy K.B. Krueger J.S. Kondapaka S.B. Diglio C.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 54Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6071-6076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown that blockade of HER-2-mediated signaling inhibits E2-induced Erk activation by 60–70%, suggesting that HER-2 mediates most of the E2-induced Erk activation. Removal of HRG from the E2-treated conditioned medium (CM) significantly reduces the ability of CM to induce Erk activation. In addition, we have also shown a significant increase in HER-2 receptor phosphorylation when compared with EGFR phosphorylation in response to E2 stimulation. Although ErbB2/HER-2 has no known ligand, it participates in type I receptor signaling by heterodimerization with ligand-bound members of the ErbB receptor family (67Rusnak D.W. Affleck K. Cockerill S.G. Stubberfield C. Harris R. Page M. Smith K.J. Guntrip S.B. Carter M.C. Shaw R.J. Jowett A. Stables J. Topley P. Wood E.R. Brignola P.S. Kadwell S.H. Reep B.R. Mullin R.J. Alligood K.J. Keith B.R. Crosby R.M. Murray D.M. Knight W.B. Gilmer T.M. Lackey K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7196-7203PubMed Google Scholar). Herceptin, a monoclonal antibody-based therapy targeted to HER-2, is presently approved for breast cancer patients and was shown to increase median survival time in metastatic breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress ErbB-2 (68Treish I. Schwartz R. Lindley C. Am. J. Health Syst. Pharm. 2000; 57: 2063-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The current study shows that normal or low levels of HER-2 play a major role in E2-mediated signaling and Erk activation. The overexpression of HER-2 or HRG in MCF-7 cells leads to a hormone-independent phenotype, however (25Pietras R.J. Arboleda J. Reese D.M. Wongvipat N. Pegram M.D. Ramos L. Gorman C.M. Parker M.G. Sliwkowski M.X. Slamon D.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2435-2446PubMed Google Scholar, 69Tang C.K. Perez C. Grunt T. Waibel C. Cho C. Lupu R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3350-3358PubMed Google Scholar). It was previously shown that while E2 increased TGFα expression in cultured breast cells, blockade of EGFR with a panel of EGFR antibodies failed to inhibit estrogen-induced growth of MCF-7, T47D, or ZR75 cells (7Arteaga C.L. Coronado E. Osborne C.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). One of the reasons that EGFR antibody to block E2 induced cell proliferation may be due to the fact that E2-induced Erk activation and cell proliferation are predominantly mediated through HER-2/neu-dependent signaling.There are some data to show that E2-induces PKC activation, and there are several studies that focus on PKC isoforms and their potential role in Erk activation (30Ueda Y.

There are apparently inconsistent observations about the role of Ras in phorbol ester-induced activation of Erk. For example in PC12 cells and NIH3T3 cells, TPA-induced activation of Erk involves Ras (70Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S.

Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). On the other hand, N17-Ras fails to inhibit TPA-induced Erk activation in Rat 1 cells, COS cells, and 293 cells (74Ming X.F. Burgering B.M. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 75Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J.

Nature. 1992; 357: 602-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It should be noted that these are all observations using TPA or other phorbol esters and not E2-stimulation or direct examination of activated PKC isoforms. In the present study, we have shown that inhibition of PKC-δ can block E2-induced activation of Erk. To determine whether PKC activates Erk through Ras or by directly activating Raf and independently of Ras, we blocked Ras activation by either a dominant negative mutant Ras (N17-Ras) or a farnesyl transferase inhibitor. Both the Ras inhibitors blocked E2–and TGFα-induced Erk activation suggesting that the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway is involved in Erk activation.In this study we have identified PKC-δ as a critical and specific element of E2-dependent activation of Erk. Inhibition of PKC-δ significantly blocked E2-induced Ras and Erk activation, but not TGFα-induced Ras and Erk activation. These data were further confirmed using stably transfected, dominant negative PKC-δ expressing clones of MCF-7 cells (DN-PKC-δ/MCF-7). Our analysis of Ras activation in the presence and absence of PKC inhibitors shows that E2-induced Ras activation is dependent on PKC-δ in MCF-7 cells, suggesting that PKC-δ is upstream of Ras in the E2-induced Erk activation signaling pathway. Interestingly, the DN-PKC-δ/MCF-7 clones also showed a significantly reduced Erk activation in response to HRG stimulation but maintain their TGFα-induced Erk activation. These observations support our hypothesis that E2-induced Erk activation is predominantly mediated by HRG/HER-2/PKC-δ/Ras/Raf/MEK. In contrast TGFα activates Erk more directly through activation of Ras/Raf/MEK signaling (Fig. 9). Ueda et al. (30Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) have demonstrated, using constitutively active mutants of PKC isoforms, that PKC-δ but not PKC-α or PKC-ε activates MEK1 and Erk. These results indicate that activation of PKC-δ is sufficient to activate the MEK-Erk pathway. However, at this time it is not clear if activated PKC-δ will be able to support cell proliferation in the absence of E2 or alter antiestrogenic effects in MCF-7 cells.The interaction between growth factors and estrogen signaling is complex and occurs at multiple levels. Previous work has implicated the estrogen receptor itself as a target for growth factor signaling pathways involving Erk (3Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. et al.Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). Conversely, activation of Erk by estrogen and ER also occurs in various tissues and cell types, although the exact mechanisms remain to be determined (77Migliaccio A., Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 78Endoh H. Sasaki H. Maruyama K. Takeyama K. Waga I. Shimizu T. Kato S. Kawashima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Even though previous studies have shown a strong association of high levels of HER-2 and PKC-δ with hormone-independent aggressive forms of tumor cells, our results show for the first time that HER-2- and PKC-δ-mediated signaling also plays a major role in E2-mediated signaling in hormone-dependent, ER-positive tumor cells. Normal mammary development and breast cancer growth are under the influence of steroid hormones, particularly E2.1 The effects of estrogens are mediated primarily through interaction with the estrogen receptor α leading to cell proliferation (1van der Burg B. van Selm-Miltenburg A.J. de Laat S.W. van Zoelen E.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1989; 64: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 2Dubik D. Dembinski T.C. Shiu R.P. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 6517-6521PubMed Google Scholar). Estrogen receptor α has an NH2-terminal domain with a hormone-independent transcriptional activation function (AF-1) (3Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. et al.Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar), a central DNA binding domain, and a COOH-terminal ligand binding domain with a hormone-dependent transcriptional activation function (AF-2) (4Mangelsdorf D.J.

Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In addition to steroid hormones, a host of polypeptide growth factors may also play an important role in the growth regulation of breast cancer by autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine mechanism(s) (6Reddy K.B. Yee D. Hilsenbeck S.G. Coffey R.J. Osborne C.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1275-1282PubMed Google Scholar, 7Arteaga C.L. Coronado E. Osborne C.K. Mol.

Several groups, including ours, have confirmed that estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells synthesize and secrete growth factors in response to estrogen stimulation and that estrogen-independent breast cells secrete these growth factors constitutively (11Lippman M.E.

Neoplasia. 1997; 2: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because breast cancer cells have membrane receptors for several of the growth factors they secrete, it has been proposed that secreted growth factors produced by the cells can bind to receptors on the surface and activate Erk/MAPK by autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms (6Reddy K.B. Yee D. Hilsenbeck S.G. Coffey R.J. Osborne C.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1275-1282PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Endocr.

Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1997; 2: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cell transformation often results from activation of components in signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and differentiation. These pathways are initiated from various cell surface receptors, and may converge on the MAPK cascade, a module consisting of MAP kinase kinase (MEK) and MAPK (14Gomez N. Cohen P. Nature. 1991; 353: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 15Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Action of the MAPK cascade appears to be necessary for cell growth. Growth factor-regulated gene transcription and cell proliferation are blocked in mammalian cells by inhibiting MAPK activity (16Reddy K.B. Krueger J.S. Kondapaka S.B. Diglio C.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) or microinjection of dominantly interfering mutants of MAPK or of antisense RNA complementary to MAPK transcripts (17Frost J.A.

The antigen-binding fragment of such heavy chain antibodies is therefore comprised in one single domain, the camelid heavy chain antibody VH (VHH). Here we report on the structures of three dromedary VHH domains in complex with porcine pancreatic α-amylase. Two VHHs bound outside the catalytic site and did not inhibit or inhibited only partially the amylase activity. The third one, AMD9, interacted with the active site crevice and was a strong amylase inhibitor (K i = 10 nm). In contrast with complexes of other proteinaceous amylase inhibitors, amylase kept its native structure. The water-accessible surface areas of VHHs covered by amylase ranged between 850 and 1150 Å2, values similar to or even larger than those observed in the complexes between proteins and classical antibodies. These values could certainly be reached because a surprisingly high extent of framework residues are involved in the interactions of VHHs with amylase. The framework residues that participate in the antigen recognition represented 25–40% of the buried surface. The inhibitory interaction of AMD9 involved mainly its complementarity-determining region (CDR) 2 loop, whereas the CDR3 loop was small and certainly did not protrude as it does in cAb-Lys3, a VHH-inhibiting lysozyme. AMD9 inhibited amylase, although it was outside the direct reach of the catalytic residues; therefore it is to be expected that inhibiting VHHs might also be elicited against proteases. These results illustrate the versatility and efficiency of VHH domains as protein binders and enzyme inhibitors and are arguments in favor of their use as drugs against diabetes.

All immunoglobulins are multimers of heterodimeric chains where each heavy (H)1 chain of four or five domains is linked by disulfide bridges to a light (L) chain of two domains (1Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The antigen-binding part of the immunoglobulins is formed invariably by the N-terminal domains of both the H and L chains. These domains display a large sequence variation concentrated in three regions per domain, the CDRs. However, important deviations of this conserved immunoglobulin organization have been observed. In some immunoglobulin isotypes of camelids from the old world (camels and dromedaries) or from the new world (llamas and vicunas) the L chain is missing (2Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S. Robinson G. Hamers C. Songa E.B. Bendahman N. Hamers R. Nature. 1993; 363: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). Furthermore their H chain is devoid of the CH1 domain (3Nguyen V.K. Hamers R. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Woolven B.P. Frenken L.G. van der Logt P. Nicholls P.J. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) due to an unconventional splicing event during the mRNA maturation. The antigen-binding fragment of the heavy chain antibodies is therefore comprised in one single domain, the unique N-terminal variable domain referred to as VHH that replaces a four-domain Fab fragment in the immunoglobulin structure (5Muyldermans S. Atarhouch T. Saldanha J. Barbosa J.A. Hamers R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This VHH domain is obtained after a DNA recombination between dedicated VHH germline gene segments with D and J minigenes. The dromedary VHH germline genes are quite diverse. They can be grouped into seven subfamilies (6Nguyen V.K. Hamers R. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 921-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and contain additional hotspots for mutation that will add to the diversity of the antigen binding repertoire. Moreover the VHH domain often acquires a disulfide bond between its CDR3 and CDR1 or position 45 (5). A considerable interest in the humoral immune system of Camelidae comes from the observation that their heavy chain antibodies and the recombinant VHHs as well contain a much higher proportion of molecules that interact directly with the active site cleft of enzymes (7Lauwereys M.

This cAb-Lys3 inhibitor of chicken egg white lysozyme has a remarkable paratope architecture where part of its long CDR3 protrudes from the remaining antigen-binding site and inserts into the active site of the enzyme, mimicking the lysozyme natural substrate (15Transue T.R., De Genst E.

Here we report the three-dimensional structures of three complexes between porcine pancreatic α-amylase (PPA, Ref. 16Minxie Q. Haser R. Payan F. J. Mol.

These three binders originated from VHH germline genes of three different subfamilies, two for which no structural information is yet available. Crystal structures of complexes between PPA and carbohydrate or proteinaceous inhibitors are known at atomic resolution (17Minxie Q. Haser R. Buisson G. Duée E. Payan F.

We investigated inhibitors that were raised by the humoral immune response in a few weeks time and that possess an enzyme inhibiting potency similar to the natural inhibitors that co-evolved with amylase over many millions of years. Periplasmic expression and immobilized metal affinity chromatography purification of the three PPA binder VHH proteins, in fusion with a C-terminal His6tail, was performed according to Lauwereys et al. (7Lauwereys M. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W., De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The VHH proteins were further purified by gel filtration and mixed with PPA in a 2 to 1 molar ratio, and the complexes were separated from free antibody on Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl. The inhibition of the enzymatic activity of PPA by the various VHHs was tested on 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl maltotrioside or on “blue-starch” (Phadebas, Pharmacia-Upjohn) according to the protocols in Ref. 7Lauwereys M.

All crystals were obtained using the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of reservoir solution. A single crystal of the PPA·AMB7 complex was obtained in 10–15% polyethylene glycol 20,000, 0.1–0.2 m imidazole malate (pH 8.0). A unique monoclinic crystal was obtained that could not be further reproduced (Table I). Triclinic crystals of the PPA·AMD9 complex were obtained in 0.8 m phosphate buffer (NaH2PO4 and K2HPO4) at pH 7.0 (Table I). Triclinic crystals of the PPA·AMD10 complex were produced in 32% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium citrate, 0.2 m ammonium acetate (pH 5.0) (Table I).Table IData collection, structure determination, and refinement summaryAMB7AMD9AMD10Data collection Space groupP21P1P1 Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)52.8 × 286.8 × 66.065.2 × 100.9 × 103.757.6 × 61.0 × 107.3α, β, γ (°)β = 93.779.3, 72.6, 86.181.2, 79.1, 78.9 Complex per asymmetric unit/V m (Å3/Da)3/2.324/2.392/2.19 Resolution range (Å)20.0–2.030.0–1.630.0–1.7 Total/unique number of reflections456,505/78,2823,531,130/383,526716,803/175,069 Completeness (overall/last shell)1-aLast shell: 2.13–2.0Å, 1.75–1.65 Å, 1.8–1.7 Å.51/5099.8/99.599.8/99.5 % I/ςI (overall/last shell)1-aLast shell: 2.13–2.0Å, 1.75–1.65 Å, 1.8–1.7 Å.7.0/5.25.0/1.74.6/2.0 R merge (%) (overall/last shell)1-aLast shell: 2.13–2.0Å, 1.75–1.65 Å, 1.8–1.7 Å.7.0/13.76.4/32.27.4/13.7Refinement Number of protein/solvent/other atoms14,439/1,730/619,296/2,807/89,571/1,380/4 Number of reflections (all)/completeness (%)65,698/50.1317,086/96.8168,160/95.9 R/R free value (%)1-bReflections in the test set (number/%): 1655/2.5, 9426/3, 3337/1.9.20.3/23.619.7/21.920.5/22.9 B-factor (Å2): main chain/side chain/solvent16.3/16.9/28.316.1/16.7/27.216.1/17.9/22.9 Residues in the 4 PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab Data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) at beamline ID14-EH2 for AMB7 and AMD10 on an ADSC-Q4 detector. AMD9 was collected at beamline BM14 with an imaging plate detector. Data were integrated with DENZO (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W., Jr. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. 276.

Collection statistics, presented in Table I, indicate a good quality for the AMD9 and AMD10 complexes, whereas the data are incomplete for AMB7 due to spot overlap. The three structures were solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (22Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). The initial solution for the complex with AMB7 was obtained using native amylase (Ref. 16Minxie Q. Haser R. Payan F. J. Mol.

The three amylases were positioned readily by AMoRE, yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.53 and anR value of 37.6 at 4.0-Å resolution. The VHHs, however, were positioned manually by visual inspection of the difference maps using Turbo-Frodo (23Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. 81. Mountain View, CA1991: 77-78Google Scholar). After rigid body and minimization refinement with CNS (24Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLane W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kustleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

For the AMD9 complex, the same search models were used. The amylase molecules were found by AMoRE, resulting in R andR free values of 36.8 and 39.0%, respectively, at 3.5-Å resolution. The packing consists of a dimer related by a pure 2-fold axis and a translated dimer. The complete model of the four complexes was subjected to a rigid body minimization and B-factor refinement, which lowered R and R freeto values of 33.4 and 35.2%, respectively, at 1.8-Å resolution. For the PPA·AMD10 complex, the VHH search model was cAb-Lys3 (Ref. 8Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Dao Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct.

The two amylase molecules and the two VHH fragments were readily located by AMoRe, leading to a correlation coefficient of 0.56 and anR value of 36.9% at 2.7-Å resolution. The same refinement procedure was used with the three complexes using CNS (24Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLane W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kustleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Panun N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Rounds of minimization/B-factor refinement were alternated with model rebuilding at the display with Turbo-Frodo. The complexes with AMD9 and AMD10 exhibit an excellent geometry and good Rvalues (Table I). In contrast, the complex with AMB7 suffers from data incompleteness and hence exhibits a geometry quality closer to a model at medium resolution. The water-accessible surfaces were calculated with DSSP (25Kabsch W. Sander K. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12333) Google Scholar) implemented in Turbo-Frodo (23Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. 81. Mountain View, CA1991: 77-78Google Scholar). The radius of the water probe used was 1.5 Å. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank at Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (www.rcsb.org/pdb/) as entries 1KXT, 1KXQ, and 1KXV. A dromedary was immunized with PPA, and the antigen binding repertoire of the heavy chain antibodies was cloned in a phage display vector. After three rounds of panning with the antigen we identified several binders (7Lauwereys M. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W., De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) of which three (AMB7, AMD9, and AMD10 VHH) were selected for structural investigation. The sequences revealed that the three binders are derived from germline genes of different subfamilies (Ref. 6Nguyen V.K. Hamers R. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 921-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar and Fig.1 A). The VHH germline gene used to generate the AMB7 VHH binder is a member of subfamily 4b since it has a 16-amino acid-long CDR2 and a Cys (at position 45). Its CDR3 is 19 amino acids long and contains a Cys that could form a disulfide bridge with Cys-45. The AMD9 VHH binder contains 17 amino acids in its CDR2, meaning that the VHH germline used is either of subfamily 2a or 5a. The presence of Phe-37, Gly-47, Ala-49, and Val-78 instead of Tyr, Leu, Ser, and Leu, respectively, suggests that is most likely derived from 2a, the most frequently found subfamily in dromedary. This binder is special in the sense that the CDR1 is shortened by 3 amino acids possibly due to a deletion around the palindromic nucleotide sequence (codons 29–33 in clone cvhhp11). Since the deletion in the CDR1 has removed the Cys and since no Cys occurred in the CDR3 region of 14 amino acids in size, this structure is not stabilized by an interloop disulfide bridge. The VHH germline used for the AMD10 binder is of subfamily 3b because it has the characteristic 16-amino acid-long CDR2 and Cys-30, Tyr-37, and Phe-47. Its CDR3 is short for a VHH (13 amino acids) and contains a Cys. The affinity of the three VHHs for PPA ranged from 3.5 (AMD9) to 235 nm (AMB7) with AMD10 having an intermediate affinity of 25 nm as measured on an IAsys biosensor (Ref. 7Lauwereys M. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W., De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar and TableII). The gel filtration of a stoichiometric mixture of the binders with PPA proved that binding occurred at a 1:1 molar ratio. These binders were also chosen because they inhibit the PPA to different extents. Only AMD9 VHH had the capacity to inhibit the hydrolysis of the small organic 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl maltotrioside substrate (Ref. 7Lauwereys M. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W., De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar and Table II). The hydrolysis of blue-starch, a large water-insoluble cross-linked starch polymer carrying a blue dye, by α-amylase to form water-soluble blue fragments was almost completely blocked by AMD9 VHH, whereas the AMB7 VHH showed a largely retarded solubilization of the chromophore, and AMD10 VHH exhibited only a weak effect (Table II). This suggests that the three VHHs interact at three different epitopes of the PPA and/or utilize different enzyme inhibition modes.Table IISummary of VHH affinities and inhibitory effects on PPA K d 2-aIAsys biosensor assay (7).IC50CNPMT2-bCNPMT, 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl maltotrioside (7).Remaining amylose activity2-cBlue-starch Phadebas amylase test (this work). nm %PPA/AMB7235>mm27PPA/AMD93.510 nm7PPA/AMD1025>mm802-a IAsys biosensor assay (7Lauwereys M.

Open table in a new tab The VHH polypeptidic chains are not complete and are visible in density from residues 2 to 25 and 28 to 111 for AMB7 VHH (123 residues), from 1 to 111 for AMD9 VHH (118 residues), and from 2 to 112 for AMD10 VHH (119 residues) (Kabat numbering, Ref. 30Kabat E., Wu, T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. United States Public Health Services Publication No. 91-3242. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar). The three VHH structures adopt the classical immunoglobulin fold (Fig. 1 B) and do not present important deviations in their frameworks: the root mean square deviation calculated with the 88 framework Cα atoms ranged from 0.61 (AMB7/AMD9) to 0.84 Å (AMB7/AMD10). Indeed most deviations were observed at the CDRs level, but some significant divergences also occurred elsewhere: in the loop adjacent to the CDRs (amino acids 71–78), in the loop at the bottom of the VHHs (amino acids 39–44), and in the segment 102–106 just after the CDR3 in the PPA·AMD10 complex. Besides the classical disulfide bridge formed between Cys-22 and Cys-92, dromedary VHHs frequently possess a second pair of cysteines, one always being located in the CDR3 (5Muyldermans S. Atarhouch T. Saldanha J. Barbosa J.A. Hamers R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and the other one in the CDR1 (5Muyldermans S. Atarhouch T. Saldanha J. Barbosa J.A. Hamers R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), forming a second disulfide bridge (8Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Dao Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 10Desmyter A. Decanniere K. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26285-26290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Two VHHs studied here, AMB7 and AMD10, possess four cysteines in their sequence (Fig.1 A). A second disulfide bridge was observed in AMB7 VHH between the CDR3 cysteine residue 100h and, for the first time, a framework residue (Cys-45). In the case of AMD10 VHH, the second disulfide bridge tethers CDR3 Cys-100c and CDR1 Cys-30. In the latter case, the relatively short CDR3 and the presence of this disulfide bridge may explain the deviation in the framework conformation observed between residues 102–106; in addition, the presence of two prolines (residues 100a and 100d) may also contribute to this effect. The CDRs 1–3 in the VL and 1–2 in the VH domains of immunoglobulins have been shown to adopt a restricted set of conformations depending on their length and amino acid sequence (26Al-Lazikani B. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 927-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In the VHHs of camelids, the set of conformations of CDR1 and CDR2 has been found to extend beyond that observed in classical VHs (27Decanniere K. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The CDRs in the three VHHs are well defined in density except for two residues that were not visible in the CDR1 of AMB7 VHH. The conformation of this CDR1, however, resembles that of canonical type 1. For the two other VHHs (AMD9 and AMD10) the CDR1s did not fit with any CDR1 of known canonical type or with any VHH known structures. In contrast, CDR2 canonical types were readily identified as type 1 for AMB7 and AMD10 VHHs and as type 2 for AMD9 VHH. The CDR3 loops do not resemble the canonical types even if some conformational preferences and classes have been identified (28Morea V. Tramontano A. Rustici M. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 269-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Their lengths of 19, 14, and 13 residues, respectively, in the three VHHs can be considered as average for dromedary VHHs (Fig. 1 A). Amazingly, when looking at the VHH side bearing the CDR3 (Fig.1 B), one CDR3 is going to the left (AMB7), another to the right (AMD9), and the last one upwards (AMD10). Clearly the disulfide bridges may play a role in this conformational dispersion. In the AMB7 VHH, the disulfide bridge pulls the CDR3 in a zone never observed in any of the other camelid VHHs. Proline 96 twists the CDR3 chain toward the solvent. It adopts an antiparallel two-stranded β-sheet structure (β-hairpin) between residues 99 and its end at residue 100k (Fig.1 B). A proline at this position redirects the chain close to the protein core with a classical framework conformation. The AMD9 CDR3 covers the VH/VL interface as shown in other VHH studies and does not present any special features. In the AMD10 VHH, the disulfide bridge between CDR1 and the short CDR3 maintains the loops close together and makes it possible for the CDR3 to protrude as observed in the anti-lysozyme VHH (8Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Dao Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In the three complexes, the complete PPA polypeptidic chain was visible in the electron density map. The structures of the PPA complexes with AMB7, AMD9, and AMD10 VHHs contained three, four, and two PPA·VHH complexes in their asymmetric unit, respectively. When the PPA·VHH complexes contained in the asymmetric unit from the same crystal form were superimposed, very low root mean square deviation on the Cα atoms were observed (below 0.3 Å in all cases). Superimposing the PPAs belonging to the three different complexes yielded surprisingly low root mean square deviation values below 0.5 Å for all atoms. Superposition of the three complexes using the PPA coordinates indicates clearly the different location of the VHHs at the PPA surface (Fig.2). The AMD9 VHH interacts directly with the active site region of PPA and blocks the entrance of the V-shaped crevice. AMB7 VHH binds PPA at one end of the elongated active site crevice but far from the catalytic residues (Fig. 2). In contrast, AMD10 VHH binds PPA far from the catalytic crevice (Fig. 2). Calculations of water-accessible surfaces have been used to evaluate the contacts of each VHH with its PPA partner. In TableIII, the surface areas of the VHH shielded from the solvent by bound PPA have been reported. AMD9 VHH had the largest contact area with a total of 1151 Å2 (TableIII). This belongs to the highest values currently observed in complexes between classical antibodies (Fab or Fv fragments) and proteins. The two other fragments, AMB7 and AMD10 VHHs, interacted with PPA with large contact surface areas of 854 and 882 Å2, respectively (Table III).Table IIIWater-accessible surfaces (in Å 2 ) of the VHHs covered by PPA and of PPA covered by the VHHs upon complexationAMD 7AMD 9AMD10CDR15612139CDR2159405113CDR3404338376Sum of CDRS619864528Framework235287354Sum of VHH8541151882% of total surface area of VHH13.117.914.4PPA8711108849Sum VHH + PPA172522591731The CDR definition is according to Kabat (30Kabat E., Wu, T.T.

Open table in a new tab The CDR definition is according to Kabat (30Kabat E., Wu, T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. United States Public Health Services Publication No. 91-3242. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar). In all three complexes, several parts of the VHHs interacted with PPA. Dissecting these interactions indicates a surprisingly large contribution of the framework residues to the VHH·PPA contacts with 28, 25, and 40% of the total contact surface in the three VHHs, respectively (Table III). Some contribution of framework residues to the interaction with the antigen has already been reported for classical immunoglobulins. However, the extent of these interactions is much smaller than for the present VHHs, the amount of buried surfaces covered by framework residues being comprised of between 1 and 9% of the total interaction (29Wilson I.A. Garcia K.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Such interactions have also been observed to be important in VHH/hapten interactions (13Spinelli S. Tegoni M. Frenken L. van Vliet C. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The main interactions, however, were provided by the three CDRs, CDR3 being the main contributor in the complexes of AMB7 and AMD10 VHHs and the least for AMD9 VHH. In this latter case, CDR2 dominated the interaction and provided the inhibitory contact (Table III). In all cases, the CDR1 was little involved in the interactions. The CDR3 plays a minor role in PPA inhibition when considering the AMD9·PPA complex. It did not protrude from the paratope and did not penetrate into the active site in the way that was reported for the lysozyme·cAb-Lys3 complex (8Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Dao Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). This protruding geometry can certainly be established upon formation of a disulfide bridge between the CDR1 and the CDR3. This feature, however, was absent in AMD9 VHH. In contrast, this feature was observed in the AMD10 VHH in which the CDR3 protruded at the top of the VHH body. Despite this favorable conformation, AMD10 VHH did not bind to the catalytic crevice either. The AMD10·PPA interactions involved mainly framework residues on a side of the VHH and the CDR3 and other framework residues located close to it. In AMB7 VHH, the long hairpin CDR3 and some framework residues around it provided most of the interactions. The AMD9 VHH covered a large surface of PPA in the complex (1108 Å2) within the active site crevice. This VHH, however, did not occupy a central position in the active site as compared with other proteinaceous inhibitors of PPA (18Wiegand G. Epp O. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Bompard-Gilles C. Rousseau P. Rougé P. Payan F. Structure. 1996; 4: 1441-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The CDR2 loop 50–55 contacted the upper side of the V-shaped extended active site crevice, the side chains of Tyr-52 and Arg-52a filling the amylose path at its non-reducing end. The Tyr-52-accessible surface was reduced from 32 to 9 Å2 upon complexation and that of Arg-52a from 179 to 46 Å2, making this residue the largest contributor in the AMD9 complex formation. The Arg-52a guanidinium group was located 4.8 Å away from the catalytic residue Asp-300 and established a strong stacking contact (d = 3.6 Å) with the Trp-59 indole ring of PPA, which has been shown to interact with the hydrophobic face of saccharides. This stacking has also been observed in other structures of PPA in complex with proteinaceous inhibitors such as tendamistat and α-AI (18Wiegand G. Epp O. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Bompard-Gilles C. Rousseau P. Rougé P. Payan F. Structure. 1996; 4: 1441-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The three current PPA structures remain very close to the native PPA structure. Native PPA has been shown to exhibit striking differences when inhibited by a small molecule or some proteinaceous inhibitor such as α-AI (but not by tendamistat) (18Wiegand G. Epp O. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Bompard-Gilles C. Rousseau P. Rougé P. Payan F. Structure. 1996; 4: 1441-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The core A domain was very similar in all PPA structures as well as in the VHH·PPA complexes with the exception of some loops near the active site (see below). In the VHH complexes, the C domain of PPA adopted slightly different orientations compared with the native enzyme. The B domain stretch 125–155 was distorted especially in the case of AMD9 VHH, while the effect was less pronounced with AMB7 VHH and non-existent in AMD10 VHH. Three loops deviated as compared with native PPA: loops 220–225, 237–241, and 348–354. The largest deviation with regards to the native enzyme involved the 348–354 loop. The effect was larger in AMD9 VHH (3-Å displacement) and weaker in AMB7 and AMD10 VHHs. Two loop deviations were common between the complexes of PPA with VHH and with proteinaceous inhibitors. In this latter case, deviations were observed at 137–153, 237–241, and 350–359 and at the active site of PPA. Among the three VHH binders of PPA, AMD9 VHH was the only one to interact directly in the V-shaped active site crevice close to the catalytic residues. Its binding affinity (K d = 3.5 nm, Table II) correlates well with its very large interaction surface area with PPA, the largest found among VHH/protein interactions. The affinity value was of the same order of magnitude as the K i value obtained upon competitive inhibition by AMD9 VHH of the PPA activity on a small pseudo-substrate, 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl maltotrioside. This inhibition is also a clear indicator of the proximity of AMD9 VHH to the catalytic residues. In contrast, the two other binders were unable to inhibit the hydrolysis of the small substrate by the PPA, their epitope being located outside of the catalytic area. The K d value of AMD10 VHH was 25 nm, while that of AMB7 VHH was 1 order of magnitude larger despite the same interacting surface area. The action of PPA on large substrates, mimicked by the blue-starch Phadebas amylase test, was indeed inhibited by AMD9 VHH (Table II). AMB7 VHH, unable to inhibit the activity of PPA on a small substrate, exhibited, however, a marked inhibitory effect (70%) of the PPA activity on starch. This can be explained by the localization of AMB7 VHH in the starch binding crevice ∼15 Å away from the catalytic residues, at the reducing end, opposite to the AMD9 VHH location. AMD10 VHH was unable to inhibit PPA activity on small substrates and presented a very reduced effect with large substrates that can be rationalized by its location far from the catalytic residues. The crystal structures of the three VHHs in complex with PPA revealed water-accessible surface areas similar to or even larger than those observed in the complexes between proteins and classical antibodies (32Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). For the first time, a strong involvement of framework residues in opportunistic interactions with a proteinaceous antigen was observed. Such interactions have recently been documented in the case of a complex of a VHH with a hapten (12Spinelli S. Frenken L.G. Hermans P. Verrips T. Brown K. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed the involvement of framework residues could compensate in some cases for the lack of VL and hence provide interaction surfaces of the same magnitude as for classical immunoglobulins. In brief, for a smaller footprint of VHHs compared with Fv fragments, involvement of framework residues makes it possible for VHHs to reach an interaction surface area as large, or even larger, than that observed with Fv fragments. Furthermore it makes it possible for the VHH to interact with its protein antigen with different topologies of orientations: front-wise, side-wise, penetrating, and flat-wise. The participation of the framework residues in the antigen recognition is expected to occur more frequently for VHHs than for VHs because we noticed an overall increased accumulation of mutations (i.e. variability) throughout the entire sequence relative to that of dromedary VHs (6Nguyen V.K. Hamers R. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 921-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Hence these mutants introduced by an active somatic hypermutation mechanism can be selected during the affinity maturation."

The enzyme requires K+ and Mg2+ (or Mn2+) for activity (1Kayne F.J. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press Inc., New York1973: 353-382Google Scholar, 2Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Michels P.A. Prog. Mol.

The PK-catalyzed reaction represents the last step of glycolysis with the reaction product, pyruvate, being involved in a number of energetic and biosynthetic pathways. PK is activated homotropically by PEP and heterotropically by monophosphorylated or bisphosphorylated sugars (2Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Michels P.A. Prog. Mol. Biol. Biophys. 1992; 59: 105-227Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In addition, Mg2+, H+, and other cations modulate enzymatic activity (4Mesecar A.D. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6792-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The regulatory behavior of PK varies depending on the enzyme source. Four PK isozymes have been identified in mammals (5Hall E.R. Cottam G.L. Int. J. Biochem. 1978; 9: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The M1 (muscle) and M2 (fetal) proteins are products of the alternative splicing of the same mRNA. M2 PK is allosterically activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and PEP, whereas the M1 enzyme is exceptional in that it is the only known PK that displays hyperbolic kinetics. The other two mammalian PK isozymes, liver and erythrocyte, are coded by the same PKLR gene through the use of tissue-specific alternate promoters. Both erythrocyte and liver isozymes are activated by PEP and FBP (2Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Michels P.A. Prog. Mol. Biol. Biophys. 1992; 59: 105-227Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of several PKs from prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms have been elucidated (6Allen S.C. Muirhead H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Biol. 1999; 291: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). They reveal a conserved architecture. PK is a 200-kDa tetramer with four identical subunits, each consisting of four domains (Fig. 1): the small N-terminal helical domain (absent in bacterial PKs); the A domain with (β/α)8 barrel topology; the B domain, which is inserted between strand β3 and helix α3 of the A domain (β/α)8 barrel; and the C domain with an α+β topology. This multidomain architecture is instrumental to the regulation of PK activity. The enzyme activation is thought to involve a combination of domain and subunit rotations coupled to alterations in the active site geometry. In this mechanism, the residues located at the domain and subunit interfaces are crucial in that they function in the communication between the activator-binding site and the catalytic center (8Mattevi A.

Deficiency of human erythrocyte isozyme (RPK) is, together with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, the most common cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (11Zanella A. Bianchi P. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 2000; 13: 57-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). RPK deficiency severely affects the erythrocyte metabolism, causing ATP depletion, which ultimately leads to hemolysis. Worldwide, more than 150 mutations in the gene coding RPK have been found in RPK-deficient patients (12Bianchi P. Zanella A. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2000; 26: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The disease is transmitted as a recessive trait, and the pathological symptoms occur only in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. The clinical manifestations vary from mild to severe anemia, which can be life threatening and require continuous transfusion therapy. Here, we describe the first crystal structure of recombinant RPK and the biochemical characterization of eight mutants found in patients subjected to clinical follow-up. These studies allow a correlation between the clinical symptoms and the molecular properties of the mutant enzymes. The vectors used to express RPK and its mutant and truncated forms were derivatives of pTrcHisB (Invitrogen). RPK cDNA insert was obtained from pGG1 (13Wang C.Q. Chiarelli L.R. Bianchi P. Abraham D.J. Galizzi A. Mattevi A. Zanella A. Valentini G. Blood. 2001; 98: 3113-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) after introduction ofNcoI-NdeI sites around the ATG initiation codon. The mutagenic primer (14Nickoloff J.A. Deng W.P. Miller E.M. Ray F.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 455-468PubMed Google Scholar) used to introduce the two sites into pGG1 was 5′-CAAGGAGGCTGAAACCATGGCTAGCCAGGAGAACATATCATT. It altered the second and the third codon of the insert. The underlined letters indicate the mutated bases. The selection primer used to abolish the vector unique restriction site AflIII was 5′-CGCAGGAAAGACCTTGGGAGCAAAAGGCC. The pTrcHisB with RPK cDNA inserted inNcoI/EcoRI and designated pCW3 was mutagenized to restore the codons previously changed. The mutagenic primer was 5′-TAAGGAGGAATAAACCATGTCGATCCA GGAGAACATATCAT. The selection was performed by digesting the parental pCW3 with NcoI. The new plasmid, which contains the correct insert, was named pLC1. To obtain the desired RPK mutants, the pLC1 was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis (14Nickoloff J.A. Deng W.P. Miller E.M. Ray F.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 455-468PubMed Google Scholar). The same selection primer (5′-CCCCCCTGAATTCGAACCTTGGCTG) was used to abolish the unique HindIII site in all cases. The specific mutagenic primers were: 5′-CTGGAGGTGAGCGACAGCATCATGGTGGCA for G332S; 5′-CTGCAACTTGGCGGACAAGCCTGTTGTCTG for G364D; 5′-CAAGCCCCGGCCAATGAGGGCAGAGACAAG for T384M; 5′-AGGGCAGAGACAAGCAATGTCGCCAATGCTG for D390N; 5′-CTGACCACAACTGGCCACTCAGCCCAGCTTCTG for R479H; 5′-AGCCCAGCTTCTGTCTTGGTACCGACCTCGG for R486W; 5′-CTGCCCAGGCTGCCCTCCAGGTCCACTTAT for R504L; and 5′-ATGATGTAAGATCGCTGGGTGCAATTTGGCA for R532W. To obtain a truncated form of RPK lacking the first 49 residues, pCW3 was mutagenized by using the primer 5′-TAAGGAGGAATAAACCATGGAGCTGGGCACTGCCTTCTTCC. This sequence corresponds to that of the plasmid upstream of the initiation triplet ATG and continues with that of the RPK insert starting from the GAG codon of Glu at position 50. The selection was performed by digesting pCW3 with NheI restriction enzyme. The plasmid with the insert encoding the truncated RPK (residues 50–574) was designated pLC3. All of the inserts were sequenced. Escherichia coli DH5α transformed with the specific expression vectors were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When the culture optical density at 600 nm reached a value of 0.5, the expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The induction time was 12 h, whereas the induction temperature was 30 °C, with the exception of the mutants G332S, G364D, R504L, and R532W, for which the induction temperature was 21 °C. Wild-type and mutant enzymes were purified by the procedure of Wang et al. (13Wang C.Q. Chiarelli L.R. Bianchi P. Abraham D.J. Galizzi A. Mattevi A. Zanella A. Valentini G. Blood. 2001; 98: 3113-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities were measured at 37 °C by the assay (13Wang C.Q. Chiarelli L.R. Bianchi P. Abraham D.J. Galizzi A. Mattevi A. Zanella A. Valentini G. Blood. 2001; 98: 3113-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) recommended by the International Committee for Standardization in Hematology. The kinetic parameters were determined with the Enzyme Kinetic ModuleTM 1.1 (SPSS Science Software Gmb). Thermal stability was measured by incubating the enzyme (100–200 μg/ml) at 53 °C in a solution consisting of 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The samples were removed at intervals and immediately assayed. Recombinant wild-type RPK was crystallized using the vapor diffusion method at 22 °C. Well solutions consisted of 50 mm Mes/KOH, pH 6.4, 10 mmMnSO4, and 10–14% w/v PEG8000. Hanging drops were formed by mixing equal volumes of 12 mg/ml protein in 50 mm KCl, 5 mm FBP, 5 mm phosphoglycolate, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and well solutions. The crystals were difficult to reproduce. The recombinant enzyme undergoes partial proteolysis, and about 50% of the purified protein chains lack the first 47 amino acids (13Wang C.Q. Chiarelli L.R. Bianchi P. Abraham D.J. Galizzi A. Mattevi A. Zanella A. Valentini G. Blood. 2001; 98: 3113-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). On this basis, we produced a mutant truncated enzyme lacking the first 49 residues (see above). Employment of the truncated protein greatly improved the crystallization, which was carried out using the above-described protocol. Crystals were obtained for the T384M, R479H, and R486W truncated mutants by the same protocol used for the truncated wild-type RPK. RPK crystals belong to space group P21 with one tetramer in the asymmetric unit. The diffraction data were measured at 100 K on beamline ID14-EH2 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) using a MarCCD detector and beamline B7WB of DESY/EMBL (Hamburg, Germany) using a Mar Imaging Plate. Data processing and reduction were carried out using MOSFLM (15Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). The data collection statistics are reported in TableI. The structure of the wild-type RPK was solved by molecular replacement using the program Molrep (16Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The Phases were improved by 4-fold averaging (17Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), producing an electron density of excellent quality. Model building was carried out with the program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). The model was refined using Refmac (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13855) Google Scholar). All of the measured data (no ς cut-off) were employed, and 2.5% of unique reflections were used to monitor the progress of the refinement byR free validation. The refined wild-type coordinates provided the starting model for the refinement of the mutants. The set of reflections for calculation ofR free was identical to that of the wild-type structure refinement. A summary of refinement statistics is presented in Table I. Analysis and inspection of the structures were carried out with the program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Use of the truncated protein resulted in considerable improvement in the reproducibility of the crystallization experiments. The truncated protein exhibits kinetic properties virtually identical to those of wild-type RPK. A more detailed analysis of this and other mutants targeting the N-terminal residues will be published elsewhere. The truncated recombinant RPK was crystallized in complex with phosphoglycolate (a PEP analogue), FBP, Mn2+, and K+. The presence of the allosteric activators implies that the crystalline enzyme is in the active R state. The 2.7 Å resolution structure of RPK reveals the typical four-domain subunit architecture found in all PKs of known three-dimensional structure (Fig.1 A). The A (residues 85–159 and 263–431) and C domains (residues 432–574), together with the small N-terminal domain (residues 57–84), form the main body of the subunit. The B domain (residues 160–262) is loosely packed to the rest of the molecule and adopts slightly different orientations (about 4°) in the four crystallographically independent polypeptide chains. The four subunits of the RPK tetramer are assembled to form a D2 symmetric oligomer. The intersubunit interactions define two large contact areas; the A/A′ interface involves the A domains of subunits related by the vertical 2-fold axis, as defined in Fig.1 B, whereas the C/C′ interface involves the C domains of subunits interacting along the horizontal axis. The structure of the RPK subunit closely resembles that of rabbit muscle M1 PK, as expected from the 59% sequence identity between the two proteins. The similarity is highest with M1 PK in complex with pyruvate (7Larsen T.M. Laughlin L.T. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6301-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), with a root-mean-square difference of 1.2 Å for 512 Cα atom pairs. This M1 PK complex exhibits the same B domain orientation found in RPK. In other M1 structures, the B domain is either more open, as in the phospholactate complex (21Larsen T.M. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G.E. Rayment I. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), or more closed, as in the complex with ATP (22Larsen T.M. Benning M.M.

All ligands are clearly visible in the electron density map. Phosphoglycolate, a potent PK inhibitor (9Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), is positioned in the PEP-binding site, which is located at the top of the A domain (β/α)8 barrel, facing a cleft between the A and B domains (Fig. 1 A). It is at the heart of an intricate network of hydrogen bonds, which involve protein residues and the Mn2+ and K+ cations (Fig.2 A). The phosphate group is bound to the K+ atom and the side chain of Arg116, whereas the carboxylate moiety is anchored through interactions with the Mn2+ ion, the side chain of Thr371, and the main chain nitrogen atoms of Gly338 and Asp339, which are located at the N terminus of a short helical segment belonging to loop 6 of the A domain (β/α)8 barrel. This binding geometry is identical to that observed in the yeast PK-phosphoglycolate complex (9Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and closely resembles the binding of pyruvate and phospholactate to rabbit M1 PK (for a discussion of the implications of this binding mode for catalysis see Refs. 7Larsen T.M.

These similarities are in keeping with the strict conservation among the PK sequences of all residues surrounding the substrate-binding site. The FBP activator is hosted in the allosteric site in the C domain (Fig. 1 A). The ligand is sandwiched between loops 475–479 and 557–566 (Fig. 2 B) and extensively interacts with protein. The 6′-phosphate group is engaged in a salt bridge with Arg532, whereas the 1′-phosphate is hydrogen-bonded to the side chains of Thr475 and Ser480 and the backbone nitrogen atoms of Thr476 and Thr477. Moreover, the dipole of α-helix 480–486 points toward the 1′-phosphate, further compensating the ligand negative charge. This geometry in FBP-binding is identical to that found in yeast PK crystallized in the R state (9Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). A survey of the missense mutations associated with the nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia shows that most of them cluster in specific regions of the protein three-dimensional structure: the interface between the A and C domains, the A/A′ intersubunit interface, the hydrophobic core of the A domain, and the FBP-binding site (24Mattevi A. Bolognesi M. Valentini G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We generated eight RPK mutants (Fig.1 A), targeting residues belonging to each of these regions of the protein. Almost all selected mutations have been found in homozygote patients. The kinetic, allosteric, and thermostability parameters of mutant proteins were evaluated (TableII), and the crystal structures of three mutants (T384M, R479H and R486W) were solved. The mutations did not induce significant conformational changes in the overall protein conformation, and therefore we shall restrict the description of the mutant structures mainly to the sites affected by the mutations.Table IIKinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant RPKsEnzymePEP2-aKinetic parameters for PEP were obtained at fixed 1.5 mm ADP by fitting data to the Hill plot.FBP(−)1 mmFBPADP2-bKinetic parameters for ADP were obtained at fixed 5 mm PEP by fitting data to the Lineweaver-Burk plot. k cat S 0.5 k cat/S 0.5 n H k cat S 0.5 k cat/S 0.5 n H k cat S 0.5 k cat/S 0.5 s −1 mm s −1 /mm s −1 mm s −1 /mm s −1 mm s −1 /mmWild type2-cND, not determined.355 ± 121.10 ± 0.043231.60 ± 0.16355 ± 110.18 ± 0.02019721.05 ± 0.07355 ± 130.17 ± 0.012080G332S137 ± 63.79 ± 0.2362.31 ± 0.12152 ± 50.38 ± 0.043891.08 ± 0.08111 ± 70.49 ± 0.03226G364D104 ± 70.93 ± 0.031121.54 ± 0.03118 ± 60.75 ± 0.021531.39 ± 0.03115 ± 60.16 ± 0.04718T384M149 ± 101.24 ± 0.091201.50 ± 0.03172 ± 70.36 ± 0.073831.00 ± 0.16135 ± 90.15 ± 0.02900D390N0.48 ± 0.041.40 ± 0.050.341.65 ± 0.010.55 ± 0.050.34 ± 0.0091.61.15 ± 0.020.45 ± 120.25 ± 0.011.8R479H390 ± 81.10 ± 0.034542.09 ± 0.02386 ± 80.08 ± 0.00344521.17 ± 0.06381 ± 120.20 ± 0.021905R486W195 ± 41.69 ± 0.061162.07 ± 0.11203 ± 100.40 ± 0.074921.32 ± 0.03218 ± 130.24 ± 0.02908R504LND2-cND, not determined.NDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDR532W183 ± 50.63 ± 0.032901.41 ± 0.11187 ± 80.66 ± 0.062751.48 ± 0.14189 ± 120.20 ± 0.04945The results are the means ± S.E. for three determinations from four different protein preparations.2-a Kinetic parameters for PEP were obtained at fixed 1.5 mm ADP by fitting data to the Hill plot.2-b Kinetic parameters for ADP were obtained at fixed 5 mm PEP by fitting data to the Lineweaver-Burk plot.2-c ND, not determined.

An example is the G332S mutation (nucleotide G994 → A), which affects a residue that is strictly conserved among PK sequences. Gly332 is located on strand β6, being buried inside the domain core (Fig. 1 A). The G332S protein exhibits a 9-fold decrease in the catalytic efficiency (5-fold for the FBP activated protein) and is considerably less thermostable than the wild-type enzyme (Table II and Fig. 3). These substantially altered molecular properties account for the clinical data. In homozygous form, the G332S mutation leads to severe anemia with the need of regular transfusions (25Zanella A. Bianchi P. Baronciani L. Zappa M. Bredi E. Vercellati C. Alfinito F. Pelissero G. Sirchia G. Blood. 1997; 89: 3847-3852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lenzner C. Nurnberg P. Thiele B.J. Reis A. Brabec V. Sakalova A. Jacobasch G. Blood. 1994; 83: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interface between the A and C domains is characterized by many polar interactions that often involve charged side chains. Many of these residues represent sites of pathological mutations, which cause RPK deficiency at variable levels of severity. The mutation R504L (nucleotide G1511 → T) affects Arg504, a C domain residue that is partly solvent-accessible and engaged in an interdomain salt bridge with Asp281 (Fig. 1 A). The R504L mutation removes this interdomain interaction and introduces a hydrophobic Leu side chain in a solvent exposed site close to a negatively charged Asp. Such amino acid replacement is clearly unfavorable, providing a reason for the extreme instability of the protein, which prevented functional analysis (Table II). This feature explains the severe anemia found in RPK-deficient patients homozygous for this mutation (27Demina A. Varughese K.I. Barbot J. Forman L. Beutler E. Blood. 1998; 92: 647-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other two investigated mutants targeting the A/C interface affect Gly364 and Arg486, which are part of a region of close association between the A and C domains (Figs. 1 Aand 4 A). Arg486 is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Leu362 at the C terminus of the A domain helix α6, whereas the neighboring Gly364 allows a sharp turn of the polypeptide chain with a backbone conformation (φ = 85°,ψ = 98°) that is unfavorable for a nonglycine residue. The G364D (nucleotide G1091 → A) mutation has a drastic effect on the enzyme stability, which is coupled to a 3-fold reduction of the catalytic efficiency (Fig. 3 B and Table II). Given the tightly packed environment and the backbone conformation of Gly364, it is conceivable that introduction of a charged Asp side chain at this site of the A/C interface can greatly perturb the domain assembly, thus being deleterious for stability. Fully consistent with these observations is the severe anemia found in patients homozygous for G364D (28van Solinge W.W. Kraaijenhagen R.J. Rijksen G. van Wijk R. Stoffer B.B. Gajhede M. Nielsen F.C.

Repression of transcription accompanying CpG island hypermethylation has been proposed to be mediated by methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins. We report here that inhibition of transcription from hypermethylatedGSTP1 promoters in Hep3B HCC cells, which fail to expressGSTP1 mRNA or GSTP1 polypeptides, appears to be mediated by MBD2. Treatment of Hep3B cells with 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a methyltransferase inhibitor, activated GSTP1expression, whereas treatment with trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, had little effect. To more precisely assess the contribution of the pattern of GSTP1 CpG island methylation on GSTP1 mRNA expression, Hep3B cells were treated for 72 h with 5-aza-dC and then subjected to limiting dilution cloning. Bisulfite sequencing was used to map the methylation patterns of the GSTP1 promoter region inGSTP1-expressing and -non-expressing clones. In the clone that expressed GSTP1 mRNA determined by Northern blot analysis and quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, widespread demethylation of at least one GSTP1allele was evident. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed the presence of MBD2, but not Sp1, at the GSTP1 promoter in Hep3B cells. In contrast, Sp1 was detected at the GSTP1promoter in a GSTP1-expressing Hep3B 5-aza-dC subclone. To test whether MBD2 might be responsible for the inhibition ofGSTP1 transcription from hypermethylated GSTP1promoters, siRNAs were used to reduce MBD2 polypeptide levels in Hep3B cells. SssI-catalyzed methylation ofGSTP1 promoter sequences resulted in diminished luciferase reporter activity after transfection into Hep3B cells. However, when hypermethylated GSTP1 promoter sequences were transfected into Hep3B cells that had been treated with siRNA-targetingMBD2 mRNA, no repression of luciferase reporter expression was evident. These findings implicate MBD2 in the repression of GSTP1 expression associated with GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation in HCC cells.

The mechanism by which CpG island hypermethylation, amid global hypomethylation, appears in HCC or in other human cancers has not been established. The mechanism by which hypermethylation at CpG islands acts to suppress the transcription of genes is an area of active research. Methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) family proteins have been identified as candidate mediators of this process. All MBD proteins contain a conserved methyl-CpG binding domain, first identified in MeCP2 (13Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. Bird A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5085-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 14Nan X. Meehan R.R. Bird A.

MeCP2 is capable of binding DNA containing a single 5-mCpG. MeCP2 also contains a transcriptional repression domain that permits interaction with Sin3a and histone deacetylase (HDAC) to form one postulated 5-mCpG-dependent transcriptional repression complex (13Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. Bird A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5085-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 16Nan X., Ng, H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A.

Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). MBD2, which also binds DNA containing5-mCpG, has been shown to be a part of another transcriptional repression complex, containing HDACs, MBD3, and Mi-2·NuRD proteins (18Feng Q. Zhang Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 827-832PubMed Google Scholar). The Mi-2·NuRD complex appears capable of disrupting histone-DNA interactions to promote chromatin remodeling (19Tong J.K. Hassig C.A. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). For cancer genes inactivated by somatic CpG island hypermethylation, the role of HDACs in transcriptional silencing is unclear. For some genes, treatment with trichostatin A, an HDAC inhibitor, is sufficient to reverse the repression associated with CpG island hypermethylation, whereas for other genes, TSA treatment alone is unable to restore gene expression (17Jones P.L.

GSTP1, encoding the human π-class glutathioneS-transferase, has been reported to be targeted for somatic CpG island hypermethylation in 85% of HCCs as well as in 30% of breast cancers and in >90% of prostate cancers (7Tchou J.C.

Hep3B cells, a human HCC line, have been shown to contain densely hypermethylated GSTP1 CpG island sequences and to be devoid of GSTP1 mRNA (7Tchou J.C. Lin X. Freije D. Isaacs W.B. Brooks J.D. Rashid A., De Marzo A.M. Kanai Y. Hirohashi S. Nelson W.G. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 663-676PubMed Google Scholar). We report here that in Hep3B HCC cells, repression of GSTP1 associated with CpG island hypermethylation was reversed by treatment with 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) but was unaffected by treatment with TSA. Furthermore, when Hep3B cells were treated with 5-az-dC for 72 h, subjected to limiting dilution cloning, and then assessed by quantitative RT-PCR forGSTP1 mRNA and by bisulfite genomic sequencing forGSTP1 CpG island methylation, Hep3B-5-aza-dC clones that express GSTP1 mRNA all contained at least one unmethylated GSTP1 CpG island allele. Hep3B-5-aza-dC clones that failed to reverse hypermethylation at the GSTP1 CpG island failed to express GSTP1 mRNA. Repression of transcription from hypermethylated GSTP1 CpG island alleles in Hep3B cells appeared to be mediated by MBD2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of nucleoprotein complexes in Hep3B cells revealed a preferential association of MBD2, but not MeCP2, with hypermethylated GSTP1 promoter sequences. Furthermore, when siRNAs targeting MBD2 and MeCP2 mRNAs were introduced by transfection into Hep3B cells, cells with reduced MBD2 levels, but not cells with reduced MeCP2 levels, were incapable of repressing transcription from SssI-methylatedGSTP1 promoters. All of the data collected suggest that MBD2, perhaps via an HDAC-independent pathway, acts to repress transcription from hypermethylated GSTP1 promoters in HCC cells. Human Hep3B cells were propagated in vitro in minimal Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) (25Aden D.P. Fogel A. Plotkin S. Damjanov I. Knowles B.B. Nature. 1979; 282: 615-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Treatment of Hep3B cells with 5-aza-dC (Sigma) and with TSA (Sigma) was accomplished by adding the drugs to complete growth medium at a concentration of 1 μm for 5-aza-dC and 100 ng/ml for TSA. Stock solutions of 5-aza-dC, 1 mm in Me2SO, and TSA, 100 mg/ml in ethanol, were stored at –20 °C. To isolate individual Hep3B clones with varying degrees ofGSTP1 CpG island methylation, Hep3B cells were treated with 5-aza-dC for 72 h and then maintained in complete growth medium without drugs. The cells were then subjected to limiting dilution cloning in drug-free medium using 96-well culture plates. Eight Hep3B-5-aza-dC clones were isolated and maintained in complete growth medium without drugs for at least 3 months before assessment forGSTP1 expression and GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation. Total RNA was isolated from Hep3B cells and Hep3B-5-aza-dC clones using an RNeasy® RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) and quantified using an orcinol assay (26Lin R.I. Schjeide O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Purified RNAs (20 μg) were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels in the presence of 2.2m formaldehyde, transferred to Zeta-Probe® GT (Bio-Rad) filters, and then assessed for GSTP1 mRNA levels by hybridization with specific 32P-labeledGSTP1 cDNA probes (ATCC) prepared using Rediprime II DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). After hybridization at 50 °C for 3 h in Quick-Hybe® (Stratagene) hybridization solution containing heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) at 200 μg/ml, blots were washed twice with 2× SSC (1× SSC is 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.1% SDS at room temperature and once with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Blot were exposed to X-OMAT™ film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at –70 °C. Immunoblot analyses for GSTP1 polypeptides in total protein extracts from cultured HCC cells were accomplished as described previously (7Tchou J.C. Lin X. Freije D. Isaacs W.B. Brooks J.D.

PCR reactions included cDNA from 125 ng of RNA, sense (5′-GGGCAGTGCCTTCACATAGT-3′) and antisense (5′-ggagacctcaccctgtacca-3′) primers, and the Master Mix from a QuantiTect™ SYBR Green® PCR kit (Qiagen). PCR cycles were 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Cloned GSTP1 cDNA was used as a standard for quantification. As an internal control, TBPmRNA, encoding the TATA-binding protein, was also detected by quantitative RT-PCR using specific sense (5′-cacgaaccacggcactgatt-3′) and antisense (5-ttttcttgctgccagtctggac-3′) primers. PCR cycles forTBP cDNA detection were 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Each of the PCR assays was run in triplicate, and the GSTP1 and TBP copy numbers were estimated from the threshold amplification cycle numbers using software supplied with the iCycler IQ™ Thermal Cycler. Genomic DNA was isolated from Hep3B cells using the DNneasy™ kit (Qiagen). To map5-mCpG dinucleotides in the GSTP1 CpG island region, a bisulfite genomic sequencing approach was undertaken (24Lin X. Tascilar M. Lee W.H. Vles W.J. Lee B.H. Veeraswamy R. Asgari K. Freije D. van Rees B. Gage W.R. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Brooks J.D. DeWeese T.L., De Marzo A.M. Nelson W.G. Am. J.

Purified DNAs (500 μg) were treated with EcoRI, admixed with salmon sperm DNA (2.5 μg), and then treated with sodium bisulfite as previously described (27Lee W.H. Morton R.A. Epstein J.I. Brooks J.D. Campbell P.A. Bova G.S. Hsieh W.S. Isaacs W.B. Nelson W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11733-11737Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The bisulfite-treated DNA was then subjected to two rounds of PCR to amplify GSTP1 CPG island alleles using primers that recognize the antisense strand ofGSTP1 after bisulfite conversion. First-round PCR primers were 5′-AC(A/G)CAACCTATAATTCCACCTACTC-3′ and 5′-GT(T/C)GGGAGTTGGGGTTTGATGTTG-3′; second round PCR primers were 5′-AACCTAAACCACAAC(A/G)TAAAACAT-3′ and 5′-TTGGTTTTATGTTGGGAGTTTTGA-3′. PCR reaction conditions have been described previously. To permit DNA sequencing of individual GSTP1 CpG island alleles, PCR products were purified by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels using the Qiaquick™ gel extraction kit (Qiagen), ligated into pCR2.1pTOPO® cloning vectors (Invitrogen), and then introduced into TOP 10® One Shot competent bacteria (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA, isolated using Qiaprep® Spin Miniprep kit, was subjected to DNA sequence analysis using M13 sequencing primers. 8–10 × 106growing Hep3B cells or Hep3B-5-aza-dC clone 5 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C, washed twice in ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture III (Calbiochem), and then recovered by scraping and centrifugation at 325 × gfor 5 min (30Gould A.P. Brookman J.J. Strutt D.I. White R.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of chromatin lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.1), incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, and then sonicated for 40 s using a Versonic micropipette sonicator to reduce DNA fragment size to 400–600 bp. The sonicated chromatin lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were added to 10 ml of precipitation buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 167 mm NaCl, and 1.2 mm EDTA in 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). After preclearing with 400 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotech) by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation and then centrifugation at 325 × g for 1 min, nucleoprotein complexes were separated into 1 ml aliquots for immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies to MBD2, MeCP2, Sp1, and acetylated histone H4 (all from Upstate Biotechnology). 5–10 μg of antibody solution was added to 1 ml of nucleoprotein complexes. Antibody-nucleoprotein complex mixtures were incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle agitation. Immunocomplexes were collected by the addition of 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotech), incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation, then centrifugation at 325 × g for 1 min. Pelleted immunocomplexes were washed with low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), LiCl/Nonidet P-40/deoxycholate buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and with TE buffer (1 mm EDTA in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0). Nucleoprotein complexes were eluted from the final washed immunoprecipitates in 250 μl of 1% SDS and 0.1 mNaHCO3 by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. To reverse the cross-linking of protein to DNA, 20 μl of 5 mNaCl was added to the eluted immunoprecipitates and incubated at 65 °C overnight. Proteins were digested by adding 2 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml), 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and 20 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and incubating the mixture for 1 h at 45 °C. DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and EtOH precipitation. To detect GSTP1 CpG island DNA, quantitative PCR was undertaken using the iCycler iQ™ multi-color real time PCR system (Bio-Rad) and a Quantitect™SYBR® Green Master Mix. The PCR cycles were 95 °C for 15 min, then 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. The GSTP1 primers were sense (5′-GACCTGGGAAAGAGAGGGAAAG-3′) and antisense (5′-ACTCACTGGTGGCGAAGACT-3′). PCR assays were run in triplicate, andGSTP1 copy numbers were estimated from the threshold amplification cycle numbers using software supplied with the iCycler IQ™ Thermal Cycler. The amount of GSTP1 DNA recovered by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies was expressed as a percent of the total amount of GSTP1 DNA in nucleoprotein complexes before immunoprecipitation. siRNA duplexes were designed targeting AA(N19)UU sequences in the open reading frames of mRNA encoding MBD2 and MeCP2; siRNA-targeting mRNA encoding lamin A was already available (Dharmacon) (31Caplen N.J. Parrish S. Imani F. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9742-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Selected siRNA target sequences were also submitted to BLAST searches against other human genome sequences to ensure target specificity. 21-Nucleotide RNAs were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon and obtained in annealed form. The following target sequences were used: MBD2 mRNA (5′-AAGAGGAUGGAUUGCCCGGCC-3′), MeCP2 mRNA (target 5′-AAGCAUGAGCCCGUGCAGCCA-3′), and lamin A mRNA (5′-AAGGACCUGGAGGCUCUGCUG-3′). siRNAs were transfected into Hep3B cells using Oligofectamine™ (Invitrogen). An additional siRNA transfection was undertaken 48 h later to increase the efficiency of target protein knock-down. The effectiveness of the target protein reduction was monitored by immunoblot analysis. Total protein extracts, prepared by lysing cells in 2% SDS, were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels (Novex) in MES running buffer (Novex), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen), and then probed with antibodies to MBD, MeCP2, acetylated histone H4, and lamin A/C (Upstate Biotechnology, Calbiochem) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described. GSTP1promoter-luciferase reporter constructs (pGL3 vector, Promega) containing sequences from −408 5′ of the GSTP1transcription start site to +36 were treated with SssI, a CpG methylase, or left untreated and then transfected into Hep3B cells using LipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen) (24Lin X. Tascilar M. Lee W.H. Vles W.J. Lee B.H. Veeraswamy R. Asgari K. Freije D. van Rees B. Gage W.R. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Brooks J.D. DeWeese T.L., De Marzo A.M. Nelson W.G. Am. J.

Luciferase reporter activity was assayed using a Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) and a 1450 MicroBeta® JET luminometer (Wallac). A cytomegalovirus promoter-β-galactosidase reporter construct was used to monitor transfection efficiency. Although π-class glutathioneS-transferases appear to be up-regulated in rat models of HCC, the human π-class glutathione S-transferase is not expressed in human HCCs or by the human HCC cell line, Hep3B (5Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W., Ng, H.H., Xu, G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). In normal human liver tissue, the GSTP1 CpG island is unmethylated, even though GSTP1 is usually not expressed (7Tchou J.C. Lin X. Freije D. Isaacs W.B. Brooks J.D. Rashid A., De Marzo A.M. Kanai Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24893-24899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, in Hep3B HCC cells, the GSTP1 promoter has been previously shown to be heavily methylated (7Tchou J.C. Lin X. Freije D. Isaacs W.B. Brooks J.D. Rashid A., De Marzo A.M. Kanai Y. Hirohashi S. Nelson W.G. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 663-676PubMed Google Scholar). When we subjected Hep3B cells to treatment with 5-aza-dC, a DNMT inhibitor, or with TSA, an HDAC inhibitor, GSTP1 expression was evident only in cells treated with 5-aza-dC within 72 h (Fig.1). To ascertain whether combinations of 5-aza-dC and TSA might be more effective at restoring GSTP1 expression than 5-aza-dC alone, Hep3B cells were treated sequentially for 48 h with 5-aza-dC and/or TSA to a total 96 h of drug treatment (Fig.2). Prior exposure of Hep3B cells to TSA did not potentiate the effect of 5-aza-dC on increasingGSTP1 mRNA levels, nor did exposure to TSA after 5-aza-dC treatment have any synergistic effect on restoringGSTP1 expression. These findings are consistent with a role for GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation in the silencing ofGSTP1 transcriptional in Hep3B cells and further suggest that the mechanism of methylation-associated inhibition ofGSTP1 transcription may not require HDACs.Figure 2Treatment with 5-aza-dC , but not with TSA , restores GSTP1 expression in Hep3B cells. Hep3B cells were treated sequentially for two 48-h periods with 5-aza-dC (1 μm), TSA (100 ng/ml), or neither drug. GSTP1expression was monitored by Northern blot analysis as described for Fig1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To better characterize the effect of CpG island hypermethylation on GSTP1 expression in Hep3B cells, we treated the cells for 72 h with 5-aza-dC and then isolated individual Hep3B-5-aza-dC subclones by limiting dilution cloning. Eight Hep3B-5-aza-dC clones were recovered, and three of the clones expressed significant levels of GSTP1 mRNA by Northern blot (Fig. 3) and quantitative RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 4). DNMT inhibitors have been reported to restore the expression of many genes repressed by CpG island hypermethylation in cancer cells; however, a reduction in gene expression and a remethylation of CpG island sequences after prolonged passage in cell culture have been described for some such genes (33Bender C.M. Gonzalgo M.L. Gonzales F.A. Nguyen C.T. Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6690-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In T24 bladder cancer cells, restoration of p16mRNA expression by treatment with 5-aza-dC was completely reversed after 21 population doublings in the absence of the inhibitor (33Bender C.M. Gonzalgo M.L. Gonzales F.A. Nguyen C.T. Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6690-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Remarkably, in Hep3B-5-aza-dC clones 2, 5, and 7, GSTP1mRNA expression remained stable for at least 8 months during continuous cell culture in the absence of 5-aza-dC (not shown). Whether the apparent differences in propensity for CpG island remethylation between p16 in T24 cells and GSTP1 in Hep3B cells can be attributed to differences in selection for loss of p16versus GSTP1 expression or to some mechanism has not been established (24Lin X. Tascilar M. Lee W.H. Vles W.J. Lee B.H. Veeraswamy R. Asgari K. Freije D. van Rees B. Gage W.R. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Brooks J.D. DeWeese T.L., De Marzo A.M. Nelson W.G. Am. J.

When genomic DNA from each of the clones was subjected to bisulfite genomic sequencing, capable of mapping5-mCpG dinucleotides at the GSTP1transcriptional regulatory region, a reduction in GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation was evident only in Hep3B-5-aza-dC clones that expressed GSTP1 mRNA (Fig.5). Of interest, the PCR primers for bisulfite genomic sequence analysis flanked a polymorphic (ATAAA) n repeat located −506 bp 5′ of the GSTP1transcription start site, permitting discrimination of CpG dinucleotide methylation patterns on individual GSTP1 alleles. Hep3B cells and four of the Hep3B-5-aza-dC clones were found to contain three different (ATAAA) n repeat lengths, consistent with an instability of this polymorphic repeat at some point during the development, isolation, and propagation of Hep3B HCC cell line. Four of the Hep3B-5-aza-dC clones appeared to have lost GSTP1 allele 3 after 5-aza-dC treatment and limiting dilution cloning. For the three Hep3B-5-aza-dC clones with a reduction in GSTP1 CpG island methylation, the reduction was restricted to one GSTP1allele. Furthermore, each of the three Hep3B-5-aza-dC subclones displayed reversal of GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation at different GSTP1 alleles, suggesting no bias of 5-aza-dC action toward any specific GSTP1 allele. Hep3B-5-aza-dC clones 2 and 5 appeared to have completely reversed GSTP1"

https://openalex.org/W2098104239,"Gain of chromosome 17q material is the most frequent genetic abnormality in neuroblastomas. The common region of gain is at least 375 cR large, which has precluded the identification of genes with a role in neuroblastoma pathogenesis. Neuroblastoma also frequently show amplification of the N-myc oncogene, which correlates closely with 17q gain. Both events are strong predictors of unfavorable prognosis. To identify genes that are part of the N-myc downstream pathway, we constructed SAGE libraries of an N-myc transfected and a control cell line. This identified the chromosome 17q genes nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 as being 6-10 times induced in the N-myc expressing cells. Northern and Western blot analysis confirmed this up-regulation. Time-course experiment shows that both genes are induced within 4 h after N-myc is switched on. Furthermore, we demonstrate also that c-myc can up-regulate nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 expression. Neuroblastoma tumor and cell line panels reveal a striking correlation between N-myc amplification and mRNA and protein expression of both nm23 genes. We show that the nm23 genes are located at the edge of the common region of chromosome 17q gain previously described in neuroblastoma cell lines. Our findings suggest that nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 expression is increased by 17q gain in neuroblastoma and can be further up-regulated by myc overexpression. These observations suggest a major role for nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 in tumorigenesis of unfavorable neuroblastomas."

We previously demonstrated that nNOS exon 1c, one of the predominant transcripts in the human gastrointestinal tract, is driven by a separate promoter (Saur, D., Paehge, H., Schusdziarra, V., and Allescher, H. D. (2000) Gastroenterology 118, 849–858). The present study focused on the quantitative expression of nNOS first exon variants in different human tissues and the characterization of the basal nNOS exon 1c promoter. In human brain, skeletal muscle, colon, and TGW-nu-I neuroblastoma cells, first exon expression patterns were analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. In these tissues/cells exon 1c was one of the most abundant first exons of nNOS. By transient transfections of TGW-nu-I and HeLa cells with reporter plasmids containing a series of 5′ and 3′ deletions in the exon 1c regulatory region, the minimal TATA-less promoter was localized within 44 base pairs. Gel mobility shift assays of this cis-regulatory region revealed a high complexity of the basal promoter with a cooperative binding of several transcription factors, like Sp and ZNF family members. When the Sp binding site of the minimal promoter construct was mutated, promoter activity was completely abolished in both cell lines, whereas mutation of the common binding site of ZNF76 and ZNF143 resulted in a decrease of 53% in TGW-nu-I and 37% in HeLa cells. In Drosophila Schneider cells expression of Sp1, the long Sp3 isoform, ZNF76 and ZNF143 potently transactivated the nNOS exon 1c promoter. These results identify the critical regulatory region for the nNOS exon 1c basal promoter and stress the functional importance of multiple protein complexes involving Sp and ZNF families of transcription factors in regulating nNOS exon 1c transcription.

In the central and peripheral nervous system, skeletal muscle, the macula densa of the kidney, testis, and neutrophils, neuronal NOS (nNOS) is the predominant enzyme for the generation of nitric oxide. NO, synthesized by nNOS, acts as neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, or intracellular signaling molecule. It is involved in synaptic plasticity, regulation of gene expression, development, differentiation, and regeneration and plays an important role in neurodegenerative disorders and stroke as a mediator of neurotoxicity (for review see Refs. 1Bredt D.S.

A recent study comprising 27 families with inherited infantile pyloric stenosis identified nNOS as a susceptibility gene for this disorder (15Chung E. Curtis D. Chen G. Marsden P.A. Twells R., Xu, W. Gardiner M. Am. J. Hum.

Saur, J. M. Vanderwinden, M. H. De-Laet, and H.-D. Allescher, manuscript in preparation.2D. Saur, J. M. Vanderwinden, M. H. De-Laet, and H.-D. Allescher, manuscript in preparation. Therefore it is of physiological and pathophysiological interest to investigate the molecular basis of nNOS exon 1c transcription. In addition, the distribution and quantitative expression of alternative first exon nNOS variants in different human tissues was determined. Here we present evidence for a tissue-specific expression of nNOS first exon variants, with exon 1c being one of the predominant forms in human brain, skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal tissue, and neuroblastoma cells. We furthermore characterize the basal promoter of exon 1c, showing a high complexity with a cooperative binding of several Sp and ZNF family members of transcription factors.

Boldface letters indicate mutated bases. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses for the alternative first exons 1a–1i and exon 6/7 of human nNOS mRNA were performed using an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System instrument (Applied Biosystems). cDNAs for quantitative analysis were generated with the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems) as recommended by the manufacturer, using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, random hexamer primers, and 5 μg of total RNA from human rectum and from TGW-nu-I, ME-180, and HeLa cells. In addition, total RNA obtained from CLONTECH and isolated from pooled human brain and skeletal muscle was used. nNOS transcripts were amplified with intron-spanning, isoform-specific primers and probes complementary to the alternative first exons 1a–1i (forward primers) and the common exon 2 (reverse primer, probe). As a parameter for total nNOS mRNA expression, an intron-spanning pair of exon 6- and exon 7-specific primers present in all known human nNOS cDNAs was used with an exon 7-specific internal probe. Primers and TaqMan probes were designed to meet specific criteria by using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). The 5′-end of the probe was labeled with a fluorescent reporter (6-carboxy-fluorescein (FAM)) and the 3′-end with a quencher dye (6-carboxyltetramethylrhodamine). Sequences of primers and fluorescent probes used in the study are shown in Table I.GAPDH, HPRT, and TF2D primers and probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The principle of real-time RT-PCR has been described in detail elsewhere (32Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 33Bustin S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (3011) Google Scholar). Briefly, real-time PCR is based on a sequence-specific probe labeled with a 5′ reporter and 3′ quencher dye. When the probe is intact, reporter dye emission is quenched, but during the extension phase of the PCR, the nucleolytic activity of theTaq-DNA polymerase cleaves the hybridized probe, and due to the separation of reporter and quencher dye a fluorescence signal is released that is monitored by the sequence detector. A computer algorithm normalizes the signal to an internal reference (ΔRn) and calculates the threshold cycle number (C t), when ΔRn becomes equal to 10 standard deviations of the baseline. C t is used for quantification of the input mRNA number. For each amplicon, the amount of target and endogenous reference (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, HPRT, TF2D) was determined from a standard curve generated by serial 5-fold dilutions (25,000 to 8 copies) of plasmids containing the respective target sequence. The standard curve was amplified in triplicate during every experiment, and the amount of target gene was normalized by the endogenous reference. Quantitative PCR was performed using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), with cDNAs corresponding to 100 ng of total RNA, 200 nm probe, and 900 nmprimers in a 25-μl final reaction mix (1 PCR cycle 50 °C, 2 min; 95 °C, 10 min; 50 PCR cycles 60 °C, 1 min; 95 °C, 15 s). Signals were analyzed by the ABI Prism Sequence Detection System software version 1.7 (Applied Biosystems). The 5′-flanking region of human nNOS exon 1c was determined by rapid amplification of genomic ends (RAGE) using the human GenomeWalker kit (CLONTECH) as previously described (12Saur D. Paehge H. Schusdziarra V. Allescher H.D. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Digested and adapter-ligated genomic DNA fragments obtained from CLONTECH were amplified in a first round of PCR (seven cycles 94 °C, 25 s; 72 °C, 7 min and 32 cycles 94 °C, 25 s; 67 °C, 7 min adding 5 s each cycle) using the antisense gene-specific primer GSP1-AS/ex 1c (10 pmol) (for all primers see Table I) and the sense generic primer AP1 from CLONTECH specific for the ligated adapters. The second round of PCR was performed with nested antisense gene-specific primer GSP2-AS/ex 1c (10 pmol) and sense generic primer AP2 (5 cycles 94 °C, 25 s; 72 °C, 7 min; 20 cycles 94 °C, 25 s; 67 °C 7 min adding 5 s each cycle). PCR products were cloned into pCRII plasmid and subjected to commercial sequence analysis (GATC). The BLASTn program was employed to search for sequence identity. Potential cis-acting DNA sequences and putative consensus elements were identified by analysis with the MatInspector professional software (Genomatix Software GmbH, Munich, Germany) using the Transfac data base. The human genomic 5′-flanking region of nNOS exon 1c was obtained by 5′-RAGE PCR. To create a 5940-bp fragment containing the promoter of exon 1c (nt −5891 to +49), 100 ng of genomic DNA was PCR-amplified (30 cycles at 94 °C, 20 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 7 min) using a proofreading polymerase (Pwo, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) and the primers P-5891 (sense) and P+49 (antisense) (see TableI for primer sequences). The gel-purified PCR product was blunt end-cloned into the SmaI site of the promoter-/enhancerless firefly luciferase reporter gene vector pGL3-basic (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) in the forward (pGL3−5891/+49) and reverse (pGL3+49/−5891) orientation. Reporter gene constructs containing 5′ and 3′ deletions of the promoter region of nNOS exon 1c were generated by PCR, exonuclease III/S1 nuclease digestion, or restriction endonuclease digestion. pGL3−2774/+49, pGL3−1938/+49, pGL3−1520/+49 and pGL3−332/+49 were prepared by PCR and blunt end cloning similar to the preparation of pGL3−5891/+49, using the sense primers P-2774, P-1938, P-1520, and P-332 combined with the common antisense primer P+49. For construction of pGL3−5891/−279, sense primer P-5891 was used with antisense primer P-279. pGL3−226/+49 was prepared by restriction endonuclease digestion of pGL3−332/+49 with PflmI andMluI, followed by blunting and religation. Additional 5′ deletions of pGL3−332/+49 (pGL3−278/+49, pGL3−241/+49, pGL3−174/+49, pGL3−131/+49, pGL3−90/+49, pGL3−83/+49, pGL3−63/+49, pGL3−48/+49, pGL3−34/+49, pGL3−24/+49, pGL3−14/+49, pGL3−4/+49, pGL3 + 18/+49), were prepared by successive exonuclease III and S1 nuclease digestions and re-ligations. pGL3−90/+49 Sp1/ZNF42-M1, containing a point mutation of the common Sp1 and ZNF42 binding site, pGL3−90/+49 Sp1-M2, containing only a mutated Sp1 element, pGL3−90/+49 Ap2/Olf-1-M, containing a mutation of the common Ap2 and Olf-1 binding site, and pGL3−90/+49 Staf-M, containing a mutated Staf consensus sequence (common binding site for ZNF76 and ZNF143), were prepared by PCR using the common antisense primer P+49 combined with the following sense primers: P-90 Sp1/ZNF42-M1, P-90 Sp1-M2, P-90 Ap2/Olf-1-M, and P-90 Staf-M. Gel-purified PCR products were blunt end-cloned into pGL3-basic in the forward orientation. Mutations and deletions of the common Sp1/ZNF42 binding site, the Staf binding site, and both the Sp1/ZNF42 and Staf binding sites in the longer promoter constructs pGL3−5981/+49 and pGL3−332/+49 were generated by using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) exactly as described by the manufacturer with the following primers: SDM-Sp1/ZNF42-M1 (mutation of the Sp1/ZNF42 binding site), SDM-Sp1/ZNF42-del (deletion of the Sp1/ZNF42 binding site), SDM-Staf-M (mutation of the Staf binding site), SDM-Staf-del (deletion of the Staf binding site), SDM-Staf/Sp1/ZNF42-M1 (mutation of the Staf and Sp1/ZNF42 binding sites), and SDM-Staf/Sp1/ZNF42-del (deletion of the Staf and Sp1/ZNF42 binding sites). To construct plasmids that express the transcription factors ZNF42, ZNF76, and ZNF143 from theDrosophila actin promoter, the eukaryotic expression vectors CB6-ZNF42 (alternative name CB6-MZF-1), pcDNA3 ZNF76, and pcDNA3 ZNF143 were used as templates for PCR to generate DNAs containing the complete coding sequences of these transcription factors. Primers for ZNF42 contained XhoI, and primers for ZNF76 and ZNF143 contained BamHI restriction sites and a Kozak consensus sequence upstream of the ATG start codon. TheXhoI and BamHI restriction sites were used to clone the coding sequences of ZNF42, ZNF76, and ZNF143 into the respective XhoI or BamHI sites of the expression plasmid pPac0, which contains only the Drosophila actin promoter. Integrity of all cloned sequences was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (GATC) using an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). HeLa cells were cultured and transiently cotransfected with the different nNOS exon 1c-pGL3 promoter gene constructs and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter-drivenRenilla luciferase expression vector pRL-TK (Promega) to normalize for transfection efficiency and cell number essentially as described previously (12Saur D.

Studies on the mechanism have shown that chronic ethanol consumption induces P450 enzymes that increase RA degradation, thus accounting for much but not all of the observed decrease in RA. A reduction in RA synthesis may also be involved as ethanol competitively inhibits retinol oxidation catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)in vitro. This may be important during acute ethanol intoxication and may contribute to adverse retinol/ethanol drug interactions. Here we have examined mice for the effect of either acute ethanol intoxication or Adh1 gene disruption on RA synthesis and degradation. RA produced following a dose of retinol (50 mg/kg) was reduced 87% by pretreatment with an intoxicating dose of ethanol (3.5 g/kg). RA produced inAdh1-null mutant mice following a 50-mg/kg dose of retinol was reduced 82% relative to wild-type mice, thus similar to wild-type mice pretreated with ethanol. Reduced RA production was associated with increased retinol levels in both ethanol-treated wild-type mice andAdh1-null mutant mice, indicating reduced clearance of the retinol dose. RA degradation following a dose of RA (10 mg/kg) was increased only 42% by ethanol pretreatment (3.5 g/kg) and only 26% inAdh1-null mutant mice relative to wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that the reduced RA levels observed during acute retinol/ethanol drug interaction are due primarily to a decrease in ADH-catalyzed RA synthesis and secondarily to an increase in RA degradation.

Retinoid activation is performed by enzymes that first oxidize retinol to retinal followed by oxidation of retinal to RA. Many of the retinoid-metabolizing enzymes identified in vitro are members of the same families of alcohol- and aldehyde-metabolizing dehydrogenases that oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde and acetaldehyde to acetic acid (i.e. alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), respectively) (17Duester G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4315-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Deactivation of RA by oxidation to more polar metabolites can be performed by various cytochrome P450 enzymes (18Roberts E.S. Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 427-433PubMed Google Scholar, 19White J.A. Guo Y.D. Baetz K. Beckett-Jones B. Bonasoro J. Hsu K.E. Dilworth F.J. Jones G. Petkovich M. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, the steady-state level of RA is dependent upon the activities of both synthesizing and degrading enzymes. It has been reported that chronic ethanol treatment of rats leads to a reduction in RA levels in liver and serum and that this may contribute to ethanol-induced liver carcinogenesis (21Wang X.D. Liu C. Chung J.Y. Stickel F. Seitz H.K. Russell R.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Further studies on the mechanism have indicated that much, but not all, of the decrease in RA levels during chronic ethanol treatment can be attributed to an increase in RA degradation by ethanol-inducible CYP2E1, a P450 that was shown to metabolize RA to more polar metabolites (22Liu C. Russell R.M. Seitz H.K. Wang X.D. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, this may not be the case for acute ethanol treatment as it takes days to weeks for CYP2E1 activity to be induced by ethanol (23Lieber C.S. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1997; 257: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism whereby ethanol reduces RA levels may be different depending on whether ethanol administration is acute or chronic. It has been hypothesized that ethanol may reduce RA synthesis by acting as a competitive inhibitor of ADH-catalyzed retinol oxidation (24Duester G. Shean M.L. McBride M.S. Stewart M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Duester G. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1991; 15: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mouse embryos treated acutely with ethanol have reduced levels of RA, which may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of fetal alcohol syndrome (26Deltour L. Ang H.L. Duester G. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Five classes of ADHs are known to exist in humans and mice (27Szalai G. Duester G. Friedman R. Jia H. Lin S. Roe B.A. Felder M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Studies on purified human ADH1 and ADH4 have shown that these enzymes are direct targets of ethanol action because ethanol can competitively inhibit their abilities to catalyze retinol oxidation with K i values of ∼0.04–3.8 mm for ADH1 and 6–12 mm for ADH4 (28Han C.L. Liao C.S., Wu, C.W. Hwong C.L. Lee A.R. Yin S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Kedishvili N.Y. Gough W.H. Davis W.I. Parsons S., Li, T.K. Bosron W.F.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TheseK i values are well within the range of blood alcohol concentrations achieved by moderate or binge drinkers (31Eckardt M.J. File S.E. Gessa G.L. Grant K.A. Guerri C. Hoffman P.L. Kalant H. Koob G.F., Li, T.-K. Tabakoff B. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1998; 22: 998-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and alcoholics have much higher blood ethanol levels (32Lindblad B. Olsson R. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1976; 236: 1600-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, ethanol inhibition of ADH-catalyzed retinol oxidation may be of concern medically as it could result in reduced RA synthesis leading to an inhibition of retinoid signaling or reduced clearance of retinol leading to toxicity. Adverse interactions occur when vitamin A and ethanol are administered simultaneously. This is particularly noticeable in alcoholics who were administered retinol supplements to counter vitamin A deficiency where it was found that retinol/ethanol drug interactions occurred that increased hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicity (33Leo M.A. Lieber C.S. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1999; 69: 1071-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The mechanism of such interactions is not well understood but may relate to the fact that ADHs can utilize both retinol and ethanol as substrates. Genetic studies have demonstrated that Adh1 −/− mice have large deficiencies in the metabolism of both ethanol and retinol, indicating that ADH1 can efficiently metabolize both substratesin vivo (34Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition to a decrease in metabolism of a dose of retinol, Adh1 −/− mice display increased retinol toxicity, indicating that clearance of retinol to RA is protective against retinol toxicity (35Molotkov A. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13804-13811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These studies have shown that ADH1, expressed at high levels in liver, is the major enzyme responsible for clearance of excess retinol or ethanol. Thus, analogous to the observation that increased retinoid toxicity occurs in vitamin A-treated Adh1 −/− mice, increased retinoid toxicity associated with alcohol consumption may be rooted in the ability of ethanol to inhibit ADH-catalyzed retinol oxidation. Here we have examined RA synthesis and degradation in retinoid-treated wild-type mice either with or without additional exposure to acute ethanol intoxication. We have also compared these results with those obtained from Adh1 −/− mice. Our results indicate that acute ethanol treatment reduces ADH1-catalyzed metabolism of a dose of retinol resulting in decreased RA synthesis, but in addition there is also an increase in RA degradation that accounts for some additional loss in RA. The wild-type andAdh1 −/−-null mutant mice used here have been described (34Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Both strains are on the same genetic background: 50% C57Bl/6, 25% Black Swiss, and 25% 129/SvJ. All mice examined were matched for age, weight, and sex. When used, ethanol was administered intraperitoneally as one acute dose at 3.5 g/kg (18 μl of 25% ethanol in physiological saline per gram of body weight) as previously described (34Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Control injections consisted of the same volume of physiological saline. Injections were performed 30 min prior to retinol or RA injection. Retinoids were administered orally essentially as described (36Collins M.D. Eckhoff C. Chahoud I. Bochert G. Nau H. Arch. Toxicol. 1992; 66: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All-trans-retinol or all-trans-RA (Sigma) were dissolved in acetone/Tween 20/water (0.25:5:4.75, v/v/v) and were administered by oral injection at a dose of 50 mg/kg for retinol or 10 mg/kg for RA. At several time points following retinoid injection, blood was collected and stored at −20 °C until HPLC analysis as described below. Serum (200 μl) was extracted with 2 ml of methanol/acetone (50:50, v/v). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the organic phase was evaporated under vacuum and the residue was dissolved in 200 μl of methanol/dimethyl sulfoxide (50:50, v/v). Samples were analyzed by HPLC to quantitate retinoid levels using standards for all-trans-RA and all-trans-retinol (Sigma). Reversed-phase HPLC analysis was performed using a MICROSORB-MVTM 100 C18 column (4.5 × 250 mm) (Varian) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Mobile phase consisted of 0.5 mammonium acetate/methanol/acetonitrile (25:65:10, v/v) (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B). The A/B (v/v) gradient composition was: 100:0 at the time of injection, 70:30 at 1 min, 65:35 at 14 min, 0:100 at 16 min. UV detection was carried out at 340 nm. Quantitation of RA synthesis or degradation over time was performed by determining the area under the curve (AUC). Statistical significance was determined for raw data using the unpaired Student's t test (Statistica version 5.0). To examine RA synthesis, mice were treated orally with a single dose of retinol (50 mg/kg), and metabolism to RA was followed over time by quantitation of RA in the serum. RA is normally present in mouse serum at 4 ng/ml (37Satre M.A. Ugen K.E. Kochhar D.M. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 46: 802-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Treatment of wild-type mice with retinol resulted in a peak RA concentration of 1170 ng/ml (Fig.1 A). We have previously shown that treatment of mice with a single intraperitoneal dose of ethanol (3.5 g/kg) results in a peak blood ethanol concentration of ∼90 mm at 30 min after the dose, with the concentration dropping to ∼25 mm at 4-h post-treatment (34Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mice exposed to acute ethanol intoxication in this fashion were examined for RA synthesis as above. Pretreatment of wild-type mice with 3.5 g/kg ethanol 30 min prior to retinol treatment led to a large reduction in serum RA with the peak RA concentration reaching only 180 ng/ml (Fig. 1 A). Comparison of AUC values demonstrated that ethanol pretreatment resulted in an 87% reduction in the level of serum RA (Table I). Whether this is entirely due to a decrease in RA synthesis or whether an increase in RA degradation may also occur during acute ethanol exposure is examined below.Table IArea under curve (AUC) values for the effect of either ethanol or Adh1 gene disruption on all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) synthesis or degradationGenotypeTreatmentall-trans-Retinoic acidΔAUC1-b[AUC (2 or 3) − AUC (1)] × 100 ÷ AUC (1).

Open table in a new tab Treatment of Adh1 −/− mice with 50 mg/kg retinol resulted in a peak serum RA concentration of only 270 ng/ml relative to wild-type mice that exhibited 1170 ng/ml (Fig.1 B). AUC values indicated that disruption of Adh1resulted in an 82% reduction in the level of serum RA following a dose of retinol (Table I). These findings suggest that ADH1 plays a large role in the synthesis of RA from the administered retinol, but the effect of a loss of ADH1 on RA degradation was also examined below. The above mice were also examined for concentration of serum retinol. Although wild-type mice exhibited 1.6 μg/ml serum retinol at 2 h following retinol treatment, pretreatment with ethanol increased serum retinol to 2.5 μg/ml, andAdh1 −/− mice exhibited 3.1 μg/ml (Fig.2). Significant defects in serum retinol clearance due to ethanol pretreatment or Adh1 disruption were also seen at 4 h following retinol treatment (Fig. 2). RA is efficiently metabolized to polar degradation products (38Frolik C.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids, Vo. 2. Academic, Orlando1984: 177-208Google Scholar) leading to a half-life in mouse serum of 0.5–1.0 h (39Armstrong R.B. Ashenfelter K.O. Eckhoff C. Levin A.A. Shapiro S.S. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 545-572Google Scholar). Following treatment of wild-type mice with 10 mg/kg RA, serum RA was quantified over time in order to examine the time course of clearance (degradation). Treatment with this dose of RA resulted in a peak serum RA concentration of 1550 ng/ml (comparable to the peak RA observed when retinol was administered above) with almost complete RA clearance observed at 6 h (Fig.3 A). Pretreatment of wild-type mice with ethanol (3.5 g/kg) 30 min prior to RA treatment resulted in a lower RA peak concentration of 1002 ng/ml (Fig. 3 A). The AUC values indicated that ethanol increased RA clearance (degradation) by 42% (Table I). Although significant, the effect on degradation is not enough to account for the lower RA values observed in Fig.1 A when retinol was metabolized to RA in the presence of ethanol. Treatment of Adh1 −/− mice with 10 mg/kg RA resulted in a peak serum RA concentration of 1250 ng/ml relative to wild-type mice, which exhibited 1550 ng/ml (Fig.3 B). A comparison of AUC values indicated that disruption ofAdh1 resulted in only a 26% increase in RA clearance (TableI). Thus, the effect of Adh1 disruption on RA degradation is low, indicating that the results in Fig. 1 B are primarily due to a decrease in RA synthesis from retinol. The investigation described here indicates that acute alcohol intoxication does in fact reduce metabolism of a dose of retinol and has a negative effect on RA concentration. A single dose of ethanol was shown to decrease RA synthesis and increase RA degradation, with the effect on synthesis being larger. As the peak RA concentrations observed following either 50 mg/kg retinol (1170 ng/ml) or 10 mg/kg RA (1550 ng/ml) are in the same order of magnitude, the studies performed here with retinol treatment or RA treatment can be compared to estimate the relative effect of ethanol on RA synthesis as opposed to degradation. From the AUC calculations it is clear that ethanol decreases the amount of RA measured following retinol treatment by 87%, from an AUC value of 2.93 to 0.37, while increasing RA degradation following RA treatment by 42%. Thus, if one allows that 42% of the ethanol-induced loss of RA following retinol treatment may be due to increased RA degradation, this would only reduce the AUC from 2.93 to 1.70, accounting for an AUC loss of 1.23. As we observed an AUC of 0.37, this indicates that an ethanol-induced decrease in RA synthesis must account for the remaining AUC loss of 1.33. Thus, the effect of acute ethanol on RA synthesis is larger than the effect seen on RA degradation, but both are significant. Further evidence that ethanol inhibits RA synthesis was obtained by our results indicating that the administered retinol was not cleared as efficiently during acute ethanol intoxication. This suggests that oxidation of retinol to retinal by ADH was reduced by ethanol, thus producing less retinal for synthesis of RA. Our studies onAdh1 −/− mice have confirmed that this is the most plausible explanation. In the absence of ethanol,Adh1 −/− mice demonstrated an 82% reduction in RA concentration relative to wild-type mice. This is nearly the same effect that was observed when wild-type mice were treated with ethanol. Examination of the effect of Adh1 disruption on RA degradation indicated that RA degradation was increased by only 26%. Thus, for both Adh1 −/− mice and acute ethanol-treated mice, the negative effect on RA synthesis is still greater than the positive effect on RA degradation. It is unclear why a loss of ADH1 or acute ethanol treatment would increase RA degradation, but it is clear why these conditions would decrease RA synthesis. ADH1 is the most abundant ADH in mouse liver (40Algar E.M. Seeley T.-L. Holmes R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 41Zgombic-Knight M. Ang H.L.

Res. 1997; 21: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and it is the most efficient ADH for ethanol metabolism measured either by in vitro comparison of enzyme activities (40Algar E.M. Seeley T.-L. Holmes R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or by in vivo comparison of ethanol clearance capabilities in wild-type and ADH-deficient mice (34Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). ADH1 is also the most efficient enzyme for metabolism of a dose of retinol to RA with ADH3 (expressed ubiquitously) playing a lesser but still significant role (43Molotkov A. Fan X. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Martras S. Farrés J. Parés X. Duester G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5337-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Adh1 −/− mice do not have noticeable developmental defects, but Adh3 −/− mice have reduced survival and growth that is rescued by retinol supplementation (43Molotkov A. Fan X. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Martras S. Farrés J. Parés X. Duester G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5337-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, ADH3 in contrast to ADH1 has been shown to be necessary for metabolism of retinol to RA when retinol levels are low (physiological). However, a large role for ADH1 in the clearance of pharmacological doses of retinol to prevent toxicity has been demonstrated (i.e. Adh1 −/− mice have increased retinol toxicity as demonstrated by a 3-fold decrease in the LD50 for retinol) (35Molotkov A. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13804-13811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As metabolism of retinol by ADH1 is competitively inhibited by ethanol with a K i of 0.04–3.8 mm (28Han C.L. Liao C.S., Wu, C.W. Hwong C.L. Lee A.R. Yin S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,29Kedishvili N.Y. Gough W.H. Davis W.I. Parsons S., Li, T.K. Bosron W.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the mechanism behind the effects we observed during acute ethanol treatment could involve ethanol inhibition of ADH1-catalyzed retinol metabolism. The dose of ethanol administered here (3.5 g/kg) has been previously shown to result in a peak blood ethanol concentration of 90 mm after 30 min then falling to 20 mm over the subsequent 4 h (34Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, during the 4 h when RA was monitored after this ethanol treatment, there was clearly sufficient ethanol to almost totally inhibit ADH1-catalyzed retinol oxidation. To account for the lower AUC in ethanol-treated wild-type mice (0.37) compared with Adh1 −/− mice (0.52), it is possible that this is due to ethanol inhibition of ADH3 (43Molotkov A. Fan X. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Martras S. Farrés J. Parés X. Duester G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5337-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or yet other ADHs (27Szalai G. Duester G. Friedman R. Jia H. Lin S. Roe B.A. Felder M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that may play minor roles in clearance of excess retinol. Alternatively, the difference may be accounted for by increased RA degradation, because we demonstrated that ethanol-treated mice appeared to show a larger increase in RA degradation thanAdh1 −/− mice. Collectively, the above findings indicate that ADH1 plays a central role in retinol/ethanol drug interactions, thus suggesting that the primary defect leading to adverse interaction may be reduced clearance of retinol to RA through the ADH metabolic pathway. ADH1 metabolism of retinol evidently produces less toxicity than either accumulation of retinol or metabolism through other pathways. In addition, the observations reported here on acute ethanol intoxication demonstrate that ethanol decreases RA synthesis from the administered retinol, although it remains to be tested whether acute treatment reduces endogenous RA levels in mice not treated with retinol. Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic ethanol intoxication does reduce endogenous RA levels in rats, and the mechanism of RA deficiency is dependent to a large extent upon an ethanol-induced increase of CYP2E1-dependent degradation of RA to less active metabolites such as 4-oxo-RA (22Liu C. Russell R.M. Seitz H.K. Wang X.D. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, any effect of ethanol on endogenous RA levels during acute ethanol intoxication (i.e. binge drinking) should be different because CYP2E1 induction requires several days to weeks of continuous ethanol treatment (23Lieber C.S. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1997; 257: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Also, as RA levels during chronic ethanol intoxication were restored to only about 75% of control levels when RA degradation was inhibited by co-administering chlormethiazole, a specific CYP2E1 inhibitor (22Liu C. Russell R.M. Seitz H.K. Wang X.D. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it is unknown what is responsible for the remaining 25% reduction in RA concentration during chronic ethanol intoxication. Our findings here combined with previous studies (43Molotkov A. Fan X. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Martras S. Farrés J. Parés X. Duester G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5337-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) suggest that this may be due to ethanol inhibition of endogenous RA synthesis catalyzed by one or more retinol-utilizing ADHs.

However, the cellular function of hParvulin is entirely unknown.

Thus, these results, coupled with the preferential nuclear localization of hParvulin, suggest that hParvulin may be involved in ribosome biogenesis and/or nucleolar re-assembly of mammalian cells. peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase human parvulin preribosomal ribonucleoprotein ribosomal RNA cyclophilin FK506-binding protein glutathioneS-transferase phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer ribonucleoprotein phosphate-buffered saline Peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases)1 catalyze the rotation about the peptide bond preceding proline; a step that can be rate-limiting for the folding of newly synthesized protein (1Fischer G. Tradler T. Zarnt T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PPIases also have the ability to bind many proteins and to act as chaperones, thus they are believed to regulate folding, assembly, and trafficking and controlling activity of proteins in the cell (2Shieh B.–H. Stamnes M.A. Seavello S. Harris G.L. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1989; 338: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 3Pennisi E. Science. 1996; 274: 1613-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PPIases are most familiar as the targets of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506, which bind to cyclophilin (CyP) and FK506-binding protein (FKBP), respectively (4Takahashi N. Hayano T. Suzuki M. Nature. 1989; 336: 473-475Crossref Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 5Siekierka J.J. Hung S.H.Y. Poe M. Lin C.S. Sigal N.H. Nature. 1989; 341: 755-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Both CyPs and FKBPs are ubiquitous, highly expressed and conserved from bacteria to human. A number of CyP and FKBP homologues have been identified in almost all organisms and in almost every cellular compartment of the cell (6Takahashi N. Ohmura S. Macrolide Antibiotics: Chemistry Biology and Practice. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Bellingham2002Google Scholar). Their ubiquitous presence strongly suggests that PPIases have some general cellular functions as protein foldases and chaperones. However, all mutants with a defect in single and multiple PPIase (CyPs and FKBPs) genes were viable with no remarkable phenotype in yeast (7Tanida I. Yanagida M. Maki N. Yagi S. Namiyama F. Kobayashi T. Hayano T. Takahashi N. Suzuki M. Transplant. Proc. 1992; 23: 2856-2861Google Scholar, 8Dolinski K. Muri S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus, the general role of PPIases as protein foldases and chaperones in the cell has been difficult to elucidate in vivo and is still controversial. Despite this uncertainty of the role of PPIase in protein folding, the unique functions in higher organisms have been reported for some of the CyPs and FKBPs. For example, CyPA, which is the most abundant cytosolic PPIase, modulates human HIV-1 infectivity through controlling Gag processing, in which CyPA regulates cleavage of Gag polypeptide by HIV-1 protease through its ability to catalyze cis-trans interconversion of the proline-peptide bond around the cleavage site of the Gag polypeptide (9Streblow D.N. Kitabwalla M. Malkovsky M. Pauza C.D. Virology. 1998; 245: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Gottlinger H.G.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). NinaA, which is one of the isoforms of CyPA, has been definitively shown to be involved in the trafficking and maturation of specific isoforms of rhodopsins inDrosophila photoreceptor cells (2Shieh B.–H. Stamnes M.A. Seavello S. Harris G.L. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1989; 338: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 11Ferreira P.A. Nakayama T.A. Pak W.L. Travis G.H. Nature. 1996; 383: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the case of FKBP12, it is involved in heart formation in mice through its ability to regulate the activity of calcium ion channels (14Shou W. Aghdas B. Armstrong D.L. Guo Q. Bao S. Chang M.-J. Mathews L.M. Schneider M.D. Hamilton S.L. Matzuk M.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The third family of PPIases, the parvulins, is also conserved from bacteria to human. Parvulin, which was found initially inEscherichia coli cells, has only 92 residues, and is the smallest member in the PPIase families (15Rahfeld J.U. Rucknagel K.P. Schelbert B. Ludwig B. Hacker J. Mann K. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). E. coliparvulin was also shown to catalyze prolyl isomerization not only in short peptides, but also in protein folding reactions in vitro (16Scholz C. Rahfeld J. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 752-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Homologues of the E. coli parvulin are present in fungi (Ssp1) (17Kops O. Eckerskorn C. Hottenrott S. Fischer G., Mi, H.F.

Miklos G.L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and human (Pin1) (20Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). All of these homologues have a unique WW protein-protein interaction domain extending amino-terminal to the catalytic PPIase domain. The WW domain is able to bind the specifically phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motif (21Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), and the catalytic PPIase domain preferentially isomerizes proline residues preceded by phosphorylated Ser or Thr with more than a 1000-fold selectivity compared with unphosphorylated peptides (22Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.-U., Xu, J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Although none of the CyPs and FKBPs have been reported to be essential in any of the species so far analyzed, at least yeast Ess1 is essential (23Hanes S.D. Shank P.R. Bostian K.A. Yeast. 1989; 5: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and its defect is complemented by its homologues from other species including human (20Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). By a combination of genetic and biochemical experiments, Ess1 was shown to function in transcription machinery by associating to the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II; it was proposed that Ess1 together with a CyP control the recruitment of transcriptional regulatory factors, such as Sin3-Rpd3 histone deacetylase, via their interactions with the carboxyl-terminal domain (24Wu X. Wilcox C.B. Devasahayam G. Hackett R.L. Arevalo-Rodriguez M. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Hanes S.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3727-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25Arevalo-Rodriguez M. Cardenas M.E., Wu, X. Hanes S.D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3739-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, depletion of human Pin1 from HeLa cells was reported to induce mitotic arrest and its overexpression arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (20Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Thus, Pin1 is an essential PPIase that regulates mitosis in the human cell. However, the knockouts of the dodo andPin1 genes did not show the lethal phenotype inDrosophila and mice, respectively, indicating functional redundancy in higher eukaryotes (26Maleszka R. Lupas A. Hanes S.D. Miklos G.L.G. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 203: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Fujimori F. Takahashi K. Uchida C. Uchida T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition to Pin1, a second PPIase (hParvulin, Par14/EPVH) belonging to the parvulin family has been identified in all human tissues so far analyzed (28Rulten S. Thorpe J. Kay J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Uchida T. Fujimori F. Tradler T. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.–U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 279-282Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This hParvulin consists of 131 amino acid residues, and has an amino-terminal tail of 35 amino acid residues, which does not show sequence homology to a WW domain of Pin1. The carboxyl-terminal domain with 96 amino acid residues has 34.2% sequence homology to the PPIase domain of Pin1. Although hParvulin has been reported to have substrate specificity with preference not for phosphorylated Thr or Ser, but for positively charged residues preceding proline, its rate constant of prolyl cis to trans isomerization is at least 1000-fold lower than those of CyPs and FKBPs (29Uchida T. Fujimori F. Tradler T. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.–U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 279-282Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The NMR solution structural analysis showed that hParvulin folds into a βα3βαβ2 structure that was essentially the same as that of human Pin1, and contained an unstructured 35-amino acid basic tail amino-terminal to the PPIase catalytic core that replaces the WW domain of human Pin1 homologues (30Sekerina E. Rahfeld J.U. Muller J. Fanghanel J. Rascher C. Fischer G. Bayer P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Terada T. Shirouzu M. Fukumori Y. Fujimori F. Ito Y. Kigawa T. Yokoyama S. Uchida T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The structural model provided the molecular basis for preferential substrate specificity to positively charged residues preceding proline, and for the putative role of the amino-terminal 35-amino acid tail as a DNA-associating segment. However, the cellular function of hParvulin is not understood. Here we report proteomic analysis of the nuclear complexes bound to hParvulin. We found that the hParvulin-associating complexes isolated contained pre-rRNAs and ribosomal proteins, as well as other proteins, many of which are known or expected to be involved in rRNA processing and assembly of ribosomal proteins. These findings coupled with the other results suggest that hParvulin is a component of the pre-rRNP complexes formed at an early stage of ribosome biogenesis. Mouse fibroblast cell line L929 cells, human kidney cell line 293EBNA, and human HeLa cells were obtained from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands).

T4 polynucleotide kinase, dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and LA TaqDNA polymerase were from TAKARA (Osaka, Japan). All other reagents were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Drs. F. Fujimori and T. Uchida kindly provided the expression vector (pGEX-4T-1) containing the gene coding for hParvulin (Par14) that is fused amino-terminal to GST through a short sequence with a thrombin cleavage site. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transfected with the pGEX-4T-1 vector and were grown in LB medium (1.0% Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% Bacto-yeast extract, 1.0% NaCl, and 1 mm NaOH), containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). After the induction of protein expression with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside atA 600 = 0.7, BL21(DE3) cells were grown for a further 4 h at 37 °C and were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed in sodium phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), containing 2 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, sonicated, and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysates were affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads and eluted with reduced glutathione as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-hParvulin eluate was fractionated with ammonium sulfate, and was used for further experiments after dialysis against PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Mammalian cells were grown in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 160 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2. Cultured cells were lysed in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, containing 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm glycerol phosphate, 10 mm Na3VO4, 5 μg/ml PMSF, 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin and pepstatin A), and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cytosolic fraction was obtained as the supernatant by centrifugation of the lysate at 4 °C for 3 min at 1,000 rpm, and the precipitate was used as the nuclear pellet. The cytosol fraction and the nuclear pellet were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. After confirmation of the purity of the nuclear pellet under fluorescent microscopy BX50 FLA (KS Olympus, Tokyo Japan), it was sonicated on ice in buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmNaF, 40 mm glycerol phosphate, 10 mmNa3VO4, 5 μg/ml PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, plus 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1% sodium deoxycholate), and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as nuclear extract. The nuclear extract and cytosolic fraction were preincubated with Sepharose CL-6B for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, respectively. The supernatant was filtered with a filtrating membrane with a 0.45-μm pore size, and was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (50 μl) that were preincubated with GST-hParvulin for 1 h at 4 °C. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed five times in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmEGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm glycerol phosphate, 10 mm Na3VO4, 5 μg/ml PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A), and subsequently twice with buffer D (buffer C except PMSF and aprotinin) before thrombin treatment. The hParvulin-associating complexes were released from the glutathione-Sepharose beads by cleaving between GST and hParvulin with 5 units of thrombin in 50 μl of buffer D for 2 h at 16 °C. As a control, GST bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was also pulled down with the nuclear extract and cytosolic fraction, respectively. Peptide preparation after SDS-PAGE was done according to the method described by Yanagida et al. (32Yanagida M. Miura Y. Yagasaki K. Taoka M. Isobe T. Takahashi N. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1890-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The peptide mixture was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and aliquots of 0.5 μl were applied onto a target disk and allowed to air dry. Peptide mass fingerprint was obtained using a PE Biosystems MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (MS) (Voyager DE-STR, Foster City, CA). The data base-fitting program MS-Fit available at the World Wide Web site at the University of California, San Francisco (prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml3.4/msfit.htm), was used to interpret MS spectra of protein digests (33Yanagida M. Shimamoto A. Nishikawa K. Furuichi Y. Isobe T. Takahashi N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1390-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A protein was considered identified when the spectrum of its measured peptide masses met the previously established criteria for positive identification of proteins using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and automated data base analysis (33Yanagida M. Shimamoto A. Nishikawa K. Furuichi Y. Isobe T. Takahashi N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1390-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). First, to distinguish a valid match from a false positive, a minimum of five measured peptide masses must match tryptic peptide masses calculated for an individual protein in the data base with <50-ppm average deviation in mass between measured and calculated values. Second, the peptides identified by these matches must provide at least 15% sequence coverage of the identified protein. Incomplete tryptic cleavage and peptide modifications that may alter the peptide masses, such as oxidized methionine or carbamidomethyl cysteine, were calculated for the putatively identified protein and compared with the measured masses. The modified peptides identified in the search were added to the list to increase the number of matching peptides and sequence coverage. Protein that revealed the highest scored peptide mass fingerprint matching by data base search was retrieved as the identified protein. The nuclear extract was incubated with GST-hParvulin bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The hParvulin-associating complex on the glutathione-Sepharose beads was washed 5 times with buffer C and incubated with 5 μg/ml RNase A in buffer C at 37 °C for 5 min. After washing twice with buffer D, GST-hParvulin on the Sepharose beads was cleaved with thrombin, and the eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The GST-hParvulin was also pulled down with the cell lysate pretreated with 5 μg/ml RNase A or ethidium bromide at 37 °C for 5 min. For construction of a direct expression vector for hParvulin, a cDNA fragment containing the entire hParvulin gene was amplified by PCR using a primer set, 5′-ATCGGATCCGCGCACATTCTATGTGAAAAA-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTTATCTGACCTTTACTGCATTG-3′ from the GST-fused hParvulin expression plasmid as a template, and was inserted into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pET-3a plasmid (Novagen, Madison, WI). The protein expression was done with the BL21(DE3) strain. cDNA fragments for hParvulin deletion mutants comprising the amino-terminal 41-residue domain and the carboxyl-terminal PPIase domain were amplified by PCR using primer sets, 5′-ATCGGATCCGCGCACATTCTATGTGAAAAA-3′ and 5′-CGAATTCTTATTTTCTTCCTTCGACCATAA-3′, and 5′-CTGGATCCATGCCGCCCAAAGGAAAAAGTG-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTTATCTGACCTTTACTGCATTG-3′, respectively, from the full-length cDNA of the hParvulin gene as a template. The amplified cDNA fragments were digested with restriction enzymes whose sites were tagged with primers, BamHI and EcoRI, and subcloned downstream of a sequence encoding the NH2-terminal-tagged GST in a pGEX-2T-based vector (Fig.1). For construction of epitope-tagged expression plasmids, a DNA fragment encoding human parvulin with the FLAG tag at its amino termini was amplified by PCR, by using a human placenta cDNA library (ORIGENE) as a template. A primer set used for PCR was 5′-ATATAGCTAGCGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAGCCGCCCAAAGGAAAAAGTGGT-3′/5′-TATATGGATCCTTATTTTCTTCCTTCGACCAT-3′. The resulting fragment was introduced between the NheI andBamHI sites of the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) (Fig. 1). RNAs were prepared from the hParvulin-associating complexes by the RNAgents Total RNA Isolation System, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. The RNAs obtained were fractionated on 1.0% agarose gels containing 1.1m formaldehyde and were transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membranes as described (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An oligodeoxyribonucleotide 5′-TCAGACAGGCGTAGCCCCGGGAGGAACCCG-3′, which is complementary to nucleotides 6996–7025 of the mouse rDNA sequence, was labeled at the 5′-end by T4 polynucleotide kinase with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences), and was used as a probe for 5.8 S rRNA. DNA fragments corresponding to nucleotides 901–1100, 4434–4633, 7201–7410, and 9257–9455 of the mouse rDNA were amplified by PCR, in which 30-base oligodeoxyribonucleotides of both ends of each fragment were used as primers, and were used for 5′ETS, 18S, ITS2, and 28S probes, respectively (Fig. 2). These probes were labeled by PCR using a reaction mixture that contained 1 ng of the amplified fragments described above, 0.5 μm of the primers, 0.2 mm dTTP, dATP, and dGTP, 1 unit of LATaqDNA polymerase, 125 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 2 mm MgCl2. After incubation in prehybridization solution, which consists of 6 × SSPE (1 × SSPE is 0.18 m NaCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, and 1 mm EDTA), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 90 μg/ml heat denatured salmon sperm DNA, at 42 °C for 2 h, the RNA blots were hybridized to the probes at 42 °C overnight in the prehybridization solution containing 5 × 105 cpm. The blots were washed three times with 2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min and twice with 0.2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 56 °C for 15 min. They were exposed to the PhosphorScreen and were analyzed by STORMTM (Molecular Dynamics Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Human 293EBNA cells were cultured in 8-well culture slides (Biocoat, BD PharMingen) and transfected with the expression plasmid DNA containing theFlag-hParvulin gene using LipofectAMINE. The transfected cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. After washing with PBS, the cells were treated with 3% (w/v) skim milk in PBS at room temperature. The cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml mouse anti-FLAG IgG as the first antibody overnight at 4 °C. After another washing with PBS the cells was further incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as the second antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescent images were visualized with a confocal laser-scanning microscope Fluoview (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Despite the availability of information from the three-dimensional structure at atomic resolution and the enzymatic substrate specificity of hParvulin (29Uchida T. Fujimori F. Tradler T. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.–U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 279-282Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Sekerina E. Rahfeld J.U. Muller J. Fanghanel J. Rascher C. Fischer G. Bayer P. J. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 305: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), its cellular function is entirely unknown. Therefore, we tried to search its associating proteins by using a currently developed proteomic approach with the hope of identifying possible functional linkage to the proteins whose cellular functions are well established. For this purpose, we used an affinity tag, GST with a thrombin cleavage site, incorporated into hParvulin at the NH2 terminus to precipitate hParvulin-associating proteins from the fractionated cell extracts of mouse L929 cells. Since hParvulin was reported to be present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm (28Rulten S. Thorpe J. Kay J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Uchida T. Fujimori F. Tradler T. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.–U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 279-282Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we expected to precipitate associating proteins from both the cytosolic fraction and the nuclear extract. However, hParvulin-associating proteins were obtained mostly from the nuclear extract of L929 cells (Fig.3 A). We recognized at least 65 staining bands as the hParvulin-associating proteins on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3 A). The presence of hParvulin-associating proteins in nuclear extract was also ascertained by use of the fractionated cell extracts from human HeLa and 293EBNA cells (Fig. 3, B andC). Thus, hParvulin has the ability to pull down proteins present in the nuclear extracts of mammalian cells so far examined, suggesting that it plays a major role in the nucleus of mammalian cells. This is supported by its preferential presence in the nucleus of 293EBNA cells examined by using the FLAG-tagged hParvulin molecules (Fig. 4).Figure 4Cellular localization of FLAG-tagged hParvulin in 293EBNA cells. FLAG-hParvulin was detected with mouse anti-FLAG IgG as the first antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as the second antibody. The transmitted picture is indicated at the right side of the immunostained picture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We could retrieve 62 unique proteins for the hParvulin-associating proteins by use of the data base-fitting program MS-Fit after in-gel digestion and MALDI-TOF mass analysis of protein staining bands excised from SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 5). Of these, 15 ribosomal proteins and 23 non-ribosomal proteins were identified directly by mass data searching as known proteins (Supplementary Tables I and II). The 15 ribosomal proteins identified include L3, L6, L7, L7a (surfeit 3), L8, L10, L10A, L13a-mutant, L17, L21, L26, P0, S3, S3a, and S9. Of the 23 non-ribosomal proteins, 13 proteins are the trans-acting factors or proteins expected to be involved in ribosomal biogenesis; these include CCAAT-binding factor 1 (homologue of yeast Mak21p), Bop1 (homologue of yeast Erb1p), nucleolin (homologue of yeast Nsr1p), similar to nucleolar GTPase (homologue of yeast Nog2p), similar to nucleolar protein 1 (homologue of yeast Nop2p), nucleolar protein Nop5/58 (SIK similar protein), NNP-1 (homologue of yeast Rrp1p), nuclear protein Ytm1 (mammalian counterpart of yeast Ytm1p), fibrillarin (homologue of yeast Nop1p), p68 RNA helicase TNZ2, nucleolar RNA helicase II/Gu DDX21, ATP-dependent RNA helicases DDX24, and dead box protein 15 (Supplementary Table II). The remaining proteins retrieved (24 proteins) were putative, hypothetical, or unnamed protein products. Therefore, we performed computer analysis with the program FASTA (version 3.2t09; Ref.62Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S.

MutY is a base excision repair (BER) glycosylase that removes misincorporated adenine residues from OG:A mispairs, as well as G:A and C:A mispairs. We have previously shown that, under conditions of low MutY concentrations relative to an OG:A or G:A substrate, the time course of the adenine glycosylase reaction exhibits biphasic kinetic behavior due to slow release of the DNA product by MutY. The dissociation of MutY from its product may require the recruitment of other proteins from the BER pathway, such as an apurinic-apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, as turnover-enhancing cofactors. The effect of the AP endonucleases endonuclease IV (Endo IV), exonuclease III (Exo III), and Ape1 on the reaction kinetics of MutY with G:A- and OG:A-containing substrates was investigated. The effect of the glycosylases UDG and MutM and the DNA polymerase pol I was also characterized. Endo IV and Exo III, unlike Ape1, UDG, and pol I, greatly enhance the rate of product release with a G:A substrate, whereas the rate constant for the adenine removal step remains unchanged. Furthermore, the turnover rate with a truncated form of MutY, Stop 225, which lacks 125 amino acids of the C terminus, is unaffected by the presence of Endo IV or Exo III. These results constitute the first evidence of an interaction between the MutY-product DNA complex and Endo IV or Exo III. Furthermore, they suggest a role for the C-terminal domain of MutY in mediating this interaction.

Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). BER relies on the action of damage-specific DNA glycosylases that recognize various types of modified or inappropriate bases within the context of normal Watson-Crick DNA (2David, S. S., and Williams, S. D. (1998) Chem. Rev. 1221–1261Google Scholar). The repair process is initiated by hydrolytic removal of the target base by the relevant DNA glycosylase and proceeds by incision at the abasic site, generation of a gap, reparative DNA synthesis, and ligation of the nicked DNA (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 3Schärer O.D. Jiricny J. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The BER pathway has been reconstituted in vitro with cell-free extracts or purified protein components, and these experiments have established the minimal requirements for restoration of the damaged DNA (4Matsumoto Y.

For example, repair of uracil in DNA was achieved by use of fiveEscherichia coli proteins: uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), endonuclease IV (an AP endonuclease), RecJ protein, DNA polymerase I, and DNA ligase (7Dianov G. Lindahl T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1069-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Both “short patch” and “long patch” BER pathways have been observed, which differ in the number of nucleotides and the various protein components involved (12Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O.

Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The type of BER pathway utilized depends on the organism and the type of DNA damage; however, minimally the BER pathway requires a damage-specific glycosylase, an AP endonuclease, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase. The DNA glycosylases of BER may be classified into two distinct classes: 1) monofunctional glycosylases, which catalyze the removal of the damaged base to generate an apurinic or apyrimidinic (AP) site and 2) bifunctional glycosylase/AP-lyases, which catalyze base displacement and an associated β-elimination reaction to provide strand scission (2David, S. S., and Williams, S. D. (1998) Chem. Rev. 1221–1261Google Scholar, 14Dodson M.L. Michaels M.L. Lloyd S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32709-32712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AP site products of monofunctional glycosylases are unstable and degrade autocatalytically to generate DNA strand breaks (15Lindahl T. Mutat. Res. 1990; 238: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The presence of AP sites in DNA impedes DNA synthesis with many DNA polymerases and may also be potentially mutagenic due to lack of base coding information (16Barzilay G. Hickson I.D. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The potent cytotoxicity of these sites behooves the repair machinery to insert the appropriate base without leaving the AP site exposed at any time. In keeping with this imperative, many DNA glycosylases, including the human thymine DNA glycosylase (hTDG), human uracil DNA glycosylase (hUDG), human OG glycosylase (hOGG1), human MED1 protein, E. colidouble-stranded uracil DNA glycosylase (DUG), and the adenine glycosylase MutY have been reported to bind very tightly to their respective AP site products (17Waters T.R.

Presumably, these glycosylases remain bound to their AP site product until cellular components, which will complete the repair process, are recruited. The enzymes in charge of recognizing AP sites and catalyzing cleavage of the DNA backbone are AP endonucleases. The ability of the human AP endonuclease Ape1 (also called HAP1, APEX, REF1) to enhance release of the DNA product in vitro from hUDG (19Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Slupphaug G. Bharati S. Krokan H.E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) has been demonstrated recently. This suggests a direct interaction between the AP endonuclease and the BER glycosylase·AP site DNA product complex. In eukaryotes, specific interactions between enzymes downstream of the glycosylase in the BER pathway have also been uncovered. For example, Ape1 has been found to make protein·protein contacts with polymerase β (27Bennett R.O. Wilson D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), which, in turn, interacts directly with DNA ligase I (28Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Johnson P. Shall S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Some interactions occur indirectly using a third protein as a mediator, as is the case for polymerase β and ligase III, which are connected via the scaffolding protein XRCC1 (9Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Structural studies of BER enzymes and their substrate and product complexes have also suggested coordination between enzymes of the BER pathway (3Schärer O.D. Jiricny J. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 29Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Hosfield D.J. Tainer J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Two AP endonucleases, exonuclease III (Exo III) and endonuclease IV (Endo IV), are well characterized in E. coli (2David, S. S., and Williams, S. D. (1998) Chem. Rev. 1221–1261Google Scholar, 30Demple B. Bailey E. Bennett R.A.O. Masuda Y. Wong D. Xu Y.-J. Dizdaroglu M. Karakaya A.E. Advances in DNA Damage and Repair. Karakaya Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York1999: 59-66Crossref Google Scholar). Both enzymes nick the DNA strand on the 5′ side of the AP site resulting in 5′-deoxyribose phosphate and 3′-deoxyribose-hydroxyl end products. Despite their similar substrate specificity, the primary sequences of these two enzymes are different. Exo III is the major AP endonuclease in E. coli (31Doestch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutation Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 32Mol C.D. Kuo C.-F. Thayer M.M. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and is homologous to the human AP endonuclease Ape1 (33Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Exo III also possesses a potent 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. Endo IV belongs to a second group of AP endonucleases that includes a variety of homologs thus far only identified in bacteria and simple eukaryotic organisms such as APN-1 in yeast (36Popoff S.C.

Gene. 1996; 179: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The in vitro reconstitution studies reported for the bacterial BER pathway utilized Endo IV as the AP endonuclease, suggesting that this protein may be responsible for the step following base removal by DNA glycosylases in vivo (7Dianov G. Lindahl T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1069-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar,10Harrison L. Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Indeed, APN-1 null yeast strains are strong mutators resulting in a 60-fold increase in the rate of AT → CG transversions and a hypersensitivity to AP site-generating species (39Kunz B.A. Henson E.S. Roche H. Ramotar D. Nunoshiba T. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8165-8169Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The prevention of mutations associated with formation of OG within duplex DNA in E. coli relies on two BER glycosylases: MutY and MutM (also called Fpg) (40Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriology. 1992; 174: 6321-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). MutM is an OG glycosylase specific for removal of OG opposite C. The MutY enzyme prevents mutations caused by OG by removing misincorporated adenine residues, thereby short-circuiting G:C → T:A transversion mutations (41Michaels M.L. Cruz C. Grollman A.P.

Indeed, the importance of the “GO” repair system in humans has recently been highlighted by the finding of a family with colorectal tumors that have inherited variants of human MutY (hMYH) (49Al-Tassan N.

The adenine glycosylase MutY is composed of two domains that are susceptible to separation upon partial proteolytic digestion (53Manuel R.C. Czerwinski E.W. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16218-16226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (Met-1 to Lys-225) retains catalytic activity (54Manuel R.C. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11140-11152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and exhibits a sequence (55Michaels M.L. Pham L. Nghiem Y. Cruz C. Miller J.H.

Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) that place MutY within the BER superfamily of DNA glycosylases (57Nash H.M. Bruner S.D. Sharer O.D. Kawate T. Addona T.A. Spooner E. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1230-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain has sequence (58Noll D.M. Gogos A. Granek J.A. Clarke N.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6374-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and structural homology to the d(OG)TPase MutT (59Volk D.E. House P.G. Thiviyanathan V. Luxon B.A. Zhang S. Lloyd R.S. Gorenstein D.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7331-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), indicating a role in recognition of OG. Kinetic experiments with substrates and binding assays with substrate analogs are consistent with a role of the C-terminal domain in OG recognition and nucleotide flipping (58Noll D.M. Gogos A. Granek J.A. Clarke N.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6374-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 60Chmiel N.H. Golinelli M.-P. Francis A.W. David S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that this domain has additional functions. In studies of the kinetic properties of MutY reported previously by our laboratory (24Porello S.L. Leyes A.E. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14756-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 60Chmiel N.H. Golinelli M.-P. Francis A.W. David S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the product release step of the glycosylase reaction with G:A and OG:A substrates was shown to be rate-limiting, suggesting a high affinity of MutY for the AP site product. Though MutY binds tightly to the AP site product produced from both OG:A and G:A substrates, this interaction is particularly strong with the OG:AP site, such that the half-life (t 12) of the complex is approximately 3 h (24Porello S.L. Leyes A.E. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14756-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The strong interaction between MutY and OG:AP was also shown by the ability to observe a distinct MutY “footprint” in methidium-propyl EDTA-Fe(II) hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments on the MutY·product complex (25Porello S.L. Williams S.D. Kuhn H. Michaels M.L. David S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 10684-10692Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The tight binding of MutY to the AP site may be important in vivo to avoid the adverse effects of the abasic site lesion and the premature removal of OG by MutM. It is conceivable that the in vivo turnover rate of MutY may be higher than that observed in vitro. The dissociation of MutY from its product may require the recruitment of other proteins from the BER pathway, such as an AP endonuclease, as turnover-enhancing cofactors. A study of the effect of the AP endonucleases Endo IV, Exo III, and Ape1 on the kinetics of the reaction of MutY with G:A and OG:A substrates is described herein. The effect of the glycosylases UDG and MutM and the DNA polymerase pol I was also characterized. It was found that Endo IV and Exo III, unlike Ape1, UDG, and polymerase I, greatly enhance the rate of product release with a G:A substrate, whereas the rate constant for the adenine removal step remained unchanged. However, neither Endo IV nor Exo III enhanced turnover with an OG:A substrate. Furthermore, the turnover rate for a truncated form of MutY, Stop 225, which lacks 125 amino acids on the C terminus, is not affected by the presence of Endo IV or Exo III. These results constitute the first evidence of an interaction between MutY and E. coli AP endonucleases and suggest a role for the C-terminal domain in mediating these interactions. The plasmids pKKYEco, containing mutY, and pKKFapy2, containing fpg, were kindly provided by M. Michaels and J. H. Miller (UCLA). The plasmid containing endonuclease IV (pET24 Eco Nfo) was provided by Dr. Richard Cunningham (SUNY, Albany, NY). All common DNA manipulations were performed using the standard protocols (61Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidites were purchased from ABI, except the 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine, and the tetrahydrofuran (dspacer) phosphoramidites, which were purchased from Glen Research. All other reagents used were purchased from Fisher, Sigma Chemical Co., or USB. 5′-End labeling was performed with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified using ProbeQuant G-50 Micro columns (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). UV-visible spectroscopy was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Storage phosphor autoradiography was performed using a Molecular Dynamics STORM 840 PhosphorImager. All data fitting was performed using GraFit v. 4. All electrophoresis was performed using 1× or 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer (pH 8.3), where 1× = 90 mm Tris, 90 mmboric acid, 1 mm EDTA. Chromatography for MutY, endonuclease IV, and MutM purification was conducted with a BioLogic chromatography system (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C. The E. coli strain JM101mutY::mini-tn10 harboring the pKKYS225 plasmid or pKKYEco plasmid were used in the production of Stop 225 and WT MutY, respectively, as described previously by our laboratory (60Chmiel N.H. Golinelli M.-P. Francis A.W. David S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Endonuclease IV was purified using pET 24-Eco Nfo plasmid in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. The purification of endonuclease IV was modified from Haas et al. (62Haas B.J. Sandigursky M. Tainer J.A. Franklin W.A. Cunningham R.P. J. Bacteriology. 1999; 181: 2834-2839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by replacing dialysis steps with anAmersham Biosciences, Inc. HiPrep 26/10 desalting column. E. coli MutM was purified as described previously (63Leipold M.D. Muller J.G. Burrows C.J. David S.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14984-14992Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Purified Ape1 was a generous gift of Dr. David Wilson and Dr. Jan Erzberger (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) and pol I were purchased from Invitrogen. Exonuclease III was purchased from New England BioLabs. It should be noted that, for all of the enzymes except MutY and MutM (Fpg), the concentration is listed as the Bradford concentration. MutY concentrations are reported as the active site concentrations, and MutM concentrations are based on the absorbance at 280 nm (ε280 = 3.9 × 104 liters mol−1cm−1). DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by standard phosphoramidite chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer as per the manufacturer's protocol. Oligonucleotides for enzyme assays and binding experiments were purified by ion-exchange chromatography (Waters, Protein-Pak DEAE 8HR column). The following DNA oligonucleotides were used: d(5′-CGATCATGGAGCCACXAGCTCCCGTTACAG-3′) where 30-G,X = 2′-deoxyguanosine (G) and 30-OG,X = 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (OG); d(3′-GCTAGTACCTCGGTGYTCGAGGGCAATGTC-5′) where 30-A,Y = 2′-deoxyadenosine (A) and 30-THF, Y= tetrahydrofuran nucleotide (THF); d(5′-CGATCATGGAGCCACGAGCTCCCGTTACAGTAGG-3′): 34-G; d(3′-GGATGCTAGTACCTCGGTGATCGAGGGCAATGTC-5′): 34-A; d(5′-CGAGAAGTTGACGGTCTGCAGCTGTAACGGGAGCTAGTGGCTCCATGATCGTCACGGTAAAGATCTACGG-3′): 70-A; d(3′-GCTCTTCAACTGCCAGACGTCGACATTGCCCTCGA(OG)CACCGAGGTACTAGCAGTGCCATTTCTAGATGCC-5′): 70-OG. The adenine glycosylase activity of MutY was monitored using a 30-bp oligonucleotide duplex substrate with a centrally located G:A or OG:A pair, as described previously by our laboratory (24Porello S.L. Leyes A.E. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14756-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 60Chmiel N.H. Golinelli M.-P. Francis A.W. David S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The A-containing strand was 32P-labeled on the 5′-end, and the rate of adenine removal was monitored by treating the reaction mixture with NaOH to promote strand cleavage at the abasic site. The substrate DNA (30-nucleotide strand) and the product-derived oligonucleotide (14-nucleotide) were separated in an 8 m urea-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (15%) and then quantified via storage phosphor autoradiography. The A-containing strand of the DNA duplexes used was 5′-32P-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the end-labeled A-containing strand was added to a final concentration of 2–5% to the unlabeled A-containing strand. The complementary strand was then added in slight excess (10%). The duplex formation was achieved by heating to 90 °C in an annealing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl) and then slow-cooling to room temperature over 3–4 h. In all of the kinetic experiments, substrate DNA (20 nmduplex) was equilibrated at 37 °C in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). For multiple-turnover experiments, the enzyme concentrations were adjusted to afford a 10–20% product formation for the burst phase of the reaction. Single-turnover experiments were performed in a manner analogous to the multiple-turnover experiments, with a MutY protein concentration of 60 nm. Enzyme concentrations for MutY are the active enzyme concentration determined using an active-site titration method with an OG:A substrate (24Porello S.L. Leyes A.E. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14756-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In experiments requiring Endo IV or Ape1, these enzymes were added at concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 nm. In experiments using Exo III, the Exo III concentration ranged from 38 to 760 nm. The adenine glycosylase activity was performed as above with NaOH providing cleavage at the abasic site (not the AP endonuclease). For experiments using Ape1, the buffer did not contain EDTA and contained 2 mm Mg2+. Experiments were performed in a similar manner with MutM, UDG, and pol I. Gel retardation experiments (64Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) were performed in a manner similar to that described previously for MutY with substrate analog duplexes (25Porello S.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, in these experiments, the DNA duplex was prepared in a manner similar to that for the kinetics experiments, i.e. 2–5% of the duplex was32P-end-labeled and mixed with cold duplex at the appropriate concentration. In addition, buffer conditions were slightly different than previous experiments. Reactions containing 15 nm DNA duplex, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 22.5 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol were incubated in the presence of freshly diluted Endo IV, Exo III, Ape-1, or MutM in the presence or absence of 20 nm MutY. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the samples were electrophoresed on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (17 × 14"
https://openalex.org/W2088033548,"Protein-protein interactions play critical regulatory roles in mediating signal transduction. Previous studies have identified an unconventional, small-molecule, Src signal transduction inhibitor, UCS15A. UCS15A differed from conventional Src-inhibitors in that it did not alter the levels or the tyrosine kinase activity of Src. Our studies suggested that UCS15A exerted its Src-inhibitory effects by a novel mechanism that involved the disruption of protein-protein interactions mediated by Src. In the present study we have examined the ability of UCS15A to disrupt the interaction of Src-SH3 with Sam68, both in vivo and in vitro. This ability of UCS15A was not restricted to Src-SH3 mediated protein-protein interactions, since the drug was capable of disrupting the in vivo interactions of Sam68 with other SH3 domain containing proteins such as Grb2 and PLCgamma. In addition, UCS15A was capable of disrupting other typical SH3-mediated protein-protein interactions such as Grb2-Sos1, cortactin-ZO1, as well as atypical SH3-mediated protein-protein interactions such as Grb2-Gab1. However, UCS15A was unable to disrupt the non-SH3-mediated protein-protein interactions of beta-catenin, with E-cadherin and alpha-catenin. In addition, UCS15A had no effect on the SH2-mediated interaction between Grb2 and activated Epidermal Growth Factor receptor. Thus, the ability of UCS15A, to disrupt protein-protein interactions appeared to be restricted to SH3-mediated protein-protein interactions. In this regard, UCS15A represents the first example of a non-peptide, small molecule agent capable of disrupting SH3-mediated protein-protein interactions. In vitro analyses suggested that UCS15A did not bind to the SH3 domain itself but rather may interact directly with the target proline-rich domains."
https://openalex.org/W2092733461,"The p16 tumor suppressor gene is frequently inactivated in human cancer tissues and cell lines. We previously reported that wild-type p16 expression from an adenovirus vector (Adv/p16) induced p53-dependent apoptotic cell death in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Here we show the potential mechanism of apoptosis induced by Adv/p16 infection. Infection of human NSCLC cell line A549, which carries the wild-type p53 gene, with Adv/p16 resulted in activation of caspase-3, accompanied by the cleavage of its substrate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), on day 3 of infection. The retinoblastoma (Rb) cell cycle regulator protein was also cleaved after activation of caspase-3; when the levels of Rb significantly diminished, apoptosis began. When A549 cells were pretreated with the caspase-inhibitory peptide N-acetyl-asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO (aldehyde) (Ac-DEVD-CHO), Adv/p16-mediated apoptosis and Rb cleavage were greatly inhibited. Furthermore, MDM2, a negative regulator of p53 expression was upregulated 3 days after Adv/p16 infection, and MDM2 was subsequently cleaved by caspase-3; MDM2 cleavage was inhibited by Ac-DEVD-CHO treatment. These data implied that cleavage of Rb, in addition to activation of caspase-3, represented a mechanism by which Adv/p16 induced apoptotic cell death in human NSCLC cells. Our results support the clinical relevance of Adv/p16 as a treatment for p16-null human NSCLC that express wild-type p53."

https://openalex.org/W2003067087,"Bloom's syndrome (BS) arises through mutations in both copies of the BLM gene that encodes a RecQ 3′-5′ DNA helicase. BS patients are predisposed to developing all the cancers that affect the general population, and BS cells exhibit marked genetic instability. We showed recently that BLM protein contributes to the cellular response to ionizing radiation by acting as downstream ATM kinase effector. We now show that following UVC treatment, BLM-deficient cells exhibit a reduction in the number of replicative cells, a partial escape from the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint, and have an altered p21 response. Surprisingly, we found that hydroxyurea-treated BLM-deficient cells exhibit an intact S phase arrest, proper recovery from the S phase arrest, and intact p53 and p21 responses. We also show that the level of BLM falls sharply in response to UVC radiation. This UVC-induced reduction in BLM does not require a functional ATM gene and does not result from a subcellular compartment change. Finally, we demonstrate that exposure to UVC and hydroxyurea treatment both induce BLM phosphorylation via an ATM-independent pathway. These results are discussed in the light of their potential physiological significance with regard to the role of BLM in the cellular pathways activated by UVC radiation or HU-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis."

Rhodes J.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4627-4632PubMed Google Scholar). The lectin has to be internalized to produce this effect and selectively blocks the classical NLS1-dependent nuclear protein import (5Yu L.G. Fernig D.G. White M.R.H. Spiller D.G. Evans R.C. Appleton P. Grierson I. Smith J.A. Davies H. Gerasimenko O.V. Petersen O.H. Milton J.D. Rhodes J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4890-4899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This implied that this lectin could be a very useful tool in further elucidation of this system. The classical NLS-dependent nuclear protein import is to date the best characterized nucleocytoplasmic transport pathway that mediates nuclear import of large proteins (>40–60 kDa) (6Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 7Adam S.A. Curr. Opin.

The classical NLS, which contains short stretches of basic amino acids, is recognized by the “adapter” protein importin α. Importin α (karyopherin α) binds to importin β (karyopherin β) (9Gorlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and the cargo-importin complex then translocates into the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes. The cargo-importin complex is then dissociated by RanGTP (10Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), thus releasing the cargo from its carrier. Importin α then forms a trimeric complex with an importin β-related protein CAS (cellular apoptosis susceptibility gene protein) (11Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Gorlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) and RanGTP, and this together with the importin β-RanGTP complex returns to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP by GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP1) and Ran-binding protein (RanBP1) results in dissociation of the Ran-importin complexes and recycling of the carrier importin molecules (12Coutavas E. Ren M. Oppenheim J.D. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Nature. 1993; 366: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 13Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H.

Thus, transport of cargo proteins requires three types of soluble factors, transport receptor molecule (importin β), adapter molecule (importin α), and Ran and its binding proteins. Identification of these soluble transport factors has largely been achieved using digitonin-permeabilized cells in which these factors have been shown to be essential for nuclear protein import. We have demonstrated in this study that one of the intracellular ABL binding ligands is a truncated, hence cytoplasmically localized form of oxygen-regulated protein 150 (Orp150) that is also shown to express the ABL ligand, sialyl-2,3-galactosyl-β1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine-α. Introduction of an antibody against Grp170 (the hamster homologue of Orp150) or depletion of Orp150 from the transport system by prior immunoabsorption inhibited nuclear accumulation of NLS-bovine serum albumin (BSA)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) in digitonin-permeabilized cells. This suggests that the N-terminal truncated form of Orp150 is essential for NLS-dependent nuclear protein import. Peroxidase-ABL, agarose-ABL, FITC-ABL, and peroxidase-PNA were from EY Laboratories Inc. (San Mateo, CA). Sialidase (EC 3.2.1.18) from Arthrobacter ureafaciens,sialidase from Newcastle Disease virus (EC 3.2.1.18), andO-glycanase (endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase) (EC 3.2.1.97) from Streptococcus pneumoniae were obtained from Oxford GlycoSciences (Abingdon, UK). Fluorescent mounting medium was purchased from Vector Laboratories Inc. (Peterborough, UK). Anti-Orp150/Grp170 polyclonal antibody generated against purified Chinese hamster Grp170 in rabbit (19Lin H.Y. Masso-Welch P., Di, Y.P. Cai J.W. Shen J.W. Subjeck J.R. Mol. Biol.

The human colon cancer cell line HT29 was obtained from the European Cell Culture Collection at the Public Health Laboratory Service, Porton Down, Wiltshire, UK and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mm glutamine. Cell culture medium was from Invitrogen. Confluent HT29 cells (6 × 108) were released by trypsinization from the cell culture plates and washed 3 times with PBS. The cells (5 × 106) were suspended in PBS, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma) and leupeptin (Sigma) were added. The cells were sonicated 4 times for 25 s with 1-min intervals on salt-ice. The unbroken cells, membranes, and debris were removed by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min). The cytosolic proteins were obtained after two centrifugations of the supernatant at 40,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the extract was 1.2 mg/ml as determined by bicinchoninic acid method (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) using a bicinchoninic acid solution kit (Sigma). 5 ml of ABL-agarose beads containing 7.5 mg of ABL (EY Laboratories) were thoroughly washed with 50 ml of PBS before use. The cytosolic protein extract was mixed with ABL-agarose beads by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then poured into a column (1 × 20 cm) and washed thoroughly with PBS till no protein was detected in the eluate. Specific binding to ABL-agarose was released by elution with 5 mmgalactose-β1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine (Sigma) in the presence of 15 mm EDTA. The eluate was then dialyzed thoroughly against PBS and freeze-dried. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and protein transfer to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were performed as previously described (4Yu L. Fernig D.G. Smith J.A. Milton J.D. Rhodes J.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4627-4632PubMed Google Scholar). After application of peroxidase-conjugated lectins or the primary antibody followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, bound proteins were detected using a chemiluminescence immunoblotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The optical density of protein bands on immuno and lectin blotting was analyzed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). ABL-agarose affinity-purified proteins were applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5 or 10%) electrophoresis running in the presence of 2 mmthioglycollic acid in the upper electrode buffer to scavengeN-blocking free radicals. After electrophoresis, the separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride-Immobilon P (Sigma) membranes. The membrane was washed once with distilled water and stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 50% methanol for 5 min. After destaining with 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, the membrane was washed again with distilled water and air-dried. The protein bands were sliced out and N-terminally sequenced using a 494 PROCISE protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) in the Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility of the Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge. Equal amounts (0.2 μg) of ABL-agarose affinity-purified proteins were incubated with or without 1.5 units/ml A. ureafaciens sialidase (which cleaves non-reducing terminal sialic acid α2–3- or 2–6-linked to galactose,N-acetylglucosamine, or N-acetylgalactosamine) for 20 h at 37 °C or 0.5 units/ml Newcastle Disease virus sialidase (which cleaves non-reducing terminal sialic acid α2–3-linked to galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine) for 24 h at 37 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). Sialidase-treated or untreated eluates were further incubated with or without 0.2 units/ml O-glycanase (endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase) from S. pneumoniae (specific removal of Galβ1–3GalNAc) in 10 mm sodium citrate-phosphate (pH 6.0) for 24 h at 37 °C. Release of cytoplasmic proteins was performed by digitonin treatment under conditions that selectively release cytoplasmic but not Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum proteins (43Holaska J.M. Black B.E. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Leszyk J. Paschal B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Subconfluent HT29 cells cultured in 6-well plates were treated with or without 50 μg/ml digitonin in PBS for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant and cells were recovered separately. Intact cells (4 × 104), digitonin-permeabilized cells(4 × 104), and the digitonin-released fractions (from 4 × 104 cells) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5%) and immunoblotting using primary antibodies to Grp170, Hsp70 (Sigma), and to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident proteins ERp72 (BD PharMingen) and protein disulfide isomerase (BD PharMingen) followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako, Denmark) and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence. To assess the localization of Orp150 and ABL, subconfluent HT29 cells were cultured on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 2 days. The medium was changed to serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25 mg/ml BSA), and FITC-ABL (10 μg) was added. After 6 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed once with culture medium, twice with PBS, and fixed with ethanol for 10 min at –20 °C. The cells were then treated with 0.5% BSA, 0.5% Triton-X-100, PBS, and 1% BSA, PBS each for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-Grp170 antibody (1:500) in 1% BSA, PBS was then applied for 1 h. After 4 washes with PBS, Texas Red conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:50) in 1% BSA, PBS was applied for 1 h. After extensive washes, the cells were mounted, and the subcellular distributions of FITC and Texas Red were monitored simultaneously by confocal microscopy (Noran Instruments Inc., Middleton, WI) with 60× Nikon objective (1.4 NA) with excitation 488 nm and emission 500–560 nm for FITC and above 610 nm for Texas Red. Image acquisition in slow mode (800 ns) was used with a slit of 25 μm, and images were processed using TwoD Analysis software (Noran Instruments Inc.). A peptide containing the SV40 large T antigen wild type NLS CGGGPKKKRKVED was synthesized as previously described (5Yu L.G. Fernig D.G. White M.R.H. Spiller D.G. Evans R.C. Appleton P. Grierson I.

Briefly, 10 mg/ml BSA-FITC was activated by incubation with a 100-fold molar excess of sulfo-SMCC (sulfosuccinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl] cyclohexane 1-carboxylate) (Pierce and Warriner, Chester, UK) for 90 min at room temperature in 100 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.3). Excess cross-linker was removed by gel filtration on a PD10 column containing 9.1 ml of Sephadex-G25 (Amersham Biosciences). The activated BSA solution was reacted with a 30-fold molar excess of NLS peptide in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) for 2 h at 37 °C. Uncoupled peptide was removed by gel filtration on a PD10 column equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl. The molar ratio of coupling was 15–25 peptides/BSA molecule as estimated from the electrophoretic mobility. Preparation of HT29 cell cytosol extracts for nuclear protein import was performed as described previously (5Yu L.G. Fernig D.G. White M.R.H. Spiller D.G. Evans R.C. Appleton P. Grierson I.

Cell permeabilization and in vitro nuclear protein import was carried out by a modification of the method previously described (5Yu L.G. Fernig D.G. White M.R.H. Spiller D.G. Evans R.C. Appleton P. Grierson I. Smith J.A. Davies H. Gerasimenko O.V. Petersen O.H. Milton J.D. Rhodes J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4890-4899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). HT29 cells were cultured on glass coverslips inserted into 24-well cell culture plates for 3 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS and twice with cold transport buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.3), 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and then permeabilized by incubation with 40 μg ml−1 digitonin (Sigma) in transport buffer for 6 min at 4 °C. After 5 washes with ice-cold transport buffer, transport mixture (final volume, 200 μl) was applied (20% cytosol fraction, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 2 mm BSA-NLS-fluorescein in transport buffer), and a protein transport reaction was allowed to proceed for 45 min in a 30 °C incubator. Protein transport was stopped by the addition of 1-ml of ice-cold transport buffer. After extensive washes with ice-cold transport buffer, the slides were fixed with ice-cold ethanol and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium H-1000 (Vector). Intracellular fluorescein localization was detected by fluorescence microscopy (Polyvar, Reichert-Jung, Austria), and images were recorded using a Kodak DC120 digital camera (Eastman Kodak Co.). Distribution of fluorescence in the nucleus and cytoplasm was analyzed as described previously (5Yu L.G. Fernig D.G. White M.R.H. Spiller D.G. Evans R.C. Appleton P. Grierson I. Smith J.A. Davies H.

Each experiment was repeated at least three times with at least six randomly selected cells analyzed on each occasion. For inhibition experiments, the cytosol extract was first incubated with 100 μg/ml wheat germ agglutinin or anti-Grp170 antibody (1:100) for 20 min at room temperature before mixing with the other transport components and introduced to the digitonin-permeabilized cells. 100 μl of cell cytosol extract (120 μg protein) obtained as described above was “precleaned” by mixing with 10 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) for 10 min. The beads were discarded after centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min. The precleaned cytosol extract was incubated with anti-Grp170 antibody (1:50) for 1 h before introduction of 10 μl of protein A-agarose beads for another hour. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was kept as Orp150-depleted cytosol extract to be used in nuclear transport. The immunoprecipitate was washed thoroughly with PBS and kept as Orp150 immunoprecipitate. Using ABL-agarose affinity purification, eight cytosolic proteins within the molecular mass range 46–300 kDa were obtained from HT29 cytosolic protein extracts, of which the four lower molecular weight proteins were stained strongly and the four higher molecular weight proteins were stained weakly by Coomassie Blue (Fig.1 A). A lectin blot of the eluate showed that only 4 of the 8 eluted proteins with molecular weights of 90, 120, 160, and >250 kDa were directly recognized by ABL peroxidase (Fig. 1 B). The four proteins directly recognized by ABL were those that stained weakly with Coomassie Blue (Fig.1 B). To determine whether any of these proteins was a known cytoplasmic transport factor, the apparent molecular sizes of the ABL-binding proteins were compared with those of the known transport factors. It was clear that only the 90-kDa protein appeared to be close in size to one of the known transport factors, importin β. However, immunoblotting using anti-importin β monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories Lexington, KY) indicated that this 90-kDa intracellular protein obtained from ABL affinity purification was not importin β (data not shown). Our previous studies have shown that the ABL-mediated effect on nuclear protein import is prevented by the addition of glycoproteins that express the ABL carbohydrate ligand, galactosyl-β1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine-α, the Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) blood group antigen (4Yu L. Fernig D.G. Smith J.A. Milton J.D. Rhodes J.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4627-4632PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the intracellular ABL-ligand interaction is mediated through lectin-carbohydrate interactions. Therefore, to further identify the functional intracellular ligand of ABL, we investigated the glycosylation of the intracellular ABL-binding proteins obtained from ABL affinity purification. It was found that none of the proteins eluted from ABL-agarose were recognized by anti-TF-monoclonal antibody (Fig.2 A, first lane) or by the TF binding PNA lectin (Figs. 2 B and2 C, first lanes), suggesting the absence of unsubstituted TF antigen on these intracellular proteins. To determine whether any of the intracellular ABL-binding proteins might express sialyl-TF antigen, the alternative carbohydrate binding ligand of ABL (1Presant C.A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6837-6945Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 2Chen Y. Jain R.K. Chandrasekaran E.V. Matta K.L. Glycoconj.

Res. 1988; 178: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the eluate was treated with A. ureafacienssialidase to cleave sialic acid α2–3-linked to galactose or 2–6 toN-acetylgalactosamine. It was found that removal of sialic acid residues resulted in strong binding of both anti-TF antibody (Fig.2 A, second lane) and PNA (Fig. 2 B,second lane) to the 160-kDa protein in addition to weak binding to the 90- and >250-kDa proteins. Further treatment of the sialidase-treated eluate with O-glycanase (endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase) to allow specific removal of terminal Galβ1–3GalNAcα resulted in an 84% reduction in binding of anti-TF antibody (Fig. 2 A, third lane, and Fig. 2 D) and a 62% reduction in binding of PNA (Fig. 2 B, third lane and Fig. 2 E) to the sialidase-treated 160-kDa protein. Weak binding to the 90- and >250-kDa proteins by anti-TF antibody and PNA was also largely inhibited by the sialidase treatment (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the 90-, 160-, and >250-kDa intracellular proteins (but not the 120-kDa protein) are sialyl-TF antigen-expressing glycoproteins. Although A. ureafaciens sialidase removes sialic acid whether α2–3- or α2–6-linked to galactose orN-acetylgalactosamine, it is known that ABL does not recognize galactosyl-β1,3-(sialyl2–6)-N-acetylgalactosamine-α (1Presant C.A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6837-6945Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 2Chen Y. Jain R.K. Chandrasekaran E.V. Matta K.L. Glycoconj.

Moreover, PNA would be expected to bind galactosyl-β1,3-(sialyl2–6)-N-acetylgalactosamine-α (2Chen Y. Jain R.K. Chandrasekaran E.V. Matta K.L. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore these results suggest that the sialic acid on these intracellular ABL-binding proteins is α2–3-linked to galactose. This is confirmed by the following studies using sialidase from Newcastle Disease virus that specifically cleaves non-reducing terminal α2–3-linked sialic acid residues. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment of the eluate with sialidase from Newcastle Disease virus resulted in strong binding of PNA to the 160- and >250-kDa proteins in addition to weak binding to the 90-kDa protein (Fig. 2 C, second lane). Again, further treatment of the sialidase-treated eluate with O-glycanase to allow specific removal of unsubstituted terminal Galβ1–3GalNAc resulted in a 73% reduction in binding of PNA to the 160-kDa protein (Fig. 2 C, third lane, and 2 F) as well as significantly decreased binding to the 90- and >250-kDa proteins. These results are in keeping with the conclusion that these proteins express sialyl-2,3-galactosyl-β1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine-α (sialyl-TF). Because the 160-kDa ABL-binding protein is the major intracellular sialyl-TF-expressing glycoprotein (Fig. 2), this protein was selected for N-terminal sequencing. The sequence obtained, LAVMSVDLG, matched exactly with the 33–42-amino acid sequence of oxygen-regulated protein 150 (Orp150), a member of the stress-related protein family that has more than 90% amino acid sequence identity with its hamster homologue glucose-regulated protein 170 (Grp170) (21Ikeda J. Kaneda S. Kuwabara K. Ogawa S. Kobayashi T. Matsumoto M. Yura T. Yanagi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The amino acids 33–426 of Orp150/Grp170 protein exhibit 32 and 30% identity, respectively, with amino acids 1–380 of human and bovine Hsp70 (21Ikeda J. Kaneda S. Kuwabara K. Ogawa S. Kobayashi T.

Immunoblot of the ABL affinity-purified proteins using a polyclonal antibody against Grp170 (Orp150) further supported Orp150 as the 160-kDa ABL-binding protein (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblotting with anti-Grp170 (Orp150) antibody confirms that treatment with sialidase and O-glycanase induced electrophoretic shifts, in keeping with expression of sialyl-TF by Orp150 (Fig. 3 B). Orp150 is known as an ER-associated protein that is thought to function as a molecular chaperone. Because the N-terminal 32 amino acids represent the signal peptide for ER translocation (21Ikeda J. Kaneda S. Kuwabara K. Ogawa S. Kobayashi T. Matsumoto M. Yura T. Yanagi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Kaneda S. Yura T. Yanagi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the discovery that ABL-purified Orp150 lacks this signal peptide suggests that this may represent a free cytoplasmic form of Orp150 as predicted by Kaneda et al. (28Kaneda S. Yura T. Yanagi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Dual labeling of the cells with FITC-ABL and anti-Grp170 antibody/Texas Red-conjugated second antibody assessed by confocal microscopy revealed co-localization of ABL and Orp150 in the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear region (Fig.4 A). The existence of cytoplasmic Orp150 is further demonstrated by digitonin treatment of the cells under conditions that selectively release cytoplasmic but not Golgi or ER resident proteins (43Holaska J.M. Black B.E. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Leszyk J. Paschal B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Orp150, like Hsp70, is released from the cells by digitonin treatment, whereas the typical ER-resident proteins, Erp72 and protein disulfide isomerase, are not released by this treatment (Fig. 4 B). Given the cytoplasmic localization of the N-terminally truncated Orp150, its expression of sialyl-TF, its co-localization with ABL, its sequence similarity with nuclear transport factor Hsp70, and the known inhibition of NLS-dependent nuclear import by ABL, we speculated that Orp150 might be involved in NLS-dependent nuclear protein import. We therefore investigated the role of Orp150 in nuclear protein import of a NLS-peptide complex (NLS-BSA-FITC) in vitro in digitonin-permeabilized cells. NLS-BSA-FITC accumulates in the nucleus in this transport system (Fig.5 A). Nuclear import of this NLS complex was reduced by 53% (n = 3) by the presence of wheat germ agglutinin (40 μg ml−1) (Fig. 5,A and C), a lectin that has been shown previously to block nuclear protein import by binding toN-acetylglucosamine on p62 nucleoporin (29Finlay D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Price T.M. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The transport process was also inhibited by 52% (n = 3) in the absence of ATP (Fig. 5, A and C). Introduction of an anti-Grp170 antibody to the transport system largely blocked the nuclear accumulation of NLS-BSA-FITC (Fig. 5 A), reducing the nuclear fluorescence by 57% (n = 5) (Fig.5 C). Introduction of irrelevant antibodies such as anti-Erk1/2 antibody (Promega UK Ltd., Southampton, UK) (1:50) (not shown) or normal rabbit serum (1:50) to the system did not show any effect on the nuclear accumulation of NLS-BSA-FITC (Fig.5 A). Similar results were observed also in human gastric cancer cell line AGS cells (not shown). To exclude the possibility that the inhibition of nuclear import by the addition of anti-Grp170 antibody to the digitonin-permeabilized cells might have be due to binding to ER-associated Orp150, NLS-BSA-FITC nuclear import was also investigated"
https://openalex.org/W2071891396,"Ceramide induces apoptotic cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner in neuroblastoma SKN-SH cells. Pretreatment with caspase inhibitors blocks cell death, suggesting that a set of caspase activities including caspase 1, as well as caspase 3, are involved in ceramide-induced apoptosis in SKN-SH cells. Treatment with a caspase inhibitor 3 h after ceramide addition did not inhibit cell death, although caspase activity was substantially reduced. Ceramide-induced apoptosis is accompanied by accumulation of p53 followed by an increase of Bax and decrease of Bcl-2 levels. Inhibition of p53 expression with p53 antisense oligonucleotides inhibits apoptosis and prevents the increase in Bax and decrease in Bcl-2. Furthermore, pretreatment with p53 antisense oligonucleotides markedly inhibits the induction of caspase activity. These results suggest that p53 regulates the ratio Bcl-2/Bax and the expression/activation of caspases during ceramide-induced apoptosis in SKN-SH cells. Caspase inhibition did not alter the expression of p53, Bcl-2 and Bax. Thus ceramide-induced reduction in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, increase in caspase activity, and apoptosis is dependent upon increases in cellular p53 levels which play a critical role in the regulation of apoptotic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2042555275,"This paper describes the consequences of alanine-scanning mutagenesis on 28 positions of the second epidermal growth factor (EGF-2) domain of factor IX. We identified four positions of Gln97, Phe98, Tyr115, and Leu117 that are critical for secretion of factor IX. Of the remaining mutations, 4 mutants (V86A, E113A, K122A, and S123A) are as active as wild-type factor IX (IXwt); 16 (D85A, K100A, N101A, D104A, N105A, R116A, E119A, T87A, I90A, K91A, R94A, E96A, S102A, K106A, T112A, and N120A) retain reduced but detectable activity, and 4 (N89A, N92A, G93A, and V107A) are nearly inert in the clotting assay. Both factor XIa and the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex effectively catalyzed the activation of these mutants except N89A. The mutant V107A failed to form the factor tenase complex with factor VIIIa because of a 35-fold increase in K d . The mutants N89A and N92A did not compete with factor IXwt for factor VIIIa binding, and G93A exhibited a 6-fold increase in K i values in the competitive binding assay. It appears that mutations at these positions have significantly affected the interaction between factor IX and factor VIIIa, although other mutations had little effect on the binding of factor IX to factor VIIIa. Mutations in two regions, Thr87–Gly93 and Asn101–Val107, significantly increased theK m value of factor IXa (2–10-fold) in cleavage of factor X in the absence of factor VIIIa. In the presence of factor VIIIa, the catalytic efficiency of each mutant toward factor X paralleled its clotting activity. Briefly, we propose two relatively distinctive functions of factor IX for two adjacent regions in the EGF-2 domain; the first loop region (residues 89–94) is involved with the binding of its cofactor, factor VIIIa, and the third loop with connected β-sheets (residues 102–108) is involved in the proper binding to the substrate, factor X.

The activation of factor IX by proteolytic cleavages of two peptide bonds by factor XIa or by the factor VIIa-tissue factor (VIIa-TF)1complex results in a catalytically active two-chain molecule of factor IXa (3Lindquist P.A.

Factor IXa converts zymogen factor X into factor Xa, which is responsible for the activation of prothrombin to thrombin. Generation of factor Xa by factor IXa requires factor VIIIa, the only macromolecular protein cofactor identified for factor IXa (6Mann K.G. Thromb.

Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between factor IXa and factor VIIIa requires both factors to be activated. Defects in both proteins are linked to hemophilia. The zymogen form of factor IX has five structural domains as follows: the Gla domain, two EGF-like domains, the activation peptide, and the catalytic domain (8Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the activation peptide is released from factor IXa. A number of experiments have indicated that a few regions in the catalytic domain (residues 301–303 and 333–339) may confer factor VIIIa binding (9Kolkman J.A. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. Biochem.

The EGF-2 domain of factor IX contains 43 residues (Asp85–Ala127, factor IX numbering system) and is highly conserved among different organisms, with 80–85% amino acid sequence identity. Furthermore, the EGF-2 domains among factors VII, IX, X, and protein C share 30–50% sequence homology (16Tatusova T.A. Madden T.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 247-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Domain swapping experiments showed that the chimeric recombinant factor IX, in which the EGF-1 domain was replaced by that of factor X or factor VII, retained full factor IXa activity, indicating that the EGF-1 domain does not contribute to factor VIIIa binding in a factor IX-specific manner (13Lin S.W.

Invest. 1997; 100: 886-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, substituting two EGF domains with that of factor X (factor IXXegf1+2) the chimeric factor IX lost almost all of its clotting activity (13Lin S.W. Smith K.J. Welsch D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 144-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the EGF-2 domain is critical for factor IX-specific function. In other studies using the chimeric recombinant factor IXXegf2 (factor IX with the EGF-2 domain from factor X), it is suggested that the EGF-2 domain is required for the assembly of the functional intrinsic factor IXa-factor VIIIa (factor tenase) complex on the surfaces of the activated platelets but is not directly involved in the interaction between factor IXa and factor VIIIa (18Ahmad S.S. Rawala R. Cheung W.F. Stafford D.W. Walsh P.N. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Wong M.Y. Gurr J.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8948-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The EGF-2 domain is composed of five β-strands and four β-hairpin loops based on the crystal structure of porcine factor IXa (14Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Mutations at residues located along the concave surface of factor IXa (such as residues Ile90, Asn92, and Arg94) appear to be associated with hemophilia, indicating functional significance of this region (14Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 20Giannelli F. Green P.M. Sommer S.S. Poon M. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goossens M. Yoshioka A. Figueiredo M.S. Brownlee G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Arg94 is involved in the formation of a salt bridge with residue Glu78 of the EGF-1 domain, which may be critical for the interaction with factor VIIIa (21Christophe O.D. Lenting P.J. Kolkman J.A. Brownlee G.G. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Glu78 is conserved in the EGF-1 domain of factors IX and X, and therefore, replacing only the EGF-1 of factor IX with that of factor X might not influence the stability of the salt bridge. In contrast, changing both EGF domains between factor IX and factor X would eliminate the salt bridge and perturb the integrity between these two EGF domains, and consequently affect the activity of factor IX. These facts are consistent with the aforementioned domain swapping results. In addition, a hydrophobic loop of EGF-1 (formed by Val75–Phe77) protrudes into the hydrophobic concavity formed by residues Ala86, Arg94, Val107, Cys109, and Lys122 in the EGF-2 domain (14Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). When the hydrophobic region of residues Lys106–Val108 was replaced by the corresponding site of factor VII, the mutation caused a dramatic decrease in factor IXa activity toward factor X both in the absence and the presence of factor VIIIa (22Celie P.H. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 229-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This suggests that the decrease of the factor IX activity can be attributed to a defect in the interaction of factor IX and its substrate, factor X (22Celie P.H. Lenting P.J. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 229-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The study suggested that the proper orientation and interaction of the EGF-1 and -2 domains are crucial for substrate binding. Whether and how the EGF-1 and -2 interdomain interactions affect the bindings of factor VIIIa and factor X remains to be determined. In this study, we conducted an extensive alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the EGF-2 domain of factor IXa spanning residues 85 and 125 in order to identify the EGF-2 region that interacts with the cofactor and substrates of factor IX. We provide an analysis of the functional roles of the aforementioned salt bridge and the hydrophobic interactions that link the two EGF domains of factor IX. All the restriction endonucleases and polymerases were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Geneticin (G418) was from Invitrogen. Factor IX-deficient plasma, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylserine (PS) were purchased from Sigma. Human factor XIa, factor Xa, and factor X were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratory (South Bend, IN). Preparations of tissue factor, factor VII, factor VIIa, and phospholipids were described previously (23Chang Y.J. Hamaguchi N. Chang S.C. Ruf W. Shen M.C. Lin S.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10940-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-factor IX antibodies were prepared by immunization of rabbits with plasma-derived factor IX as described previously (24Wu P.C. Hamaguchi N., Yu, Y.S. Shen M.C. Lin S.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-factor IX antibodies (A1, A5, and A7, see Ref. 25Smith K.J. Ono K. Thromb. Res. 1984; 33: 211-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. Kenneth Smith (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). Spectrozyme FXa and spectrozyme FIXa were purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite (ITS) supplements used in serum-free media were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. AV max microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA) equipped with a thermal controller was used for all spectrophotometric assays. QAE-Sephadex and Resource Q were fromAmersham Biosciences. DEGR-CK was a product of Calbiochem. Mutagenesis was performed by the PCR-based method following the manufacturer's instructions (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, Boston). Pairs of specific primers were synthesized to create codons for alanine at individual positions within amino acid residues 85–127. The altered cDNA was fully sequenced and subcloned into pCR3TM-Uni (Invitrogen) for expression in human 293 cells under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (26Hsu Y.C. Hamaguchi N. Chang Y.J. Lin S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11261-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Transfection and identification of cell clones expressing factor IX were performed as described previously (24Wu P.C. Hamaguchi N., Yu, Y.S. Shen M.C. Lin S.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The cultured supernatant was collected and stored at −20 °C for further analysis. Recombinant factor IX was purified by a method similar to Yan et al. (27Yan S.C.B. Razzano P. Chao Y.B. Walls J.D. Berg D.T. McClure D.B. Grinnell B.W. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 liter of the cultured supernatant (containing 1–4 mg of factor IX) was adjusted to 2 mm benzamidine and 5 mm EDTA and subjected to centrifugation at 4350 rpm (Sorvall RC-3C Plus, DuPont) for 45 min at 4 °C. After removal of the cell debris, the supernatant was passed through a QAE-Sephadex A50 column (30 ml in 2.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with TBS (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl). After washing the column with 1 liter of TBS and 1 mm benzamidine, factor IX was eluted with a gradient of 0–30 mm CaCl2 in TBS and 1 mmbenzamidine. Fractions containing factor IX were identified by ELISA as described previously (13Lin S.W. Smith K.J. Welsch D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 144-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lin S.W. Lin C.N. Hamaguchi N. Smith K.J. Shen M.C. Blood. 1994; 84: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pooled, dialyzed against 100-fold excess volumes of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter (Nalge Nunc International, New York). Approximately 100 ml of the QAE-eluent was loaded on to a Resource Q column (1 ml, Akta FPLC purifier, Amersham Biosciences). After washing with 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, the column was eluted with a gradient of NaCl (0–1 m) in 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5. Factor IX was eluted at fractions of ∼350 mm NaCl. Purified proteins (0.2–1 mg) were verified to be >95% purity by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with silver nitrate (Silver Stain kit, Bio-Rad). The protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) modified from the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211925) Google Scholar) and the ELISA method using monoclonal antibodies recognizing human factor IX were used to measure the concentration of purified factor IX proteins as described previously (24Wu P.C. Hamaguchi N., Yu, Y.S. Shen M.C. Lin S.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Hsu Y.C. Hamaguchi N. Chang Y.J. Lin S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11261-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). By using factor IX-deficient plasma, clotting activity was measured by the one-stage aPTT clotting assay following the manufacturer's instructions (Pathromtin, Behring, Germany) as described previously (24Wu P.C. Hamaguchi N., Yu, Y.S. Shen M.C. Lin S.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28Lin S.W. Lin C.N. Hamaguchi N. Smith K.J. Shen M.C. Blood. 1994; 84: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pooled plasmas of at least 20 healthy individuals were used in parallel experiments to prepare standard curves for calculation of activities and protein concentrations (by ELISA) of related clotting factors (28Lin S.W. Lin C.N. Hamaguchi N. Smith K.J. Shen M.C. Blood. 1994; 84: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the purified recombinant wild-type factor IX was comparable with that of plasma-derived factor IX (26Hsu Y.C. Hamaguchi N. Chang Y.J. Lin S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11261-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Activation of factor IX by factor XIa and VIIa-TF was performed as described previously (24Wu P.C. Hamaguchi N., Yu, Y.S. Shen M.C. Lin S.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Hsu Y.C. Hamaguchi N. Chang Y.J. Lin S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11261-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The VIIa-TF complex was prepared as described previously (23Chang Y.J. Hamaguchi N. Chang S.C. Ruf W. Shen M.C. Lin S.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10940-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Hsu Y.C. Hamaguchi N. Chang Y.J. Lin S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11261-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Purified wild-type and mutant factor IX proteins (1.8 μm) were incubated at 37 °C with factor XIa (9 nm) and VIIa-TF complex (36 nm). The reaction products of both experiments were analyzed at timed intervals by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. To determine the rate of factor IX hydrolysis by the VIIa-TF complex, a two-step kinetic assay was performed in that IXwt and N89A (1.8 μm) were incubated with VIIa-TF (18 nm) in 50 μl of TBS/Ca/bovine serum albumin (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were withdrawn at different time points (5–60 min) and stopped by addition of 10 μl of 12 mm EDTA. The factor IXa activity generated by the VIIa-TF complex at each time point was measured by the addition of 40 μl of Spectrozyme FIXa at a final concentration of 4 mm. Hydrolysis was monitored at 405 nm and 37 °C for 1 h, and the initial rates (mOD/min) for the sampled mixtures of wild-type factor IX and N89A were recorded and plottedversus the durations of cleavage by VIIa-TF. The slope of each curve represents the efficiency of the cleavage of wild-type factor IX and N89A, respectively, by VIIa-TF. The activated wild-type and mutant factor IXa (1.8 μm) was prepared by incubation of the purified proteins with factor XIa (9 nm) at 37 °C for 2 h. Complete activation of factor IX to factor IXa was monitored by SDS-PAGE and silver stain. The concentration of the generated wild-type factor IXa was also determined by titration with antithrombin III with the assumption that 1 mol of factor IXa is inhibited by 1 mol of antithrombin III (30Griffith M.J. Breitkreutz L. Trapp H. Briet E. Noyes C.M. Lundblad R.L. Roberts H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The amount of antithrombin III required to completely inhibit the activated factor IXa activity toward factor X was assumed to be the concentration of factor IXa, which correlated to that determined by SDS-PAGE. The activity of wild-type and mutant factor IXa toward factor X was monitored kinetically through the hydrolysis of Spectrozyme FXa by factor Xa in the absence and presence of factor VIIIa as described previously (24Wu P.C. Hamaguchi N., Yu, Y.S. Shen M.C. Lin S.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Hsu Y.C. Hamaguchi N. Chang Y.J. Lin S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11261-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Final concentrations were factor IXa, 10 nm, PCPS, 100 μm, Spectrozyme FXa, 0.5 mm, and factor X, 0.025–1 μm. The amount of factor Xa generated was computed from a standard curve derived by the hydrolysis of Spectrozyme FXa with factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories) prepared by immobilized Russell's viper venom. The factor Xa preparation was fully active as analyzed by an active site-specific fluorogenic substrate (31Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle W.S. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), 4-methylumbelliferylp-guanidinobenzoate (Fluka), as described before (32Wu D.H. Shi G.Y. Chuang W.J. Hsu J.M. Young K.C. Chang C.W. Wu H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15025-15033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), in a Hitachi 850 fluorescent spectrophotometer. The factor IXa activity was then calculated according to an active site as described previously (24Wu P.C. Hamaguchi N., Yu, Y.S. Shen M.C. Lin S.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30Griffith M.J. Breitkreutz L. Trapp H. Briet E. Noyes C.M. Lundblad R.L. Roberts H.R. J. Clin.

Roberts H.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Factor VIIIa was prepared freshly by incubation with thrombin as described previously (24Wu P.C. Hamaguchi N., Yu, Y.S. Shen M.C. Lin S.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Larson P.J. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. VanDusen W.J. Kasper C.K. Smith K.J. Monroe D.M. High K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3869-3876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To analyze the interaction of factor IXa with factor X in the presence of factor VIIIa, 25 μl of the factor VIIIa preparation was mixed with an equal volume of factor IXa preincubated with PCPS in TBS/Ca/bovine serum albumin. The mixture was used to form the intrinsic factor tenase complex, and its activity toward factor X was subsequently analyzed kinetically by adding 50 μl of a reaction mixture containing PCPS and Spectrozyme FXa. The final concentrations are as follows: for wild-type or mutant factor IXa, 0.25 nm; factor VIIIa, 0.4 nm; PCPS, 100 μm; factor X, 0–200 nm; and Spectrozyme FXa, 0.5 mm. The factor IXa activity was calculated as described above. Binding experiments were performed by monitoring the intrinsic factor tenase activity at limiting concentrations of factor VIIIa as described previously (26Hsu Y.C. Hamaguchi N. Chang Y.J. Lin S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11261-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar,33Larson P.J. Stanfield-Oakley S.A. VanDusen W.J. Kasper C.K. Smith K.J. Monroe D.M. High K.A. J. Biol.

Freshly prepared factor VIIIa (1.6 nm, 25 μl) was incubated with 25 μl of different concentrations of wild-type or mutant factor IXa at room temperature for 5 min to form a factor tenase complex. Activity of the resultant complex was then measured as described above. The total volume of the reaction mixtures was 100 μl, and the final concentrations are as follows: factor VIIIa, 0.5 nm; PCPS, 100 μm; factor X, 100 nm; Spectrozyme FXa, 0.5 mm; and factor IXa, 0–40 nm. The reaction was measured at 37 °C kinetically on a microtiter plate reader. Experiments were performed in duplicate for 3–5 independent reactions, and curves were fitted using all data points. The K d values were derived as previously described (26Hsu Y.C. Hamaguchi N. Chang Y.J. Lin S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11261-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Krishnaswamy S.

Biophys. 1984; 233: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recombinant factor IXa, at a concentration of 1 μm in 50 μl of TBS, was incubated with a 3-fold molar excess of DEGR-CK for 7 h at room temperature and then for 17 h at 4 °C. Then wild-type and mutant factor IXa (DEGR-IXa) were separated from excessive DEGR-CK by extensive dialysis against TBS at 4 °C. The remaining enzymatic activity of the wild-type factor IXa was measured by aPTT clotting test and found to contain less than 0.05% of untreated wild-type factor IXa. The remaining activity of the mutant factor IXa (N89A, N92A, and G93A) was measured to determine whether their amidolytic activities toward Spectrozyme FIXa were <0.1% of their uninhibited counterparts. Competition experiments were carried out by incubating wild-type factor IXa and factor VIIIa with different concentrations of wild-type and mutant DEGR-IXa as competitors at room temperature for 5 min. The residual factor tenase complex activity was measured for the activity toward factor X as described above. Final concentrations are as follows: factor VIIIa, 0.55 nm; PCPS, 100 μm; factor X, 100 nm; Spectrozyme FXa, 0.5 mm; wild-type factor IXa, 0.05 nm; and wild-type or mutant DEGR-IXa, 0–50 nm. The relative rate of factor Xa generation in the presence of each DEGR-IXa was used to calculate K i according to Equation 1 as described by Larson et al. (33Larson P.J. Stanfield-Oakley S.A.

Residues 110 and 114 were also omitted from this study because the missense mutations at these positions were reported to cause hemophilia B with little antigen levels. Residues 103 and 118 are alanine in factor IX; thus they were not investigated. Recombinant factor IX mutants were designated as D85A, V86A, etc. respectively. When expressed in stably transfected cells, all mutants except Q97A, F98A, Y115A, and L117A, were secreted at levels comparable with wild-type factor IX (IXwt). The secreted factor IX mutants reacted with a polyclonal antibody and three different monoclonal anti-factor IX antibodies. At least one of the antibodies is known to be conformational specific (25Smith K.J. Ono K. Thromb. Res. 1984; 33: 211-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) indicating that the alanine replacements at these positions did not alter the global structure of factor IX. Immunostaining showed that Q97A, F98A, Y115A, and L117A were accumulated inside the cells (data not shown), suggesting that these substitutions disrupted the secretion of factor IX. These four mutants were not characterized further in subsequent experiments. The specific clotting activities of the 24 secreted alanine mutants are summarized in Fig. 1. One mutant, V86A, was found two times more active than factor IXwt. Three (E113A, K122A, and S123A) were as active as factor IXwt. In contrast, N89A, N92A, G93A, and V107A had minimal clotting activities. Of the remaining 16 mutants, 7 (D85A, K100A, N101A, D104A, N105A, R116A, and E119A) had 46–75% IXwt activity, and the other 9 (T87A, I90A, K91A, R94A, E96A, S102A, K106A, T112A, and N120A) showed decreased activity to 7–37%.

Since the discovery of acetate kinase in 1944 by Lipmann (1Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 155: 55-70Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and isolation in 1954 by Ochoa (2Rose I.A. Grunberg-Manago M. Korey S.R. Ochoa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 211: 737-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most research on the catalytic mechanism has been performed with the Escherichia coli enzyme. The early research led to two proposed catalytic mechanisms, a triple-displacement mechanism via a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate and a direct in-line mechanism. The direct in-line transfer mechanism is consistent with steady state kinetics (3Janson C.A. Cleland W.W. J. Biol.

Spector L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2120-2125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the triple displacement mechanism was challenged when it was shown that phosphorylated acetate kinase from E. coli is a phosphoryl donor to Enzyme I of the bacterial phosphotransferase system, which suggested an alternate function for phosphorylated acetate kinase in sugar transport (8Fox D.K. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13498-13503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There has been very little mechanistic work on acetate kinase, since this intriguing triple displacement mechanism was proposed by Spector in 1980 (5Spector L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2626-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The thermostable Methanosarcina thermophila acetate kinase has been cloned and hyper-produced in E. coli making it the first available for modern biochemical approaches including site-directed mutagenesis (9Singh-Wissmann K.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The crystal structure identifies acetate kinase as a member of the superfamily now identified as the acetate and sugar kinases/Hsc70/actin (ASKHA) superfamily (12Buss K.A. Cooper D.R. Ingram-Smith C.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2659-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Glucose binding to hexokinase results in partial closure of the active site cleft and the subsequent binding of ATP is proposed to result in even greater closure of the cleft (14Steitz T.A. Shoham M. Bennet W.S.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1981; 293: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,15Shoham M. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 140: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). When glucose is absent, the phosphates and metal of the metal-nucleotide complex are proposed to be disordered possibly to reduce the inherent ATPase activity of hexokinase (14Steitz T.A. Shoham M. Bennet W.S.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1981; 293: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Shoham M. Steitz T.A. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Acetate kinase is expected to undergo an analogous conformational change upon substrate binding. Consistent with this hypothesis, the β-phosphate appears to be displaced in the current crystal structure of acetate kinase in complex with ADP (12Buss K.A. Cooper D.R. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); hence, identification of residues involved in catalysis from the crystal structure is precluded. Thus, a crystal structure of acetate kinase in the transition state bound to both MgADP and acetate as well as an analog of the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP is key to the identification of residues involved in transition state stabilization and the orientation of the substrates for catalysis.Aluminum fluoride has recently become a powerful tool in the study of phosphoryl transfer enzymes. In several phosphatases and kinases, AlF3–4 mimics the planar phosphoryl group in the catalytic transition state (17Lunardi J. Dupuis A. Garin J. Issartel J.-P. Michel L. Chabre M. Vignais P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8958-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9290-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence for a transition state analog, MgADP-aluminum fluoride-acetate, for the M. thermophila acetate kinase. To our knowledge, this work represents the first use of aluminum fluoride to mimic a transition state in an acetate kinase or in any kinase from the ASKHA superfamily. In conjunction with recent site-directed replacement studies, our results favor a direct in-line transfer of the ATP-γ-phosphoryl group to acetate and provide a new direction in which to investigate other unanswered questions regarding the mechanism of acetate kinase.DISCUSSIONStudies on several kinases including F1-ATPase and UMP kinase indicate that AlF3–4 mimics the planar phosphoryl group in the catalytic transition state and, with the substrates, forms an abortive active site complex (17Lunardi J. Dupuis A. Garin J. Issartel J.-P. Michel L. Chabre M. Vignais P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8958-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9290-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here we report the inhibition of M. thermophila acetate kinase activity by MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, NaF, and acetate. The characteristics of the inhibition and other experiments indicate that a transition state analog, MgADP-aluminum fluoride-acetate, forms an abortive complex in the active site of acetate kinase.The requirements for formation of a transition state analog should mimic the requirements for catalysis. If MgADP-aluminum fluoride-acetate is a transition state analog for the acetate kinase, then any substrate that substitutes for acetate should form a transition state analog in conjunction with MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, and NaF. Propionate replaces acetate as a substrate (21Aceti D.J. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15444-15448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and as shown here inhibited the enzyme when preincubated with MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, NaF; however, butyrate is not a substrate for acetate kinase (21Aceti D.J. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15444-15448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and did not form an inhibitory complex with MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, and NaF. These results support MgADP-aluminum fluoride-acetate as a transition state analog. A distinguishing characteristic of acetate kinase is the ability to utilize various NTPs (21Aceti D.J. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15444-15448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in place of ATP. Each of the cognate NDPs (in conjunction with MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, NaF, and acetate) resulted in the inhibition of acetate kinase activity, further supporting the formation of a transition state analog. These results also indicate that inhibition of acetate kinase is not the consequence of a nonspecific interaction of aluminum fluoride with the adenosine moiety of ADP to form an inactive nucleotide complex. Although ADP is not a β-phosphoryl group donor in the acetate kinase reaction, AMP was able to partially replace ADP in the proposed transition state analog. AMP has previously been shown to be a competitive inhibitor versus ATP in the E. coli acetate kinase (K i of 7.4 mm) (26Purich D.L. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 149: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). MgAMP, aluminum fluoride, and acetate may form a transition state analog despite the absence of the β-phosphate. Either the nucleotide β-phosphate group is not essential for formation of the active conformation of acetate kinase or aluminum fluoride substitutes for both the nucleotide β- and γ-phosphates in the MgAMP-aluminum fluoride-acetate complex. The ability of MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, NaF, and acetate to inhibit acetate kinases from both E. coli (Bacteria domain) and phylogenetically distantM. thermophila (Archaea domain) indicates that the inhibition is related to the common mechanism of catalysis and not a nonspecific event.Although not always observed, the propensity of enzymes to maximize protein-substrate interactions in the transition state predicts tighter binding of substrates. The fluorescence quenching results indicate that acetate kinase has a higher binding affinity for MgADP when AlCl3, NaF, and acetate are present. Consistent with these results are the much lower K i values determined for ADP and acetate (in the presence of MgCl2, AlCl3, NaF, and the co-substrate) relative to theK m values for ADP and acetate. In conclusion, the fluorescence and K i data are consistent with the formation of a transition state analog, MgADP-aluminum fluoride-acetate.The primary metal complexes involved in acetate kinase inhibition were MgADP and aluminum fluoride; however, the 23% inhibition of acetate kinase by the preincubation mixture minus AlCl3 suggests the formation of magnesium fluoride, which is also inhibitory. In support of this scenario, magnesium fluoride, in addition to aluminum fluoride, is proposed to form in the transition state analog of G proteins (27Graham D.L. Eccleston J.F. Chung C.-W. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14981-14987Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consequently, a portion of the metal fluoride in the acetate kinase transition state analog is probably magnesium fluoride. The dependence of acetate kinase inhibition on the AlCl3concentration suggests the predominant metal fluoride species in the transition state analog is aluminum fluoride (28Issartel J.P. Dupuis A. Lunardi J. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Beryllium failed to replace aluminum in the inhibitory complex. Beryllium fluoride, in association with a bridging β-phosphate oxygen, is thought to mimic the tetrahedral nucleotide γ-phosphate in the ground state (29Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 30Xu Y.W. Morera S. Janin J. Cherfils J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Consequently, beryllium fluoride is not a true analog of the planar phosphoryl group during catalysis. Despite this fact, preincubation with MgADP, BeCl2, and NaF inhibits several phosphoryl transfer enzymes, including adenylate kinase and F1-ATPase (17Lunardi J. Dupuis A. Garin J. Issartel J.-P. Michel L. Chabre M. Vignais P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8958-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Garin J. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6821-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Acetate kinase may differ from these enzymes in the inability to form a locked active conformation without a planar phosphoryl analog in the inhibitory complex.The stoichiometry of the aluminum fluoride complex that forms in acetate kinase is uncertain. It has been proposed that pH plays a significant role in the aluminum to fluoride ratio of the transition state analog (32Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The acetate kinase was inhibited in a preincubation mixture containing MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, NaF, and acetate at a pH value of 5.5. At this pH, AlF4− is proposed to be the dominant species in the transition state analogs of kinases (32Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and thus may be the species formed in acetate kinase. A planar AlF4− molecule would not strictly mimic the planar phosphoryl group during catalysis. Nevertheless, transition state analogs containing AlF4− have been shown to be reasonable mimics of the transition state (29Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 33Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.T.

Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The nature of the nucleophilic attack may also help to determine the aluminum fluoride species in the transition state analog (30Xu Y.W. Morera S. Janin J. Cherfils J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of Gαi (33Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.T. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) and GαtGTPases (34Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), as well as myosin (29Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), indicate that an octahedrally coordinated aluminum is present in the transition state analog with four equatorial fluoride atoms, a nucleotide β-phosphate oxygen as one apical ligand, and a water molecule as the second apical ligand. Hydrolytic nucleotidases such as these may have more structural flexibility to accept AlF4− than would enzymes that utilize a protein functional group as the nucleophile (30Xu Y.W. Morera S. Janin J. Cherfils J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In nucleoside diphosphate kinase for example, in which an active site histidine attacks the γ-phosphate, steric considerations were invoked to explain the presence of AlF3 instead of AlF4− in the crystal structure (30Xu Y.W. Morera S. Janin J. Cherfils J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). If the above scenario is correct, the requirement for acetate in the proposed acetate kinase transition state analog suggests that this molecule acts as the nucleophile and further suggests that the aluminum fluoride species is AlF3, not AlF4−. This supposition is supported by a binding coefficient of ∼3 that was determined for NaF in formation of the inhibitory complex.Since the 1970s, there has been dispute over a single versustriple displacement mechanism for acetate kinase. The single displacement mechanism assumes direct in-line phosphoryl transfer from ATP to acetate, whereas the triple displacement mechanism involves phosphoryl transfer to two enzyme sites before transfer to acetate. Here we report the requirement for both ADP and acetate in formation of the transition state analog. The most straightforward interpretation of these results is that the phosphorylation of acetate by ATP occurs by a direct in-line mechanism. The protection from inhibition by non-hydrolyzable ATPγS or acetylphosphate suggests that the terminal phosphate of ATP, the phosphate group of acetylphosphate, and the aluminum fluoride of the transition state analog all share the same binding site. These results are consistent with a direct in-line mechanism. Other recent site-directed mutagenesis studies reported for the M. thermophila enzyme support the direct in-line mechanism. These studies have eliminated the possibility of active site histidine residues acting as phosphorylation sites in the catalytic mechanism (11Ingram-Smith C. Barber R.D. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33765-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, active site residues Arg91 and Arg241 were found to be essential for catalysis (10Singh-Wissmann K. Miles R.D. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3671-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These arginines are well positioned in the crystal structure to stabilize the transition state in a direct in-line mechanism (12Buss K.A. Cooper D.R. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). If the acetate kinase reaction involves a direct in-line phosphoryl transfer, an alternative role must be proposed for active site residue Glu384, previously found to be essential for catalysis and postulated as the phosphorylation site of acetate kinase (9Singh-Wissmann K. Ingram-Smith C. Miles R.D. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead of acting as a catalytic phosphorylation site, Glu384 may be involved in magnesium binding. In support of this proposal, variant Glu384 → Ala requires a 30-fold increase in the concentration of magnesium necessary for half-maximal velocity relative to that of the wild-type enzyme (35Miles R.D. Iyer P.P. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45059-45064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the results presented here combined with recent reports support a direct in-line mechanism. Finally, the work presented here lays the foundation for further research to elucidate the role of active site residues and the catalytic mechanism for this enzyme. Acetate kinase, which catalyzes the phosphoryl transfer of the ATP γ-phosphate to acetate, was one of the earliest phosphoryl transfer enzymes to be recognized. Since the discovery of acetate kinase in 1944 by Lipmann (1Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 155: 55-70Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and isolation in 1954 by Ochoa (2Rose I.A. Grunberg-Manago M. Korey S.R. Ochoa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 211: 737-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most research on the catalytic mechanism has been performed with the Escherichia coli enzyme. The early research led to two proposed catalytic mechanisms, a triple-displacement mechanism via a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate and a direct in-line mechanism. The direct in-line transfer mechanism is consistent with steady state kinetics (3Janson C.A. Cleland W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2567-2571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also stereochemical evidence (4Blattler W.A. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3927-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which indicates that there are an odd number of in-line phosphoryl transfers (5Spector L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2626-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Todhunter J.A. Purich D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

Either the nucleotide β-phosphate group is not essential for formation of the active conformation of acetate kinase or aluminum fluoride substitutes for both the nucleotide β- and γ-phosphates in the MgAMP-aluminum fluoride-acetate complex. The ability of MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, NaF, and acetate to inhibit acetate kinases from both E. coli (Bacteria domain) and phylogenetically distantM. thermophila (Archaea domain) indicates that the inhibition is related to the common mechanism of catalysis and not a nonspecific event.Although not always observed, the propensity of enzymes to maximize protein-substrate interactions in the transition state predicts tighter binding of substrates. The fluorescence quenching results indicate that acetate kinase has a higher binding affinity for MgADP when AlCl3, NaF, and acetate are present. Consistent with these results are the much lower K i values determined for ADP and acetate (in the presence of MgCl2, AlCl3, NaF, and the co-substrate) relative to theK m values for ADP and acetate. In conclusion, the fluorescence and K i data are consistent with the formation of a transition state analog, MgADP-aluminum fluoride-acetate.The primary metal complexes involved in acetate kinase inhibition were MgADP and aluminum fluoride; however, the 23% inhibition of acetate kinase by the preincubation mixture minus AlCl3 suggests the formation of magnesium fluoride, which is also inhibitory. In support of this scenario, magnesium fluoride, in addition to aluminum fluoride, is proposed to form in the transition state analog of G proteins (27Graham D.L. Eccleston J.F. Chung C.-W. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14981-14987Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consequently, a portion of the metal fluoride in the acetate kinase transition state analog is probably magnesium fluoride. The dependence of acetate kinase inhibition on the AlCl3concentration suggests the predominant metal fluoride species in the transition state analog is aluminum fluoride (28Issartel J.P. Dupuis A. Lunardi J. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Beryllium failed to replace aluminum in the inhibitory complex. Beryllium fluoride, in association with a bridging β-phosphate oxygen, is thought to mimic the tetrahedral nucleotide γ-phosphate in the ground state (29Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 30Xu Y.W. Morera S. Janin J. Cherfils J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Consequently, beryllium fluoride is not a true analog of the planar phosphoryl group during catalysis. Despite this fact, preincubation with MgADP, BeCl2, and NaF inhibits several phosphoryl transfer enzymes, including adenylate kinase and F1-ATPase (17Lunardi J. Dupuis A. Garin J. Issartel J.-P. Michel L. Chabre M. Vignais P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8958-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Garin J. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6821-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Acetate kinase may differ from these enzymes in the inability to form a locked active conformation without a planar phosphoryl analog in the inhibitory complex.The stoichiometry of the aluminum fluoride complex that forms in acetate kinase is uncertain. It has been proposed that pH plays a significant role in the aluminum to fluoride ratio of the transition state analog (32Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The acetate kinase was inhibited in a preincubation mixture containing MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, NaF, and acetate at a pH value of 5.5. At this pH, AlF4− is proposed to be the dominant species in the transition state analogs of kinases (32Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and thus may be the species formed in acetate kinase. A planar AlF4− molecule would not strictly mimic the planar phosphoryl group during catalysis. Nevertheless, transition state analogs containing AlF4− have been shown to be reasonable mimics of the transition state (29Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 33Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.T.

Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The nature of the nucleophilic attack may also help to determine the aluminum fluoride species in the transition state analog (30Xu Y.W. Morera S. Janin J. Cherfils J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of Gαi (33Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.T. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) and GαtGTPases (34Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), as well as myosin (29Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), indicate that an octahedrally coordinated aluminum is present in the transition state analog with four equatorial fluoride atoms, a nucleotide β-phosphate oxygen as one apical ligand, and a water molecule as the second apical ligand. Hydrolytic nucleotidases such as these may have more structural flexibility to accept AlF4− than would enzymes that utilize a protein functional group as the nucleophile (30Xu Y.W. Morera S. Janin J. Cherfils J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In nucleoside diphosphate kinase for example, in which an active site histidine attacks the γ-phosphate, steric considerations were invoked to explain the presence of AlF3 instead of AlF4− in the crystal structure (30Xu Y.W. Morera S. Janin J. Cherfils J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). If the above scenario is correct, the requirement for acetate in the proposed acetate kinase transition state analog suggests that this molecule acts as the nucleophile and further suggests that the aluminum fluoride species is AlF3, not AlF4−. This supposition is supported by a binding coefficient of ∼3 that was determined for NaF in formation of the inhibitory complex.Since the 1970s, there has been dispute over a single versustriple displacement mechanism for acetate kinase. The single displacement mechanism assumes direct in-line phosphoryl transfer from ATP to acetate, whereas the triple displacement mechanism involves phosphoryl transfer to two enzyme sites before transfer to acetate. Here we report the requirement for both ADP and acetate in formation of the transition state analog. The most straightforward interpretation of these results is that the phosphorylation of acetate by ATP occurs by a direct in-line mechanism. The protection from inhibition by non-hydrolyzable ATPγS or acetylphosphate suggests that the terminal phosphate of ATP, the phosphate group of acetylphosphate, and the aluminum fluoride of the transition state analog all share the same binding site. These results are consistent with a direct in-line mechanism. Other recent site-directed mutagenesis studies reported for the M. thermophila enzyme support the direct in-line mechanism. These studies have eliminated the possibility of active site histidine residues acting as phosphorylation sites in the catalytic mechanism (11Ingram-Smith C. Barber R.D. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33765-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, active site residues Arg91 and Arg241 were found to be essential for catalysis (10Singh-Wissmann K. Miles R.D. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3671-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These arginines are well positioned in the crystal structure to stabilize the transition state in a direct in-line mechanism (12Buss K.A. Cooper D.R. Ingram-Smith C. Ferry J.G. Sanders D.A. Hasson M.S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). If the acetate kinase reaction involves a direct in-line phosphoryl transfer, an alternative role must be proposed for active site residue Glu384, previously found to be essential for catalysis and postulated as the phosphorylation site of acetate kinase (9Singh-Wissmann K. Ingram-Smith C. Miles R.D. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead of acting as a catalytic phosphorylation site, Glu384 may be involved in magnesium binding. In support of this proposal, variant Glu384 → Ala requires a 30-fold increase in the concentration of magnesium necessary for half-maximal velocity relative to that of the wild-type enzyme (35Miles R.D. Iyer P.P. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45059-45064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the results presented here combined with recent reports support a direct in-line mechanism. Finally, the work presented here lays the foundation for further research to elucidate the role of active site residues and the catalytic mechanism for this enzyme. Studies on several kinases including F1-ATPase and UMP kinase indicate that AlF3–4 mimics the planar phosphoryl group in the catalytic transition state and, with the substrates, forms an abortive active site complex (17Lunardi J. Dupuis A. Garin J. Issartel J.-P. Michel L. Chabre M. Vignais P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8958-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9290-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here we report the inhibition of M. thermophila acetate kinase activity by MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, NaF, and acetate. The characteristics of the inhibition and other experiments indicate that a transition state analog, MgADP-aluminum fluoride-acetate, forms an abortive complex in the active site of acetate kinase. The requirements for formation of a transition state analog should mimic the requirements for catalysis. If MgADP-aluminum fluoride-acetate is a transition state analog for the acetate kinase, then any substrate that substitutes for acetate should form a transition state analog in conjunction with MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, and NaF. Propionate replaces acetate as a substrate (21Aceti D.J. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15444-15448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and as shown here inhibited the enzyme when preincubated with MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, NaF; however, butyrate is not a substrate for acetate kinase (21Aceti D.J. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15444-15448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and did not form an inhibitory complex with MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, and NaF. These results support MgADP-aluminum fluoride-acetate as a transition state analog. A distinguishing characteristic of acetate kinase is the ability to utilize various NTPs (21Aceti D.J. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15444-15448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in place of ATP. Each of the cognate NDPs (in conjunction with MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, NaF, and acetate) resulted in the inhibition of acetate kinase activity, further supporting the formation of a transition state analog. These results also indicate that inhibition of acetate kinase is not the consequence of a nonspecific interaction of aluminum fluoride with the adenosine moiety of ADP to form an inactive nucleotide complex. Although ADP is not a β-phosphoryl group donor in the acetate kinase reaction, AMP was able to partially replace ADP in the proposed transition state analog. AMP has previously been shown to be a competitive inhibitor versus ATP in the E. coli acetate kinase (K i of 7.4 mm) (26Purich D.L. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 149: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). MgAMP, aluminum fluoride, and acetate may form a transition state analog despite the absence of the β-phosphate. Either the nucleotide β-phosphate group is not essential for formation of the active conformation of acetate kinase or aluminum fluoride substitutes for both the nucleotide β- and γ-phosphates in the MgAMP-aluminum fluoride-acetate complex. The ability of MgCl2, ADP, AlCl3, NaF, and acetate to inhibit acetate kinases from both E. coli (Bacteria domain) and phylogenetically distantM. thermophila (Archaea domain) indicates that the inhibition is related to the common mechanism of catalysis and not a nonspecific event.

https://openalex.org/W2322570911,"The mesenchyme plays a crucial regulatory role in organ formation and maintenance. However, comprehensive molecular characterization of these cells is lacking. We found unexpectedly that primary mesenchyme, as well as mesenchymal cell clones, express T cell receptor (TCR)αβ mRNAs, lacking the variable region. Immunological and genetic evidence support the expression of a corresponding TCRβ protein. Additionally, mRNAs encoding TCR complex components including CD3 and ζ chain are present. A relatively higher expression of the mesenchymal TCRβ mRNA by cultured mesenchymal cell clones correlates with fast growth, whereas poorly expressing cells are slow growers and are contact inhibited. The clones that express relatively higher amount of the TCR mRNA exhibit an increased capacity to form tumors in nude mice. However, the expression of this mRNA in the mesenchyme is not per se leading to tumorigenesis, as demonstrated by primary mesenchyme that does not form tumors in mice while expressing moderate amounts of the TCR transcripts. The expression of mesencymal TCRβ was confined to the G2/M phases of the cell cycle in the MBA-13 mesenchymal cell line. This cell cycle dependent expression, considered together with the correlation between growth properties and the level of TCR expression by cell clones, implies association of mesenchymal TCR with cell growth control."

Analysis of the CG2958 sequence suggests that it consists of an N-terminal domain found in other Drosophilaproteins, a middle segment that is unique, and a C-terminal C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain. Expression studies show that the full-length protein is a tetramer formed by noncovalent association of disulfide-linked dimers that are linked through cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain. The expressed protein binds to immobilized yeast invertase through the C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain. Competition binding studies using monosaccharides demonstrate that CG2958 interacts specifically with fucose and mannose. Fucose binds ∼5-fold better than mannose. Blotting studies reveal that the best glycoprotein ligands are those that contain N-linked glycans bearing α1,3-linked fucose residues. Binding is enhanced by the additional presence of α1,6-linked fucose.

Recognition of endogenous glycoconjugates at the cell surface, in the extracellular matrix, and in serum can lead to intercellular adhesion and signaling as well as uptake and degradation. Animal lectins are diverse in structure, but they usually contain modular carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs)1 (1Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 2Dodd R.B. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 2000; 11: 71R-79RCrossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The C-type CRDs are the largest and most diverse class of CRDs. These domains share a common fold and show Ca2+-dependent sugar binding activity, although their selectivity for different carbohydrate ligands varies. Binding of sugars involves formation of a ternary complex between the protein, a bound Ca2+, and the sugar (3Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Selectivity for particular sugar ligands is determined in large part by the disposition of Ca2+-ligating residues in the protein, but can also reflect additional interactions with nearby regions of the protein surface. The C-type CRDs are a subset of a larger family of protein modules, the C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs) (4Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Although the CTLDs share a common fold, many do not bind Ca2+ and they often interact with ligands others than sugars. Profile analysis provides a powerful method for identifying CTLDs in proteins identified by genome sequence analysis. Using information about the structures and sugar binding activities of known C-type CRDs, it is possible to identify CTLDs that are likely to display carbohydrate binding activity. This approach has been applied to the complete genomic sequences of model organisms such asCaenorhabditis elegans (5Drickamer K. Dodd R.B. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and Drosophila melanogaster (2Dodd R.B. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 2000; 11: 71R-79RCrossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar) as well as to the human genome (see ctld.glycob.ox.ac.uk for a current update). The screen of theDrosophila genome revealed 32 genes that encode proteins containing CTLDs, of which only 6 have appropriate residues at the key positions required for Ca2+ and sugar binding in the C-type CRDs. Among these potential CRDs, the domain encoded in theCG2958 gene (also designated Lectin-24DB) shows a particularly strong resemblance to mammalian CRDs that bind mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine. The Ca2+-ligating residues are in the same configuration as those in serum mannose-binding protein and other C-type lectins that bind sugars with hydroxyl groups in the orientation corresponding to the 3- and 4-hydroxyl groups of mannose (6Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In addition, the CTLD of CG2958 contains a cluster of basic residues (Arg-Lys-Lys at positions 347–349) that can form a secondary binding site that enhances binding of C-type CRDs to anionic oligosaccharides (7Bouyain S. Rushton S. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To probe a possible role of CG2958 in sugar-mediated recognition, the protein has been expressed and its carbohydrate-binding properties have been examined. CG2958 appears to be an endogenous receptor for α1,3-linked fucose residues linked to the core GlcNAc residue ofN-linked oligosaccharides in Drosophila. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Both the Advantage 2 polymerase mix and the adultDrosophila Matchmaker cDNA library were supplied by CLONTECH. Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. Yeast invertase, glycans, and glycoproteins used in binding assays were obtained from Sigma. Man-BSA, purchased from E-Y Laboratories, had an average density of 30 mol of mannose/mol of protein. Na125I, Bolton-Hunter reagent, and nitrocellulose were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Immulon 4 polystyrene wells were from Dynex Technologies. Affinity resins were prepared by the method of Fornstedt and Porath (8Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). RNase B oligosaccharides were purchased from Oxford GlycoSciences, and oligosaccharides from soybean agglutinin were a kind gift of Daniel Mitchell and Brian Matthews (Glycobiology Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom). cDNA sequences encoding the CRD of CG2958 were amplified with forward primer 5′-aaggccggccaccaaggtcttctggccgaaatttgagcga-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ttgcggccgcttaaacttctttgtcggtttgacaaataac-3′. For amplification of the CRD and neck region, the alternative forward primer 5′-aaggccggcctccttggaggaatcagcgcagaaggttcca-3′ was used. The 5′ end of the cDNA was amplified using forward primer 5′-aaggccggcccgagcggaatccacagaaaattcccgatcc-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ttgcggccgccattttcattagcctcgcatcgagttgagc-3′. The primers include restriction sites for FseI or NotI. Following denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 1 min were executed. Fragments were digested withFseI and NotI and inserted into a pINIIIompA2 expression vector modified to contain the restriction sitesFseI and NotI downstream of the ompA signal sequence (9Grayeb J. Kimura H. Takahara M. Hsiung H. Masui Y. Inouye M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2437-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Portions of cDNAs without reverse transcription errors were recombined using convenient restriction sites. The resulting plasmids were used to transform Escherichia colistrain JA221. To avoid possible toxicity of the expressed fragments, the FseI site was introduced in a way that interrupts the reading frame. The correct reading frame was then generated by digesting the vector with FseI followed by trimming of the 3′ extensions with T4 DNA polymerase. Mutagenesis was performed by substituting double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides for restriction fragments in the expression plasmid. An aliquot of an overnight culture of transformed bacteria (20 ml) was used to inoculate 1 liter of Luria-Bertini medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and the culture was grown at 25 °C and 200 rpm. Expression of proteins was induced, when the A 550 nm reached 0.8, by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 40 μm and CaCl2 to a final concentration of 100 mm. Cells were grown for another 16–18 h. Harvested cells were suspended in loading buffer (150 mmNaCl, 25 mm CaCl2, and 25 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.8) and sonicated with the large probe of a Branson 250 sonifier at full power for a total of 10 min. The lysate was spun for 15 min in a Beckman JA14 rotor at 11,000 × g and for another 60 min at 100,000 × g in a Beckman Ti55.2 rotor. The supernatant was applied to a 1-ml column of invertase-Sepharose equilibrated with 5 ml of loading buffer. The column was washed with loading buffer, and proteins were recovered by elution with five aliquots of 0.5 ml of eluting buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 25 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.8). In most cases, the expressed proteins were further purified on a C4 reverse phase column (4.6 × 50 mm) eluted with an acetonitrile gradient increasing from 10 to 60% at a rate of 1.25%/min in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions were concentrated for 30 min to remove acetonitrile and then lyophilized. Aliquots (50 μl) of the neck and CRD fragment of CG2958 (0.1 mg/ml) in loading buffer were pipetted into Immulon 4 wells, and the plate was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein solution was removed, and wells were filled with 5% BSA in loading buffer. After 2 h at 4 °C, the blocking solution was discarded and wells were washed three times with cold HEPES-buffered saline (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 19 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5). Aliquots (100 μl) of inhibitor solutions at various concentrations in HEPES-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 125I-Man-BSA (∼0.5 μg/ml) were added to the protein-coated wells. After 2 h at 4 °C, wells were washed three times with cold HEPES-buffered saline and counted in a Wallac Wizard γ counter. Results were fitted to a simple competition binding equation (10Quesenberry M.S. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10831-10841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which KI is the concentration of inhibitor that gives 50% inhibition of 125I-Man-BSA binding, using the SigmaPlot program from Jandel Scientific. Results reported as averages ± standard deviations are from at least two experiments, each performed in duplicate. Assays showing little or no inhibition or with inhibitors available in limited quantities were performed only once, with duplicate samples for each data point. For iodination, 20 μl (0.1 mCi) of Bolton-Hunter reagent (11Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar) was dried with argon, CG2958 (100 μg in 200 μl of 100 mm NaCl, 25 mmCaCl2, and 25 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.8) was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 10 min. After addition of 800 μl of loading buffer, the labeled protein was recovered on invertase-Sepharose as described above. Glycoprotein samples (10 μg) were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, and the gel was transferred onto nitrocellulose (12Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with 2% hemoglobin in HEPES-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and incubated for 90 min with a solution of 125I-CG2958 in HEPES-buffered saline in the presence of 2% hemoglobin. Following three washes with cold HEPES-buffered saline for 5, 10, and 10 min, radioactivity was detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For dot blots, nitrocellulose membranes were soaked in gel transfer buffer and clamped into a 96-well dot blot apparatus. Protein samples prepared in 100 μl of gel transfer buffer were filtered through the membrane under vacuum, followed by another 100 μl of gel transfer buffer. The membrane was removed from the apparatus and blocked and incubated with 125I-CG2958 as for the gel blot. Neoglycolipids were prepared and resolved by thin layer chromatography following published procedures (13Mizuochi T. Loveless R.W. Lawson A.M. Chai W. Lachmann P.J. Childs R.A. Thiel S. Feizi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13834-13839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chromatograms were blocked and with 125I-CG2958 as described for the gel blots. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli, using gels containing 17.5% acrylamide (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared by heating at 100 °C for 5 min in sample buffer, either in the presence or absence of 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out as described previously in a Beckman XLA-70 centrifuge (15Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein was analyzed at three different loading concentrations at 12,000 rpm and 20 °C. Equilibrium distributions were fitted globally to a single species model, using the software supplied with the centrifuge. The partial specific volume of CG2958 was calculated as 0.730 ml/g from the amino acid composition (16Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold, New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar). The SwissProt data base (17Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (2359) Google Scholar) was accessed through the European Bioinformatics Institute web site, and sequence comparisons were performed using Fast A with the default parameters. Molecular modeling was performed with the Insight II software (Biosym), starting with coordinates for the CRD of mannose-binding protein modified to display selectin-like binding characteristics (Protein Data Bank entry 2kmb). The deduced amino acid sequence of CG2958 is shown in Fig. 1. The CTLD was previously identified using profile scanning algorithms, and the extent of the signal sequence was predicted using hydropathy plots combined with the sequence preference of signal peptidase (18Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar,19von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). The domain organization of the remainder of the protein was investigated by screening the SwissProt data base of protein sequences with the portion of CG2958 between the signal sequence and the CTLD. The results revealed that several proteins in Drosophilacontain sequences similar to residues 21–90 of CG2958. Within this N-terminal domain, two cysteine residues are conserved in most of these proteins. No related sequences in other organisms were detected. The remaining portion of CG2958, between the N-terminal domain and the CTLD, was rescreened against the protein sequence data base, but no significant sequence similarity was detected. A CG2958 cDNA was created using the polymerase chain reaction. Sequencing of multiple independent clones revealed a consistent discrepancy at the codon for amino acid 134, which encodes lysine in the Drosophila genome sequence (codon AAA) and arginine in the cDNAs (codon AGA). This difference may reflect a strain difference or a polymorphism in the Drosophilapopulation. Based on the sequence analysis, vectors were created from the amplified cDNA to express the entire CG2958 polypeptide, a fragment lacking the N-terminal domain, and a smaller fragment consisting only of the CTLD. In each case, a bacterial signal sequence was fused to the open reading frame to allow export into the periplasm of E. coli. Induction of protein synthesis in the presence of Ca2+ allows correct folding of many CTLDs under such conditions (10Quesenberry M.S. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10831-10841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of CG2958, sonication of the bacteria in Ca2+-containing buffer and passage over a column containing immobilized yeast invertase resulted in binding of the expressed fragments, which could be eluted with EDTA (Fig.2). The intact protein and the CRD + neck fragment were retained more effectively on the column than was the fragment consisting only of the CRD. Weak binding of isolated CRDs to affinity columns and stronger binding of larger lectin fragments often reflects multivalent binding by oligomers of the larger fragments. Portions of the lectin polypeptide outside the CRDs are often necessary to stabilize such oligomers (4Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The oligomeric states of the CG2958 fragments were investigated by gel electrophoresis and sedimentation analysis (Fig.3). When analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the intact protein runs as a covalent dimer, whereas the fragments that lack the N-terminal domain run as monomers. Thus, CG2958 consists of covalent dimers of polypeptides that are held together by disulfide bonds between cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain. Sedimentation analysis gives a molecular mass of 156,800 Da, which corresponds to a tetramer with a calculated molecular mass of 156,900 Da. These results demonstrate that CG2958 consists of a dimer of covalent dimers, in which each polypeptide comprises an N-terminal oligomerization domain, an intervening neck, and a C-terminal CRD. Although formation of the covalent oligomer requires the N-terminal domain, the relatively tight binding of the neck + CRD fragment to the invertase-Sepharose column suggests that noncovalent oligomerization can be mediated by the neck region. The observation that CG2958 binds to immobilized yeast invertase in a Ca2+-dependent manner suggested that it interacts with the extensive mannose-containing glycans attached to this protein. To obtain direct evidence for carbohydrate-dependent binding, the fragment representing the head plus neck region of CG2958 was immobilized on polystyrene wells. This fragment was chosen because it binds tightly to the affinity resin and is produced in high yield. Radiolabeled Man-BSA was found to bind to the immobilized protein and was therefore used as a reporter ligand to test the binding of potential sugar ligands in competition assays. These assays were first used to establish relative affinities of CG2958 for various monosaccharides (TableI).Table IInhibition of 125 I-Man-BSA binding to the neck and CRD fragment of CG2958 by monosaccharides and anionic polysaccharidesMonosaccharide K I K I /K I (Man) mmd-Mannose1.25 ± 0.011α-Methyl-d-mannoside1.3 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1d-Glucose134 ± 0.0101 ± 16 N-Acetyl-d-glucosamine149 ± 37114 ± 45 N-Acetyl-d-mannosamine>2501-aOnly partial inhibition was seen at the indicated highest concentration tested.>2002-Deoxy-d-glucose>250>200l-Fucose0.27 ± 0.010.22 ± 0.02α-O-Methyl-l-fucoside0.13 ± 0.010.11 ± 0.02β-O-Methyl-l-fucoside0.18 ± 0.030.15 ± 0.04d-Galactose38 ± 530 ± 4α-Methyl-d-galactoside≫2501-bNo inhibition was seen at the indicated highest concentration tested.≫200 N-Acetylneuraminic acid8.77.0Mannose 6-phosphate>25>20d-Glucuronic acid≫10>8GlcNAc 6-phosphate>25>20GlcNAc 3-phosphate>25>20Chondroitin sulfate A>181-cExpressed in moles of glucuronic acid or glucuronic plus iduronic acid.Heparin>131-cExpressed in moles of glucuronic acid or glucuronic plus iduronic acid.Hyaluronic acid (bovine trachea)0.231-cExpressed in moles of glucuronic acid or glucuronic plus iduronic acid.Hyaluronic acid (Streptococcus zooepidemicus)≫2.31-cExpressed in moles of glucuronic acid or glucuronic plus iduronic acid.Hyaluronic acid (human umbilical cord)>2.31-cExpressed in moles of glucuronic acid or glucuronic plus iduronic acid.Hyaluronic acid (rooster comb)≫2.31-cExpressed in moles of glucuronic acid or glucuronic plus iduronic acid.Fucoidan1.61-dExpressed in moles of fucose sulfate.Inhibition constants (K I ) for 125I-Man-BSA binding were obtained from solid-phase competition assays.1-a Only partial inhibition was seen at the indicated highest concentration tested.1-b No inhibition was seen at the indicated highest concentration tested.1-c Expressed in moles of glucuronic acid or glucuronic plus iduronic acid.1-d Expressed in moles of fucose sulfate. Open table in a new tab Inhibition constants (K I ) for 125I-Man-BSA binding were obtained from solid-phase competition assays. The inhibition data reveal that, among the neutral monosaccharides tested, the most effective inhibitors of Man-BSA binding arel-fucose and the α- and β-methyl fucosides. Among thed-hexoses tested, only mannose showed inhibition in the low millimolar range. Weak inhibition observed with free galactose is probably caused by interaction with the anomeric hydroxyl group of the free sugar, as has been previously observed (20Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), because α-methyl-d-galactoside does not inhibit binding. The selective binding of mannose and α-methyl-d-mannoside suggests that, as with other C-type lectins, the relative orientation of the 3- and 4-hydroxyl groups is important for binding to CG2958. The assays also reveal that binding is sensitive to the orientation and nature of the 2-substituent, because glucose, GlcNAc,N-acetylmannosamine, and 2-deoxyglucose are all poor inhibitors. Thus, the data suggest that the 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxyl groups of mannose may interact with the binding site of CG2958. In the light of the selectin-like aspects of the CG2958 sequence, various potential anionic ligands were tested. In the inhibition assay, only sialic acid showed any inhibition at the concentrations tested. The measured KI indicates that it binds to CG2958 with higher affinity than glucose, but the affinity is still 7-fold lower than the affinity for mannose. Polymers containing glucuronic acid as well as various sulfated sugars were also tested, but none of these have enhanced affinity compared with glucuronic acid. Finally, the result using fucoidan as an inhibitor indicates that sulfated fucose shows decreased rather than increased affinity compared with fucose. Direct incubation with radioiodinated sialyl Lewisx-BSA also failed to demonstrate any binding (data not shown). The high selectivity for fucose and the submillimolarKI are unusual in C-type CRDs, so it was of interest to determine what structural features of the CRD might enhance binding to this monosaccharide. In previous studies, the sequence Lys-Lys-Lys has been inserted into the CRD from mannose-binding protein in the positions corresponding to the Arg-Lys-Lys sequence in CG2958 (21Blanck O. Iobst S.T. Gabel C. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7289-7292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of this modified CRD complexed with the fucose-containing sialyl-Lewisx tetrasaccharide (22Ng K.K.S. Weis W.I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was used as a starting point to model the binding site of CG2958. There are four orientations in which pairs of hydroxyl groups of fucose can be superimposed on the hydroxyl groups that interact with Ca2+in the binding site (Fig. 4). Two of these structures involve interactions between Ca2+ and the 2- and 3-hydroxyl groups (orientations A and B) and two involve interaction with the 3- and 4-hydroxyl groups (orientations C and D). In orientationD, there are clashes with the modeled protein surface, so this orientation can be dismissed. In orientation C, the fucose residue approaches the side chains of residues that correspond to Asn327 and Arg347 of CG2958 in the model. Binding of the 2- and 3-hydroxyl groups, as in the original crystal structure, projects the sugar mostly away from the protein surface, but in orientation B there is a potential hydrogen bond between O1 of the sugar and Arg347. Because interactions of residues Asn327 or Arg347 with the O1 and O2 substituents of fucose could contribute to selective binding to this sugar, their role in preferential binding to fucose was tested by mutagenesis. The effects of changing these residues to alanine or lysine on the relative binding affinities for mannose and fucose were examined using the competition binding assay (Table II). Changing Asn327 to alanine has the most severe effect on the relative affinity for fucose, causing a nearly 3-fold reduction in theKI for fucose compared with mannose. There is a marginal effect when residue Arg347 is modified. The only orientation in which significant interactions with Asn327would be predicted is orientation C, suggesting that this is the most likely way that fucose interacts with CG2958. This orientation is similar to the orientation observed in crystals of E- and P-selectin with bound sialyl-Lewisx ligand.Table IICompetition binding assays for mutants of CG2958Mutation K I (Man) K I (Fuc) K I (Man)/K I (Fuc)Wild type1.7 ± 0.60.3 ± 0.16.6 ± 1.7N327A1.4 ± 0.70.7 ± 0.22.3 ± 1.0R347A0.9 ± 0.30.17 ± 0.045.5 ± 1.5R347K1.1 ± 0.20.20 ± 0.055.2 ± 1.4 Open table in a new tab To screen for potential oligosaccharide ligands for CG2958, the expressed protein was radioiodinated and used to probe a glycoprotein blot containing a range of glycan structures (Fig. 5). As a positive control, yeast invertase was included on the blot. The strong binding observed confirms that the radioiodinated material retains binding activity. No interaction with glycoproteins bearing complexN-linked glycans was detected. Binding to high mannose oligosaccharides is suggested by the interaction with RNase B, which contains a range of oligosaccharides from Man3GlcNAc2 to Man9GlcNAc2 (23Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 396-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, no binding to soybean agglutinin was detected, although this glycoprotein bears Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides (24Dorland L. van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Lis H. Sharon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7708-7711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether CG2958 binds preferentially to the smaller oligosaccharides that are more abundantly expressed on RNase B, the oligosaccharides from RNase B and soybean agglutinin were released and presented to CG2958 in the form of neoglycolipids on a thin layer chromatogram (Fig.5). In this format, binding to all of the mannose-containing structures, including Man9GlcNAc2, was observed at levels proportional to their abundance (25Childs R.A. Feizi T. Yuen C.T. Drickamer K. Quesenberry M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20770-20777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that binding of CG2958 to oligosaccharides may be influenced by the proteins to which they are conjugated. The other glycoprotein ligand detected in the blotting procedure is horseradish peroxidase. As a plant glycoprotein, horseradish peroxidase bears glycans containing sugars, such as xylose, and linkages, including fucose residues α1,3-linked to the inner core GlcNAc residue, that are not found in mammalian glycoproteins (26Kurosaka A. Yano A. Itoh N. Kuroda Y. Nakagawa T. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4168-4172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wilson I.B.H. Harthill J.E. Mullin N.P. Ashford D.A. Altmann F. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Xylose is not found in N-linked glycans on Drosophilaglycoproteins, but the core α1,3-fucose residue is present (28Fabini G. Freilinger A. Atltmann F. Wilson I.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28058-28067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The most striking finding from the comparison of monosaccharide affinities is the relatively high selectivity for fucose, suggesting that the binding to horseradish peroxidase might be a result of the presence of core fucose. Goat immunoglobulin G, which bears core α1,6-linked fucose (29Raju T.S. Briggs J.B. Borge S.M. Jones A.J.S. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), did not react, suggesting that the binding might be specific for α1,3-linked fucose. The possibility that CG2958 binds to core α1,3-linked fucose residues was investigated using various modified human serum transferrin preparations, in an approach previously used for studying binding of anti-horseradish peroxidase antibody (28Fabini G. Freilinger A. Atltmann F. Wilson I.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28058-28067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). After removal of the terminal sialic acid and galactose residues, fucose was added enzymatically in vitro to the inner GlcNAc residue in either α1,3- or α1,6-linkage. The nonreducing terminal GlcNAc residues were then removed to expose the modified Man3GlcNAc2 core. In preliminary studies, these proteins were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with radioiodinated CG2958. Only the proteins bearing structures modified with α1,3-linked or α1,3- and α1,6-linked core fucose were bound by the labeled protein (data not shown). Similar modified proteins in which the nonreducing terminal GlcNAc residues were retained were also tested, but no binding was observed. Binding to the fucosylated Man3GlcNAc2 core structures was quantified by performing a dot blot assay and comparing the binding to that obtained with dilutions of horseradish peroxidase (Fig.6). Binding to 1-μg aliquots of the modified transferrin samples exceeds binding to comparable amounts of horseradish peroxidase, even though here are only twoN-glycosylation sites in transferrin and seven in horseradish peroxidase and the in vitro fucosylation of transferrin is incomplete. The results confirm that binding is dependent on the presence of α1,3-linked fucose, and they suggest that addition of α1,6-linked fucose enhances the binding. The enhancement of CG2958 binding to modified transferrin by α1,6-fucosylation is consistent with the findings that all α1,3-fucosylated N-glycans found in adult flies are difucosylated and that α1,6-fucosylated N-glycans are the preferred substrates for the α1,3-fucosyltransferase. The results presented here demonstrate that Drosophilaprotein CG2958 is a fucose-binding lectin that interacts specifically with α1,3-linked fucose attached to the core of N-linked glycans. This binding can occur with oligosaccharides that are attached to proteins, so CG2958 is a potential endogenous receptor forDrosophila glycoproteins that bear core α1,3-fucosylated glycans. CG2958 is predicted to be secreted, and the full-length, expressed protein is soluble in the absence of detergents. Its tetrameric structure indicates that it would have the ability to interact with multiple N-linked glycans simultaneously. Depending on the geometry of the tetramer, such multivalent binding could lead to high affinity attachment to cell surfaces or to cross-linking of glycoproteins. CG2958 was initially considered a potential selectin ortholog, largely based on the presence of a cluster of three basic residues adjacent to the predicted primary sugar-binding site in both the selectins and CG2958. In previous studies, it has been shown that such a cluster of residues can form a secondary, ionic strength-sensitive subsite in C-type CRDs, facilitating the binding of sialyl-Lewisx and other anionic oligosaccharide ligands (7Bouyain S. Rushton S. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Additionally, like the selectin CRDs, the CRD in CG2958 appears to contain a single Ca2+-binding site, because several of the acidic amino acid residues that usually form the secondary site are not conserved in CG2958 (Fig. 1). The present studies suggest that CG2958 and the selectins share the ability to bind fucose-containing ligands, but their oligosaccharide-binding characteristics are very different. CG2958 does not bind with high affinity to any of the anionic oligosaccharide or polysaccharide ligands tested. Thus, there seems to be little basis for suggesting that CG2958 might function in a selectin-like fashion in Drosophila. Despite the differences between the CRDs in the selectins and CG2958, it is interesting that these proteins do share the ability to bind to fucose attached to N-acetylglucosamine in α1,3 linkage. The modeling and mutagenesis results suggest a possible orientation of fucose-containing ligands in the binding site of the CRD in CG2958, in which the anomeric hydroxyl group would be near to one of the loops of the polypeptide adjacent to the conserved Ca2+ that forms the nucleus of the sugar-binding site (Fig. 4). The portions of the E- and P-selectin CRDs that correspond to the loop containing Asn327 in CG2958 form part of the extended sialyl-Lewisx-binding sites (30Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D.

Differences in sequence between these loops in the selectins and CG2958 preclude exactly analogous contacts, but the results suggest that the loop may be a common determinant of ligand-binding specificity beyond the simple monosaccharide-binding site. Although the modeling studies are suggestive, further structural analysis will clearly be necessary. The pattern of staining of Drosophila embryos with anti-horseradish peroxidase antibodies suggests a role for core α1,3-linked fucose in the nervous system (31Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2700-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 32Snow P.M. Patel N.H. Harrelson A.L. Goodman C.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Katz F. Moats W. Jan Y.N. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3471-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The ability of CG2958 to serve as an endogenous receptor for glycoproteins bearing core α1,3-linked fucose further suggests that this protein might also be expressed in the nervous system. The Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (34Rubin G.M. Hong L. Brokstein P. Evans-Holm M. Frise E. Stapleton M. Harvey D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 2222-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) has reported expressed sequence tags for the mRNA encoding CG2958 in cDNA libraries from head, brain, and sensory organs in the larval-early pupal stage suggestive of expression throughout development (identifiers HL05328 and LP02926). Structural data for glycoconjugates in invertebrates, includingDrosophila, are limited (35Seppo A. Tiemeyer M. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36Altmann F. Fabini G. Ahorn H. Wilson I.B.H. Biochemie. 2001; 83: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the information that is available suggests that there are substantial differences between the glycans in invertebrates and vertebrates. Particularly striking differences are observed in the terminal sugars present on glycans. Although sialic acid and galactose are common terminal elaborations of vertebrate glycans, these sugars are rare, if present at all, in invertebrates. In contrast, fucose appears to be much more abundant in invertebrates. These data suggest that cell surface carbohydrates have evolved somewhat differently in different animal lineages. The results reported here suggest that endogenous receptors for cell surface glycans have evolved in parallel to recognize a distinct complement of sugar structures.

This process, known as transformational recombination, is dependent in part on themmsA gene, which encodes a protein having a sequence that is 40% identical to that of the Escherichia coli RecG protein, a junction-specific DNA helicase believed to be involved in the branch migration of recombinational intermediates. We have developed an expression system for the MmsA protein and have purified the MmsA protein to more than 99% homogeneity.

In the standard direction (circular single-stranded (ss) DNA + linear double-stranded (ds) DNA → linear ssDNA + nicked circular dsDNA), the MmsA protein appears to promote the branch migration of partially exchanged intermediates in a direction opposite of the RecA protein, resulting in a nearly complete inhibition of the overall strand exchange reaction. In the reverse direction (linear ssDNA + nicked circular dsDNA → circular ssDNA + linear dsDNA), however, the MmsA protein appears to facilitate the conversion of partially exchanged intermediates into fully exchanged products, leading to a pronounced stimulation of the overall reaction.

Microbiol. 1998; 27: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this process, known as transformational recombination, has evolved as a general mechanism that allows S. pneumoniae to change its genetic composition in response to environmental changes and stresses (3Claverys J.-P. Prudhomme M. Mortier-Barriere Martin B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For example, transformational recombination is believed to have contributed to the recent emergence of penicillin-resistance in clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae (4Dowson C.G. Coffey T.J. Spratt B.G. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 361-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 5Hakenbeck R. Grebe T. Zahner D. Stock J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that transformational recombination is dependent on the presence of the recA gene, which encodes a DNA recombinase analogous to the RecA protein from Escherichia coli (2Mortier-Barriere I. de Saizieu A. Claverys J.-P. Martin B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6Martin B. Ruellan J-M. Angulo J. Devoret R. Claverys J.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We recently developed an expression system and purification protocol for the S. pneumoniae RecA protein (7Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The purified S. pneumoniae RecA protein (RecA(Sp)) has an ATP-dependent three-strand exchange activity that is generally similar to that of the E. coli RecA protein (RecA(Ec)) (7Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the standard three-strand exchange reaction, a circular ssDNA and a homologous linear dsDNA are recombined to form a nicked circular dsDNA and a linear ssDNA. This reaction proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, RecA protein polymerizes onto the circular ssDNA (1 RecA monomer/3 nucleotides of ssDNA), forming a helical nucleoprotein filament known as the presynaptic complex. In the second phase, the presynaptic complex interacts with a homologous linear dsDNA, and pairing between the circular ssDNA and the complementary strand from the linear dsDNA is initiated. In the third phase, the complementary linear strand is completely transferred to the circular ssDNA by unidirectional branch migration (in the 5′-3′ direction relative to the circular ssDNA) to yield the nicked circular dsDNA and displaced linear ssDNA products (8Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three-strand exchange activity of the RecA(Ec) protein is stimulated by the E. coli SSB protein, a homotetrameric, non-sequence-specific, single-stranded DNA-binding protein that is involved in many aspects of DNA biochemistry (10Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). It is believed thatE. coli SSB protein (SSB(Ec)) stimulates strand exchange both presynaptically (by facilitating the binding of RecA(Ec) protein to the circular ssDNA substrate), and postsynaptically (by binding to the displaced linear strand that is generated when the circular ssDNA invades the linear dsDNA substrate) (8Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our initial characterization of the RecA(Sp) protein, we found that its three-strand exchange activity was also strongly stimulated by SSB(Ec) protein (7Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). More recently, we isolated the SSB protein from S. pneumoniae (SSB(Sp)) and showed that this protein stimulates the RecA(Sp)-promoted three-strand exchange reaction in a manner similar to that of the SSB(Ec) protein (11Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that transformational recombination is also dependent, at least in part, on the mmsA gene (12Martin B. Sharples G.J. Humbert O. Lloyd R.G. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ThemmsA gene encodes a protein of 671 amino acids (75,188 Da) having a sequence that is 40% identical to the E. coli RecG protein (693 amino acids, 76,438 Da), a protein believed to be involved in the branch migration of recombinational intermediates (12Martin B. Sharples G.J. Humbert O. Lloyd R.G. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). On the basis of this similarity, it has been proposed that the S. pneumoniae MmsA protein (MmsA(Sp)) may be involved in the branch migration of three-stranded intermediates formed by the RecA(Sp) protein during transformational recombination (12Martin B. Sharples G.J. Humbert O. Lloyd R.G. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To directly evaluate its mechanistic role in transformational recombination, we have developed an expression system and purification protocol for the MmsA(Sp) protein. These procedures, the biochemical properties of the purified MmsA(Sp) protein, and the effects of the MmsA(Sp) protein on the RecA(Sp) protein-promoted three-strand exchange reaction are described in this report. S. pneumoniae RecA protein (7Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) andS. pneumoniae SSB protein (11Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. ATP and [α-32P]ATP were from AmershamBiosciences. Circular φX ssDNA (+ strand) and circular φX dsDNA were from New England Biolabs. The ssDNA oligomers, DNA I (5′-GACGCTGCCGAATTCTACCAGTGCCTTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCC-3′), DNA II (5′-CAACGGCATAAAGCTTGACGATTACATTGCTAGGACATGCTGTCTACAGGATCCGACTATCGA-3′), DNA III (5′-TGGGTGAACCTGCAGGTGGGCAAAGATGTCCTAGCAATGTAATCGTCAAGCTTTATGCCGTT-3′), and DNA IV (5′-CAACGGCATAAACGTGACGATTACATTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCC-3′), were from Invitrogen. The three-stranded DNA junction was prepared by annealing DNA I, DNA II, and DNA III as described by Whitby and Lloyd (13Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3302-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The fully paired dsDNA was prepared by annealing DNA III and DNA IV, and the partially paired dsDNA was prepared by annealing DNA I and DNA III. Linear φX dsDNA was prepared from circular φX dsDNA by PstI digestion as described by Cox and Lehman (14Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Linear φX ssDNA was prepared from circular φX ssDNA by annealing a complementary DNA oligomer (25 nucleotides) to the region corresponding to thePstI site and then digesting it with PstI. Nicked circular φX dsDNA was generated by a RecA protein-mediated strand exchange reaction between circular φX ssDNA and linear φX dsDNA (using the conditions described in the legend to Fig. 5), and was then purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Single- and double-stranded DNA concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm using the conversion factors 36 and 50 μg ml−1 A 260−1, respectively. All DNA concentrations are expressed as total nucleotides. The S. pneumoniae mmsA gene was amplified from 2 μl of a saturated culture of R800 S. pneumoniae cells (generously provided by Dr. Jean-Pierre Claverys, Université Paul Sabatier, Toulouse Cedex, France) using in situ PCR andPfu DNA polymerase as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The primers used (5′-GGATGGGAGCATATG AATCTACATCAACC-3′ and 5′-AAGGGATCCTTAGAGAAAGCTTAATCC-3′) corresponded to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding sequence (italics) of the mmsA gene and also contained the recognition sequences for the restriction enzymes NdeI and BamHI (underlined). 2S. pneumoniae genome sequence data were obtained from the Institute for Genomic Research Web site at www.tigr.org. The DNA product obtained from the polymerase chain reaction was digested withNdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET-21a (Novagen) to give the final construct, pETmmsA(Sp). The insert was sequenced by the Johns Hopkins University DNA Sequencing Facility and found to be identical to the mmsA gene nucleotide sequence (GenBankTM accession number Z49988) (12Martin B. Sharples G.J. Humbert O. Lloyd R.G. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The S. pneumoniae mmsA gene was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). Competent BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with pETmmsA (Sp) and selected for growth on LB/carbenicillin/chloramphenicol plates. A single BL21(DE3)pLys/pETmmsA(Sp) colony was used to inoculate LB broth (5 ml) containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml), and the resulting culture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. A portion of the culture (2 ml) was then used to inoculate 2 liters of LB broth/carbenicillin (50 μg/ml)/chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml), and the cells were grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.8. The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 liter of LB broth/carbenicillin (50 μg/ml)/chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). Isopropyl-1-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to induce expression of the S. pneumoniae MmsA protein, and the culture was incubated at 27 °C for 12 h. The cells (10 g) were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)/20% sucrose/1 mm EDTA, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cell suspension was stored at – 80 °C. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The frozen BL21(DE3)pLys/pETmmsA(Sp) cell suspension (50 ml) was thawed on ice overnight; the cells lysed upon thawing because of the constitutive expression of T7 lysozyme from the pLysS plasmid (Novagen). The thawed suspension was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet was discarded, and 0.9 ml of Polymin-P (5%, pH 7.9) was added to the supernatant (35 ml). The suspension was mixed for 15 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was suspended in 35 ml of R buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/10% glycerol/7 mmβ-mercaptoethanol)/1.0 M NaCl. The suspension was centrifuged as described above. Ammonium sulfate (0.42 g/ml final concentration) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The mixture was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved in 8 ml of R buffer, and the mixture was dialyzed against 2 liters of R buffer/0.5 M NaCl. The dialyzed fraction was diluted with R buffer to a final NaCl concentration of 0.1m (40 ml final volume) and then loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (30 ml, Sigma) that had been equilibrated with R buffer/0.1 M NaCl. The column was then washed with R buffer/0.1 M NaCl. The protein-containing fractions (Bradford assay) were pooled and then loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column (30 ml; Sigma) that had been equilibrated with R buffer/0.1 m NaCl. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of R buffer/0.1 M NaCl and then eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of R buffer/0.1–1.0 M NaCl. The protein-containing fractions (centered at 0.4 m NaCl) were pooled and then loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 HR column (200 ml; Sigma) that had been equilibrated with R buffer/1 m NaCl. The fractions containing MmsA protein (identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of R buffer/0.2 m NaCl. The dialyzed fraction was loaded onto a Progel-TSK Heparin-5PW column (Supelco) that had been equilibrated with R buffer/0.2 M NaCl, and it was then eluted with a linear gradient (30 ml) of R buffer/0.2–1.0 m NaCl. The fractions containing MmsA protein were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of R buffer (pH 8.5). The dialyzed fraction was loaded onto a MonoQ HR 5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with R buffer (pH 8.5), and was then eluted with a linear gradient (30 ml) of R buffer(pH 8.5)/0–1.0 M NaCl. The fractions containing MmsA protein (centered at 0.4 m NaCl) were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/20% glycerol/1 mm DTT/0.1 mm EDTA) to yield the final fraction (2 mg) of highly purified S. pneumoniae MmsA protein (Fig.1). The concentration of the purified S. pneumoniae MmsA protein was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient of 54,740 m−1cm−1, which was calculated from the amino acid sequence (12Martin B. Sharples G.J. Humbert O. Lloyd R.G. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using the formula of Gill and von Hippel (15Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal protein sequencing of the purified S. pneumoniae MmsA protein was carried out by the Johns Hopkins Protein/Peptide Sequencing Facility. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometric analysis was carried out by the Applied Biosynthesis Mass Spectrometry Facility at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. To develop a purification procedure for the MmsA(Sp) protein, we first used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the mmsA gene from wild-type R800 S. pneumoniae cells. The sequence of our amplified gene was identical to that reported previously for theS. pneumoniae mmsA gene (12Martin B. Sharples G.J. Humbert O. Lloyd R.G. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We then cloned themmsA gene into a pET21a expression vector and expressed the protein in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. With this expression system, the MmsA(Sp) protein corresponded to ∼5–10% of the total protein in the crude cell extract, and we were able to obtain 2 mg of highly purified protein (more than 99% homogeneity) from 10 g of cells (Fig. 1). The mobility of the purified MmsA(Sp) protein during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was consistent with a protein with a molecular mass of ∼75,000 Da (Fig. 1). Mass spectrometric analysis of the purified MmsA(Sp) protein yielded a molecular mass of ∼75,100 Da, in excellent agreement with the molecular mass of 75,188 Da predicted by the protein sequence (12Martin B. Sharples G.J. Humbert O. Lloyd R.G. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there was no indication of a peak at the position corresponding to the molecular mass of the E. coliRecG protein (76,438 Da; Ref. 16Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6837-6843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that the MmsA(Sp) protein preparation contained no detectable E. coli RecG protein. Amino-terminal protein sequencing confirmed that the preparation corresponded to the MmsA(Sp) protein. The purified MmsA(Sp) protein was analyzed for DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity at pH 7.5 and 37 °C. The initial set of reactions was carried out at a fixed concentration of MmsA(Sp) protein (0.3 μm) and ATP (4 mm), in the presence of a variety of oligomeric DNA effectors (1–75 μm). The oligomers that were used to construct these DNA effectors are described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2, the MmsA(Sp) protein exhibited ATP hydrolysis activity in the presence of each of the DNA effectors that was examined. The best effector was a partially paired dsDNA, with a maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis of ∼4500 mol ATP hydrolyzed/min/mol MmsA protein being reached at DNA concentrations of 30 μm or higher (Fig. 2). The reaction was less efficient when either a fully paired dsDNA or a ssDNA oligomer was provided as the effector (Fig. 2). There was no detectable ATP hydrolysis by the MmsA protein in the absence of DNA. The preference of the MmsA(Sp) protein for the partially paired dsDNA effector is similar to the DNA specificity that has been reported for the E. coli RecG protein (17Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19729-19739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and suggests that the MmsA(Sp) protein may interact favorably with ssDNA/dsDNA junctions. The dependence of the MmsA(Sp) protein-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis reaction on ATP concentration was determined at a fixed concentration of MmsA(Sp) protein (0.3 μm) and a saturating concentration of the partially paired dsDNA effector (50 μm). The maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis under these conditions was ∼4500 mol ATP hydrolyzed/min/mol MmsA protein, and the apparent K m for ATP was ∼0.7 mm (Fig.3). The MmsA(Sp) protein was examined for DNA junction-helicase activity at pH 7.5 and 37 °C, using an oligomeric three-stranded DNA junction substrate that was used previously with theE. coli RecG protein (13Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3302-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this three-stranded junction, two noncomplementary single-stranded oligonucleotides are each paired with a third single-stranded oligonucleotide; the 5′-half of the third strand is complementary to one of the noncomplementary strands and the 3′-half is complementary to other noncomplementary strand. The central 12 nucleotides of the third strand are complementary to both noncomplementary strands, thus allowing the three-stranded junction to branch migrate through this region. The oligomers that were used to construct the three-stranded junction are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction that occurred when MmsA(Sp) protein (0.5 nm) was added to the three-stranded junction (500 nm) in the presence of ATP (5 mm) is shown in Fig.4. In this reaction, the central strand of the three-stranded junction was 32P-end labeled. The MmsA(Sp) protein was able to unwind the three-stranded junction to form either of the two partially paired dsDNAs (32P-labeled) and the corresponding displaced linear ssDNAs (unlabeled) as reaction products. Neither the partially paired dsDNA nor a fully paired dsDNA substrate of the same length was unwound under these conditions (gel not shown), indicating that the unwinding activity of the MmsA(Sp) protein was specific for the three-stranded junction. No unwinding of the three-stranded junction occurred if ATP was omitted from the reaction solution, indicating that the reaction was dependent on ATP (gel not shown). The ATP-dependent three-stranded junction-helicase activity of the MmsA(Sp) protein is similar to that of the E. coli RecG protein (13Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3302-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The effect of the MmsA(Sp) protein on the strand exchange activity of the RecA(Sp) protein was examined at pH 7.5 and 37 °C, using the standard ATP-dependent three-strand exchange reaction (14Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In this reaction, a circular φX ssDNA (5386 nucleotides) and a homologous linear φX dsDNA (5386 base pairs) are recombined to form a nicked circular φX dsDNA and a linear φX ssDNA; the substrates and products of this reaction are readily monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis (14Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out in the presence of SSB(Sp) protein, which strongly stimulates the strand exchange activity of the RecA(Sp) protein (11Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The three-strand exchange reaction that was promoted by the RecA(Sp) protein in the absence of MmsA(Sp) protein is shown in Fig.5 A. In this reaction, the formation of partially exchanged DNA intermediates was apparent within 5 min and the fully exchanged nicked circular dsDNA product could be detected within 15 min. The nicked circular dsDNA product accumulated to a maximal level after ∼30 min. This reaction time course is consistent with our previously reported results (11Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The three-strand exchange reaction that was promoted by the RecA(Sp) protein in the presence of MmsA(Sp) protein is shown in Fig. 5,B and C. When MmsA(Sp) protein was added to the reaction after the partially exchanged intermediates had formed but before they had been converted into the fully exchanged nicked circular dsDNA product (10 min), the intermediates disappeared rapidly and the formation of the fully exchanged product was strongly inhibited (Fig.5 B). When MmsA(Sp) protein was added at the beginning of the reaction, there was no detectable accumulation of intermediates and the yield of the fully exchanged product was reduced further still (Fig.5 C). These results suggest that the partially exchanged intermediates that were formed by the RecA(Sp) protein were branch-migrated by the MmsA(Sp) protein in the direction opposite of the RecA protein-promoted strand exchange reaction (i.e. in the 3′-5′ direction relative to the circular ssDNA substrate), resulting in the reformation of the circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA substrates. A similar inhibitory effect has been reported for theE. coli RecG protein on the RecA(Ec) protein-promoted three-strand exchange reaction (13Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G.

A consideration of the results described above suggested that the effect of the MmsA(Sp) protein on the three-strand exchange activity of the RecA(Sp) protein might depend on the manner in which the strand exchange reaction is carried out. In particular, we reasoned that if we carried out the reaction in the direction opposite of that of the standard three-strand exchange reaction (i.e. by starting with linear φX ssDNA and nicked circular φX dsDNA as our strand exchange substrates), then a MmsA(Sp) protein-promoted branch migration of the partially exchanged intermediates to form circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA would act to stimulate (rather than inhibit) the overall strand exchange reaction. To test this idea, we examined the RecA(Sp) protein-promoted three-strand exchange reaction between a linear φX ssDNA and nicked circular φX dsDNA in the presence and absence of MmsA(Sp) protein (this reaction will be referred to below as the reverse three-strand exchange reaction). The reverse three-strand exchange reaction that was promoted by the RecA(Sp) protein in the absence of MmsA(Sp) protein is shown in Fig.6 A. In this reaction, the formation of partially exchanged intermediates was apparent within 5 min and these intermediates accumulated to a maximum level after ∼15 min. In contrast to the results obtained in the standard reaction, however, the partially exchanged intermediates were not converted to fully exchanged products in the presence of RecA(Sp) protein alone (Fig. 6 A). When MmsA(Sp) protein was added to the reaction after the partially exchanged intermediates had formed (15 min), however, the intermediates disappeared rapidly, and the formation of the fully exchanged linear dsDNA product was apparent within 10 min after MmsA(Sp) protein addition (Fig. 6 B). When MmsA(Sp) protein was added at the beginning of the reaction, there was no detectable accumulation of intermediates, but the formation of linear dsDNA was still detected (Fig. 6 C). No strand exchange products were formed in the presence of MmsA(Sp) protein if RecA(Sp) protein was omitted from the reaction solution (gel not shown). These results suggest that the partially exchanged intermediates that were formed by the RecA(Sp) protein were branch-migrated by the MmsA(Sp) protein in the direction opposite of the RecA protein-promoted strand exchange reaction (i.e. in the 3′-5′ direction relative to the linear ssDNA substrate) to form the linear dsDNA product. The MmsA(Sp) protein has DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and DNA junction-helicase activities that are similar to those of the RecG protein from E. coli. These findings provide biochemical support for the previous proposal (based on sequence similarity and genetic evidence) that the MmsA(Sp) protein is anS. pneumoniae homolog of the E. coli RecG protein (12Martin B. Sharples G.J. Humbert O. Lloyd R.G. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the E. coli RecG protein may be involved in the recombinational repair of stalled replication forks (18McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8227-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and it is possible that the MmsA(Sp) protein will be found to play a similar role in S. pneumoniae, although this has not yet been investigated. It has been shown, however, that a null mutation in the mmsA gene leads to marked reduction in transformational recombination in S. pneumoniae, indicating that the MmsA(Sp) protein plays a direct role in this process (12Martin B. Sharples G.J. Humbert O. Lloyd R.G. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The first step in transformational recombination involves the binding of exogenous dsDNA to one of the specific uptake sites on the surface of a S. pneumoniae cell (19Dubnau D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 217-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The DNA is initially cleaved into fragments (several kb in size) by a surface-bound nuclease. One strand of the dsDNA fragment is then degraded further into smaller oligonucleotides, whereas the complementary linear ssDNA is transported through the cell wall and membrane into the cell cytosol (19Dubnau D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 217-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). It is presumed that the RecA(Sp) protein will then mediate the assimilation of this ssDNA into a homologous region of the double-strandedS. pneumoniae chromosome (20Mortier-Barriere I. Humbert O. Martin B. Prudhomme M. Claverys J.-P. Microb. Drug Resist. 1997; 3: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The means by which the MmsA(Sp) protein would facilitate the RecA(Sp) protein-mediated transformational recombination reaction has not been clear inasmuch as it has been reported that the E. coli RecG protein inhibits the three-strand exchange activity of the RecA(Ec) protein (12Martin B. Sharples G.J. Humbert O. Lloyd R.G. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3302-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Mortier-Barriere I. Humbert O. Martin B. Prudhomme M. Claverys J.-P. Microb. Drug Resist. 1997; 3: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although our results indicate that the MmsA(Sp) protein can similarly inhibit the three-strand exchange activity of the RecA(Sp) protein, this inhibitory effect was observed only when the strand exchange reaction was carried out in the standard manner, with a circular ssDNA and a linear dsDNA as the starting substrates (Fig.7 A). In this direction, the circular ssDNA substrate can pair with the 3′-end of the complementary strand of the linear dsDNA substrate. The branch migration activity of the RecA(Sp) protein can then extend this three-stranded junction in the 5′-3′ direction (relative to the circular ssDNA substrate) to form the nicked circular dsDNA and linear ssDNA products (8Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When MmsA(Sp) protein is included in the reaction, however, the initial partially exchanged intermediates may be branch-migrated in the direction opposite of the RecA(Sp) protein to regenerate the starting circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA substrates (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, if the three-strand exchange reaction is carried out in the reverse direction, with a linear ssDNA and a nicked circular dsDNA as the starting substrates, a MmsA(Sp) protein-promoted branch migration of the partially exchanged intermediates to form circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA would have the effect of stimulating (rather than inhibiting) the overall reaction (Fig. 7 B). It has been reported that the RecA(Ec) protein was unable to promote a strand exchange reaction between linear ssDNA and gapped circular dsDNA substrates that were similar to those used in our reverse strand exchange reactions (21Roman L.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7375-7385Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with this earlier report in that they show that although the RecA(Sp) protein is able to form initial pairing intermediates between a linear ssDNA and nicked circular dsDNA, it is unable to readily extend these intermediates to form fully exchanged products. The incomplete reaction that was observed in the reverse direction may be due to the linear nature of the ssDNA substrate. Because RecA protein polymerizes on ssDNA in the 5′-3′ direction and dissociates from the 5′-end of the RecA-ssDNA filament, the 3′-end of the linear ssDNA substrate will be preferentially covered with RecA protein and will therefore be more likely to invade the nicked circular dsDNA (8Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the 3′-end of the linear ssDNA invades the dsDNA, however, the branch migration activity of the RecA protein (which is 5′-3′ relative to the linear ssDNA) will be unable to extend this heteroduplex junction (Fig. 7 B). When the MmsA(Sp) protein is included in the reaction, however, it appears to facilitate the branch migration of these junctions in the 3′-5′ direction (relative to the linear ssDNA), leading to the formation of the fully exchanged linear dsDNA product (Fig.7 B). Because transformational recombination is believed to involve the recombination of a linear ssDNA into the double-stranded S. pneumoniae chromosome (19Dubnau D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 217-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), the reverse three-strand exchange reaction may be more appropriate than the standard reaction as a model reaction for this process. In fact, the sequential reaction that we describe here, in which an initial RecA(Sp) protein-mediated invasion of a linear ssDNA into a homologous dsDNA is followed by a MmsA(Sp) protein-mediated branch migration of the three-stranded intermediate, is consistent with a hypothetical model for transformational recombination that was envisioned by Claverys and colleagues (12Martin B. Sharples G.J. Humbert O. Lloyd R.G. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Mortier-Barriere I. Humbert O. Martin B. Prudhomme M. Claverys J.-P. Microb. Drug Resist. 1997; 3: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, although our results suggest that the RecA(Sp) and MmsA(Sp) protein can act together to carry out a complete strand exchange reaction between a polymeric linear ssDNA and homologous dsDNA, the efficiency of this coupled reaction is relatively low under our present reaction conditions. In particular, a comparison of the reaction time courses in Figs. 5 and 6 indicates that the yield of initial pairing intermediates is lower in the reverse reaction than in the standard reaction. This is likely due to an inefficient assembly of RecA(Sp) protein on the linear ssDNA substrate. The three-strand exchange activity of the RecA(Sp) protein is strongly stimulated by SSB(Sp) protein (11Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and SSB(Sp) protein was included in the reactions shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The RecA(Sp) protein differs from the RecA(Ec) protein, however, in that its ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity is completely inhibited by SSB(Sp) protein, apparently because SSB(Sp) protein displaces RecA(Sp) protein from ssDNA (22Steffen S.E. Katz F.S. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14493-14500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results indicate that in contrast to the mechanism that has been established for the RecA(Ec) protein, SSB(Sp) protein does not facilitate the formation of a presynaptic complex between the RecA(Sp) protein and the ssDNA substrate. Instead, the stimulatory effect of SSB(Sp) protein in the RecA(Sp) protein-promoted strand exchange reaction may be due entirely to the postsynaptic binding of the displaced single strand that is generated when the ssDNA substrate invades the homologous linear dsDNA. The competing displacement of RecA(Sp) protein from the ssDNA substrate by SSB(Sp) protein, however, will reduce the efficiency of strand invasion and intermediate formation (22Steffen S.E. Katz F.S. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14493-14500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the efficient assembly of RecA(Sp) protein on the linear ssDNA substrate may require additional recombination accessory proteins, perhaps analogous to the E. coli RecO and RecR proteins, which have been shown to facilitate the assembly of the RecA(Ec) protein on SSB(Ec) protein-covered ssDNA (23Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bork J.M. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7313-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A search for these putative recombination accessory proteins as well as studies aimed at more clearly defining the mechanistic nature of the interaction between the RecA(Sp) and MmsA(Sp) proteins at the three-stranded junction are in progress.
