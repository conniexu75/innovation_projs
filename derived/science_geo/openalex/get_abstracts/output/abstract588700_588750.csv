Topological quantum materials in particular have become a focus of intense research in part because of the remarkable possibility to realize Majorana fermions, with their potential for new, decoherence-free quantum computing architectures. In this paper we undertake a study on high-quality single crystal of $\alpha-RuCl_3$ which has been identified as a material realizing a proximate Kitaev state, a topological quantum state with magnetic Majorana fermions. Four-dimensional tomographic reconstruction of dynamical correlations measured using neutrons is uniquely powerful for probing such magnetic states. We discover unusual signals, including an unprecedented column of scattering over a large energy interval around the Brillouin zone center which is remarkably stable with temperature. This is straightforwardly accounted for in terms of the Majorana excitations present in Kitaev's topological quantum spin liquid. Other, more delicate, features in the scattering can be transparently associated with perturbations to an ideal model. This opens a window on emergent magnetic Majorana fermions in correlated materials."

On the basis of this activity, BIA 10-2474 was being developed as a potential treatment for anxiety and pain. In a phase 1 trial of the drug, one subject died, and four others suffered brain damage. As an initial step in investigating whether inhibition of off-target proteins by BIA 10-2474 might contribute to its clinical neurotoxicity, van Esbroeck et al. used activity-based proteomic assays to identify proteins targeted by the drug. Studying human cells and brain samples from subjects not associated with the trial, they found that BIA 10-2474 targeted several different lipases in addition to FAAH. It also substantially altered lipid metabolism in cultured neurons. Science , this issue p. 1084"

Lampel et al. examined a family of melanin-inspired materials based on tripeptides containing tyrosine as precursors for polymeric pigments. They found that the supramolecular organization of the tripeptide assembly is the most important factor for the enzymatic oxidation, with the position of the tyrosine residue playing a dominant role. Thus, simply juggling the order of the peptides allowed tuning of the optical and electrical properties of the resulting polymers. Science , this issue p. 1064"

This involves a process whereby a noncoding RNA known as Xist coats one of the X chromosomes and recruits chromatin silencing factors. The Polycomb complexes PRC1 and PRC2 are also known to be involved in X chromosome inactivation. Almeida et al. elucidate a key role of a specific complex, PCGF3/5-PRC1, in initiating Polycomb recruitment by Xist RNA. They further demonstrate that Polycomb recruitment is critical for Xist-mediated chromosome silencing and female embryogenesis. Science , this issue p. 1081"
https://openalex.org/W2624057787,"Many studies report that, under some circumstances, amending soil with biochar can improve field capacity and plant-available water. However, little is known about the mechanisms that control these improvements, making it challenging to predict when biochar will improve soil water properties. To develop a conceptual model explaining biochar's effects on soil hydrologic processes, we conducted a series of well constrained laboratory experiments using a sand matrix to test the effects of biochar particle size and porosity on soil water retention curves. We showed that biochar particle size affects soil water storage through changing pore space between particles (interpores) and by adding pores that are part of the biochar (intrapores). We used these experimental results to better understand how biochar intrapores and biochar particle shape control the observed changes in water retention when capillary pressure is the main component of soil water potential. We propose that biochar's intrapores increase water content of biochar-sand mixtures when soils are drier. When biochar-sand mixtures are wetter, biochar particles' elongated shape disrupts the packing of grains in the sandy matrix, increasing the volume between grains (interpores) available for water storage. These results imply that biochars with a high intraporosity and irregular shapes will most effectively increase water storage in coarse soils."

Marty et al. measured isotopic ratios of xenon released from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and found that they match the heretofore unknown source. The xenon appears to have been trapped in ice within the comet since before the solar system formed. Comets contributed about a quarter of the xenon on Earth, which constrains the amount of other materials (such as water) delivered to our planet by comets. Science , this issue p. 1069"
https://openalex.org/W2622149047,"While the association of ethnic group with individual cardiovascular diseases has been studied, little is known about ethnic differences in the initial lifetime presentation of clinical cardiovascular disease in contemporary populations.We studied 1,068,318 people, aged ≥30 years and free from diagnosed CVD at baseline (90.9% White, 3.6% South Asian and 2.9% Black), using English linked electronic health records covering primary care, hospital admissions, acute coronary syndrome registry and mortality registry (CALIBER platform). During 5.7 years median follow-up between 1997-2010, 95,224 people experienced an incident cardiovascular diagnosis. 69.9% (67.2%-72.4%) of initial presentation in South Asian <60 yrs were coronary heart disease presentations compared to 47.8% (47.3%-48.3%) in White and 40.1% (36.3%-43.9%) in Black patients. Compared to White patients, Black patients had significantly lower age-sex adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for initial lifetime presentation of all the coronary disease diagnoses (stable angina HR 0.80 (95% CI 0.68-0.93); unstable angina- 0.75 (0.59-0.97); myocardial infarction 0.49 (0.40-0.62)) while South Asian patients had significantly higher HRs (stable angina- 1.67 (1.52-1.84); unstable angina 1.82 (1.56-2.13); myocardial infarction- 1.67 (1.49-1.87). We found no ethnic differences in initial presentation with heart failure (Black 0.97 (0.79-1.20); S Asian 1.04(0.87-1.26)). Compared to White patients, Black patients were more likely to present with ischaemic stroke (1.24 (0.97-1.58)) and intracerebral haemorrhage (1.44 (0.97-2.12)). Presentation with peripheral arterial disease was less likely for Black (0.63 (0.50-0.80)) and South Asian patients (0.70 (0.57-0.86)) compared with White patients.While we found the anticipated substantial predominance of coronary heart disease presentations in South Asian and predominance of stroke presentations in Black patients, we found no ethnic differences in presentation with heart failure.

https://openalex.org/W2623262658,"We present non-invasive means that detect unilateral hand motor brain activity from one individual and subsequently stimulate the somatosensory area of another individual, thus, enabling the remote hemispheric link between each brain hemisphere in humans. Healthy participants were paired as a sender and a receiver. A sender performed a motor imagery task of either right or left hand, and associated changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) mu rhythm (8–10 Hz) originating from either hemisphere were programmed to move a computer cursor to a target that appeared in either left or right of the computer screen. When the cursor reaches its target, the outcome was transmitted to another computer over the internet, and actuated the focused ultrasound (FUS) devices that selectively and non-invasively stimulated either the right or left hand somatosensory area of the receiver. Small FUS transducers effectively allowed for the independent administration of stimulatory ultrasonic waves to somatosensory areas. The stimulation elicited unilateral tactile sensation of the hand from the receiver, thus establishing the hemispheric brain-to-brain interface (BBI). Although there was a degree of variability in task accuracy, six pairs of volunteers performed the BBI task in high accuracy, transferring approximately eight commands per minute. Linkage between the hemispheric brain activities among individuals suggests the possibility for expansion of the information bandwidth in the context of BBI."
https://openalex.org/W2622383747,"Oesophageal tissue engineering is a therapeutic alternative when oesophageal replacement is required. Decellularised scaffolds are ideal as they are derived from tissue-specific extracellular matrix and are non-immunogenic. However, appropriate preservation may significantly affect scaffold behaviour. Here we aim to prove that an effective method for short- and long-term preservation can be applied to tissue engineered products allowing their translation to clinical application. Rabbit oesophagi were decellularised using the detergent-enzymatic treatment (DET), a combination of deionised water, sodium deoxycholate and DNase-I. Samples were stored in phosphate-buffered saline solution at 4°C (4°C) or slow cooled in medium with 10% Me2SO at -1°C/min followed by storage in liquid nitrogen (SCM). Structural and functional analyses were performed prior to and after 2 and 4 weeks and 3 and 6 months of storage under each condition. Efficient decellularisation was achieved after 2 cycles of DET as determined with histology and DNA quantification, with preservation of the ECM. Only the SCM method, commonly used for cell storage, maintained the architecture and biomechanical properties of the scaffold up to 6 months. On the contrary, 4°C method was effective for short-term storage but led to a progressive distortion and degradation of the tissue architecture at the following time points. Efficient storage allows a timely use of decellularised oesophagi, essential for clinical translation. Here we describe that slow cooling with cryoprotectant solution in liquid nitrogen vapour leads to reliable long-term storage of decellularised oesophageal scaffolds for tissue engineering purposes."

Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were evaluated using LIAISON 25-OH (Diasorin, Italy). Medsger disease severity scale (DSS), nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) and all instrumental exam contemplated by international guidelines were performed. Drug assumption, including oral colecalciferol, was evaluated. Non-parametric tests were used for statistical analysis.Average 25(OH)D serum concentration was 18.7 ±9 ng/ml (<20 classified as deficiency). A significant correlation was found with presence/absence of lung bi-basal fibrotic changes (16.1 ±8 ng/ml and 20 ±10 ng/ml, respectively; p = 0.04). Peripheral vascular (p = 0.03), kidney (p = 0.02), gastrointestinal (p = 0.05) Medsger's DSS parameters were found to correlate with 25(OH)D serum concentrations. No significant correlations were observed with digital ulcers incidence, strictly correlated to patterns of microangiopathy, defined at NVC analysis (p<0.0001). Interestingly, no effects of treatment with oral colecalciferol (Dibase 1,000 IU daily for at least 6 months) were found on 25(OH)D serum concentrations in treated (18.8 ±10 ng/ml) or untreated (18.7 ±9 ng/ml) SSc patients (p = 0.81). A significant difference was observed among seasonal 25(OH)D serum concentrations (winter: 14.6 ±7.8 ng/ml, spring: 17.2 ±7.9 ng/ml, summer: 21.43 ±10 ng/ml, autumn: 20.2 ±10 ng/ml; p = 0.032) in all patients.Serum 25(OH)D deficiency was found to correlate with lung involvement, peripheral vascular, kidney and gastrointestinal Medsger's DSS parameters and with seasonality In SSc patients. Supplementation with oral colecalciferol was found not effective in increasing 25(OH)D serum concentrations. Therefore, for successful replacement, supra-physiological vitamin D3 doses or programmed UVB light exposure should be tested."
https://openalex.org/W2621650211,"Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) orient less to socially salient stimuli, such as dynamic social images, than typically developing children. In turn, this lack of social orienting is thought to impair affected individuals’ socio communicative development. Here, we aim to explore the relationship between time spent on dynamic social images and ASD behaviors, such as joint attention and communication, in preschoolers on the autism spectrum. In this study, social orienting is measured using eye-tracking during a task consisting of side-by-side presentations of dynamic social images and dynamic geometric images. The side of the screen where each type of video was presented alternated between items to avoid visual perseveration from influencing the location of participants’ first fixations. Visual exploration patterns recorded during the task from 33 preschoolers with ASD were compared with those of 27 typical developing (TD) children. Additionally, we quantified joint attention behaviors and used standardized parent reports to measure communication. We observed reduced orienting to dynamic social images in preschoolers with ASD compared to TD children. Also, ASD participants went to the dynamic social images less frequently for their first fixations. However, we observed great heterogeneity within the ASD group. ASD preschoolers who spent more time on the dynamic social images also presented more pronounced visual engagement with the dynamic social images (longer mean fixation duration and fewer saccades per second). Moreover, in the ASD group, more time spent on dynamic social images correlated with increased frequency of joint attention behaviors, which in turn correlated with improved communication skills. Our results support reduced social orienting in children with ASD, which correlated with their visual exploration patterns. Further, reduced orienting to the social world in young children with ASD is related to socio communicative deficits and should, therefore, be a focus of intervention programs as early as possible."
https://openalex.org/W2623080230,"Even in healthy individuals, renal function gradually declines during aging. However, an observed variation in the rate of this decline has raised the possibility of slowing or delaying age-related kidney disease. One of the most successful interventional measures that slows down and delays age-related kidney disease is caloric restriction. We undertook the present studies to search for potential factors that are regulated by caloric restriction and act as caloric restriction mimetics. Based on our prior studies with the bile acid–activated nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein–coupled membrane receptor TGR5 that demonstrated beneficial effects of FXR and TGR5 activation in the kidney, we reasoned that FXR and TGR5 could be excellent candidates. We therefore determined the effects of aging and caloric restriction on the expression of FXR and TGR5 in the kidney. We found that FXR and TGR5 expression levels are decreased in the aging kidney and that caloric restriction prevents these age-related decreases. Interestingly, in long-lived Ames dwarf mice, renal FXR and TGR5 expression levels were also increased. A 2-month treatment of 22-month-old C57BL/6J mice with the FXR-TGR5 dual agonist INT-767 induced caloric restriction-like effects and reversed age-related increases in proteinuria, podocyte injury, fibronectin accumulation, TGF-β expression, and, most notably, age-related impairments in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function. Furthermore, in podocytes cultured in serum obtained from old mice, INT-767 prevented the increases in the proinflammatory markers TNF-α, toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and TLR4. In summary, our results indicate that FXR and TGR5 may play an important role in modulation of age-related kidney disease. Even in healthy individuals, renal function gradually declines during aging.

INT-767 has similar lipophilicity and detergency to CDCA but with a much lower pKa (<1), similar to taurine-conjugated CDCA (25Roda A. Pellicciari R. Gioiello A. Neri F. Camborata C. Passeri D. De Franco F. Spinozzi S. Colliva C. Adorini L. Montagnani M. Aldini R. Semisynthetic bile acid FXR and TGR5 agonists: physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism in the rat.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2014; 350: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). INT-767 is 300 times more potent than CDCA in FXR activation and about 5 times more potent than lithocholic acid, the endogenous TGR agonist, in TGR activation (26Rizzo G. Passeri D. De Franco F. Ciaccioli G. Donadio L. Rizzo G. Orlandi S. Sadeghpour B. Wang X.X. Jiang T. Levi M. Pruzanski M. Adorini L. Functional characterization of the semisynthetic bile acid derivative INT-767, a dual farnesoid X receptor and TGR5 agonist.Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). INT-767 shows efficient intestinal absorption, and its biliary excretion is facilitated by 3-glucuronididation (25Roda A. Pellicciari R. Gioiello A. Neri F. Camborata C. Passeri D. De Franco F. Spinozzi S. Colliva C. Adorini L. Montagnani M. Aldini R. Semisynthetic bile acid FXR and TGR5 agonists: physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism in the rat.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2014; 350: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, INT-767 possesses a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for targeting both FXR and TGR5. Consistent with its dual agonist activities, INT-767 induces FXR-dependent lipid uptake by adipocytes, with the beneficial effect of shuttling lipids from central hepatic to peripheral fat storage, and promotes TGR5-dependent glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion by enteroendocrine cells, a validated target in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, INT-767 treatment markedly decreases cholesterol and triglyceride levels in diabetic db/db mice and in mice rendered diabetic by streptozotocin administration (26Rizzo G. Passeri D. De Franco F. Ciaccioli G. Donadio L. Rizzo G. Orlandi S. Sadeghpour B. Wang X.X. Jiang T. Levi M. Pruzanski M. Adorini L.

Our results indicate that FXR and TGR5 expression levels are decreased in the aging kidney and that caloric restriction prevents the age-related decreases in FXR and TGR5 expression. 2-month treatment of 22-month-old aged C57BL/6J mice with the FXR-TGR5 dual agonist INT-767 has caloric restriction-like actions and reverses age-related increases in proteinuria and podocyte injury and, most notably, age-related mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, in podocytes cultured in the presence of serum obtained from old mice, INT-767 prevents the increases in the inflammatory markers TNF-α, TLR2, and TLR4. Our results therefore indicate that FXR and TGR5 may play an important role in modulation of age-related kidney disease. We found that, compared with 5-month-old ad libitum fed mice, 24-month-old ad libitum fed mice had significant decreases in FXR and TGR5 mRNA expression. These decreases were prevented in 24-month-old mice with lifelong caloric restriction (Fig. 1A). The effects of aging and caloric restriction on FXR were also documented at the protein level by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). We could not perform Western blotting for TGR5 because at present there are no specific antibodies available for mouse TGR5. Although a TGR5 antibody did reveal parallel changes in TGR5 protein, based on Western blotting performed with tissues from TGR5 KO mice, we do not believe that the signals are specific for TGR5. We then treated 22-month-old ad libitum fed mice with the dual FXR and TGR5 agonist INT-767 to determine whether a 2-month treatment would be able to reverse the age-related increase in urinary albumin excretion. Our results indicate that treatment of 22-month-old ad libitum fed mice with INT-767 induced a significant decrease in urinary albumin like the beneficial effects achieved with lifelong caloric restriction (Fig. 1C). In addition, INT-767 prevented the age-related decrease in synaptopodin expression as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1D). The beneficial effects of INT-767 were associated with prevention of the age-related increases in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), fibroblast specific protein-1, and fibronectin mRNA (Fig. 1E) and protein (Fig. 1F) as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Because mitochondria have been known to play a crucial role in the process of aging (30Perico N. Remuzzi G. Benigni A. Aging and the kidney.Curr. Opin. Nephrol.

The NAD+/sirtuin pathway modulates longevity through activation of mitochondrial UPR and FOXO signaling.Cell. 2013; 154: 430-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), we examined whether the treatment with INT-767 could modulate mitochondrial biogenesis and function in the aging kidney. We found that the mitochondrial to nuclear DNA ratio, a hallmark of mitochondrial biogenesis, and the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1), were significantly decreased in the kidneys of 24-month-old ad libitum fed mice and reversed by the treatment with INT-767 (Fig. 2A). We also found that the INT-767 treatment concomitantly increased the activated AMPK level and reversed the age-related decreases in SIRT1 mRNA and the nuclear hormone receptor estrogen-related receptor-α (ERR-α) mRNA expression (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, treatment of 22-month-old ad libitum fed mice with INT-767 for 2 months reversed the age-related decrease in PGC-1α mRNA and protein and mitochondrial SIRT3 mRNA and protein (Fig. 2C). The increase in SIRT3 was accompanied by increases in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) protein, an important mediator of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (Fig. 2C). At the same time, INT-767 also reversed the age-related increase in acetylated form of mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase (acetyl-IDH2/IDH2), another target of SIRT3 activity (Fig. 2D). This is ultimately associated with reversal of the decreased mitochondrial complex I and complex IV activity in aged kidneys by 2-month INT-767 treatment, achieving levels identical to lifelong caloric restriction (Fig. 2D). To determine whether INT-767 has direct effects in aging podocytes, we treated human podocytes with serum from young (4-month-old) or old (28-month-old) mice. Aging serum increased the expression of TNF-α, TLR2, and TLR4 (Fig. 3). Treatment with INT-767 prevented these changes (Fig. 3), indicating a direct effect of FXR and TGR5 activation on the cultured podocytes. Because caloric restriction is associated with prevention of age-related pathologies and life and health span extension, we studied the Ames dwarf mice, which exhibit delayed aging and extended longevity, to determine whether FXR and TGR5 expression was regulated like caloric restriction. We found that, like caloric restriction, FXR and TGR5 mRNA levels are increased in the kidneys of Ames dwarf mice (supplemental Fig. S1A). In addition, we found that the genes involved in the mitochondrial biogenesis and function, including NRF1, SIRT1, PGC-1α, ERRα, SIRT3, COX4, and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, were also increased in the kidneys of Ames dwarf mice, consistent with the findings with INT-767 treatment of aging C57BL/6 mice (supplemental Fig. S1B). Our studies have identified the nuclear hormone receptor FXR and the G protein–coupled receptor TGR5 as two important modulators of age-related kidney disease that are regulated by lifelong caloric restriction. FXR and TGR5 expression levels are decreased in the aging kidney, and caloric restriction results in increases in expression of both FXR and TGR5 in the kidney. Remarkably, only a 2-month treatment of 22-month-old mice with the dual FXR-TGR5 agonist INT-767 reverses the age-related increase in urinary albumin excretion and the significant decrease of the podocyte marker synaptopodin. These effects were comparable with those achieved with lifelong caloric restriction, which is known to protect against age-related co-morbidities, including loss of renal function (16Jiang T. Liebman S.E. Lucia M.S. Phillips C.L. Levi M. Calorie restriction modulates renal expression of sterol regulatory element binding proteins, lipid accumulation, and age-related renal disease.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2385-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Jiang T. Liebman S.E. Lucia M.S. Li J. Levi M. Role of altered renal lipid metabolism and the sterol regulatory element binding proteins in the pathogenesis of age-related renal disease.Kidney Int. 2005; 68: 2608-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These improvements in renal function were associated with reversal of the age-related impairments in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. INT-767, like caloric restriction, increased the mitochondrial DNA content and complex I and complex IV activities. These improvements were associated with significant increases in phospho-AMPK, PGC-1α, and Sirtuin 3 protein expression in the kidney. Increased Sirtuin 3 expression was paralleled by increased protein expression of MCAD, an important mediator of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, and decreased acetyl-IDH2, an important mediator of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. INT-767 also increased the expression of Sirtuin 1 mRNA as well as expression of the mitochondrial transcription factor NRF1 and estrogen-related receptor-α. Once again, these effects were identical to those achieved by lifelong caloric restriction. Interestingly, the long-lived Ames mice display changes in the kidney like those induced by FXR-TGR5 activation and caloric restriction, including increases in FXR and TGR5 and the mitochondrially related NRF1, Sirtuin 1, PGC-1α, Sirtuin 3, ERR-α, and Sirtuin 3 target long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an important mediator of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. In addition, in human podocytes cultured in the presence of serum from young versus old mice, INT-767 prevented increases in TNF-α, TLR2, and TLR4 induced by serum from aged mice, indicating a direct beneficial effect of FXR and TGR5 activation on cultured podocytes. In summary, our results indicate that FXR and TGR5 are up-regulated by caloric restriction and may act as caloric restriction mimetics. Indeed, 2-month treatment of aged mice with the FXR-TGR5 dual agonist INT-767 could reverse age-related kidney disease, including age-related impairments in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial function. Our studies therefore indicate that FXR and TGR5 agonists may play an important role in prevention and/or reversal of age-related decline in renal function. 3- and 22-month-old C57BL/6 mice fed ad libitum and 22-month-old C57BL/6 mice with caloric restriction were obtained from an aging colony through the National Institute on Aging. The mice continued to be fed ad libitum with NIH31 diet or calorie-restricted NIH31 diet according to the instructions of the National Institute on Aging. A group of 22-month-old ad libitum fed mice was also fed with diet containing INT-767 (6α-ethyl-3α,7α,23-trihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholan-23-sulfate sodium salt), the dual FXR-TGR5 agonist (30 mg/kg of body weight/day) (26Rizzo G.

https://openalex.org/W2623333834,"Optimum planting geometries have been shown to increase crop yields in maize-soybean intercrop systems. However, little is known about whether changes in planting geometry improve the seasonal water use of maize and soybean intercrops. We conducted two different field experiments in 2013 and 2014 to investigate the effects of changes in planting geometry on water use efficiency (WUE) and evapotranspiration (ETc) of maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] relay strip intercrop systems. Our results showed that the leaf area index of maize for both years where intercropping occurred was notably greater compared to sole maize, thus the soil water content (SWC), soil evaporation (E), and throughfall followed a decreasing trend in the following order: central row of maize strip (CRM) < adjacent row between maize and soybean strip (AR) < central row of soybean strip (CRS). When intercropped, the highest grain yield for maize and total yields were recorded for the 40:120 cm and 40:160 cm planting geometries using 160 cm and 200 cm bandwidth, respectively. By contrast, the highest grain yield of intercropped soybean was appeared for the 20:140 cm and 20:180 cm planting geometries. The largest land equivalent ratios were 1.62 for the 40:120 cm planting geometry and 1.79 for the 40:160 cm planting geometry, indicating that both intercropping strategies were advantageous. Changes in planting geometries did not show any significant effect on the ETc of the maize and soybean intercrops. WUEs in the different planting geometries of intercrop systems were lower compared to sole cropping. However, the highest group WUEs of 23.06 and 26.21 kg ha-1 mm-1 for the 40:120 cm and 40:160 cm planting geometries, respectively, were 39% and 23% higher than those for sole cropping. Moreover, the highest water equivalent ratio values of 1.66 and 1.76 also appeared for the 40:120 cm and 40:160 cm planting geometries. We therefore suggest that an optimum planting geometry of 40:160 cm and bandwidth of 200 cm could be a viable planting pattern management method for attaining high group WUE in maize-soybean intercrop systems."
https://openalex.org/W2623093806,"TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a main constituent of cytoplasmic aggregates in neuronal and glial cells in cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We have previously demonstrated that adenovirus-transduced artificial TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregates formation is enhanced by proteasome inhibition in vitro and in vivo. However, the relationship between cytoplasmic aggregate formation and cell death remains unclear. In the present study, rat neural stem cell lines stably transfected with EGFP- or Sirius-expression vectors under the control of tubulin beta III, glial fibrillary acidic protein, or 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase promoter were differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, respectively, in the presence of retinoic acid. The differentiated cells were then transduced with adenoviruses expressing DsRed-tagged human wild type and C-terminal fragment TDP-43 under the condition of proteasome inhibition. Time-lapse imaging analyses revealed growing cytoplasmic aggregates in the transduced neuronal and glial cells, followed by collapse of the cell. The aggregates remained insoluble in culture media, consisted of sarkosyl-insoluble granular materials, and contained phosphorylated TDP-43. Moreover, the released aggregates were incorporated into neighboring neuronal cells, suggesting cell-to-cell spreading. The present study provides a novel tool for analyzing the detailed molecular mechanisms of TDP-43 proteinopathy in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2624647768,"Acori Tatarinowii Rhizome (ATR; the dried rhizome of Acori tatarinowii Schott) is a well-known herb being used for mental disorder in China and Asia. Volatile oil is considered as the active ingredient of ATR, and asarones account for more than 90% of total volatile oil. Here, the protective effects of ATR oil and asarones, both α-asarone and β-asarone, were probed in cultured rat astrocytes. The cyto-protective effect of ATR oil and asarones against tBHP-induced astrocyte injury was revealed, and additionally ATR oil and asarones reduced the tBHP-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. In parallel, the activity of anti-oxidant response element (ARE) promoter construct (pARE-Luc), being transfected in cultured astrocytes, was markedly induced by application of ATR oil and asarones. The mRNAs encoding anti-oxidant enzymes, e.g. glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutamate-cysteine ligase modulatory subunit (GCLM), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) were induced by ATR oil and asarones in a dose-dependent manner. The ATR oil/asarone-induced gene expression could be mediated by Akt phosphorylation; because the applied LY294002, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, fully abolished the induction. These results demonstrated that α-asarone and β-asarone could account, at least partly, the function of ATR being a Chinese medicinal herb."
https://openalex.org/W2622430554,"The mechanisms explaining the co-existence of asthma, eczema and rhinitis (allergic multimorbidity) are largely unknown. We investigated the mechanisms underlying multimorbidity between three main allergic diseases at a molecular level by identifying the proteins and cellular processes that are common to them.An in silico study based on computational analysis of the topology of the protein interaction network was performed in order to characterize the molecular mechanisms of multimorbidity of asthma, eczema and rhinitis. As a first step, proteins associated to either disease were identified using data mining approaches, and their overlap was calculated. Secondly, a functional interaction network was built, allowing to identify cellular pathways involved in allergic multimorbidity. Finally, a network-based algorithm generated a ranked list of newly predicted multimorbidity-associated proteins.Asthma, eczema and rhinitis shared a larger number of associated proteins than expected by chance, and their associated proteins exhibited a significant degree of interconnectedness in the interaction network. There were 15 pathways involved in the multimorbidity of asthma, eczema and rhinitis, including IL4 signaling and GATA3-related pathways. A number of proteins potentially associated to these multimorbidity processes were also obtained.These results strongly support the existence of an allergic multimorbidity cluster between asthma, eczema and rhinitis, and suggest that type 2 signaling pathways represent a relevant multimorbidity mechanism of allergic diseases. Furthermore, we identified new candidates contributing to multimorbidity that may assist in identifying new targets for multimorbid allergic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2622223954,"Keratinocyte-derived cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the most common metastatic skin cancer. Although some of the early events involved in this pathology have been identified, the subsequent steps leading to tumor development are poorly defined. We demonstrate here that the development of mouse tumors induced by the concomitant application of a carcinogen and a tumor promoter (7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), respectively) is associated with the up-regulation of a previously uncharacterized long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), termed AK144841. We found that AK144841 expression was absent from normal skin and was specifically stimulated in tumors and highly tumorigenic cells. We also found that AK144841 exists in two variants, one consisting of a large 2-kb transcript composed of four exons and one consisting of a 1.8-kb transcript lacking the second exon. Gain- and loss-of-function studies indicated that AK144841 mainly inhibited gene expression, specifically down-regulating the expression of genes of the late cornified envelope-1 (Lce1) family involved in epidermal terminal differentiation and of anticancer genes such as Cgref1, Brsk1, Basp1, Dusp5, Btg2, Anpep, Dhrs9, Stfa2, Tpm1, SerpinB2, Cpa4, Crct1, Cryab, Il24, Csf2, and Rgs16. Interestingly, the lack of the second exon significantly decreased AK144841's inhibitory effect on gene expression. We also noted that high AK144841 expression correlated with a low expression of the aforementioned genes and with the tumorigenic potential of cell lines. These findings suggest that AK144841 could contribute to the dedifferentiation program of tumor-forming keratinocytes and to molecular cascades leading to tumor development.

https://openalex.org/W2622893602,"The objective of this study was to explore the potential of genomic prediction (GP) for soybean resistance against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary, the causal agent of white mold (WM). A diverse panel of 465 soybean plant introduction accessions was phenotyped for WM resistance in replicated field and greenhouse tests. All plant accessions were previously genotyped using the SoySNP50K BeadChip. The predictive ability of six GP models were compared, and the impact of marker density and training population size on the predictive ability was investigated. Cross-prediction among environments was tested to determine the effectiveness of the prediction models. GP models had similar prediction accuracies for all experiments. Predictive ability did not improve significantly by using more than 5k SNPs, or by increasing the training population size (from 50% to 90% of the total of individuals). The GP model effectively predicted WM resistance across field and greenhouse experiments when each was used as either the training or validation population. The GP model was able to identify WM-resistant accessions in the USDA soybean germplasm collection that had previously been reported and were not included in the study panel. This study demonstrated the applicability of GP to identify useful genetic sources of WM resistance for soybean breeding. Further research will confirm the applicability of the proposed approach to other complex disease resistance traits and in other crops."
https://openalex.org/W2623959892,"Live pig trade patterns, drivers and characteristics, particularly in backyard predominant systems, remain largely unexplored despite their important contribution to the spread of infectious diseases in the swine industry. A better understanding of the pig trade dynamics can inform the implementation of risk-based and more cost-effective prevention and control programs for swine diseases. In this study, a semi-structured questionnaire elaborated by FAO and implemented to 487 farmers was used to collect data regarding basic characteristics about pig demographics and live-pig trade among villages in the country of Georgia, where very scarce information is available. Social network analysis and exponential random graph models were used to better understand the structure, contact patterns and main drivers for pig trade in the country. Results indicate relatively infrequent (a total of 599 shipments in one year) and geographically localized (median Euclidean distance between shipments = 6.08 km; IQR = 0–13.88 km) pig movements in the studied regions. The main factors contributing to live-pig trade movements among villages were being from the same region (i.e., local trade), usage of a middleman or a live animal market to trade live pigs by at least one farmer in the village, and having a large number of pig farmers in the village. The identified villages’ characteristics and structural network properties could be used to inform the design of more cost-effective surveillance systems in a country which pig industry was recently devastated by African swine fever epidemics and where backyard production systems are predominant."
https://openalex.org/W2623719044,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive bone malignancy commonly observed in children and adolescents. Sub-optimal therapy for years has irretrievably compromised the chances of OS patient survival; also, lack of extensive research on this rare disease has hindered therapeutic development. Cisplatin, a common anti-tumor drug, is currently an integral part of treatment regime for OS along with methotrexate and doxorubicin. However, toxicity issues associated with combination module impede OS therapy. Also, despite the proven benefits of cisplatin, acquisition of resistance remains a concern with cisplatin-based therapy. This prompted us to investigate the molecular effects of cisplatin exposure and changes associated with acquired resistance in OS cells. Cisplatin shock was found to activate MAPK signaling and autophagy in OS cells. An activation of JNK and autophagy acted as pro-survival strategy, while ERK1/2 triggered apoptotic signals upon cisplatin stress. A crosstalk between JNK and autophagy was observed. Maximal sensitivity to cisplatin was obtained with simultaneous inhibition of both autophagy and JNK pathway. Cisplatin resistant cells were further developed by repetitive drug exposure followed by clonal selection. The resistant cells showed an altered signaling circuitry upon cisplatin exposure. Our results provide valuable cues to possible molecular alterations that can be considered for development of improved therapeutic strategy against osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2624646775,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes encoding the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) and elongase (ELOVL) enzymes affect long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) production. We aimed to determine if these SNPs are associated with body mass index (BMI) or affect fatty acids (FAs) in pregnant women. Participants (n = 180) from the PREOBE cohort were grouped according to pre-pregnancy BMI: normal-weight (BMI = 18.5–24.9, n = 88) and overweight/obese (BMI≥25, n = 92). Plasma samples were analyzed at 24 weeks of gestation to measure FA levels in the phospholipid fraction. Selected SNPs were genotyped (7 in FADS1, 5 in FADS2, 3 in ELOVL2 and 2 in ELOVL5). Minor allele carriers of rs174545, rs174546, rs174548 and rs174553 (FADS1), and rs1535 and rs174583 (FADS2) were nominally associated with an increased risk of having a BMI≥25. Only for the normal-weight group, minor allele carriers of rs174537, rs174545, rs174546, and rs174553 (FADS1) were negatively associated with AA:DGLA index. Normal-weight women who were minor allele carriers of FADS SNPs had lower levels of AA, AA:DGLA and AA:LA indexes, and higher levels of DGLA, compared to major homozygotes. Among minor allele carriers of FADS2 and ELOVL2 SNPs, overweight/obese women showed higher DHA:EPA index than the normal-weight group; however, they did not present higher DHA concentrations than the normal-weight women. In conclusion, minor allele carriers of FADS SNPs have an increased risk of obesity. Maternal weight changes the effect of genotype on FA levels. Only in the normal-weight group, minor allele carriers of FADS SNPs displayed reduced enzymatic activity and FA levels. This suggests that women with a BMI≥25 are less affected by FADS genetic variants in this regard. In the presence of FADS2 and ELOVL2 SNPs, overweight/obese women showed higher n-3 LC-PUFA production indexes than women with normal weight, but this was not enough to obtain a higher n-3 LC-PUFA concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2623348960,"High-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are crucial to improve the resolution and accuracy of genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS). Numerous approaches, including whole genome sequencing, genome sampling sequencing, and SNP chips are able to discover or genotype markers at different densities and costs. Achieving an optimal balance between sequencing resolution and budgets, especially in large-scale population genetics research, constitutes a major challenge. Here, we performed improved double-enzyme digestion genotyping by sequencing (ddGBS) on chicken. We evaluated eight double-enzyme digestion combinations, and EcoR I- Mse I was chosen as the optimal combination for the chicken genome. We firstly proposed that two parameters, optimal read-count point (ORP) and saturated read-count point (SRP), could be utilized to determine the optimal sequencing volume. A total of 291,772 high-density SNPs from 824 animals were identified. By validation using the SNP chip, we found that the consistency between ddGBS data and the SNP chip is over 99%. The approach that we developed in chickens, which is high-quality, high-density, cost-effective (300 K, $30/sample), and time-saving (within 48 h), will have broad applications in animal breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2621978577,"Several members of cucurbitaceae family have been reported to regulate growth of cancer by interfering with STAT3 signaling. In the present study, we investigated the unique role and molecular mechanism of cucurbitacins (Cucs) in reducing symptoms of metabolic syndrome in mice. Cucurbitacin E (CuE) was found to reduce adipogenesis in murine adipocytes. CuE treatment diminished hypertrophy of adipocytes, visceral obesity and lipogenesis gene expression in diet induced mice model of metabolic syndrome (MetS). CuE also ameliorated adipose tissue dysfunction by reducing hyperleptinemia and TNF-alpha levels and enhancing hypoadiponectinemia. Results show that CuE mediated these effects by attenuating Jenus kinase- Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (JAK- STAT5) signaling in visceral fat tissue. As a result, CuE treatment also reduced PPAR gamma expression. Glucose uptake enhanced in adipocytes after stimulation with CuE and insulin resistance diminished in mice treated with CuE, as reflected by reduced glucose intolerance and glucose stimulated insulin secretion. CuE restored insulin sensitivity indirectly by inhibiting JAK phosphorylation and improving AMPK activity. Consequently, insulin signaling was up-regulated in mice muscle. As CuE positively regulated adipose tissue function and suppressed visceral obesity, dyslipedemia, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in mice model of MetS, we suggest that CuE can be used as novel approach to treat metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2623885785,"Background Physical activity and physical performance relate to quality of life, mortality, and morbidity in elderly people. However, little is known about differences in physical performance related to low-intensity light physical activity (LLPA), high-intensity light physical activity (HLPA), and moderate-intensity physical activity (MPA) and how they are separated by sex in elderly populations. Aims This study aimed to determine differences in LLPA, HLPA, MPA, and physical performance, and associations between these measures in community-dwelling elderly men and women. Methods Physical activity and physical performance such as timed-up-and-go test, one-leg standing time, and maximum gait speed were measured in 181 community-dwelling elderly men (mean age, 75.1 ± 5.3 years) and 109 women (mean age, 73.4 ± 4.8 years) in 2013. Physical activity was classified as LLPA (1.6~1.9 METs of physical activity), HLPA (2.0~2.9 METs of physical activity), and MPA (over 3 METs of physical activity). The association between the values of these three intensities of physical activity in the participants was assessed by Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the association of physical performance values with the three groups defined by accelerometer-measured physical activity intensity adjusted for sociographic, behavioral, and multiple diseases in the participants. Results MPA was beneficially associated with all physical performance indicators in the men (all P<0.05) and women (all P<0.05). Only HLPA showed significant associations with the timed-up-and-go test (P = 0.001) and maximum gait speed (P = 0.006) in women. Discussion These results may support the notion that not only HLPA in women but MPA in both sexes appears to improve physical performance in elderly populations. Conclusion The present study findings provide novel epidemiological evidence for the potential benefits of HLPA in women and also reinforce the potential benefits of MPA in both sexes, which is the mainstay of public health recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W2622187301,"Nearly three-quarters of global deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) occur in low- and middle-income countries such as India. However, there are few data available on longitudinal change in risk factors for NCDs in India. We conducted a cohort study among 495 individuals (aged 15 to 64 years at baseline) in rural Kerala state, India, from 2003 to 2010. For the present analysis, data from 410 adults (aged 20 to 64 years at baseline) who participated at both baseline and follow-up studies were analyzed. We used the World Health Organization STEPwise approach to risk factor surveillance for data collection. Age-adjusted change in risk factors for NCDs was assessed using the mixed-effects linear regression for continuous variables and the generalized estimating equation for categorical variables. The mean age of participants at baseline was 41.6 years, and 53.9% were women. The mean follow-up period was 7.1 years. There were significant increases in weight (mean change +5.0 kg, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2 to 5.8), body mass index (mean change +1.8 kg/m2, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.1), waist circumference (mean change +3.9 cm, 95% CI 3.0 to 4.8), waist-to-height ratio (mean change +0.022, 95% CI 0.016 to 0.027), current smokeless tobacco use (men: odds ratio [OR] 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.2), alcohol use (men: OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.9 to 3.5; women: OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8 to 12.6), physical inactivity (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.0), obesity (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.8), and central obesity (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.3). Over a seven-year period, several NCD risk factors have increased in the study cohort. This calls for implementation of lifestyle intervention programs in rural Kerala."
https://openalex.org/W2623661612,"Myeloid-derived lymphatic endothelial cells (M-LECP) are induced by inflammation and play an important role in adult lymphangiogenesis. However, the mechanisms driving M-LECP differentiation are currently unclear. We previously showed that activation of Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) induces myeloid-lymphatic transition (MLT) of immortalized mouse myeloid cells. Here the goals were to assess the potential of different TLR4 ligands to induce pro-lymphatic reprogramming in human and mouse primary myeloid cells and to identify transcriptional changes regulating this process.Human and mouse myeloid cells were reprogrammed to the lymphatic phenotype by TLR4 ligands including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), recombinant high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), and paclitaxel. TLR4 induced similar MLT in cells from mice of different strains and immune status. Commonly induced genes were detected by transcriptional profiling in human and mouse myeloid cells from either immunocompetent or immunodeficient mice. Shared trends included: (1) novel expression of lymphatic-specific markers vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE-1) and podoplanin (PDPN) largely absent prior to induction; (2) lack of notable changes in blood vessel-specific markers; (3) transient expression of VEGFR-3, but sustained increase of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and a variety of inflammatory cytokines; (4) dependency of VEGFR-3 upregulation and other LEC genes on NF-κB; and (5) novel expression of lymphatic-specific (e.g., PROX1) and stem/progenitor (e.g., E2F1) transcription factors known for their roles in adult and embryonic vascular formation. M-LECP generated by TLR4 ligands in vitro were functional in vivo as demonstrated by significantly increased lymphatic vessel density and lymphatic metastasis detected in orthotopic breast cancer models.We established a novel TLR4-dependent protocol for in vitro production of functionally competent M-LECP from primary human or mouse myeloid cells and identified many potential regulators of this process. This information can be further exploited for research and therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2622841529,"Cyanobacteria blooms are a risk to environmental health and public safety due to the potent toxins certain cyanobacteria can produce. These nuisance organisms can be removed from water bodies by biomass flocculation and sedimentation. Here, we studied the efficacy of combinations of a low dose coagulant (poly-aluminium chloride-PAC-or chitosan) with different ballast compounds (red soil, bauxite, gravel, aluminium modified zeolite and lanthanum modified bentonite) to remove cyanobacterial biomass from water collected in Funil Reservoir (Brazil). We tested the effect of different cyanobacterial biomass concentrations on removal efficiency. We also examined if zeta potential was altered by treatments. Addition of low doses of PAC and chitosan (1-8 mg Al L-1) to the cyanobacterial suspensions caused flock formation, but did not settle the cyanobacteria. When those low dose coagulants were combined with ballast, effective settling in a dose-dependent way up to 99.7% removal of the flocks could be achieved without any effect on the zeta potential and thus without potential membrane damage. Removal efficacy was influenced by the cyanobacterial biomass and at higher biomass more ballast was needed to achieve good removal. The combined coagulant-ballast technique provides a promising alternative to algaecides in lakes, ponds and reservoirs."
https://openalex.org/W2624059108,"Obesity induces various metabolic diseases such as dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and type 2 diabetes. Fat expansion in adipose tissue induces adipose tissue dysfunction and inflammation, insulin resistance, and other metabolic syndromes. α-Mangostin (α-MG) has been previously studied for its anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. In this study, we investigated the effects of α-MG on adipose tissue inflammation and hepatic steatosis. We categorized study animals into four groups: regular diet control mice, RD mice treated with α-MG, high fat diet-induced obese mice, and HFD mice treated with α-MG. α-MG treatment significantly reduced not only the body, liver, and fat weights, but also plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels in HFD mice. Additionally, adiponectin levels of α-MG-treated mice were significantly higher than those of control HFD mice. Immunohistochemistry of liver and adipose tissue showed that CD11c expression was reduced in α-MG fed obese mice. α-MG treatment of HFD mice down-regulated the adipose-associated inflammatory cytokines and CCR2 in both liver and adipose tissue. Moreover, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were significantly improved in α-MG fed obese mice. α-Mangostin ameliorates adipose inflammation and hepatic steatosis in HFD-induced obese mice."

We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among transfusion-dependent patients in Taiwan.A total of 140 patients (67 thalassemic patients, 70 hemophilic patients, two patients with hereditary spherocytosis and one patient with von Willebrand disease) were prospectively enrolled to evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with viral hepatitis and spontaneous HCV clearance. All patients were tested for HBV and HCV serology and virology. Two consecutive serum samples, at least 1 year apart, were collected to clarify HCV seroclearance.The seropositivity rate of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV antibody (anti-HCV), and both HBsAg/anti-HCV were 6.4%, 45.7% and 5%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis of factors associated with anti-HCV seropositivity included age (odds ratio/95% confidence interval [OR/CI]: 1.12/1.07-1.18, P<0.001), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (OR/CI: 1.04/1.02-1.06, P<0.001) and platelet counts (OR/CI: 0.995/0.991-0.998, P = 0.002). Age was the only factor independently associated with HBsAg seropositivity (OR/CI: 1.08/1.02-1.14.4, P = 0.007). Compared to patients born before 1992, the seroprevalence of HCV among thalassemic patients decreased dramatically in those born after 1992 (46.0% vs. 11.8%, p = 0.012). The seroprevalence of HCV among hemophilic patients also decreased significantly when comparing patients born before 1987 to those born after 1987 (79.5% vs. 11.5%, p<0.001). Similarly, the seroprevalence of HBV decreased significantly in the post-vaccination cohort compared to its counterpart (13.1%, vs. 1.3%, p = 0.005). The spontaneous clearance of HCV was observed in 25.4% (15/59) of patients, and ALT was the only factor associated with it (OR/CI 0.98/0.96-1.00, P = 0.02).Both HBV and HCV infections are prevalent among transfusion-dependent thalassemic and hemophilic patients in Taiwan. Nevertheless, seroprevalence decreased significantly and dramatically for HCV after universal blood screening and for HBV after implementation of a universal mass vaccination program."
https://openalex.org/W2623244405,"Molecular characterization of plant cell wall glycosyltransferases is a critical step towards understanding the biosynthesis of the complex plant cell wall, and ultimately for efficient engineering of biofuel and agricultural crops. The majority of these enzymes have proven very difficult to obtain in the needed amount and purity for such molecular studies, and recombinant cell wall glycosyltransferase production efforts have largely failed. A daunting number of strategies can be employed to overcome this challenge, including optimization of DNA and protein sequences, choice of expression organism, expression conditions, co-expression partners, purification methods, and optimization of protein solubility and stability. Hence researchers are presented with thousands of potential conditions to test. Ultimately, the subset of conditions that will be sampled depends on practical considerations and prior knowledge of the enzyme(s) being studied. We have developed a rational approach to this process. We devise a pipeline comprising in silico selection of targets and construct design, and high-throughput expression screening, target enrichment, and hit identification. We have applied this pipeline to a test set of Arabidopsis thaliana cell wall glycosyltransferases known to be challenging to obtain in soluble form, as well as to a library of cell wall glycosyltransferases from other plants including agricultural and biofuel crops. The screening results suggest that recombinant cell wall glycosyltransferases in general have a very low soluble:insoluble ratio in lysates from heterologous expression cultures, and that co-expression of chaperones as well as lysis buffer optimization can increase this ratio. We have applied the identified preferred conditions to Reversibly Glycosylated Polypeptide 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, and processed this enzyme to near-purity in unprecedented milligram amounts. The obtained preparation of Reversibly Glycosylated Polypeptide 1 has the expected arabinopyranose mutase and autoglycosylation activities."
https://openalex.org/W2623440614,"This study’s aims to verify the energy expenditure, metabolic distress and usefulness to evaluate the anaerobic constructs for different all-out durations in running efforts. Twelve active male underwent four testing sessions, one for familiarization and three performing one all-out (AO) tethered running sprint lasting 30s, 20s or 10s. Oxygen consumption, excess post exercise oxygen consumption, and lactate production were retained to analyse metabolic function, together with mechanical power and work as performance parameters. Paired results were compared via one-way ANOVA for repeated measures (Tukey-HSD post-hoc), effect sizes and ICC for absolute agreement. Statistical significance was accepted at p ≤ 0.05. Despite total and energy expenditure from oxidative pathway being significantly higher for longer durations (p < 0.001; ES > 0.7), glycolytic energy expenditure presented an agreement between AO30s and AO20s (ICC-A = 0.63*), while the paired comparisons to AO10s have presented significant differences (p < 0.01; ES > 1.0). Phosphagen energy expenditure were similar between all-out durations (p = 0.12; ICC-A = 0.62*; ES < 0.5). Maximum mechanical power was higher in AO10s than in AO30s (p = 0.03; ES = 0.6), not being different between AO10s and AO20s (p = 0.67; ICC-A = 0.88*; ES = 0.2) and between AO20s and AO30s (p = 0.18; ICC-A = 0.56*; ES = 0.4). In addition, agreement between work in the first ten seconds was confirmed via ICC only between AO10s and AO20s (p = 0.50; ICC-A = 0.86*; ES = 0.3), but not for the other paired comparisons (p < 0.1; ICC < 0.45; ES > 0.5). AO20s is a better alternative to estimate anaerobic power and capacity in one single test, with similar oxidative demand than AO30s."

To study the gene expression across these diverse morphological forms, suitable reference genes are required. In the present study, 13 genes viz. ACT, 18S rRNA, eEF1α, eEF-Tu,eIF-1A, Tub-α, Tub-b, Ubc, GAPDH, Try, WS-21, NADGDH and NADPGDH were evaluated for their potential as a reference, particularly for studying gene expression during the Y-H reversible transition and also for other asexual and sexual life stages of B. poitrasii. Analysis of RT-qPCR data using geNorm, normFinder and BestKeeper software revealed that genes such as Ubc, 18S rRNA and WS-21 were expressed at constant levels in each given subset of RNA samples from all the morphological phases of B. poitrasii. Therefore, these reference genes can be used to elucidate the role of morpho-genes in B. poitrasii. Further, use of the two most stably expressed genes (Ubc and WS-21) to normalize the expression of the ornithine decarboxylase gene (Bpodc) in different morphological forms of B. poitrasii, generated more reliable results, indicating that our selection of reference genes was appropriate."
https://openalex.org/W2622123352,"Amblyopia is a developmental visual impairment that is increasingly recognized to affect higher-level perceptual and multisensory processes. To further investigate the audiovisual (AV) perceptual impairments associated with this condition, we characterized the temporal interval in which asynchronous auditory and visual stimuli are perceived as simultaneous 50% of the time (i.e., the AV simultaneity window). Adults with unilateral amblyopia (n = 17) and visually normal controls (n = 17) judged the simultaneity of a flash and a click presented with both eyes viewing. The signal onset asynchrony (SOA) varied from 0 ms to 450 ms for auditory-lead and visual-lead conditions. A subset of participants with amblyopia (n = 6) was tested monocularly. Compared to the control group, the auditory-lead side of the AV simultaneity window was widened by 48 ms (36%; p = 0.002), whereas that of the visual-lead side was widened by 86 ms (37%; p = 0.02). The overall mean window width was 500 ms, compared to 366 ms among controls (37% wider; p = 0.002). Among participants with amblyopia, the simultaneity window parameters were unchanged by viewing condition, but subgroup analysis revealed differential effects on the parameters by amblyopia severity, etiology, and foveal suppression status. Possible mechanisms to explain these findings include visual temporal uncertainty, interocular perceptual latency asymmetry, and disruption of normal developmental tuning of sensitivity to audiovisual asynchrony."

The mitogenome (15,247 bp) of D.nerii encodes13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) and an adenine (A) + thymine (T)-rich region. Its gene complement and order is similar to that of other sequenced lepidopterans. The 12 PCGs initiated by ATN codons except for cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene that is seemingly initiated by the CGA codon as documented in other insect mitogenomes. Four of the 13 PCGs have the incomplete termination codon T, while the remainder terminated with the canonical stop codon. This mitogenome has six major intergenic spacers, with the exception of A+T-rich region, spanning at least 10 bp. The A+T-rich region is 351 bp long, and contains some conserved regions, including 'ATAGA' motif followed by a 17 bp poly-T stretch, a microsatellite-like element (AT)9 and also a poly-A element. Phylogenetic analyses based on 13 PCGs using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) revealed that D. nerii resides in the Sphingidae family."

Although some children with NTS infection develop bacteremia, its clinical manifestations have not been discussed adequately. Therefore, we examined children with NTS bacteremia. We retrospectively examined the medical records of 15 patients aged less than 15 years. Salmonella spp. were detected in the blood cultures of these patients between 1991 and 2014. We divided an additional sample group of 34 patients diagnosed with an NTS infection between 2005 and 2014, into 2 groups. Group bacteremia (B) included patients in whose blood cultures Salmonella spp. were detected, and group non-bacteremia (NB) included patients in whom Salmonella infection was not detected. We compared each group using Wilcoxon test and Fisher’s exact test. The number of patients with fever, diarrhea, or abdominal pain was 15 (100%), 13 (87%), and 9 (60%), respectively, in the first sample of patients. However, vomiting and bloody stool were observed in only 5 patients (33%). More than 70% of patients exhibited a reduced white blood cell count, while C-reactive protein levels were variable in the patients. Salmonella spp. were detected via stool culture in 10 patients (67%). Diarrhea persisted for more than 4 days more frequently in group B than group NB (p = 0.004). The number of patients whose fever persisted for more than 4 days was significantly higher in group B than group NB (p = 0.030). Therefore, if NTS bacteremia is suspected, blood cultures should be collected and antibiotics should be initiated in cases with diarrhea or fever for more than 4 days. Furthermore, a negative stool culture result does not preclude the possibility of NTS bacteremia."
https://openalex.org/W2622905183,"Objectives Synthetic mesh surgery for both abdominal and urogenital hernia repair is often unsatisfactory in the long-term due to postoperative complications. We hypothesized that a semi-degradable mesh hybrid may provide more appropriate biocompatibility with comparable mechanical properties. The aim was to compare its in vivo biocompatibility with a commercial polypropylene (PP) mesh. Methods 72 rats were randomly allocated to either our new composite mesh (monofilament PP mesh knitted with polylactic-acid-fibers (PLA)) or to a commercially available PP mesh that was used as a control. 15, 90, and 180 days after implantation into the rat abdomen mesh tissue complexes were analysed for erosion, contraction, foreign body reaction, tissue integration and biomechanical properties. Results No differences were seen in regard to clinical parameters including erosion, contraction or infection rates between the two groups. Biomechanical properties including breaking load, stiffness and deformation did not show any significant differences between the different materials at any timepoint. Macrophage staining did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups or between timepoints either. In regard to collagen I there was significantly less collagen I in the PP group compared to the PP/ PLA group at day 180. Collagen III did not show any significant differences at any timepoint between the two groups. Conclusion A PP/PLA hybrid mesh, leaving a low amount of PP after PLA degradation seems to have comparable biomechanical properties like PP at 180 days due to enhanced collagen production without significant differences in erosion, contraction, herniation or infection rates."

Methods 1) Development of the evaluation tool. Literature was searched, experts in the field of myofascial therapy were consulted and pilot testing was performed. 2) Thirty patients (63% had a mastectomy, 37% breast-conserving surgery and 97% radiotherapy) with myofascial adhesions were evaluated using the developed tool by 2 independent raters. The Weighted Kappa (WK) and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. Results 1) The evaluation tool for Myofascial Adhesions in Patients with Breast Cancer (MAP-BC evaluation tool) consisted of the assessment of myofascial adhesions at 7 locations: axillary and breast region scars, musculi pectorales region, axilla, frontal chest wall, lateral chest wall and the inframammary fold. At each location the degree of the myofascial adhesion was scored at three levels (skin, superficial and deep) on a 4-points scale (between no adhesions and very stiff adhesions). Additionally, a total score (0–9) was calculated, i.e. the sum of the different levels of each location. 2) Interrater agreement of the different levels separately was moderate for the axillary and mastectomy scar (WK 0.62–0.73) and good for the scar on the breast (WK >0.75). Moderate agreement was reached for almost all levels of the non-scar locations. Interrater reliability of the total scores was the highest for the scars (ICC 0.82–0.99). At non-scar locations good interrater reliability was reached, except for the inframammary fold (ICC = 0.71). Conclusions The total scores of all locations of the MAP-BC evaluation tool had good to excellent interrater reliability, except for the inframammary fold which only reached moderate reliability."

Two force sensing resistors were firmly affixed at the heel and second toe of both insoles to collect the time signal of foot contact. A total of 109 healthy young adults (42 males and 67 females) were recruited in this study. They ran on an instrumented treadmill at 0°, +10°, and -10° inclinations and attempted rearfoot, midfoot, and forefoot landings using real time visual biofeedback. Intra-step strike index and onset time difference between two force sensors were measured and analyzed with univariate linear regression. We analyzed 25,655 footfalls and found that onset time difference between two sensors explained 80–84% of variation in the prediction model of strike index (R-squared = 0.799–0.836, p<0.001). However, the time windows to detect footstrike patterns on different surface inclinations were not consistent. These findings may allow laboratory-based gait retraining to be implemented in natural running environments to aid in both injury prevention and performance enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W2623510814,"ShK toxin from the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus is a 35-residue protein that binds to the Kv1.3 ion channel with high affinity. Recently we determined the X-ray structure of ShK toxin by racemic crystallography, in the course of which we discovered that d-ShK has a near-background IC50 value ∼50,000 times lower than that of the l-ShK toxin. This lack of activity was at odds with previously reported results for an ShK diastereomer designated d-allo-ShK, for which significant biological activity had been observed in a similar receptor-blocking assay. As reported, d-allo-ShK was made up of d-amino acids, but with retention of the natural stereochemistry of the chiral side chains of the Ile and Thr residues, i.e. containing d-allo-Ile and d-allo-Thr along with d-amino acids and glycine. To understand its apparent biological activity, we set out to chemically synthesize d-allo-ShK and determine its X-ray structure by racemic crystallography. Using validated allo-Thr and allo-Ile, both l-allo-ShK and d-allo-ShK polypeptide chains were prepared by total chemical synthesis. Neither the l-allo-ShK nor the d-allo-ShK polypeptides folded, whereas both l-ShK and d-ShK folded smoothly under the same conditions. Re-examination of NMR spectra of the previously reported d-allo-ShK protein revealed that diagnostic Thr and Ile signals were the same as for authentic d-ShK. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the previously reported d-allo-ShK was in fact d-ShK, the true enantiomer of natural l-ShK toxin, and that the apparent biological activity may have arisen from inadvertent contamination with trace amounts of l-ShK toxin.

https://openalex.org/W2624486801,"Objectives Severe mental illness (SMI) is associated with premature cardiovascular disease, prompting the UK primary care payment-for-performance system (Quality and Outcomes Framework, QOF) to incentivise annual physical health reviews. This study aimed to assess the QOF’s impact on detection and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in people with SMI. Methods A retrospective open cohort study of UK general practice was conducted between 1996 and 2014, using segmented logistic regression with 2004 and 2011 as break points, reflecting the introduction of relevant QOF incentives in these years. 67239 SMI cases and 359951 randomly-selected unmatched controls were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Results There was strong evidence (p≤0.015) the 2004 QOF indicator (general health) resulted in an immediate increase in recording of elevated cholesterol (odds ratio 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.51)); obesity (OR 1.21 (1.06 to 1.38)); and hypertension (OR 1.19 (1.04 to 1.38)) in the SMI group compared with the control group, which was sustained in subsequent years. Similar findings were found for diabetes, although the evidence was weaker (p = 0.059; OR 1.21 (0.99 to 1.49)). There was evidence (p<0.001) of a further, but unsustained, increase in recording of elevated cholesterol and obesity in the SMI group following the 2011 QOF indicator (cardiovascular specific). There was no clear evidence that the QOF indicators affected the prescribing of lipid modifying medications or anti-diabetic medications. Conclusion Incentivising general physical health review for SMI improves identification of cardiovascular risk factors, although the additional value of specifically incentivising cardiovascular risk factor assessment is unclear. However, incentives do not affect pharmacological management of these risks."
https://openalex.org/W2623488989,"To assess the diagnostic weight of sequence-specific magnetic resonance features in characterizing clinically significant prostate cancers (csPCa).We used a prospective database of 262 patients who underwent T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging before prostatectomy. For each lesion, two independent readers (R1, R2) prospectively defined nine features: shape, volume (V_Max), signal abnormality on each pulse sequence, number of pulse sequences with a marked (S_Max) and non-visible (S_Min) abnormality, likelihood of extracapsular extension (ECE) and PSA density (dPSA). Overall likelihood of malignancy was assessed using a 5-level Likert score. Features were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). csPCa was defined as Gleason ≥7 cancer (csPCa-A), Gleason ≥7(4+3) cancer (csPCa-B) or Gleason ≥7 cancer with histological extraprostatic extension (csPCa-C).For csPCa-A, the Signal1 model (S_Max+S_Min) provided the best combination of signal-related variables, for both readers. The performance was improved by adding V_Max, ECE and/or dPSA, but not shape. All models performed better with DCE findings than without. When moving from csPCa-A to csPCa-B and csPCa-C definitions, the added value of V_Max, dPSA and ECE increased as compared to signal-related variables, and the added value of DCE decreased. For R1, the best models were Signal1+ECE+dPSA (AUC = 0,805 [95%CI:0,757-0,866]), Signal1+V_Max+dPSA (AUC = 0.823 [95%CI:0.760-0.893]) and Signal1+ECE+dPSA [AUC = 0.840 (95%CI:0.774-0.907)] for csPCa-A, csPCA-B and csPCA-C respectively. The AUCs of the corresponding Likert scores were 0.844 [95%CI:0.806-0.877, p = 0.11], 0.841 [95%CI:0.799-0.876, p = 0.52]) and 0.849 [95%CI:0.811-0.884, p = 0.49], respectively. For R2, the best models were Signal1+V_Max+dPSA (AUC = 0,790 [95%CI:0,731-0,857]), Signal1+V_Max (AUC = 0.813 [95%CI:0.746-0.882]) and Signal1+ECE+V_Max (AUC = 0.843 [95%CI: 0.781-0.907]) for csPCa-A, csPCA-B and csPCA-C respectively. The AUCs of the corresponding Likert scores were 0. 829 [95%CI:0.791-0.868, p = 0.13], 0.790 [95%CI:0.742-0.841, p = 0.12]) and 0.808 [95%CI:0.764-0.845, p = 0.006]), respectively.Combination of simple variables can match the Likert score's results. The optimal combination depends on the definition of csPCa."

Density functional theory has extended the reach of computational chemistry to a large range of compounds that were previously intractable to simulation. However, a recent study on a test set of neutral and charged atoms suggested that new functionals have lately been targeting more accurate energy calculations at the expense of the electron densities. Brorsen et al. extended this comparison to a set of 14 diatomic molecules of clearer relevance to ambient reaction chemistry. They found once again that improved energy calculations did not always correlate with density improvements, although the weakest-performing class of functionals in the atomic study fared considerably better with molecules.

https://openalex.org/W2623509686,"Background Prediction of End-Systole time is of utmost importance for cardiac MRI to correctly associate acquired k-space lines during reconstruction of cine acquisitions. This prediction is usually based on the patient’s heart rate using Weissler’s formula, which was calibrated by linear regression within a population and cannot account for individual variability. Objective We propose an automatic method to build a personalized model that better predicts end-systole. Methods A phase contrast sequence was modified to acquire only central k-space line with 6.6ms temporal resolution, in a slice passing through the aorta during 128 heartbeats in 35 subjects. Segmentation of aorta and detection of end of systolic ejection was automatic. Duration of electromechanical systole duration as function of heart rate was determined for each subject separately. Results In comparison with the global models, the adapted cardiac model predicted significantly better both echocardiographic end-systolic reference (bias = 0ms vs 17ms, p<0.001) and MRI measurements (bias = 6.8ms vs 17ms). Favorable impact was shown on the cine reconstruction of the 5 subjects with the higher cardiac variability (p = 0.02). Conclusions Personalization of cardiac model to the subject is feasible in MRI and reduces the error of prediction of systole."

Survival rates of patients with HIV have improved enormously as a result of antiretroviral therapy, but increased life expectancy is now associated with a high risk of comorbidities. HIV–1-associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often manifests as emphysema, originating around the airways and extending into lung tissue. Chung et al. have discovered that this is caused by HIV binding to basal cells in the airway and activating a tissue-destructive phenotype through a mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade. HIV binding triggers up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9, which is known to be elevated in COPD patients and may contribute to the degradation of extracellular matrix seen in emphysema sufferers.

Expert-like thinking is a difficult skill to measure. SLEED-Q, an instrument developed by Elvira et al. , aims to evaluate expert-like thinking by measuring the extent to which educators create a “supportive learning environment for expertise development.” To develop SLEED-Q, the authors conducted a literature review of instructional practices that promote the development of professional expertise. Sixty-five relevant practices were identified, further clustered into 10 main principles, and finally reflected in 10 scales. Ultimately, SLEED-Q was shown to assess seven factors, including epistemological understanding, teaching for understanding, and supporting learning for understanding. SLEED-Q provides a quantitative approach for examining learning environments and begins a dialogue about how to create an environment that is conducive to developing professional expertise.

Some cancer drugs are rationally designed on the basis of their known interaction with specific target molecules that drive tumorigenesis. Others are mechanistically poorly understood but are developed because they display anticancer activity with low toxicity in preclinical models. Uehara et al. have identified the mechanism underlying the anticancer activity of a class of drugs in the latter category—the sulfonamides. They find that three different sulfonamides (E7820, indisulam, and CQS) induce formation of a complex between a specific RNA-splicing factor and a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase. This interaction promotes selective degradation of the splicing factor. Interestingly, selective protein degradation also explains the activity of an unrelated cancer drug called lenalidomide.

Mass extinction may be reaching parts that we do not normally consider. Like most living organisms, lizards are dependent on a variety of cohabiting microorganisms for optimum health. Bestion et al. looked at the cloacal microbiota of Zootoca vivipara lizards living in semi-natural enclosures under various temperature regimes. Life at warmer temperatures affected the lizards' most diverse gut bacterial phyla, which declined by over 30%. In particular, the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes dropped, and those of Proteobacteria increased, at 3°C above present conditions. Species richness positively correlated with lizard survival the following year. What mediates the changes in bacterial diversity is not understood, but climate may be acting via food supplies, host behavior, or body condition. The data also revealed gender differences in functional features of the resulting microbiota.

Travel on stepped, bumpy, or rocky terrain can require oversized wheels and independent power delivery to each wheel, which can necessitate a larger vehicle. Lee et al. turned to ideas from origami to design a variable-diameter wheel. By using a folded, patterned sheet, they avoided the need for complex assembly or a large number of parts. The wheels are a combination of a stiff polymer film glued to a flexible mesh, so that the difference in stiffness controls the shape change. The wheel can double in diameter, with a corresponding reduction in thickness that allows a two-wheeled robot to climb steps, pass under a low ledge, and go through narrow gaps.
