https://openalex.org/W3209371735,"RNA, DNA, and protein molecules are highly organized within three-dimensional (3D) structures in the nucleus. Although RNA has been proposed to play a role in nuclear organization, exploring this has been challenging because existing methods cannot measure higher-order RNA and DNA contacts within 3D structures. To address this, we developed RNA & DNA SPRITE (RD-SPRITE) to comprehensively map the spatial organization of RNA and DNA. These maps reveal higher-order RNA-chromatin structures associated with three major classes of nuclear function: RNA processing, heterochromatin assembly, and gene regulation. These data demonstrate that hundreds of ncRNAs form high-concentration territories throughout the nucleus, that specific RNAs are required to recruit various regulators into these territories, and that these RNAs can shape long-range DNA contacts, heterochromatin assembly, and gene expression. These results demonstrate a mechanism where RNAs form high-concentration territories, bind to diffusible regulators, and guide them into compartments to regulate essential nuclear functions."
https://openalex.org/W3209709362,"The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of many people, including medical students. The present study explored internet addiction and changes in sleep patterns among medical students during the pandemic and assessed the relationship between them.A cross-sectional study was carried out in seven countries, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Guyana, India, Mexico, Pakistan, and Sudan, using a convenience sampling technique, an online survey comprising demographic details, information regarding COVID-19, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Internet Addiction Test (IAT).In total, 2749 participants completed the questionnaire. Of the total, 67.6% scored above 30 in the IAT, suggesting the presence of an Internet addiction, and 73.5% scored equal and above 5 in the PSQI, suggesting poor sleep quality. Internet addiction was found to be significant predictors of poor sleep quality, causing 13.2% of the variance in poor sleep quality. Participants who reported COVID-19 related symptoms had disturbed sleep and higher internet addiction levels when compared with those who did not. Participants who reported a diagnosis of COVID-19 reported poor sleep quality. Those living with a COVID-19 diagnosed patient reported higher internet addiction and worse sleep quality compared with those who did not have any COVID-19 patients in their surroundings.The results of this study suggest that internet addiction and poor sleep quality are two issues that require addressing amongst medical students. Medical training institutions should do their best to minimize their negative impact, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3209462345,"Behavioral plasticity is key to animal survival. Harpegnathos saltator ants can switch between worker and queen-like status (gamergate) depending on the outcome of social conflicts, providing an opportunity to study how distinct behavioral states are achieved in adult brains. Using social and molecular manipulations in live ants and ant neuronal cultures, we show that ecdysone and juvenile hormone drive molecular and functional differences in the brains of workers and gamergates and direct the transcriptional repressor Kr-h1 to different target genes. Depletion of Kr-h1 in the brain caused de-repression of ""socially inappropriate"" genes: gamergate genes were upregulated in workers, whereas worker genes were upregulated in gamergates. At the phenotypic level, loss of Kr-h1 resulted in the emergence of worker-specific behaviors in gamergates and gamergate-specific traits in workers. We conclude that Kr-h1 is a transcription factor that maintains distinct brain states established in response to socially regulated hormones."
https://openalex.org/W3209831855,"The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of primates plays an important role in executive control, but how it interacts with the rest of the cortex remains unclear. To address this, we densely mapped the cortical connectome of LPFC, using electrical microstimulation combined with functional MRI (EM-fMRI). We found isomorphic mappings between LPFC and five major processing domains composing most of the cerebral cortex except early sensory and motor areas. An LPFC grid of ∼200 stimulation sites topographically mapped to separate grids of activation sites in the five domains, coarsely resembling how the visual cortex maps the retina. The temporal and parietal maps largely overlapped in LPFC, suggesting topographically organized convergence of the ventral and dorsal streams, and the other maps overlapped at least partially. Thus, the LPFC contains overlapping, millimeter-scale maps that mirror the organization of major cortical processing domains, supporting LPFC's role in coordinating activity within and across these domains."
https://openalex.org/W3209741986,"We analyze whether and to what extent strategies employed by governments to fight the COVID-19 pandemic made a difference for GDP growth developments in 2020. Based on the strength and speed with which governments imposed non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) when confronted with waves of infections we distinguish between countries pursuing an elimination strategy and countries following a suppression / mitigation strategy. For a sample of 44 countries fixed effect panel regression results show that NPI changes conducted by elimination strategy countries had a less severe effect on GDP growth than NPI changes in suppression / mitigation strategy countries: strategy matters. However, this result is sensitive to the countries identified as “elimination countries” and to the sample composition. Moreover, we find that exogenous country characteristics drive the choice of strategy. At the same time our results show that countries successfully applying the elimination strategy achieved better health outcomes than their peers without having to accept lower growth."

https://openalex.org/W3210575963,"The nursing education system has evolved with an increased emphasis on student-centred education, such as implementing flipped classroom pedagogy. Given the promising positive educational outcomes, the trend of using flipped classroom pedagogy has become increasingly popular in undergraduate nursing education. However, little is known about how these flipped classroom methods impact on nursing educational practices in limited-resource settings situated in South Asia.To assess the feasibility of implementing flipped classroom pedagogy in undergraduate nursing education from the nursing students' perspective.This mixed-methods study employed a quantitative survey and six focus group discussions conducted in three state universities in Sri Lanka. The Nursing Students' Readiness for Flipped Classroom (NSR-FC) questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data. The semi-structured focus group discussions were conducted by using 18 reflective and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis of variance methods were employed when analysing quantitative data. An inductive thematic analysis approach was used to summarize the focus group discussions.The questionnaire survey revealed that nursing students reported high levels of personal, technical, and pedagogical readiness across all three universities, while environmental readiness was perceived as low. The inductive thematic analysis identified three themes, namely: enablers, challenges, and benefits. Specifically, nursing students valued the student-centred approach. They were ready to utilize their own devices to overcome limited technological provision; however, a short training session about how to engage in the flipped classroom was desirable. Also, their exposure to basic educational technology was perceived as adequate and they were aware of the positive outcomes of flipped classroom pedagogy.Nursing students were ready to enrol in a flipped classroom programme. The provision of technological resources in the education environment was identified as a great challenge for flipped classroom implementation. Overall, the findings indicate there are promising feasibilities for the flipped classroom implementation."
https://openalex.org/W3211189874,"Protecting healthcare professionals is crucial in maintaining a functioning healthcare system. The risk of infection and optimal preventive strategies for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic remain poorly understood. Here we report the results of a cohort study that included pre- and asymptomatic healthcare workers. A weekly testing regime has been performed in this cohort since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify infected healthcare workers. Based on these observations we have developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission that integrates the sources of infection from inside and outside the hospital. The data were used to study how regular testing and a desynchronisation protocol are effective in preventing transmission of COVID-19 infection at work, and compared both strategies in terms of workforce availability and cost-effectiveness. We showed that case incidence among healthcare workers is higher than would be explained solely by community infection. Furthermore, while testing and desynchronisation protocols are both effective in preventing nosocomial transmission, regular testing maintains work productivity with implementation costs."
https://openalex.org/W3208150683,"Liver sinusoidal endothelial cell-derived bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) and the BMP6-small mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (SMAD) signaling pathway are essential for the expression of hepcidin, the secretion of which is considered the systemic master switch of iron homeostasis. However, there are continued controversies related to the strong and direct suppressive effect of iron on hepatocellular hepcidin in vitro in contrast to in vivo conditions. Here, we directly studied the crosstalk between endothelial cells (ECs) and hepatocytes using in vitro coculture models that mimic hepcidin signaling in vivo. Huh7 cells were directly cocultured with ECs, and EC conditioned media (CM) were also used to culture Huh7 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes. To explore the reactions of ECs to surrounding iron, they were grown in the presence of ferric ammonium citrate and heme, two iron-containing molecules. We found that both direct coculture with ECs and EC-CM significantly increased hepcidin expression in Huh7 cells. The upstream SMAD pathway, including phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8, SMAD1, and inhibitor of DNA binding 1, was induced by EC-CM, promoting hepcidin expression. Efficient blockage of this EC-mediated hepcidin upregulation by an inhibitor of the BMP6 receptor ALK receptor tyrosine kinase 2/3 or BMP6 siRNA identified BMP6 as a major hepcidin regulator in this coculture system, which highly fits the model of hepcidin regulation by iron in vivo. In addition, EC-derived BMP6 and hepcidin were highly sensitive to levels of not only ferric iron but also heme as low as 500 nM. We here establish a hepatocyte-endothelial coculture system to fully recapitulate iron regulation by hepcidin using EC-derived BMP6."
https://openalex.org/W3208178710,"Drought stress massively restricts plant growth and the yield of crops. Reducing the deleterious effects of drought is necessary for agricultural industry. The plant-specific NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) transcription factors (TFs) are widely involved in the regulation of plant development and stress response. One of the NAC TF, JUNGBRUNNEN1 (JUB1), has been reported to involve in drought resistance in Arabidopsis. However, little is known of how the JUB1 gene respond to drought stress in cotton. In the present study, we cloned GhJUB1L1, a homologous gene of JUB1 in upland cotton. GhJUB1L1 is preferentially expressed in stem and leaf and could be induced by drought stress. GhJUB1L1 protein localizes to the cell nucleus, and the transcription activation region of which is located in the C-terminal region. Silencing GhJUB1L1 gene via VIGS () reduced cotton drought tolerance, and retarded secondary cell wall (SCW) development. Additionally, the expression of some drought stress-related genes and SCW synthesis-related genes were altered in the GhJUB1L1 silencing plants. Collectively, our findings indicate that GhJUB1L1 may act as a positive regulator in response to drought stress and SCW development in cotton. Our results enriched the roles of NAC TFs in cotton drought tolerance and laid a foundation for the cultivation of transgenic cotton with higher drought tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3210824556,"Objectives To investigate nurses’ behavioral intention toward caring for COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation, as well as the factors affecting their intention. Background COVID-19 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation have many care needs and pose more challenges for nurses, which might adversely affect nurses’ intention toward caring behavior. Methods A cross‐sectional study was conducted by using simple random sampling to recruit 598 nurses from five tertiary hospitals in Sichuan Province, China. The participants responded to an online questionnaire that included questions on demographic characteristics; the Attitude, Subjective Norms, and Behavioral Intention of Nurses toward Mechanically Ventilated Patients (ASIMP) questionnaire; the Nursing Professional Identity Scale (NPIS); and the Compassion Fatigue-Short Scale (CF-Short Scale). ANOVA, Spearman correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression were performed to analyze the data. Results The mean total behavioral intention score was 179.46 (± 14.83) out of a total score of 189.00, which represented a high level of intention toward caring for patients on mechanical ventilation. Multiple linear regression revealed that subjective norms (β = 0.390, P &lt;0.001), perceived behavioral control (β = 0.149, P &lt;0.001), professional identity (β = 0.101, P = 0.009), and compassion fatigue (β = 0.088 P = 0.024) were significant predictors of nurses’ behavioral intention. Conclusions Most nurses have a positive behavioral intention to care for COVID-19 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. The findings in this study provide some insight for developing effective and tailored strategies to promote nurses’ behavioral intention toward caring for ventilated patients under the pandemic situation."
https://openalex.org/W3211065139,"To investigate differences in brain volumes between children born extremely preterm and term born controls at term age and at 10 years of age.Children born extremely preterm (EPT), up to 26 weeks and 6 days gestational age, in Stockholm between January 1 2004 to March 31 2007 were included in this population-based cohort study. A total of 45 EPT infants were included at term age and 51 EPT children were included at 10 years of age. There were 27 EPT children included at both time points. Two different control groups were recruited; 15 control infants were included at term age and 38 control children at 10 years of age. The primary outcomes were the grey and white matter volumes. Linear regression, adjusted for intracranial volume and sex, was used.At term age, the extremely preterm infants had significantly smaller grey matter volume compared to the control infants with an adjusted mean difference of 5.0 cm3 and a 95% confidence interval of -8.4 to -1.5 (p = 0.004). At 10 years of age the extremely preterm children had significantly smaller white matter volume compared to the control children with an adjusted mean difference of 6.0 cm3 and a 95% confidence interval of -10.9 to -1.0 (p = 0.010).Extremely preterm birth was associated with reduced grey matter volume at term age and reduced white matter volume at 10 years of age compared to term born controls."
https://openalex.org/W3211127251,"Inonotus obliquus Polysaccharide (IOP) is a large molecule extracted from Inonotus obliqus, a medicinal fungus, which has a wide range of biological activities and has been shown to be associated with inflammation. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether IOP can help to reduce acute endometritis by regulating intestinal flora. We observed pathological changes in mice with endometritis following treatment with IOP and evaluated changes in the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and further studied the effects of IOP on the intestinal flora of endometritis mice using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that IOP improved the condition of uterine tissues and reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Meanwhile, the 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that IOP could regulate the changes in intestinal microflora at the level of genera, possibly by changing the relative abundance of some genera."
https://openalex.org/W3208324388,"Protective behaviors such as mask wearing and physical distancing are critical to slow the spread of COVID-19, even in the context of vaccine scale-up. Understanding the variation in self-reported COVID-19 protective behaviors is critical to developing public health messaging. The purpose of the study is to provide nationally representative estimates of five self-reported COVID-19 protective behaviors and correlates of such behaviors. In this cross-sectional survey study of US adults, surveys were administered via internet and telephone. Adults were surveyed from April 30-May 4, 2020, a time of peaking COVID-19 incidence within the US. Participants were recruited from the probability-based AmeriSpeak® national panel. Brief surveys were completed by 994 adults, with 73.0% of respondents reported mask wearing, 82.7% reported physical distancing, 75.1% reported crowd avoidance, 89.8% reported increased hand-washing, and 7.7% reported having prior COVID-19 testing. Multivariate analysis (p critical value .05) indicates that women were more likely to report protective behaviors than men, as were those over age 60. Respondents who self-identified as having low incomes, histories of criminal justice involvement, and Republican Party affiliation, were less likely to report four protective behaviors, though Republicans and individuals with criminal justice histories were more likely to report having received COVID-19 testing. The majority of Americans engaged in COVID-19 protective behaviors, with low-income Americans, those with histories of criminal justice involvement, and self-identified Republicans less likely to engage in these preventive behaviors. Culturally competent public health messaging and interventions might focus on these latter groups to prevent future infections. These findings will remain highly relevant even with vaccines widely available, given the complementarities between vaccines and protective behaviors, as well as the many challenges in delivering vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3208396796,"Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) has been reported to have a strong regulatory function in the proinflammatory response, but the mechanism is still unknown. Here, we identified HDAC5 as a positive regulator of NF-κB signaling in vivo. HDAC5-deficient mice exhibited enhanced survival in response to LPS challenge. Using LPS, TNFα, different kinds of viruses, hydrogen peroxide, or ultraviolet stimulation, we demonstrate that HDAC5-mediated regulation of NF-κB occurs in manners both dependent on and independent of IKK, an upstream kinase in the NF-κB signaling pathway. Deficiency in HDAC5 impaired the phosphorylation of IKKβ, subsequent phosphorylation of the NF-κB inhibitor protein IκBα and NF-κB subunit p65. We also show that the phosphatase PP2A repressed transcriptional activation of NF-κB by decreasing phosphorylation of IKKβ, p65, and IκBα. In vitro deacetylation experiments and site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that HDAC5 directly deacetylated PP2Ac at Lys136, which resulted in the deactivation of PP2A. Our data add mechanistic insight into the cross talk between epigenetic and posttranslational modifications regulating NF-κB signaling and protein phosphatase activation that mediate survival in response to inflammatory challenges."
https://openalex.org/W3209197716,"Urban areas are associated with high levels of habitat fragmentation. For some terrestrial species with limited climbing abilities, property boundaries can pose a significant problem by limiting access to residential gardens. The West European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) has declined markedly in the UK but is commonly found in areas of human habitation, including residential gardens. 'Hedgehog Street' is a public engagement campaign aimed at recruiting volunteers ('Hedgehog Champions') to create access points ('hedgehog highways') across garden boundaries to improve habitat connectivity. In this study, we used a series of questionnaire surveys to explore motivations for and obstacles to the creation of highways. Householders were more likely to have created a highway if they were already aware of the Hedgehog Street campaign, if their garden contained a high number of wildlife-friendly features and if they considered watching wildlife to be important. Hedgehog Champions created, on average, 1.69 highways each with 52.0% creating none; this would equate to an estimated >120,000 across all registered Champions. In comparison, 6.1-29.8% of non-Champions stated that they had made a highway. However, most highways had been created in boundaries that could already be traversed via naturally occurring holes: only 11.4% of garden boundaries could be traversed, and 3.2% of gardens accessed, just via a hedgehog highway. In addition, only 5.0% of gardens were considered totally inaccessible to hedgehogs. The most common reasons cited for not having made a highway were that householders' gardens were already accessible to hedgehogs followed by concerns relating to boundary ownership and / or communicating with neighbours. Future studies need to identify strategies for overcoming these obstacles to maximize citizen engagement, particularly with those householders who are not innately ""wildlife-friendly"", and to quantify the degree to which networks of highways affect patterns of individual movement and, ultimately, populations."
https://openalex.org/W3209502338,"Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) allows quantifying myocardial tissue deformation and strain based on the tagging principle. In this work, we investigate accuracy and precision of strain quantification from synthetic 3D tagged MRI using equilibrated warping. To this end, synthetic biomechanical left-ventricular tagged MRI data with varying tag distance, spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were generated and processed to quantify errors in radial, circumferential and longitudinal strains relative to ground truth. Results reveal that radial strain is more sensitive to image resolution and noise than the other strain components. The study also shows robustness of quantifying circumferential and longitudinal strain in the presence of geometrical inconsistencies of 3D tagged data. In conclusion, our study points to the need for higher-resolution 3D tagged MRI than currently available in practice in order to achieve sufficient accuracy of radial strain quantification."
https://openalex.org/W3209902354,"To characterize the microbiota of postmenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for endometrioid (EAC) or uterine serous cancers (USC) compared to controls with non-malignant conditions.Endometrial, cervicovaginal and anorectal microbial swabs were obtained from 35 postmenopausal women (10 controls, 14 EAC and 11 USC) undergoing hysterectomy. Extracted DNA was PCR amplified using barcoded 16S rRNA gene V4 primers. Sequenced libraries were processed using QIIME2. Phyloseq was used to calculate α- and β- diversity measures. Biomarkers associated with case status were identified using ANCOM after adjustment for patient age, race and BMI. PICRUSt was used to identify microbial pathways associated with case status.Beta-diversity of microbial communities across each niche was significantly different (R2 = 0.25, p < 0.001). Alpha-diversity of the uterine microbiome was reduced in USC (Chao1, p = 0.004 and Fisher, p = 0.007) compared to EAC. Biomarkers from the three anatomical sites allowed samples to be clustered into two distinct clades that distinguished controls from USC cases (p = 0.042). The USC group was defined by 13 bacterial taxa across the three sites (W-stat>10, FDR<0.05) including depletion of cervicovaginal Lactobacillus and elevation of uterine Pseudomonas. PICRUSTt analysis revealed highly significant differences between the USC-associated clades within the cervicovaginal and uterine microbiota.The microbial diversity of anatomic niches in postmenopausal women with EAC and USC is different compared to controls. Multiple bacteria are associated with USC case status including elevated levels of cervicovaginal Lactobacillus, depletion of uterine Pseudomonas, and substantially different functional potentials identified within cervicovaginal and uterine niches."
https://openalex.org/W3208159271,"This paper explored the occurrence of food fraud and adulterations (FFA) in exports from the Association of South- East Asia Nations (ASEAN), with implications on food chain and international trade. Data from European Union Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (EU RASFF) about FFA notifications on ASEAN exports for a period of 20 years (2000-2020) were extracted and analyzed. Results from this study revealed that of all ten ASEAN member countries, seven had cases of FFA notified in the database with Thailand (n = 47, 32%) and the Philippines (n = 37, 26%) receiving the highest frequency of notifications in the region. There was a statistical significance difference in frequency of notifications received on products from these seven countries with herbs and spices ranking highest (n = 22, 15%). Highest notifications of FFA on ASEAN exports came from the United Kingdom (n = 31, 21%). All the seven countries experienced border rejections and consequent destruction of food products especially on exports from Indonesia where 95% of product with FFA were border rejected. Border rejections on products from these countries were significantly different. Therefore, a thorough implementation system, appropriate testing and constantly updating each country's FFA database could aid actions in curtailing future events."
https://openalex.org/W3209353202,"Health workers' compliance with outpatient malaria case-management guidelines has been improving in Africa. This study examined the factors associated with the improvements.Data from 11 national, cross-sectional health facility surveys undertaken from 2010-2016 were analysed. Association between 31 determinants and improvement trends in five outpatient compliance outcomes were examined using interactions between each determinant and time in multilevel logistic regression models and reported as an adjusted odds ratio of annual trends (T-aOR).Among 9,173 febrile patients seen at 1,208 health facilities and by 1,538 health workers, a higher annual improvement trend in composite ""test and treat"" performance was associated with malaria endemicity-lake endemic (T-aOR = 1.67 annually; p<0.001) and highland epidemic (T-aOR = 1.35; p<0.001) zones compared to low-risk zone; with facilities stocking rapid diagnostic tests only (T-aOR = 1.49; p<0.001) compared to microscopy only services; with faith-based/non-governmental facilities compared to government-owned (T-aOR = 1.15; p = 0.036); with a daily caseload of >25 febrile patients (T-aOR = 1.46; p = 0.003); and with under-five children compared to older patients (T-aOR = 1.07; p = 0.013). Other factors associated with the improvement trends in the ""test and treat"" policy components and artemether-lumefantrine administration at the facility included the absence of previous RDT stock-outs, community health workers dispensing drugs, access to malaria case-management and Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines, health workers' gender, correct health workers' knowledge about the targeted malaria treatment policy, and patients' main complaint of fever. The odds of compliance at the baseline were variable for some of the factors.Targeting of low malaria risk areas, low caseload facilities, male and government health workers, continuous availability of RDTs, improving health workers' knowledge about the policy considering age and fever, and dissemination of guidelines might improve compliance with malaria guidelines. For prompt treatment and administration of the first artemether-lumefantrine dose at the facility, task-shifting duties to community health workers can be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3209788485,"Human root and canal number and morphology are highly variable, and internal root canal form and count does not necessarily co-vary directly with external morphology. While several typologies and classifications have been developed to address individual components of teeth, there is a need for a comprehensive system, that captures internal and external root features across all teeth. Using CT scans, the external and internal root morphologies of a global sample of humans are analysed (n = 945). From this analysis a method of classification that captures external and internal root morphology in a way that is intuitive, reproducible, and defines the human phenotypic set is developed. Results provide a robust definition of modern human tooth root phenotypic diversity. The method is modular in nature, allowing for incorporation of past and future classification systems. Additionally, it provides a basis for analysing hominin root morphology in evolutionary, ecological, genetic, and developmental contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3209998060,"Lystrosaurus was one of the few tetrapods to survive the Permo-Triassic mass extinction, the most profound biotic crisis in Earth’s history. The wide paleolatitudinal range and high abundance of Lystrosaurus during the Early Triassic provide a unique opportunity to investigate changes in growth dynamics and longevity following the mass extinction, yet most studies have focused only on species that lived in the southern hemisphere. Here, we present the long bone histology from twenty Lystrosaurus skeletal elements spanning a range of sizes that were collected in the Jiucaiyuan Formation of northwestern China. In addition, we compare the average body size of northern and southern Pangean Triassic-aged species and conduct cranial geometric morphometric analyses of southern and northern taxa to begin investigating whether specimens from China are likely to be taxonomically distinct from South African specimens. We demonstrate that Lystrosaurus from China have larger average body sizes than their southern Pangean relatives and that their cranial morphologies are distinctive. The osteohistological examination revealed sustained, rapid osteogenesis punctuated by growth marks in some, but not all, immature individuals from China. We find that the osteohistology of Chinese Lystrosaurus shares a similar growth pattern with South African species that show sustained growth until death. However, bone growth arrests more frequently in the Chinese sample. Nevertheless, none of the long bones sampled here indicate that maximum or asymptotic size was reached, suggesting that the maximum size of Lystrosaurus from the Jiucaiyuan Formation remains unknown."
https://openalex.org/W3209207130,"Interspecific interactions among mesocarnivores can influence community dynamics and resource partitioning. Insights into these interactions can enhance understanding of local ecological processes that have impacts on pathogen transmission, such as the rabies lyssavirus. Host species ecology can provide an important baseline for disease management strategies especially in biologically diverse ecosystems and heterogeneous landscapes. We used a mesocarnivore guild native to the southwestern United States, a regional rabies hotspot, that are prone to rabies outbreaks as our study system. Gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), bobcats (Lynx rufus), and coyotes (Canis latrans) share large portions of their geographic ranges and can compete for resources, occupy similar niches, and influence population dynamics of each other. We deployed 80 cameras across two mountain ranges in Arizona, stratified by vegetation type. We used two-stage modeling to gain insight into species occurrence and co-occurrence patterns. There was strong evidence for the effects of elevation, season, and temperature impacting detection probability of all four species, with understory height and canopy cover also influencing gray foxes and skunks. For all four mesocarnivores, a second stage multi-species co-occurrence model better explained patterns of detection than the single-species occurrence model. These four species are influencing the space use of each other and are likely competing for resources seasonally. We did not observe spatial partitioning between these competitors, likely due to an abundance of cover and food resources in the biologically diverse system we studied. From our results we can draw inferences on community dynamics to inform rabies management in a regional hotspot. Understanding environmental factors in disease hotspots can provide useful information to develop more reliable early-warning systems for viral outbreaks. We recommend that disease management focus on delivering oral vaccine baits onto the landscape when natural food resources are less abundant, specifically during the two drier seasons in Arizona (pre-monsoon spring and autumn) to maximize intake by all mesocarnivores."
https://openalex.org/W3210241325,"Changes in brain structure and cognitive decline occur in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). They also occur with smoking and coronary artery disease (CAD), but it is unclear whether a common mechanism is responsible.Brain MRI markers of brain structure were tested for association with disease markers in other organs. Where possible, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to group markers within organ systems into composite markers. Univariate relationships between brain structure and the disease markers were explored using hierarchical regression and then entered into multivariable regression models.100 participants were studied (53 COPD, 47 CAD). PCA identified two brain components: brain tissue volumes and white matter microstructure, and six components from other organ systems: respiratory function, plasma lipids, blood pressure, glucose dysregulation, retinal vessel calibre and retinal vessel tortuosity. Several markers could not be grouped into components and were analysed as single variables, these included brain white matter hyperintense lesion (WMH) volume. Multivariable regression models showed that less well organised white matter microstructure was associated with lower respiratory function (p = 0.028); WMH volume was associated with higher blood pressure (p = 0.036) and higher C-Reactive Protein (p = 0.011) and lower brain tissue volume was associated with lower cerebral blood flow (p<0.001) and higher blood pressure (p = 0.001). Smoking history was not an independent correlate of any brain marker.Measures of brain structure were associated with a range of markers of disease, some of which appeared to be common to both COPD and CAD. No single common pathway was identified, but the findings suggest that brain changes associated with smoking-related diseases may be due to vascular, respiratory, and inflammatory changes."
https://openalex.org/W3210645080,"Although long sinus arrest is occasionally observed during atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation when the fibrillation was terminated, its meaning and prognosis have not yet been clearly elucidated. We hypothesized that sinus node recovery time (SNRT) after termination of AF (time from termination of AF to the earliest sinus node activation) could reflect the extent of atrial remodeling, influencing the formation of non-pulmonary vein (non-PV) triggers and post-ablation outcomes.The participants were 157 consecutive patients with persistent AF (male: 77.1%, age: 63.3±11.2 years) who underwent catheter ablation. We recorded SNRT after terminating AF by radiofrequency delivery or electrical cardioversion during the first ablation and evaluated the relationships between SNRT and atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence and between SNRT and non-PV triggers after repeat ablation.Forty-five patients (28.7%) experienced recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias. Patients with recurrence had longer SNRTs (1738 ms vs. 1394 ms, p = 0.012). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, only SNRT ≥2128ms was a significant independent predictor of clinical AF recurrence (hazard ratio 7.48; 95% confidence interval 2.94-19.00; P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimator showed that the recurrence-free rate was significantly lower if ≥ 2128ms (log-rank, p<0.001). Thirty-five patients (77.8%) underwent a second ablation. Although there was no difference in the rate of pulmonary vein reconnections (78.6% vs. 71.4%, p = 0.712), non-PV triggers were observed more frequently in the longer SNRT group (57.1% vs. 14.3%, p = 0.012).Patients with a prolonged SNRT had a higher prevalence of AF recurrence after the first ablation and higher inducibility of non-PV triggers. Measuring SNRT might be used for the stratification of patients with persistent AF."

The different particles including nanoclay (NC), nano-graphene oxide (NGO), and carbon nanotubes (CNT) with various weight percentages were incorporated into the epoxy matrix. Young's modulus, ultimate tensile strength, strain at the fracture point, and the fracture toughness of nanocomposite samples were investigated. Besides, the tribological performance of these fabricated nanocomposites was evaluated and discussed. The results show that a significant change in the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites compared to the epoxy matrix. Also, the results reveal that the combination of NC with NGO improves the mechanical properties of graphene nanocomposites. It is found that adding NC to the NG/epoxy composite, may increase the fracture toughness up to 2 times as well as improve the ultimate tensile strength and strain at the fracture point. However, there was no significant change in Young's modulus."
https://openalex.org/W3208854790,"In Cambodia, diabetes caused nearly 3% of the country's mortality in 2016 and became the fourth highest cause of disability in 2017. Providing sufficient financial risk protection from health care expenditures may be part of the solution towards effectively tackling the diabetes burden and motivating individuals to appropriately seek care to effectively manage their condition. In this study, we aim to estimate the distributional health and financial impacts of strategies providing financial coverage for diabetes services through the Health Equity Funds (HEF) in Cambodia. The trajectory of diabetes was represented using a Markov model to estimate the societal costs, health impacts, and individual out-of-pocket expenditures associated with six strategies of HEF coverage over a time horizon of 45 years. Input parameters for the model were compiled from published literature and publicly available household survey data. Strategies covered different combinations of types of diabetes care costs (i.e., diagnostic services, medications, and management of diabetes-related complications). Health impacts were computed as the number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted and financial risk protection was analyzed in terms of cases of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) averted. Model simulations demonstrated that coverage for medications would be cost-effective, accruing health benefits ($27 per DALY averted) and increases in financial risk protection ($2 per case of CHE averted) for the poorest in Cambodia. Women experienced particular gains in health and financial risk protection. Increasing the number of individuals eligible for financial coverage also improved the value of such investments. For HEF coverage, the government would pay between an estimated $28 and $58 per diabetic patient depending on the extent of coverage and services covered. Efforts to increase the availability of services and capacity of primary care facilities to support diabetes care could have far-reaching impacts on the burden of diabetes and contribute to long-term health system strengthening."
https://openalex.org/W3209538975,"Leadership in public health is necessary, relevant, and important as it enables the engagement, management, and transformation of complex public health challenges at a national level, as well as collaborating with internal stakeholders to address global public health threats. The research literature recommends exploring the journey of public health leaders and the factors influencing leadership development, especially in developing countries. Thus, we aimed to develop a grounded theory on individual leadership development in the Nepalese context. For this, we adopted constructivist grounded theory, and conducted 46 intensive interviews with 22 public health officials working under the Ministry of Health, Nepal. Data were analysed by adopting the principles of Charmaz's constructivist grounded theory. The theory developed from this study illustrates four phases of leadership development within an individual-initiation, identification, development, and expansion. The 'initial phase' is about an individual's wishes to be a leader without a formal role or acknowledgement, where family environment, social environment and individual characteristics play a role in influencing the actualisation of leadership behaviours. The 'identification phase' involves being identified as a public health official after having formal position in health-related organisations. The 'development' phase is about developing core leadership capabilities mostly through exposure and experiences. The 'expansion' phase describes expanding leadership capabilities and recognition mostly by continuous self-directed learning. The grounded theory provides insights into the meaning and actions of participants' professional experiences and highlighted the role of individual characteristics, family and socio-cultural environment, and workplace settings in the development of leadership capabilities. It has implications for academia to fulfill the absence of leadership theory in public health and is significant to fulfill the need of leadership models grounded in the local context of Asian countries."
https://openalex.org/W3210041479,"Our aim was to examine attitudes of the general population towards reasonableness of these costs, as well as the degree to which these costs are shared across society (solidarity financing) and to determine the factors associated with them.Repeated cross-sectional data from a nationally representative online-survey. More precisely, data from wave 8 (21-22 April 2020) and wave 16 (7-8 July 2020) were used (in wave 8: analytical sample with n = 976, average age was 47.0 years (SD: 15.3 years), ranging from 18 to 74 years, 51.8% female; in wave 16: analytical sample with n = 978, average age was 46.1 years (SD: 15.9 years), ranging from 18 to 74 years, 50.9% female). After a short introduction emphasizing considerable economic costs associated with the measures against the spread of the coronavirus, individuals were asked to rate the following statements (outcome measures), in each case from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree: ""These economic costs are currently reasonable in relation to the objective pursued"" (reasonableness of costs), ""These economic costs should be borne jointly by all citizens and depending on income"" (solidarity financing).In wave 8 (wave 16 in parentheses), the average rating for the attitude towards reasonableness of costs was 4.3, SD: 1.8 (wave 16, average: 4.2, SD: 1.8) and the average rating for the attitude towards solidarity financing was 3.7, SD: 1.9 (wave 16, average: 3.3, SD: 2.0). In wave 8, more positive attitudes towards the reasonableness of costs and solidarity financing were associated with being male, higher education, not being in a partnership/being unmarried, higher affect regarding COVID-19 and higher presumed severity with respect to COVID-19. Furthermore, more positive attitudes towards the reasonableness of costs were associated with having a migration background. More positive attitudes towards solidarity financing was associated with higher age groups. Mainly similar findings were observed in wave 16.Agreement with reasonableness of costs of preventative measures as well as solidarity financing was moderately high. Knowledge of these attitudes is important to ensure social cohesion during the fight against COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3210330974,"Athletes and rehabilitation specialists have used Kinesio tape (KT) to help alleviate pain symptoms. Currently, no clear mechanism exists as to why pain is relieved with the use of KT and whether the pain relieving effect is simply a placebo effect. Additionally, the most effective taping parameters (tension of tape) for pain reduction remain unknown. We used quantitative sensory testing to address these key gaps in the KT and pain literature. Using a repeated-measures laboratory design, we examined whether KT applied at different tensions reduces experimentally-induced pain compared to a no tape condition and KT with minimal tension. Heat pain thresholds (HPT's), pressure pain thresholds (PPT's), and pressure pain suprathreshold (PPS: 125% of PPT) tests were administered to the forearm prior to and during KT and no tape conditions. Tape was applied to the ventral forearm at 25% of max tension, 75% of max tension, and no tension (placebo). Repeated measures ANOVA's evaluated the pain outcomes between conditions and across time. KT had no significant effect on PPT's and HPT's (p's >0.05). The ANOVA on PPS revealed that KT applied at 25% of tension significantly reduced pain ratings from the pretest (M = 34.4, SE = 5.5) to post-test 1 (M = 30.3, SE = 4.7) and post-test 2 (M = 30.4, SE = 4.7). No other conditions significantly reduced suprathreshold pressure pain. However, pain ratings at posttest-1 during the no-tape condition (M = 36.4, SE = 5.3) were significantly greater than pain ratings during post-test 1 and post-test 2 of all three tape conditions. In conclusion, the current study revealed that KT applied at low tension is the optimal tension to reduce pressure-evoked muscle pain. Additionally, the results suggested that KT applied at low, high, or no tension may acutely prevent increased muscle sensitivity with repeated pressure stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W3210947306,"Tobacco consumption is one of the leading causes of preventable death. In this study, we analyze whether someone's genetic predisposition to smoking moderates the response to tobacco excise taxes.We interact polygenic scores for smoking behavior with state-level tobacco excise taxes in longitudinal data (1992-2016) from the US Health and Retirement Study (N = 12,058).Someone's genetic propensity to smoking moderates the effect of tobacco excise taxes on smoking behavior along the extensive margin (smoking vs. not smoking) and the intensive margin (the amount of tobacco consumed). In our analysis sample, we do not find a significant gene-environment interaction effect on smoking cessation.When tobacco excise taxes are relatively high, those with a high genetic predisposition to smoking are less likely (i) to smoke, and (ii) to smoke heavily. While tobacco excise taxes have been effective in reducing smoking, the gene-environment interaction effects we observe in our sample suggest that policy makers could benefit from taking into account the moderating role of genes in the design of future tobacco control policies."
https://openalex.org/W3211016602,"Background Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of musculoskeletal pain and disability among Americans. Physical therapy (PT) is recommended per the 2019 ACR /Arthritis Foundation Guideline for Treatment of OA of the Hand, Hip, and Knee. During COVID-19, access to healthcare has been altered in a variety of clinical settings, with the pandemic creating delays in healthcare, with an unknown impact on access to PT care for OA. Objectives We sought to determine whether referrals to PT for OA were reduced in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019. Methods A retrospective analysis was done of 3586 PT referrals placed by the University of California, Davis for 206 OA ICD-10 codes from January to November 2019 and from January to November 2020. The numbers of PT referrals per month of each year were compared using both descriptive statistics and Poisson Regression analysis. Results A total of 1972 PT referrals for OA were placed from January to November 2019. Only 1614 referrals for OA were placed from January to November 2020, representing a significant decrease ( p = 0.001). Month-by-month analysis of 2020 compared to 2019 revealed statistically significant drops in PT referrals for OA in April ( p = 0.001), May ( p = 0.001), and August ( p = 0.001). Conclusions These findings reveal a significant reduction in the number of referrals for PT for OA placed in 2020 during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. These reductions were particularly evident in the months following state-mandated actions and closures. Factors associated with this outcome may include decreased access to primary care providers, perceptions of PT availability by health care providers, decreased mobility limiting access to both clinic and PT appointments, and/or willingness to engage in PT by patients during the pandemic."

However, the individual effects of intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) or atrial fibrillation (AF) on the prognosis of these patients have not been studied.Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of ICAS and AF on the prognosis of ischemic stroke patients with active cancer.We included ischemic stroke patients with active cancer between 2010 and 2020. Early neurological deterioration (END) was defined as an increase of ≥ 1 in the motor NIHSS score, or ≥ 2 in the total NIHSS score within 72 hours of admission. Unfavorable outcomes were defined as a score of ≥ 3 on the 3-month modified Rankin Scale.In total, 116 ischemic stroke patients with active cancer were evaluated. In multivariable analysis, ICAS was positively associated with END (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52-13.70), and this association showed a quantitative relationship according to the degree of stenosis of ICAS (stenosis group: aOR = 4.24, 95% CI: 1.31-13.72; occlusion group, aOR = 5.74, 95% CI: 1.05-31.30). ICAS was also closely related to unfavorable outcomes (aOR = 6.33, 95% CI: 1.15-34.79). In contrast, AF showed no significant association with END or unfavorable outcomes. Our data showed that patients with ICAS had larger and more severe initial stroke lesions, and poorer prognosis than those without.ICAS, but not AF, was closely associated with poor prognosis in ischemic stroke patients with active cancer."

Ten subjects with paired CT datasets (3-6 months interval) were studied, using computer software to segment and measure the upper airway. The minimum cross-sectional area of the total airway and all its segments (velopharynx, oropharynx, tongue base, and epiglottis) generally had the largest variation, while the length of the total airway had the lowest variation. Sphericity was the only parameter that was stable over time (relative difference <15%), both in the total airway and each subregion. There was considerable intra-individual variation in CT measurements of the upper airway, with the same patient instruction protocol for image acquisitions. The length of the total airway, and the sphericity of the total upper airway and each segment were stable over time. Hence, such intra-individual variation should be taken into account when interpreting and comparing upper airway evaluation parameters on CT in order to quantify treatment results or disease progress."

The biological effects of IS in the vascular bed could be confirmed by changes in the levels of individual serum proteins during normal pregnancy and in the postpartum period as compared with non-pregnant controls. Albumin (Alb) and α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP, orosomucoid) are the most abundant serum carrier proteins with potential interrelationships with serum levels of IS.Serum levels of IS, Alb and AGP were measured in 84 pregnant women in the first, second and third trimester of pregnancy and in the postpartum period, as well as in non-pregnant controls (n = 20), using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (IS), colorimetric assay (Alb) and immunoturbidimetric assay (AGP).The postpartum serum levels [mg/L] of IS were lower (p = 0.027) than in the second trimester (mean±SD: 0.85±0.39 vs 0.58±0.32). There were no differences in the IS to ALB ratio calculated in the three trimesters of pregnancy, the postpartum period, and in the non-pregnant controls. The IS/AGP ratio increased from the first to the second trimester (p = 0.039), and decreased in the postpartum period (p<0.05), when it was lower than in the second and third trimester.The variability of the serum IS/AGP ratio during pregnancy and in the postpartum period may reflect shared involvement in the regulation of their intravascular relationships. The link between serum levels of IS derived from the gut and AGP could serve a potential biomarkers of maternal intestinal metabolism during pregnancy and postpartum."
https://openalex.org/W3208664814,"Background The benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) underpin the recommendations for the early detection of HIV infection and ART initiation. Late initiation (LI) of antiretroviral therapy compromises the benefits of ART both individually and in the community. Indeed, it promotes the transmission of infection and higher HIV-related morbidity and mortality with complicated and costly clinical management. This study aims to analyze the evolutionary trends in the median CD4 count, the median time to initiation of ART, the proportion of patients with advanced HIV disease at the initiation of ART between 2006 and 2017 and their factors. Methods and findings HIV-positive adults (≥ 16 years old) who initiated ART between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2017 in 25 HIV care facilities in Kinshasa, the capital of DRC, were eligible. The data were processed anonymously. LI is defined as CD4≤350 cells/μl and/or WHO clinical stage III or IV and advanced HIV disease (AHD), as CD4≤200 cells/μl and/or stage WHO clinic IV. Factors associated with advanced HIV disease at ART initiation were analyzed, irrespective of year of enrollment in HIV care, using logistic regression models. A total of 7278 patients (55% admitted after 2013) with an average age of 40.9 years were included. The majority were composed of women (71%), highly educated women (68%) and married or widowed women (61%). The median CD4 was 213 cells/μl, 76.7% of patients had CD4≤350 cells/μl, 46.1% had CD4≤200 cells/μl, and 59% of patients were at WHO clinical stage s 3 or 4. Men had a more advanced clinical stage (p &lt;0.046) and immunosuppression (p&lt;0.0007) than women. Overall, 70% of patients started ART late, and 25% had AHD. Between 2006 and 2017, the median CD4 count increased from 190 cells/μl to 331 cells/μl (p&lt;0.0001), and the proportions of patients with LI and AHD decreased from 76% to 47% (p&lt; 0.0001) and from 18.7% to 8.9% (p&lt;0.0001), respectively. The median time to initiation of ART after screening for HIV infection decreased from 40 to zero months (p&lt;0.0001), and the proportion of time to initiation of ART in the month increased from 39 to 93.3% (p&lt;0.0001) in the same period. The probability of LI of ART was higher in married couples (OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3–2.3) (p&lt;0.0007) and lower in patients with higher education (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.64–0.86) (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusion Despite increasingly rapid treatment, the proportions of LI and AHD remain high. New approaches to early detection, the first condition for early ART and a key to ending the HIV epidemic, such as home and work HIV testing, HIV self-testing and screening at the point of service, must be implemented."

Pre-operative oral gargles were also collected from non-diabetic subjects. Results 16S amplicon sequencing revealed similar taxa composition in endotracheal tube washings and oral gargles in the healthy control subjects, although the relative abundance of 11 genus level operational taxonomic units was significantly different between the two sample sources. The diabetic subjects showed relatively lower diversity than those of non-diabetic subjects. The proportion range of the most abundant taxa detected in each endotracheal tube washings were 10.1–33.2%. Conclusion Endotracheal tube washing fluid may provide healthy control samples for upper respiratory investigations without incurring any additional risk to the subject."
https://openalex.org/W3210384014,"An airship is lighter than an air vehicle with enormous potential in applications such as communication, aerial inspection, border surveillance, and precision agriculture. An airship model is made up of dynamic, aerodynamic, aerostatic, and propulsive forces. However, the computation of aerodynamic forces remained a challenge. In addition to aerodynamic model deficiencies, airship mass matrix suffers from parameter variations. Moreover, due to the lighter-than-air nature, it is also susceptible to wind disturbances. These modeling issues are the key challenges in developing an efficient autonomous flight controller for an airship. This article proposes a unified estimation method for airship states, model uncertainties, and wind disturbance estimation using Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The proposed method is based on a lumped model uncertainty vector that unifies model uncertainties and wind disturbances in a single vector. The airship model is extended by incorporating six auxiliary state variables into the lumped model uncertainty vector. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using a nonlinear simulation model of a custom-developed UETT airship and is validated by conducting a kind of error analysis. For comparative studies, EKF estimator is also developed. The results show the performance superiority of the proposed estimator over EKF; however, the proposed estimator is a bit expensive on computational grounds. However, as per the requirements of the current application, the proposed estimator can be a preferred choice."

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to explore the effects of the multidimensionality of narrative transportation on the multidimensionality of emotion. In this study, narrative transportation was divided into dimensions of empathy, immersion, and belief revision, and emotion was divided into pleasure and arousal. To explore the relationship between narrative transportation, emotions, and PWOM, the participants, comprising individuals with movie watching experience, completed a questionnaire on the movie that had left the deepest impression on them. The responses were analyzed through structural equation modeling. Empathy, immersion, and belief revision were significantly and positively associated with pleasure and arousal, which positively correlated with PWOM. The relationship between empathy or immersion and PWOM was partially mediated by pleasure and arousal, whereas pleasure and arousal fully mediated the association between belief revision and PWOM. Practical suggestions for filmmakers were derived from the present findings."
https://openalex.org/W3210922488,"Landforms determine the locations of particular biological communities based on their components and spatial positions. This study hierarchically classified the topographic spaces serving as habitats for biological communities in the Korean Peninsula and established the habitat types that occur on the classified landform types. We classified landform types by applying cell-based modeling, map algebra, and spatial query techniques to spatial data, including digital elevation model (DEM), Sentinel 2 image, land use, and field survey data to model their ecological characteristics. Landforms were classified into four categories (designated Category 1 through 4) according to their spatial scale based on topographical characteristics such as mountains, plains, alluvial landforms, coastal landforms, islands, and special areas (Baekdudaegan, DMZ), which are found throughout the Korean Peninsula. The landforms of the Korean Peninsula were classified into 47 subcategories in Category 1, 16 in Category 2, 36 in Category 3, and 63 in Category 4. There were 62 main types of habitats that were classified based on their topographic spatial units, and there were 437 types of sub-habitats, for which soil weathering, biodiversity, and geodiversity were combined with the main habitat types. When factor analysis was conducted for the environmental factors used to determine the main and sub-habitats, the first primary components were temperature-related factors, followed by biodiversity, geodiversity, aspect, and slope. When the indicator species were analyzed by habitat type, indicator species diversity was high in Jeju Province, Gangwon Province, and Gaema Plateau. Based on these results, landform elements for species habit conservation were assigned conservation values and classified into (I) absolute conservation areas, (II) transition areas, and (III) areas for coexistence with humans. Topographic spaces are being degraded as biological habitats as a result of climate change and human development; our proposed classifications can be applied to the conservation of landforms and biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W3210951669,"Although several studies have investigated the back-muscle flexion-relaxation phenomenon (FRP), the effect of individual flexibility on the FRP has been discussed infrequently, with very limited data on the influence of flexibility training on the FRP. This study thus examined the effect of flexibility training on the change of back-muscle FRP pattern in relatively inflexible young men. We collected and analyzed the valid data from 20 male participants (10 each with high and low flexibility included in the control and trained groups, respectively) when flexing their trunks at seven trunk flexion positions (0°-90°, in increments of 15°); their erector spinae and hamstring activation, pelvic tilt, and lumbosacral angle were then recorded. After 7 weeks of flexibility training for the low-flexibility group, no difference in flexibility was discovered between this group and the control (originally high-flexibility) group. The trunk flexion experiment was then repeated. The results showed that before the training stage, the low-flexibility group had lower erector spinae and higher hamstring activation, a larger pelvic tilt, and a smaller lumbosacral angle. By contrast, after training, the erector spinae and hamstring activation, pelvic tilt, and lumbosacral angle were significantly changed, and no intergroup differences were observed in FRP patterns. The study results suggest that flexibility training changes lumbopelvic movement and thereby reduces the degree of the back-muscle FRP when trunk flexion is performed."

We analyzed the neural responses by evaluating maximum source-localized power for the AD-MCI group (n = 11) and CU (n = 20), focusing on six regions of interest (ROIs) that form the DLPFC: right and left dorsal Brodmann area 9/46 (A9/46d), Brodmann area 46 (A46) and ventral Brodmann area 9/46 (A9/46v). We found significant differences in the maximum power between the groups in the left A46 and A9/46v. Moreover, in the left A9/46v, the maximum power significantly correlated with the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised general memory score and delayed recall score. The maximum power in the left A9/46v also revealed high performance in AD-MCI versus CU classification with the area under the ROC curve of 0.90. This study demonstrated that MEG during the optic flow task can be useful in discriminating AD-MCI from CU."
https://openalex.org/W3208437411,"In the current research, 68 specimens of orbital superior and/or medial walls taken from 33 human cadavers (12 females, 21 males) were subjected to uniaxial tension untill fracture. The samples were cut in the coronal (38 specimens) and sagittal (30 specimens) planes of the orbital wall. Apparent density (ρapp), tensile Young's modulus (E-modulus) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) were identified. Innovative test protocols were used to minimize artifacts and analyze the obtained data: (1) grips dedicated to non-symmetrical samples clamping were applied for mechanical testing, (2) non-contact measuring system of video-extensometer was employed for displacement registration, (3) ink imprint technique coupled with CAD analysis was applied to precisely access the cross-sectional areas of tested samples. With regard to a pooled group, apparent density for the coronal and sagittal cut plane was equal 1.53 g/cm3 and 1.57 g/cm3, tensile Young's modulus 2.36 GPa and 2.14 GPa, and ultimate tensile strength 12.66 MPa and 14.35 MPa, respectively. No significant statistical differences (p > 0.05) were found for all the analyzed parameters when comparing coronal and sagittal plane cut groups. These observations confirmed the hypothesis that direction of sample cut does not affect the mechanical response of the orbital wall tissue, thus suggesting that mechanical properties of orbital wall bone show isotropic character."

Optical DNA mapping (ODM), commonly categorized into sparsely-labelled ODM and densely-labelled ODM, provides sequence-specific continuous intensity profiles (DNA barcodes) along single DNA molecules and is a technique well-suited for detecting such alterations. For sparsely-labelled barcodes, the possibility to detect large genomic alterations has been investigated extensively, while densely-labelled barcodes have not received as much attention. In this work, we introduce HMMSV, a hidden Markov model (HMM) based algorithm for detecting structural variations (SVs) directly in densely-labelled barcodes without access to sequence information. We evaluate our approach using simulated data-sets with 5 different types of SVs, and combinations thereof, and demonstrate that the method reaches a true positive rate greater than 80% for randomly generated barcodes with single variations of size 25 kilobases (kb). Increasing the length of the SV further leads to larger true positive rates. For a real data-set with experimental barcodes on bacterial plasmids, we successfully detect matching barcode pairs and SVs without any particular assumption of the types of SVs present. Instead, our method effectively goes through all possible combinations of SVs. Since ODM works on length scales typically not reachable with other techniques, our methodology is a promising tool for identifying arbitrary combinations of genomic alterations."
https://openalex.org/W3209174323,"Glycogen-specific kinase (GSK3β) is an integral regulator of the Wnt signalling pathway as well as many other diverse signalling pathways and processes. Dys-regulation of GSK3β is implicated in many different pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders as well as many different tumour types. In the context of tumour development, GSK3β has been shown to play both oncogenic and tumour suppressor roles, depending upon tissue, signalling environment or disease progression. Although multiple substrates of the GSK3β kinase have been identified, the wider protein networks within which GSK3β participates are not well known, and the consequences of these interactions not well understood. In this study, LC-MS/MS expression analysis was performed using knockout GSK3β colorectal cancer cells and isogenic controls in colorectal cancer cell lines carrying dominant stabilizing mutations of β-catenin. Consistent with the role of GSK3β, we found that β-catenin levels and canonical Wnt activity are unaffected by knockout of GSK3β and therefore used this knockout cell model to identify other processes in which GSK3β is implicated. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed perturbation of proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion, and we characterized the phenotype and altered proteomic profiles associated with this. We also characterized the perturbation of metabolic pathways resulting from GSK3β knockout and identified defects in glycogen metabolism. In summary, using a precision colorectal cancer cell-line knockout model with constitutively activated β-catenin we identified several of the diverse pathways and processes associated with GSK3β function."
https://openalex.org/W3209660918,"The El Niño–Southern Oscillation is one of the most important drivers of climate change on Earth, and is characterised by warmer (El Niño) or colder (La Niña) ocean surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Tropical cyclones (TCs) and meridional circulation are the most influential weather events and climate phenomena, respectively. However, the link between TCs and meridional circulation anomalies (MCA) during El Niño years is unclear. Therefore, we calculated the accumulated cyclone energy index of TCs and the mass stream function of MCA from 1980 to 2018. Our results showed that TCs were closely related to the asymmetry of the MCA in the Central Pacific during El Niño years. An updraft anomaly in the North Pacific was found, which affected the response of MCA to El Niño from May to October during El Niño years. Therefore, the MCA intensity difference between the North and South Pacific increased, and the asymmetry was strengthened. This phenomenon may be strengthened by the combined effects of the equatorial westerly wind, relative vorticity, and warm ocean surfaces, which are controlled by El Niño. The equatorial westerly wind produces positive shear north of the equator, which increases the relative vorticity. The increase in relative vorticity is accompanied by a monsoon trough, leading to increased precipitation and updrafts. The background of the relative vorticity, updraft, and monsoon trough may be conducive to the generation and development of TCs. Our results prove that the possible link between TCs and the asymmetry of the MCA during El Niño years is derived from the combined effect of the equatorial westerly wind, relative vorticity, and warm ocean surfaces, thus providing a partial explanation for the link between TCs and the MCA."

The study was conducted with 193 Polish Hunting Dogs: 101 female and 92 male animals, aged between 3 months and 12 years. Ophthalmic examinations were performed using slit lamp biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, and tonometry based on the ophthalmological protocol for the examination of hereditary eye diseases. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was performed for dogs with sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome (SARDS) and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), while electroretinography was also performed in dogs with SARDS. Five dogs (2.6%) were diagnosed with cataract, iris coloboma in 3 dogs (1.6%), ocular dermoid in 1 dog (0.5%), and retinal dysplasia, distichiasis and entropion in 1 dog (1%). Three dogs (1.6%) were diagnosed with PRA and SARDS occurred in 1 dog. Retinal lesions was observed in 16 dogs (8.3%). The clinical signs of retinopathy observed in Polish Hunting Dogs included discoloration of the tapetal fundus, patchy increased reflectivity in the region of discoloration, focus of hyperpigmentation and an area of tapetal hyper-reflectivity with a pigmented center. SD-OCT performed in the 3 dogs with PRA revealed alteration in the retinal layers, which was most advanced in the non-tapetal fundus. Although SD-OCT revealed retinal layers with normal architecture only in some parts of the dorsal, nasal and temporal regions in dogs with SARDS, areas of disorganized external limiting membrane, myeloid zone, ellipsoid zone, outer photoreceptor segment and interdigitation zone were also observed. Polish Hunting Dogs should undergo periodic ophthalmological examination for the evaluation of other hereditary eye diseases. The prevalence of retinal lesions in Polish Hunting Dogs requires further research."

This exploratory study aimed to better understand the drivers of psychoactive substance use among Nepalese youth in Rupandehi district of Nepal.This study used a qualitative approach for data collection. Both in-depth interviews (IDI, seven participants) and focus group discussions (FGD, 13 participants) were conducted among study participants who self-reported as psychoactive substance users or had history of psychoactive substance use. Participants for IDI were aged between 11 and 24 years and between 18 and 35 years old for FGDs. Semi-structured interview guides were prepared separately for IDIs and FDGs. Interviews were conducted in Nepali language and were audio recorded, which were there transcribed and translated into English for coding and analyses. In addition, interviews notes were taken by two research assistants. An inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze the data.This study identified a range of drivers of psychoactive substances use among Nepalese youths. Themes included (i) socio-cultural factors, (ii) individual factors, (iii) academic environment, (iv) physical environment and the (v) influence of media. The socio-cultural factors were categorized into sub-themes of family relationships, ethnic identity and psychoactive substance use and lack of social acceptance. Individual factors included peer pressure, stress relief and coping with financial challenges. Accessibility and availability of psychoactive substances in the surrounding environment and lack of monitoring and reinforcement of rules/ law and regulations were other drivers to psychoactive substance use among this Nepalese youth cohort.Our study identified several important drivers of psychoactive substance use among youth in the Rupandehi district of Nepal. Future works are anticipated to further explore youth initiation and use of psychoactive substances and support the design of interventions that address these risk factors to reduce and prevent subsequent harms."
