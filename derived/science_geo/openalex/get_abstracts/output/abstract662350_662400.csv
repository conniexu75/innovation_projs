https://openalex.org/W3097187765,"Particle size is an essential factor when considering the fate and transport of virus-containing droplets expelled by human, because it determines the deposition pattern in the human respiratory system and the evolution of droplets by evaporation and gravitational settling. However, the evolution of virus-containing droplets and the size-dependent viral load have not been studied in detail. The lack of this information leads to uncertainties in understanding the airborne transmission of respiratory diseases, such as the COVID-19. In this study, through a set of differential equations describing the evolution of respiratory droplets and by using the SARS-CoV-2 virus as an example, we investigated the distribution of airborne virus in human expelled particles from coughing and speaking. More specifically, by calculating the vertical distances traveled by the respiratory droplets, we examined the number of viruses that can remain airborne and the size of particles carrying these airborne viruses after different elapsed times. From a single cough, a person with a high viral load in respiratory fluid (2.35 × 109 copies per ml) may generate as many as 1.23 × 105 copies of viruses that can remain airborne after 10 seconds, compared to 386 copies of a normal patient (7.00 × 106 copies per ml). Masking, however, can effectively block around 94% of the viruses that may otherwise remain airborne after 10 seconds. Our study found that no clear size boundary exists between particles that can settle and can remain airborne. The results from this study challenge the conventional understanding of disease transmission routes through airborne and droplet mechanisms. We suggest that a complete understanding of the respiratory droplet evolution is essential and needed to identify the transmission mechanisms of respiratory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3094870193,"Introduction Italy became the second epicenter of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic after China, surpassing by far China’s death toll. The disease swept through Lombardy, which remained in lockdown for about two months, starting from the 8th of March. As of that day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy were extended to the entire country. Here, assuming that effectively there was one case “zero” that introduced the virus to the region, we provide estimates for: (a) the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population until March 8; (c) the basic (R0)and the effective reproduction number (Re) based on the estimation of the actual number of infected cases. To demonstrate the efficiency of the model and approach, we also provide a tentative forecast two months ahead of time, i.e. until May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29. Methods To deal with the uncertainty in the number of the actual asymptomatic infected cases in the total population Volpert et al. (2020), we address a modified compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious Asymptomatic/ Infected Symptomatic/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the cases in the population that are asymptomatic or experience very mild symptoms and another modelling the infected cases with mild to severe symptoms. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the “effective” per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the proposed SEIIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem. Based on the computed parameters, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number R0 and the evolution of the effective reproduction number Re. To examine the efficiency of the model and approach, we ran the simulator to “forecast” the epidemic two months ahead of time, i.e. from March 8 to May 4. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, and the effects of social distancing and of the very strict measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. Results Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the expected day-zero was January 14 (min-max rage: January 5 to January 23, interquartile range: January 11 to January 18). The actual cumulative number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases, while the expected value of the basic reproduction number R0 was found to be 4.53 (min-max range: 4.40- 4.65). On May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced the effective reproduction number was found to be 0.987 (interquartiles: 0.857, 1.133). The model approximated adequately two months ahead of time the evolution of reported cases of infected until May 4, the day on which the phase I of the relaxation of measures was implemented over all of Italy. Furthermore the model predicted that until May 4, around 20% of the population in Lombardy has recovered (interquartile range: ∼10% to ∼30%)."
https://openalex.org/W3097750037,"The purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) on allied health professionals work environment, access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 testing, and mental health. A 34-question survey was developed and distributed electronically to allied health professionals through listservs of professional organizations and social media groups. A total of 921 responses from allied health professionals in a variety of work settings were analyzed. The majority of allied health professionals had access to medical-grade PPE and agreed with their clinics decisions to stay open or closed. Private practices appeared to be the most negatively impacted with regards to employment in the form of pay reductions, furloughs, lay-offs, or the requirement of using paid time off. Importantly, 86% of all respondents, irrespective of employment status, reported feeling stressed with regards to changes in their work environment and transmission of the virus. However, levels of stress were dependent upon access to PPE and mental health resources. Specifically, those with access to mental health support reported lower stress levels than those without such access. These results highlight the need for continuous monitoring of mental health for allied health professionals in order to inform clinic and hospital policies for PPE and the development of brief interventions to mitigate adverse long-term mental health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3096074513,"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (10–14 March, 2020) we conducted a survey (n = 1028) of a nationally representative sample (age, sex, and locale) in Poland. Respondents indicated how strong they thought the threat was to themselves, to Poland, and the world. They also described their emotional reactions to the pandemic, which we used to calculate three scores: Anxiety, Hopelessness, and Panic. Respondents also indicated how often they engaged in various coping behaviors and how much they supported different types of economic sacrifice. We used these responses to calculate measures that we labelled as Spread Prevention (e.g., social distancing), Self-preservation (food stockpiling), and Economic Sacrifice (e.g., fighting COVID-19 regardless of the cost). Multiple regression analyses found that perceived threat to self was the most reliable predictor (positive) of emotional reactions and of coping behaviors, and that Anxiety was the most reliable predictor (positive) of Spread prevention and Economic sacrifice. Panic predicted (positively) Self-preservation. A series of mediation analyses found that Anxiety mediated relationships between threat and coping behaviors, and that Panic mediated the relationship between perceived threats and Self-preservation. In addition, we found that scores on all measures, except Panic, increased following the announcement of the first COVID-19 related fatality in Poland, which occurred on the third (middle) day of the study. The mediational relationships we found did not vary as a function of whether the data were collected before or after this announcement. The present results suggest that emotional reactions to perceived threats can serve an instrumental function by providing the motivation to engage in coping behaviors. Such a mechanism complements much research on stress that has focused on how coping mediates threat-emotion relationships."
https://openalex.org/W3096354714,"This study investigated the adsorption capacities and photocatalytic activities of geopolymer-zeolite composite materials by incorporating different amounts of zeolite and TiO2 in a geopolymer matrix for dye removal. Geopolymers with SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 2.5 were synthesized from metakaolin. The geopolymers containing zeolite and TiO2-doped zeolite exhibited similar behavior in terms of mineral compositions, microstructures and chemical frameworks. The compressive strength of geopolymer-zeolite composite materials decreased with increasing amount of zeolite and TiO2-doped zeolite (0-40 wt%) because of the increase in the porosity of composite materials. The maximum methylene blue adsorption capacity and photocatalytic efficiency of the powdered geopolymer composites with 40 wt% TiO2-doped zeolite was 99.1% and was higher than that of the composites with 40 wt% zeolite without TiO2-doping (92.5%). In addition, the geopolymer composites with TiO2-doped zeolite exhibited excellent stability after repeated usage as photocatalysts. The adsorption capacity and photocatalytic activity of pelletized geopolymer composites decreased because of the reduction in their specific surface area."
https://openalex.org/W3097709953,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is a membrane receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), whereas transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is involved in viral attachment. Together, tissue expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 may determine infection. Sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and CKD are clinical risk factors for COVID-19 severity, but the relationships between kidney ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and these clinical variables are unknown. Accordingly, we obtained renal tubulointerstitial and glomerular microarray expression data and clinical variables from healthy living donors (HLD) and patients with CKD from the European Renal cDNA Bank. ACE2 expression was similar in the tubulointerstitium of the two groups, but greater in females than males in HLD (P = 0.005) and CKD (P < 0.0001). ACE2 expression was lower in glomeruli of CKD patients compared to HLD (P = 0.0002) and lower in males than females. TMPRSS2 expression was similar in the tubulointerstitium but lower in glomeruli of CKD patients compared to HLD (P < 0.0001). There was a strong relationship between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the glomerulus (r = 0.51, P < 0.0001). In CKD, there was a relationship between tubulointerstitial ACE2 expression and estimated glomerular filtration rate (r = 0.36, P < 0.0001) and age (r = -0.17, P = 0.03), but no relationship with BMI. There were no relationships between TMPRSS2 expression and clinical variables. Genes involved in inflammation (CCL2, IL6, and TNF) and fibrosis (COL1A1, TGFB1, and FN1) were inversely correlated with ACE2 expression. In summary, kidney expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 differs in HLD and CKD. ACE2 is related to sex and eGFR. ACE2 is also associated with expression of genes implicated in inflammation and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3095067489,"Background 
The study was conducted to investigate the effects of metformin treatment on the human gut microbiome’s taxonomic and functional profile in the Latvian population, and to evaluate the correlation of these changes with therapeutic efficacy and tolerance.


Methods 
In this longitudinal observational study, stool samples for shotgun metagenomic sequencing-based analysis were collected in two cohorts. The first cohort included 35 healthy nondiabetic individuals (metformin dose 2x850mg/day) at three time-points during metformin administration. The second cohort was composed of 50 newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients (metformin dose–determined by an endocrinologist) at two concordant times. Patients were defined as Responders if their HbA1c levels during three months of metformin therapy had decreased by ≥12.6 mmol/mol (1%), while in Non-responders HbA1c were decreased by <12.6 mmol/mol (1%).


Results 
Metformin reduced the alpha diversity of microbiota in healthy controls (p = 0.02) but not in T2D patients. At the species level, reduction in the abundance of Clostridium bartlettii and Barnesiella intestinihominis, as well as an increase in the abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis and Oscillibacter unclassified overlapped between both study groups. A large number of group-specific changes in taxonomic and functional profiles was observed. We identified an increased abundance of Prevotella copri (FDR = 0.01) in the Non-Responders subgroup, and enrichment of Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Odoribacter, and Dialister at baseline in the Responders group. Various taxonomic units were associated with the observed incidence of side effects in both cohorts.


Conclusions 
Metformin effects are different in T2D patients and healthy individuals. Therapy induced changes in the composition of gut microbiome revealed possible mediators of observed short-term therapeutic effects. The baseline composition of the gut microbiome may influence metformin therapy efficacy and tolerance in T2D patients and could be used as a powerful prediction tool."
https://openalex.org/W3096101462,"Global industries are typically dominated by a few disproportionately large and influential transnational corporations, or keystone actors. While concentration of economic production is not a new phenomenon, in an increasingly interconnected and globalized world, the scale of the impacts of keystone actors on diverse social-ecological systems continues to grow. In this article, we investigate how keystone actors in the global clothing industry engage in collaboration with a variety of other organizations to address nine interrelated biophysical and socioeconomic sustainability challenges. We expand on previous theoretical and empirical research by focusing on the larger business ecosystem in which keystone actors are embedded, and use network analysis to assess the contributions of different actor types to the architecture of the ecosystem. This systemic approach to the study of keystone actors and sustainability challenges highlights an important source of influence largely not addressed in previous research: the presence of organizations that occupy strategic positions around keystone actors. Such knowledge can help identify governance strategies for advancing industry-wide transformation towards sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W3096257470,"Objectives In this study, we aimed to study the clinical presentations, and viral clearance of SARS-COV-2 positive quarantined individuals. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Governmental- designated facility in the eastern province, Saudi Arabia. Participants 128 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 quarantined individuals who had a history of travel abroad in the last 14 days before the quarantine or were in direct contact with laboratory-confirmed cases. The study was from March 18th-till April 16th. Primary and secondary measures The clinical presentation, prevalence of asymptomatic carriers among SARS-COV-2 positive quarantined subjects, and the difference between virus clearance among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Results Sixty-nine of the 128 residents (54%) were completely asymptomatic until the end of the study. The remaining 59 residents (46%) had only mild symptoms. The most common symptom was a sudden loss of smell and taste, accounting for 47.5%. The median time to virus clearance was significantly different between the two groups. Symptomatic residents cleared the virus at a median of 17 days (95% CI, 12.4–21.6) from the first positive PCR vs. 11days (95% CI, 8.7–13.3) in the asymptomatic group (P = 0.011). False-negative test results occurred in 18.8% of the total residents and false-positive results in 3%. Conclusion The prevalence of asymptomatic carriers among quarantined travelers and those identified by contact tracing is high in our study. Therefore, testing, tracing, and isolating travelers and contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, regardless of symptoms, were very effective measures for early disease identification and containment. Loss of taste and smell were the most common presentations in our mild symptomatic residents and should be used as a screening tool for COVID-19. The persistent positive PCR beyond 14 days observed in the mild symptomatic residents despite being symptoms free, warrant further studies to determine its implications on disease spread and control."
https://openalex.org/W3096907188,"Introduction Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) currently affect over 5.7 million Americans and over 35 million people worldwide. At the same time, over 31 million older adults are physically inactive with impaired physical performance interfering with activities of daily living. Low physical activity is a risk factor for ADRD. We examined the utility of a new measure, the Quick Physical Activities Rating (QPAR) as an informant-rated instrument to quantify the dosage of physical activities in healthy controls, MCI and ADRD compared with Gold Standard assessments of objective measures of physical performance, fitness, and functionality. Methods This study analyzed 390 consecutive patient-caregiver dyads who underwent a comprehensive evaluation including the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), mood, neuropsychological testing, caregiver ratings of patient behavior and function, and a comprehensive physical performance and gait assessment. The QPAR was completed prior to the office visit and was not considered in the clinical evaluation, physical performance assessment, staging or diagnosis of the patient. Psychometric properties including item variability and distribution, floor and ceiling effects, strength of association, known-groups performance, and internal consistency were determined. Results The patients had a mean age of 75.3±9.2 years, 15.7±2.8 years of education and were 46.9% female. The patients had a mean CDR-SB of 4.8±4.7 and a mean MoCA score of 18.6±7.1 and covered a range of healthy controls (CDR 0 = 54), MCI or very mild dementia (CDR 0.5 = 161), mild dementia (CDR 1 = 92), moderate dementia (CDR 2 = 64), and severe dementia (CDR 3 = 29). The mean QPAR score was 20.2±18.9 (range 0–132) covering a wide range of physical activity. The QPAR internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) was very good at 0.747. The QPAR was correlated with measures of physical performance (dexterity, grip strength, gait, mobility), physical functionality rating scales, measures of activities of daily living and comorbidities, the UPDRS, and frailty ratings (all p < .001). The QPAR report of physical activities was able to discriminate between individuals with impaired physical functionality (32.2±23.9 vs 15.2±13.8, p < .001), falls risk (28.4±21.6 vs. 14.5±13.2, p < .001), and the presence of frailty (28.1±22.7 vs. 11.8±9.4, p < .001). The QPAR showed strong psychometric properties and excellent data quality, and worked equally well across different patient ages, sexes, informant relationships, and in individuals with and without cognitive impairment. Discussion The QPAR is a brief detection tool that captures informant reports of physical activities and differentiates individuals with normal physical functionality from those individuals with impaired physical functionality. The QPAR correlated with Gold Standard assessments of strength and sarcopenia, activities of daily living, gait and mobility, fitness, health related quality of life, frailty, global physical performance, and provided good discrimination between states of physical functionality, falls risk, and frailty. The QPAR performed well in comparison to standardized scales of objective physical performance, but in a brief fashion that could facilitate its use in clinical care and research."
https://openalex.org/W3096568172,"Introduction This retrospective study investigated the implications of changes in blood parameters and cellular immune function in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods Records were reviewed of 85 patients admitted with COVID-19 between February 4 and 16, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Results Fourteen patients died. The baseline leukocyte count, neutrophil count and hemoglobin was significantly higher in non-survivors compared with survivors, while the reverse was true of lymphocyte count, platelet, PaO2/FiO2, CD3+ count and CD4+ count. The percentage of neutrophil count > 6.3×109/L in death group was significantly higher than that in survival group, and multivariate logistic regression showed neutrophil count > 6.3×109/L was independently associated with mortality. However, there were not significant difference in IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4 and the percentage of IgE > 100 IU/ml between the death group and survival group. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the following at baseline could significantly predict mortality: leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts. Conclusions For hospitalized patients with COVID-19, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts that marked decrease suggest a poor outcome. Admission neutrophil count > 6.3 ×109/L is independently associated with mortality. At admission, leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, CD3+ and CD4+ counts should receive added attention."
https://openalex.org/W2775392773,"Oral swabs are emerging as a non-invasive sample type for diagnosing infectious diseases including Ebola, tuberculosis (TB), and COVID-19. To assure proper sample collection, sample adequacy controls (SACs) are needed that detect substances indicative of samples collected within the oral cavity. This study evaluated two candidate SACs for this purpose. One detected representative oral microbiota (Streptococcus species DNA) and the other, human cells (human mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for the two target cell types were applied to buccal swabs (representing samples collected within the oral cavity) and hand swabs (representing improperly collected samples) obtained from 51 healthy U.S. volunteers. Quantification cycle (Cq) cutoffs that maximized Youden's index were established for each assay. The streptococcal target at a Cq cutoff of ≤34.9 had 99.0% sensitivity and specificity for oral swab samples, whereas human mtDNA perfectly distinguished between hand and mouth swabs with a Cq cutoff of 31.3. The human mtDNA test was then applied to buccal, tongue, and gum swabs that had previously been collected from TB patients and controls in South Africa, along with ""air swabs"" collected as negative controls (total N = 292 swabs from 71 subjects). Of these swabs, 287/292 (98%) exhibited the expected Cq values. In a paired analysis the three oral sites yielded indistinguishable amounts of human mtDNA, however PurFlockTM swabs collected slightly more human mtDNA than did OmniSwabsTM (p = 0.012). The results indicate that quantification of human mtDNA cannot distinguish swabs collected from different sites within the mouth. However, it can reliably distinguish oral swabs from swabs that were not used orally, which makes it a useful SAC for oral swab-based diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3095132897,"Q fever is an important zoonosis, yet it is often neglected and can present large outbreaks, as observed in the Netherlands. In the past few years, cases of Q fever have been described in Brazil; however, the epidemiological situation of Q fever in ruminants, the main reservoir of the pathogen, is unknown in this country. Our study aimed to estimate the prevalence of C. burnetii in cattle sent to slaughterhouses using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). From 1515 cattle serum samples collected from nine slaughterhouses, 23.8% (360/1515) were serologically positive by IFA (cutoff titer>1:64), indicating past or recent exposure to C. burnetii infection. Among the 54 cities sampled during the study, 83.3% (45/54) had at least one seropositive animal. Subsequently, all seropositive samples were submitted to qPCR for C. burnetii DNA, and 12.2% (44/360) of the sera were qPCR positive, which indicates bacteremia and suggests active or recent infection. The results highlight the risk for abattoir workers that results from exposure to contaminated aerosols produced during slaughter procedures. Moreover, the heat maps that were construction from the positive samples demonstrate the widespread distribution of C. burnetii in the State of São Paulo, Brazil and denotes the need for surveillance and preventive measures to reduce the prevalence in cattle."

Logistic regression models assessed associations between past year alcohol use and sociodemographic characteristics, other drug use and HIV status, controlling for age, religion, education, occupation, marital status, and household socioeconomic status.Past year alcohol prevalence was 45%. Odds of drinking were significantly higher in men (versus women) and fishing communities (versus agrarian areas). Odds of drinking increased with age, previous (versus current) marriage and past year drug use. By occupation, highest odds of drinking were among fishermen and (in women) bar/restaurant workers. Alcohol-related consequences were more commonly reported by male (vs. females) drinkers, among whom up to 35% reported alcohol dependence symptoms (e.g., unsteady gait). HIV status was strongly associated with alcohol use in unadjusted but not adjusted models.Alcohol use differed by gender, community type and occupation. Being male, living in a fishing community and working as a fisherman or restaurant/bar worker (among women) were associated with higher odds of drinking. Alcohol reduction programs should be implemented in Uganda's fishing communities and among people working in high risk occupations (e.g., fishermen and restaurant/bar workers)."
https://openalex.org/W3096141873,"Background The burden of treatment can overwhelm people living with type 2 diabetes and lead to poor treatment fidelity and outcomes. Chronic care programs must consider and mitigate the burden of treatment while supporting patients in achieving their goals. Objective To explore what patients with type 2 diabetes and their health providers consider are the workload and the resources they must mobilize, i.e., their capacity, to shoulder it. Methods We conducted focus groups comprised of 30 patients and 32 clinicians from three community health centers in Chile implementing the Chronic Care Model to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic content analysis techniques illuminated by the Minimally Disruptive Medicine framework. Findings Gaining access to and working with their clinicians, implementing complex medication regimens, and changing lifestyles burdened patients. To deal with the distress of the diagnosis, difficulties achieving disease control, and fear of complications, patients drew capacity from their family (mostly men), social environment (mostly women), lay expertise, and spirituality. Clinicians found that administrative tasks, limited formulary, and protocol rigidity hindered their ability to modify care plans to reduce patient workload and support their capacity. Conclusions Chronic primary care programs burden patients living with type 2 diabetes while hindering clinicians’ ability to reduce treatment workloads or support patient capacity. A collaborative approach toward Minimally Disruptive Medicine may result in treatments that fit the lives and loves of patients and improve outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3097166831,"The present study was to investigate the dynamics of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) and hearing function, and explore whether the hearing loss is caused by EH alone and whether the hearing function can be modulated by changes in the EH. The extent of EH visualized by gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced inner ear magnetic resonance imaging, hearing thresholds and the summating potential/action potential ratio (-SP/AP ratio) of electrocochleography (ECochG) were recorded prior to and following surgery in 22 patients with intractable Meniere's disease (MD) who underwent endolymphatic duct blockage (EDB). The difference value of the hearing threshold and -SP/AP ratio was significantly positively correlated with the difference value of the endolymph to vestibule-volume ratio (EVVR) and grading of cochlear hydrops between prior to and following surgery. Among patients with a decreased EVVR, the average hearing threshold and -SP/AP ratio was significantly decreased following surgery, as compared to that prior to surgery. Six out of seven patients with a hearing improvement (≥10-dB decline) and 4/5 patients with a negative conversion of EcochG showed downgrading of their hydrops in the cochlea and/or vestibule. By contrast, among patients with an increased EVVR, the average hearing threshold and -SP/AP ratio tended to increase following EDB, as compared with that prior to surgery. One out of two patients with a hearing deterioration (≥10-dB elevation) showed upgrading of her hydrops in both cochlea and vestibule. The present results showed the downgrading of cochlear and/or vestibular hydrops accompanied by the downregulation of the hearing threshold and -SP/AP ratio of EcochG, as well as the upgrading of cochlear and/or vestibular hydrops that tended to upregulate the hearing threshold and -SP/AP ratio of EcochG; this suggested that hearing loss is likely to be caused by hydrops and that the impaired hearing function be modulated by changes in the hydrops."
https://openalex.org/W3095070300,"Background Anemia is a major global public health problem that had tremendous impacts on human health, social and economic development. African countries contribute to the highest-burden of anemia among women, particularly in adolescent females and young women. Anemia among young women remains a public health problem in most parts of Africa, including Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence and determinants of anemia among young women in Ethiopia. Methods A secondary data analysis was conducted based on the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. A total weighted sample of 5796 young women (15–24 years) was included in this study. We employed a multilevel analysis to assess factors associated with anemia since the EDHS has hierarchical nature. Deviance, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Median Odds Ratio (MOR) were used for model comparison as well as for assessing model fitness. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.20 at bivariable multilevel analysis were considered for the multivariable multilevel analysis. In the multivariable multilevel analysis variables with p-value ≤ 0.05 were declared to be a significant factor associated with anemia, and the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were reported to assess the strength and direction of the association. Results The overall prevalence of anemia among young women was 21.7% (95%CI = 20.7%, 22.8%). In the multivariable multilevel binary logistic regression analysis; being Muslim religion follower [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.31, 95%CI = 1.07, 1.70] and being protestant religion follower [AOR = 1.31; 95%CI = 1.01, 1.71], being rural dweller [AOR = 1.34; 95%CI = 1.02, 1.78], and being married [AOR = 1.46; 95%CI = 1.22, 1.74] were significantly associated with higher odds of anemia among young women. While, modern contraceptive use (AOR = 0.66; 95%CI = 0.53, 0.83) were significantly associated with lower odds of anemia among young women. Conclusion In this study, the prevalence of anemia among young women was high. Being a follower of Muslim and protestant religions, being married women, modern contraceptive use and being from the rural area were found to be significant determinants of anemia among young women. Therefore, giving special attention to these high-risk groups and distributing modern contraceptives for those in need of it could decrease this devastating public health problem in young women."
https://openalex.org/W3095513054,"Introduction Child stunting is a significant public health problem in Eswatini. It is associated with a range of child health outcomes, including morbidity, physical and cognitive growth. Objective To determine the individual, household, and community-level factors associated with child stunting in Eswatini in 2010 and 2014. Methods Using the Eswatini Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys conducted in 2010 and 2014, a secondary analysis was done of the children surveyed, aged 6–59 months. A total of 1,891 were surveyed in 2010, and 1,963 children in 2014. Univariate, bivariable analysis and multivariable multilevel logistic regression were used to establish the factors associated with stunting. Results The study found that stunting decreased significantly between 2010 and 2014, from 31.4% to 25.5% (p<0.001). In both 2010 and 2014, lower odds of stunting were observed among female children, in children born to women with tertiary education compared to those born to women with no formal education. Lower odds of stunting were observed among children from rich households compared to poorest households. In both 2010 and 2014, increased odds of stunting were observed among children aged 12–23, 24–35 and 36–47 months compared to children aged 6–11 months. At the household level, higher odds of stunting were observed among children from households with two and more children under five years of age compared to those with only one child and in 2010, among children from households with a pit latrine and no toilet facility compared to households with a flush toilet. At the community level, in 2010, higher odds of stunting were observed among children from the Shiselweni compared to those from the Lubombo region. Conclusion The findings highlight the individual, household, and community-level factors significantly associated with stunting and the changes between the two surveys."
https://openalex.org/W3097554436,"The use of antimicrobial agents in food-producing animals may lead to the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria of animal origin. The use of antimicrobial agents in pigs in 2018 in Japan was evaluated in terms of the weight of active ingredient and number of defined daily doses (DDD), using annual sales data of veterinary antimicrobials sold for use in pigs. In addition, the use of antimicrobial agents in the Japanese pig sector in 2008 to 2017 was evaluated to determine whether or not there were any differences in temporal change pattern by use of different metrics. In 2018, 447 metric tons of active ingredient, corresponding to 77,379 × 106 kg-days (Japanese DDD) and 34,903 × 106 kg-days (European DDD) were sold. The proportion of the sales amount of sulfonamides, trimethoprim and lincosamides to the total sales amount was significantly different depending on the metric used. For most antimicrobial classes, the number of Japanese DDDs was greater than the number of European DDDs. These results indicate that the DDD-based metric, which is more reflective of the selective pressure of antimicrobials, is recommended for use in monitoring the antimicrobial use in pigs in Japan. The differences in the number of Japanese DDDs and European DDDs appear to confirm the need for Japanese DDDs."
https://openalex.org/W3094806191,"Adaptive immunity is critical for controlling infections, which are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). In rats and mice, compromised peripheral adaptive immune responses, as shown by splenic atrophy and lowered frequencies of peripheral lymphocytes, were shown to result from high-level thoracic SCI. However, whether cervical SCI, which is the most common level of SCI in humans, impairs adaptive immunity remains largely unknown. In the present study, we induced cervical SCI in rats at the C7/T1 level by clip compression and looked at changes in peripheral adaptive immunity at 2-, 10- and 20-weeks post-injury. Specifically, we quantified changes in the frequencies of T- and B- lymphocytes in the blood and the mandibular and deep cervical lymph nodes, which drain the cervical spinal cord. We also assessed changes in serum IgG and IgM immunoglobulin levels, as well as spleen size. We found a significant decline in circulating T- and B- cell frequencies at 10 weeks post-SCI, which returned to normal at 20 weeks after injury. We found no effect of cervical SCI on T- and B- cell frequencies in the draining lymph nodes. Moreover, cervical SCI had no effect on net spleen size, although injured rats had a higher spleen/body weight ratio than sham controls at all time points of the study. Lastly, IgG and IgM immunoglobulin declined at 2 weeks, followed by a significant increase in IgM levels at 10 weeks of injury. These data indicate that cervical SCI causes a significant imbalance in circulating lymphocytes and immunoglobulin levels at 2 and 10 weeks. As we discuss in this article, these findings are largely in line with clinical observations, and we anticipate that this study will fuel more research on the effect of adaptive immunity on SCI recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3094991334,"Introduction We examined whether abuse in childhood and/or adolescence was associated with shorter telomere length in a pooled analysis of 3,232 participants from five diverse cohorts. We also assessed whether religion or spirituality (R/S) could buffer deleterious effects of abuse. Methods Physical and sexual abuse in childhood (age <12) and adolescence (age 12–18) was assessed using the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale and questions from a 1995 Gallup survey. We measured relative leukocyte telomere lengths (RTL) using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. We used generalized estimating equations to assess associations of physical and sexual abuse with log-transformed RTL z-scores. Analyses were conducted in each cohort, overall, and stratified by extent of religiosity or spirituality and religious coping in adulthood. We pooled study‐specific estimates using random‐effects models and assessed between-study heterogeneity. Results Compared to no abuse, severe sexual abuse was associated with lower RTL z-scores, in childhood: -15.6%, 95% CI: -25.9, -4.9; p-trend = 0.04; p-heterogeneity = 0.58 and in adolescence: -16.5%, 95% CI: -28.1, -3.0; p-trend = 0.08; p-heterogeneity = 0.68. Sexual abuse experienced in both childhood and adolescence was associated with 11.3% lower RTL z-scores after adjustment for childhood and demographic covariates (95% CI: -20.5%, -2.0%; p-trend = 0.03; p-heterogeneity = 0.62). There was no evidence of effect modification by R/S. Physical abuse was not associated with telomere length. Conclusions Sexual abuse in childhood or adolescence was associated with a marker of accelerated biological aging, decreased telomere length. The lack of moderation by R/S may be due to inability to capture the appropriate time period for those beliefs and practices."
https://openalex.org/W3094757063,"Airway clearance therapy (ACT) is considered an important approach to improve airway clearance in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Daily ACT administration requires substantial commitments of time and energy that complicate ACT and reduce its benefits. It is crucial to establish ACT as a positive routine. Music therapy (MT) is an aspect of integrative strategies to ameliorate the psycho-emotional consequences of chronic diseases, and a MT intervention could help children with CF between the ages of 2 and 17 develop a positive response. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effects of specifically composed and recorded instrumental music as an adjunct to ACT. We compared the use of specifically composed music (Treated Group, TG), music that the patient liked (Placebo Group, PG), and no music (Control Group, CG) during the usual ACT routine in children with CF aged from 2 to 17. The primary outcomes, i.e., enjoyment and perception of time, were evaluated via validated questionnaires. The secondary outcome, i.e., efficiency, was evaluated in terms of avoided healthcare resources. Enjoyment increased after the use of the specifically composed music (children +0.9 units/parents +1.7 units; p<0.05) compared to enjoyment with no music (0 units) and familiar music (+0.5 units). Perception of time was 11.1 min (±3.9) less than the actual time in the TG (p<0.05), 3.9 min (±4.2) more than the actual time in the PG and unchanged in the CG. The potential cost saving related to respiratory exacerbations was €6,704.87, while the cost increased to €33,524.35 in the CG and to €13,409.74 in the PG. In conclusion, the specifically composed, played and compiled instrumental recorded music is an effective adjunct to ACT to establish a positive response and is an efficient option in terms of avoided costs.

https://openalex.org/W3095117611,"Background In recent years, resilience has received extensive attention in psychology. The 14-Item Resilience Scale (RS-14) has been developed as a newer and shorter version of the resilience scale and has been applied in Western countries. In Eastern cultures, however, and particularly among Chinese populations, its factor structure remains unverified. The purpose of this study is to realize the first evaluation of the psychometric characteristics of the Chinese version of the RS-14 in young adults from Mainland China. Methods The resilience scale, Connor-Davidson resilience scale, general health questionnaire 12, perceived stress scale 14, general self-efficacy scale and meaning in life questionnaire were used to investigate 1010 undergraduates (321 male college students, 689 female college students, aged 17-25 years; mean age = 20.27; SD = 1.572). We evaluated the item quality, latent structure, reliability, criterion validity and differential item functioning on the gender variable. Results Through the analysis methods of exploratory and confirmatory factor-analytic, the original single-factor model has been proven to be applicable within the Chinese population. Both an adequate construct validity and an excellent degree of reliability were reflected in the data. In addition, test-retest evinced good stability. The current study interrogates associations with external criteria, as well as providing evidence in support of the RS-14. Conclusion To sum up, this study showed that the RS-14 is a reliable assessment for measuring resilience in China, and provides an alternative to the original scale."
https://openalex.org/W3095911907,"Kingella negevensis is a newly described gram-negative bacterium in the Neisseriaceae family and is closely related to Kingella kingae, an important cause of pediatric osteoarticular infections and other invasive diseases. Like K. kingae, K. negevensis can be isolated from the oropharynx of young children, although at a much lower rate. Due to the potential for misidentification as K. kingae, the burden of disease due to K. negevensis is currently unknown. Similarly, there is little known about virulence factors present in K. negevensis and how they compare to virulence factors in K. kingae. Using a variety of approaches, we show that K. negevensis produces many of the same putative virulence factors that are present in K. kingae, including a polysaccharide capsule, a secreted exopolysaccharide, a Knh-like trimeric autotransporter, and type IV pili, suggesting that K. negevensis may have significant pathogenic potential."

Although a few studies reported food and medicinal values of different animals, a comprehensive ethno-medicinal study of vertebrates in Nepal is still lacking. Thus, present study is aimed at documenting the ethno-medicinal knowledge related to vertebrate fauna among different ethnic communities in the Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape, central Nepal. Data was collected by using semi-structured questionnaires and analyzed by using Use Value (UV), Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) and Fidelity level (FL). Results showed a total of 58 (53 wild and 5 domestic) species of vertebrate animals. They were used to treat 62 types human ailments. Four animals were also used for veterinary diseases and agriculture benefits. The most widely used species was Felis chaus (UV = 0.25) with 3 use-reports by 10 informants. Cardiovascular and dental problems had the highest ICF value (0.974) with cardiovascular problems having 351 use-reports for 10 animal species and dental problems having 77 use-reports for 3 animal species. The least ICF was found in ophthalmological problems (ICF = 0.833, use reports = 7 for 2 species). We concluded that the different animals were an important part of traditional medicine for the local people living in the Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape. However, the majority of animals and most likely to be threatened due to their uses. The present documented ethnozoological knowledge can be used in conservation and management of vertebrates so that they could be protected for future generations."
https://openalex.org/W3095279475,"According to PubMed, roughly 10% of the annually added publications are describing findings from the small animal model (mice and rats), including investigations in the field of muscle physiology and training. A subset of this research requires neural stimulation with flexible adjustments of stimulation parameters, highlighting the need for reliable implantable electrical stimulators, small enough (~1 cm3), that even mice can tolerate them without impairing their movement. The MiniVStimA is a battery-powered implant for nerve stimulation with an outer diameter of 15 mm and an encapsulated volume of 1.2 cm3 in its smallest variation. It can be pre-programmed according to the experimental protocol and controlled after implantation with a magnet. It delivers constant current charge-balanced monophasic rectangular pulses up to 2 mA and 1 ms phase width (1 kΩ load). The circuitry is optimized for small volume and energy efficiency. Due to the variation of the internal oscillator (31 kHz ± 10%), calibration measures must be implemented during the manufacturing process, which can reduce the deviation of the frequency related parameters down to ± 1%. The expected lifetime of the smaller (larger) version is 100 (480) days for stimulation with 7 Hz all day and 10 (48) days for stimulation with 100 Hz. Devices with complex stimulation patterns for nerve stimulation have been successfully used in two in-vivo studies, lasting up to nine weeks. The implant worked fully self-contained while the animal stayed in its familiar environment. External components are not required during the entire time."
https://openalex.org/W3095842712,"Tumor-promoting cytokines are a cause of tumor progression; therefore, identifying key regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) for controlling their production is important. The aim of this study is to identify promising miRNAs associated with tumor-promoting cytokines in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We identified circulating miRNAs from 16 published miRNA profiles. The selected miRNAs were validated in the serum of 32 NSCLC patients and compared with 33 patients with other lung diseases and 23 healthy persons using quantitative real-time PCR. The cytokine concentration was investigated using the enzyme-linked immunoassay in the same sample set, with clinical validation of the miRNAs. The correlation between miRNA expression and cytokine concentration was evaluated by Spearman's rank correlation. For consistent direction, one up-regulated miRNA (miR-145) was found in four studies, and seven miRNAs were reported in three studies. One miRNA (miR-20a) and four miRNAs (miR-25-3p, miR-223, let-7f, and miR-20b) were reported in six and five studies. However, their expression was inconsistent. In the clinical validation, serum miR-145 was significantly down-regulated, whereas serum miR-20a was significantly up-regulated in NSCLC, compared with controls. Regarding serum cytokine, all cytokines [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)], except tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), had a higher level in NSCLC patients than controls. In addition, we found a moderate correlation between the TGF-β concentration and miR-20a (r = -0.537, p = 0.002) and miR-223 (r = 0.428, p = 0.015) and a weak correlation between the VEGF concentration with miR-20a (r = 0.376, p = 0.037) and miR-223 (r = -0.355, p = 0.046). MiR-145 and miR-20a are potential biomarkers for NSCLC. In addition, the regulation of tumor-promoting cytokine, through miR-20a and miR-223, might be a new therapeutic approach for lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3096183203,"The study aims to examine the latent structure of secondary traumatic stress (STS), its precursors, and the psychological effects of it on the population of service providers working with refugees passing through the Balkan route. A total of 270 service providers (57% female) of different professional backgrounds working directly with refugees took part in the study. Participants were assessed for STS using the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale, the extent of secondary exposure to trauma (i.e., clients’ traumatic experiences from the countries of origin and travel that were communicated to them directly), depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Comparisons of several confirmatory factor analyses following prominent PTSD conceptualizations showed that the model with three relatively distinct but highly correlated factors–intrusion, avoidance, and the blend of negative alterations in cognitions, mood, and reactivity (NACMR), had the best fit. STS has been shown to be positively correlated both with the amount of different traumatic experiences that were communicated to them as well as with the specific content of those experiences. Path analysis showed that the amount of secondary exposure to the clients’ traumatic experiences during travel, but not in the country of origin, had exclusive relationships with all three factors of STS. NACMR demonstrated direct effects on anxiety and depression symptoms, while intrusions exhibited a direct effect on anxiety-related symptomatology only. The avoidance factor did not have any independent direct effects on anxiety or depression. Finally, the effects of STS factors on quality of life were fully mediated by an increase of depression-related symptomatology. Results provide evidence on the latent structure of the STS which partially deviates from the prominent models of PTSD thus questioning the isomorphism of two constructs on the empirical level. Additionally, findings provide insights on the cascade of events that make professionals working with traumatized people especially vulnerable to STS and broader psychological distress."
https://openalex.org/W3097497670,"Recent studies of the ketogenic diet, an extremely high-fat diet with extremely low carbohydrates, suggest that it changes the energy metabolism properties of skeletal muscle. However, ketogenic diet effects on muscle metabolic characteristics are diverse and sometimes countervailing. Furthermore, ketogenic diet effects on skeletal muscle performance are unknown. After male Wistar rats (8 weeks of age) were assigned randomly to a control group (CON) and a ketogenic diet group (KD), they were fed for 4 weeks respectively with a control diet (10% fat, 10% protein, 80% carbohydrate) and a ketogenic diet (90% fat, 10% protein, 0% carbohydrate). After the 4-week feeding period, the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle was evaluated ex vivo for twitch force, tetanic force, and fatigue. We also analyzed the myosin heavy chain composition, protein expression of metabolic enzymes and regulatory factors, and citrate synthase activity. No significant difference was found between CON and KD in twitch or tetanic forces or muscle fatigue. However, the KD citrate synthase activity and the protein expression of Sema3A, citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4, and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase were significantly higher than those of CON. Moreover, a myosin heavy chain shift occurred from type IIb to IIx in KD. These results demonstrated that the 4-week ketogenic diet improves skeletal muscle aerobic capacity without obstructing muscle contractile function in sedentary male rats and suggest involvement of Sema3A in the myosin heavy chain shift of EDL muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3097629549,"Purposes Evidence suggests evening-type individuals have a higher risk of reporting psychological distress than morning-type individuals. However, less is known regarding the underlying processes that might mediate or moderate this association among Chinese rural population. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of psychological distress, investigate whether sleep quality would mediate the association between chronotype and psychological distress and explore whether age would moderate the direct or indirect effect of the mediation model. Methods The cross-sectional study utilized a sample of 884 rural residents from rural regions in Anqing City, Anhui Province, China. Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) were used to measure chronotype, sleep quality and psychological distress, respectively. MacKinnon’s four-step procedure was employed to examine the mediation effect, while Hayes PROCESS macro (model 59) was used to perform the moderated mediation analysis. Results The prevalence of psychological distress among Chinese rural population was 33.4%. The association between chronotype and psychological distress was partially mediated by sleep quality (indirect effect = - 0.05, 95% CI = [-0.08, -0.03]). In addition, age moderated the first stage (sleep quality–psychological distress) of the indirect effect, with the indirect effect being attenuated for older rural residents. As suggested by Johnson-Neyman technique, the association between sleep quality and psychological distress was only significant when the age of the participant was lower than 48.59. Conclusions The incidence of psychological distress among Chinese rural residents cannot be neglected. Interventions for the enhancement of sleep quality to prevent and reduce psychological distress should be prioritized to rural residents who are prone to eveningness, especially those who are younger."
https://openalex.org/W3095390066,"Introduction Do we always do what others do, and, if not, when and under what conditions do we do so? In this paper we test the hypothesis that mimicry is moderated by the mere knowledge of whether the source is a member of the same social category as ourselves. Methods We investigated group influence on mimicry using three tasks on a software platform which interfaces with mobile computing devices to allow the controlled study of collective behaviour in an everyday environment. Results Overall, participants (N = 965) were influenced by the movements of confederates (represented as dots on a screen) who belonged to their own category in both purposive and incidental tasks. Conclusion Our results are compatible with collective level explanations of social influence premised on shared social identification. This includes both a heuristic of unintended mimicry (the acts of group members are diagnostic of how one should act), and communication of affiliation (based on a desire to make one’s group cohesive). The results are incompatible with traditional ‘contagion’ accounts which suggest mimicry is automatic and inevitable. The results have practical implications for designing behavioural interventions which can harness the power of copying behaviour, for example in emergency evacuations."
https://openalex.org/W3095695868,"Introduction Liver fibrosis is a result of continuous damage to the liver combined with accumulation of the extracellular matrix and is characteristic of most chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Methods This study evaluated interleukin 10 (IL10) expression in the liver and plasma of 45 HCV patients and its association with the pathogenesis and progression of liver fibrosis. The expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGFB1) was also assessed. Patients were divided into three groups according to the METAVIR classification (F0-F1, F2 and F3-F4); there was also a control group (n = 8). Results In the control group, high intrahepatic IL10 mRNA expression showed a positive association with F0-F1 fibrosis, no inflammation, low concentrations of liver enzymes and a high viral load; conversely, low intrahepatic IL10 mRNA expression showed a negative association with fibrosis progression. Intrahepatic TGFB1 mRNA expression was greater in the HCV group than in the control group, and regarding different disease phases, its expression increased as fibrosis evolved to more severe forms. Conclusion Intrahepatic IL10 mRNA expression decreases with persistent fibrosis, probably due to the production of TGF-β1, a potent antimitotic and fibrogenic cytokine. IL10 restricts and decreases the immune response and limits the fibrogenic response; however, a decrease in IL10 favors persistent inflammatory infiltrate, resulting in severe fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3096247824,"The quinoa oil presents benefits to health, but its low water dispersibility in the aqueous matrix and instability of bioactive compounds is challenging for food application. This study performed the physicochemical and chemical characterization of quinoa oil and evaluated its water dispersibility and 2,2’-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activity after nanoencapsulation in porcine gelatin and combination with whey protein isolate by emulsification O/W technique. Thus, three formulations were obtained: 1) OG–containing quinoa oil and porcine gelatin in aqueous phase 2; 2) OWG1—containing quinoa oil, whey protein isolate, and porcine gelatin in aqueous phase 2; and 3) OWG2—containing quinoa oil and whey protein isolate in aqueous phase 1, and porcine gelatin in aqueous phase 2. The oil characterization showed that quinoa oil presented the predominance of linoleic acid (53.4%), and concentration of alpha and gamma-tocopherol, respectively, of 8.56 and 6.28 mg.100g-1. All formulations presented a smooth surface without depression or cracking, an average diameter between 165.77 and 529.70 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated chemical interaction between the encapsulating agents and the oil in all formulations, being more intensified in OWG1 and OWG2. Based on this, these formulations showed higher dispersibility in aqueous solution [68% (3.48) and 71% (2.97)]. This resulted in higher antioxidant activity for OWG1 and OWG2, showing the amounts that reduces antioxidant activity by 50% equal to 5.30 (0.19) mg/mL and 5.54 (0.27) mg/mL, respectively, compared to quinoa oil [13.36 (0.28) mg/mL] (p < 0.05). Thus, quinoa oil nanoencapsulation proved to be an efficient alternative to enable water-dispersibility and enhance antioxidant activity, increasing its potential for application in the food industry."
https://openalex.org/W3096284913,"In this work we propose an index to estimate the gut microbiota biodiversity using a modeling approach with the aim of describing its relationship with health and aging. The gut microbiota, a complex ecosystem that links nutrition and metabolism, has a pervasive effect on all body organs and systems, undergoes profound changes with age and life-style, and substantially contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related diseases. For these reasons, the gut microbiota is a suitable candidate for assessing and quantifying healthy aging, i.e. the capability of individuals to reach an advanced age, avoiding or postponing major age-related diseases. The importance of the gut microbiota in health and aging has been proven to be related not only to its taxonomic composition, but also to its ecological properties, namely its biodiversity. Following an ecological approach, here we intended to characterize the relationship between the gut microbiota biodiversity and healthy aging through the development a parsimonious model of gut microbiota from which biodiversity can be estimated. We analysed publicly available metagenomic data relative to subjects of different ages, countries, nutritional habits and health status and we showed that a hybrid niche-neutral model well describes the observed patterns of bacterial relative abundance. Moreover, starting from such ecological modeling, we derived an estimate of the gut microbiota biodiversity that is consistent with classical indices, while having a higher statistical power. This allowed us to unveil an increase of the gut microbiota biodiversity during aging and to provide a good predictor of health status in old age, dependent on life-style and aging disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3097424639,"The study of long-lived and regenerative animal models has revealed diverse protective responses to stressors such as aging and tissue injury. Spiny mice (Acomys) are a unique mammalian model of skin wound regeneration, but their response to other types of physiological skin damage has not been investigated. In this study, we examine how spiny mouse skin responds to acute UVB damage or chronological aging compared to non-regenerative C57Bl/6 mice (M. musculus). We find that, compared to M. musculus, the skin epidermis in A. cahirinus experiences a similar UVB-induced increase in basal cell proliferation but exhibits increased epidermal turnover. Notably, A. cahirinus uniquely form a suprabasal layer co-expressing Keratin 14 and Keratin 10 after UVB exposure concomitant with reduced epidermal inflammatory signaling and reduced markers of DNA damage. In the context of aging, old M. musculus animals exhibit typical hallmarks including epidermal thinning, increased inflammatory signaling and senescence. However, these age-related changes are absent in old A. cahirinus skin. Overall, we find that A. cahirinus have evolved novel responses to skin damage that reveals new aspects of its regenerative phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3097875364,"Background Anemia is the most important complication during major surgery and transfusion of red blood cells is the mainstay to compensate for life threating blood loss. Therefore, accurate measurement of hemoglobin (Hb) concentration should be provided in real-time. Blood Gas Analysis (BGA) provides rapid point-of-care assessment using smaller sampling tubes compared to central laboratory (CL) services. Objective This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of BGA hemoglobin testing as compared to CL services. Methods Data of the ongoing LIBERAL-Trial (Liberal transfusion strategy to prevent mortality and anemia-associated ischemic events in elderly non-cardiac surgical patients, LIBERAL) was used to assess the bias for Hb level measured by BGA devices (ABL800 Flex analyzer®, GEM series® and RapidPoint 500®) and CL as the reference method. For that, we analyzed pairs of Hb level measured by CL and BGA within two hours. Furthermore, the impact of various confounding factors including age, gender, BMI, smoker status, transfusion of RBC, intraoperative hemodilution, and co-medication was elucidated. In order to ensure adequate statistical analysis, only data of participating centers providing more than 200 Hb pairs were used. Results In total, three centers including 963 patients with 1,814 pairs of Hb measurements were analyzed. Mean bias was comparable between ABL800 Flex analyzer® and GEM series®: - 0.38 ± 0.15 g/dl whereas RapidPoint 500® showed a smaller bias (-0.09 g/dl) but greater median absolute deviation (± 0.45 g/dl). In order to avoid interference with different standard deviations caused by the different analytic devices, we focused on two centers using the same BGA technique (309 patients and 1,570 Hb pairs). A Bland-Altman analysis and LOWESS curve showed that bias decreased with smaller Hb values in absolute numbers but increased relatively. The smoker status showed the greatest reduction in bias (0.1 g/dl, p<0.001) whereas BMI (0.07 g/dl, p = 0.0178), RBC transfusion (0.06 g/dl, p<0.001), statins (0.04 g/dl, p<0.05) and beta blocker (0.03 g/dl, p = 0.02) showed a slight effect on bias. Intraoperative substitution of volume and other co-medications did not influence the bias significantly. Conclusion Many interventions like substitution of fluids, coagulating factors or RBC units rely on the accuracy of laboratory measurement devices. Although BGA Hb testing showed a consistently stable difference to CL, our data confirm that BGA devices are associated with different bias. Therefore, we suggest that hospitals assess their individual bias before implementing BGA as valid and stable supplement to CL. However, based on the finding that bias decreased with smaller Hb values, which in turn are used for transfusion decision, we expect no unnecessary or delayed RBC transfusion, and no major impact on the LIBERAL trial performance."
https://openalex.org/W3095474981,"In view of the difficulty, high cost and complex technology of pharmaceutical logistics green transformation, based on the idea of green supply chain, three different government subsidy strategies for green logistics were proposed. Firstly, by constructing a Stackelberg game model with pharmaceutical logistics provider as the leader and manufacturer as the followers, the behavior selection and optimal decisions of the participants under the anarchic subsidy strategy, the single subsidy strategy of the pharmaceutical logistics provider, the single subsidy strategy of the pharmaceutical manufacturer and the coordinated subsidy strategy are analyzed respectively. Furthermore, the effects of different subsidy strategies on the green investment and strategy selection of logistics provider and manufacturer are compared. Finally, according to the research results, the paper provides reference and suggestions for the formulation of government subsidy strategy. The results show that the three subsidy strategies have different degrees of incentive effect on the green transformation of pharmaceutical logistics, and the single logistics provider subsidy strategy is the best."
https://openalex.org/W3096373051,"Background Hyperphosphatemia and calcium load were associated with vascular calcification. The role of calcium-containing phosphate binders (CCPBs) use as important determinants of death and cardiovascular events in predialysis hyperphosphatemic chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients remain unclear due to the absence of evidence for reduced mortality with CCPB use compared with placebo. We aimed to investigate the effect of using CCPBs or nonuse in all-cause mortality rates and cardiovascular events in CKD stage 5 patients between 2000 and 2005 in the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database. Methods Patients with known coronary heart disease and those who had undergone dialysis or renal transplantation were excluded. The CCPB users were matched with nonusers by the propensity score model. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. Results During a mean follow-up of 4.58 years, 879 CCPB users were matched with 3516 nonusers. CCPB use was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.583, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.393–1.799]. The increased cardiovascular risk was dose-dependent and consistent across all subgroup analyses. Compared with no use, CCPB use was associated with no significant all-cause mortality risk (1.74 vs. 1.75 events per 100 person-years, adjusted HR 0.964, 95% CI 0.692–1.310). Conclusions CCPB use in CKD stage 5 patients was associated with a significantly increased cardiovascular event risk compared with the nonusers, whereas the all-cause mortality risk was similar between the two groups. Whether these relationships are causal require further randomized controlled trials."

https://openalex.org/W3097033019,"Background Sedentary behavior is a worldwide public health concern. There is consistent and growing evidence linking sedentary behavior to mortality and morbidity. Early monitoring and assessment of environmental factors associated with sedentary behaviors at a young age are important initial steps for understanding children’s sedentary time and identifying pertinent interventions. Objective This study examines the association between daily temperature (maximum, mean, minimum, and diurnal variation) and all-day sedentary time among 4–6 year old children in Mexico City (n = 559) from the year 2013 to 2015. Methods We developed a spatiotemporally resolved hybrid satellite-based land use regression temperature model and calculated percent daily sedentary time from aggregating 10-second epoch vertical counts captured by accelerometers that participants wore for one week. We modeled generalized additive models (GAMs), one for each temperature type as a covariate (maximum, mean, minimum, and diurnal variation). All GAMs included percent all-day sedentary time as the outcome and participant-level random intercepts to account for repeated measures of sedentary time. Our models were adjusted for demographic factors and environmental exposures. Results Daily maximum temperature, mean temperature, and diurnal variation have significant negative linear relationships with all-day sedentary time (p<0.01). There is no significant association between daily minimum temperature and all-day sedentary time. Children have on average 0.26% less daily sedentary time (approximately 2.2 minutes) for each 1°C increase in ambient maximum temperature (range 7.1–30.2°C), 0.27% less daily sedentary time (approximately 2.3 minutes) for each 1°C increase in ambient mean temperature (range 4.3–22.2°C), and 0.23% less daily sedentary time (approximately 2.0 minutes) for each 1°C increase in diurnal variation (range 3.0–21.6°C). Conclusions These results are contrary to our hypothesis in which we expected a curvilinear relationship between temperature (maximum, mean, minimum, and diurnal variation) and sedentary time. Our findings suggest that temperature is an important environmental factor that influences children’s sedentary behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3097407458,"Background The majority of HIV infection among children occurs through mother-to-child transmission. HIV exposed infants are recommended to have virological testing at birth or 4-6 weeks of age but challenges with centralized laboratory-based testing in Myanmar result in low testing rates and delays in result communication and treatment initiation. Decentralized point-of-care (POC) testing when integrated in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services, can be an alternative to increase coverage of early infant diagnosis (EID) and timely engagement in HIV treatment and care. Aim This paper aims to explore experiences of caregivers of HIV-exposed infants enrolled in the PMTCT program in Myanmar and the perceived acceptability of point-of-care EID testing compared to conventional centralised laboratory-based testing. Methods This is a sub-study of the cluster randomised controlled stepped-wedge trial (Trial registration number: ACTRN12616000734460) that assessed the impact of near POC EID testing using Xpert HIV-1 Qual assay in four public hospitals in Myanmar. Caregivers of infants who were enrolled in the intervention phase of the main study, had been tested with both Xpert and standard of care tests and had received the results were eligible for this qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 caregivers. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated into English. Thematic data analysis was undertaken using NVivo 12 Software (QSR International). Results The majority of caregivers were satisfied with the quality of care provided by PMTCT services. However, they encountered social and financial access barriers to attend the PMTCT clinic regularly. Mothers had concerns about community stigma from the disclosure of their HIV status and the potential consequences for their infants. While medical care at the PMTCT clinics was free, caregivers sometimes experienced financial difficulties associated with out-of-pocket expenses for childbirth and transportation. Some caregivers had to choose not to attend work (impacting their income) or the adult antiretroviral clinic in order to attend the paediatric PMTCT clinic appointment. The acceptability of the Xpert testing process was high among the caregiver participants and more than half received the Xpert result on the same day as testing. Short turnaround time of the near POC EID testing enabled the caregivers to find out their infants' HIV status quicker, thereby shortening the stressful waiting time for results. Conclusion Our study identified important access challenges facing caregivers of HIV exposed infants and high acceptability of near POC EID testing. Improving the retention rate in the PMTCT and EID programs necessitates careful attention of program managers and policy makers to these challenges, and POC EID represents a potential solution."
https://openalex.org/W3094889035,"Mycoplasma synoviae infection occurs worldwide, leading to considerable economic losses in the chicken and turkey industry due to infectious synovitis, respiratory diseases and eggshell apex abnormalities. Control programs against M. synoviae infection are based on eradication, vaccination and medication with antimicrobial agents. Prudent use of antibiotics can be improved greatly by the determination of antibiotic susceptibility prior to the treatment. However, the conventional broth or agar microdilution is very labor-intensive and time-consuming method. Thus, there is an increasing need for rapid antimicrobial susceptibility tests in order to guide antibiotic therapy more effectively. The aim of this study was to develop mismatch amplification mutation assays (MAMAs) to detect resistance-associated mutations in M. synoviae. M. synoviae strains with previously determined minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and whole genomes (n = 92) were used for target selection and assay specification. For the evaluation of the developed assays, 20 clinical samples and an additional 20 M. synoviae isolates derived from these specimens were also included in this study. MIC values of these 20 isolates were determined by broth microdilution method. Five MAMAs were designed to identify elevated MICs of fluoroquinolones, while three MAMAs were developed to detect decreased susceptibility to macrolides and lincomycin. The sensitivity of the MAMA tests varied between 102−104 template copy number/reaction depending on the assay. Clinical samples showed identical genotype calls with the M. synoviae isolates derived from the corresponding specimens in each case. Supporting the results of conventional in vitro sensitivity tests, our approach provides a feasible tool for diagnostics. Rapidity, robustness and cost-effectiveness are powerful advantages of the developed assays. Supporting prudent antibiotic usage instead of empirical treatment, the use of this method can reduce significantly the economic impact of M. synoviae in the poultry industry and decrease bacterial resistance-related public health concerns."
https://openalex.org/W3095390504,"BACKGROUND Young person's susceptibility to sexually transmitted infection has been consistently linked to intractable work places. In Ethiopia, different behavior related interventions had carried out to raise awareness of risky sexual behaviors and their consequences. However, there is still limited information on risky sexual practices. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted among the big construction site daily laborers from April 1, 2019 to May 30, 2019. A pre-tested questionnaire was used for data collection, and data were entered into Epidata and transported to SPSS for analysis. Independent variables with p < 0.05 in the multivariate analysis were considered to have a statistically significant association with risky sexual practice. RESULT Among 627 sample respondents, the magnitude of risky sexual practice was found to be 24.2%. Labor workers who had a history of an STIs (AOR = 4.29; 95% CI: 2.56, 7.19), those who enjoy in the nightclubs (AOR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.34, 4.08), those who started sex by peer pressure (AOR = 3.42; 95% CI: 2.06, 5.68), substance users (AOR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.82), those who were unable to read and write (AOR = 3.65; 95% CI: 1.41, 9.67), living independently (AOR = 3.71; 95% CI: 1.78, 7.77) and living with relatives (AOR = 3.12; 95% CI: 1.06, 9.20) were statistically associated with risky sexual practice. CONCLUSION The magnitude of risky sexual practice among big constriction daily laborers was high in Bahir Dar City likely to increase their vulnerability to HIV. The findings of this study show the need of targeted HIV prevention plan to give due attention for daily laborers who had a history of an STI, enjoy in the night clubs, peer pressure, substance users, educational status and living arrangement. The Amhara Education Bureau and the city education department have to design ways to deliver at least a high school education."
https://openalex.org/W3096266127,"β-Lactam antibiotic detection has significant implications in food safety control, environmental monitoring and pharmacokinetics study. Here, we report the development of two BADAN-conjugated β-lactamases, E166Cb and E166Cb/N170Q, as sensitive biosensors for β-lactam antibiotic detection. These biosensors were constructed by coupling an environment-sensitive BADAN probe onto location 166 at the active site of the PenP β-lactamase E166C and E166C/N170Q mutants. They gave fluorescence turn-on signals in response to β-lactam antibiotics. Molecular dynamics simulation of E166Cb suggested that the turn-on signal might be attributed to a polarity change of the microenvironment of BADAN and the removal of the fluorescence quenching effect on BADAN exerted by a nearby Tyr-105 upon the antibiotic binding. In the detection of four β-lactams (penicillin G, penicillin V, cefotaxime and moxalactam), both E166Cb and E166Cb/N170Q delivered signal outputs in an antibiotic-concentration dependent manner with a dynamic range spanning from 10 nM to 1 μM. Compared to E166Cb, E166Cb/N170Q generally exhibited more stable signals owing to its higher deficiency in hydrolyzing the antibiotic analyte. The overall biosensor performance of E166Cb and E166Cb/N170Q was comparable to that of their respective fluorescein-modified counterparts, E166Cf and E166Cf/N170Q. But comparatively, the BADAN-conjugated enzymes showed a higher sensitivity, displayed a faster response in detecting moxalactam and a more stable fluorescence signals towards penicillin G. This study illustrates the potential of BADAN-conjugated β-lactamases as biosensing devices for β-lactam antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3097033970,"The dive start is an important component of competitive swimming, especially at shorter race distances. Previous research has suggested that start performance depends on kinematic variables pertaining to the swimmer at water entry, notably the distance from the block, the horizontal velocity of the centre of mass and the angle between body and water surface. However, the combined and relative contributions of these variables to start performance remain to be determined. The aim of the present study was therefore to develop a model to predict start performance (time from take-off to reaching the 15-m line) from a set of kinematic variables that collectively define the swimmer’s entry state. To obtain an appropriate database for this purpose, fifteen well-trained, (sub-)elite swimmers performed dive starts under different instructions intended to induce substantial variation in entry state. Kinematic data were extracted from video recordings of these starts, optimised and analysed statistically. A mixed effects analysis of the relation between entry state and start performance was conducted, which revealed a significant and robust dependence of start performance on entry state (χ2(3) = 88, p < .001), explaining 86.1% of the variance. Start time was reduced by 0.6 s (p < .001) when the horizontal displacement at water entry was 1 m further, by 0.3 s (p < .001) when the horizontal velocity of the centre of mass was 1 m/s higher, and by 0.5 s (p < .01) when the entry angle was 1 radian flatter. The robustness of the analysis was confirmed by a similar mixed effects analysis of the relation between entry state and time to the 5-m line. In conclusion, dive start performance can be predicted to a considerable extent from the swimmer’s state at water entry. The implications of those findings for studying and improving block phase kinetics are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3097786581,"Koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) is a highly infectious disease leading to outbreaks and mass mortality in captive and free-ranging common carp and koi carp. Outbreaks may result in high morbidity and mortality which can have a severe economic impact along the supply chain. Currently, control and prevention of KHVD relies on avoiding exposure to the virus based on efficient hygiene and biosecurity measures. An early diagnosis of the disease is crucial to prevent its spread and to minimize economic losses. Therefore, an easy-to-handle, sensitive, specific and reliable test prototype for a point-of-care detection of KHV was developed and evaluated in this study. We used a multiplex-endpoint-PCR followed by a specific probe hybridization step. PCR-products/hybridization-products were visualized with a simple and universal lateral flow immunoassay (PCR-LFA). Fifty-four gill tissue samples (KHV-positive n = 33, KHV-negative n = 21) and 46 kidney samples (KHV-positive n = 24, KHV-negative n = 22) were used to determine diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the PCR-LFA. In addition, the usability of PCR-LFA to detect CyHV-3-DNA in gill swabs taken from 20 perished common carp during a KHVD-outbreak in a commercial carp stock was examined. This assay gave test results within approximately 60 min. It revealed a detection limit of 9 KHV gene copies/μl (95% probability), a diagnostic specificity of 100%, and diagnostic sensitivity of 94.81% if samples were tested in a single test run only. PCR inhibition was noticed when examining gill swab samples without preceding extraction of DNA or sample dilution. Test sensitivity coud be enhanced by examining samples in five replicates. Overall, our PCR-LFA proved to be a specific, easy-to-use and time-saving point-of-care-compatible test for the detection of KHV-DNA. Regarding gill swab samples, further test series using a higher number of clinical samples should be analyzed to confirm the number of replicates and the sample processing necessary to reveal a 100% diagnostic sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2980055856,"Stochastic models in which agents interact with their neighborhood according to a network topology are a powerful modeling framework to study the emergence of complex dynamic patterns in real-world systems. Stochastic simulations are often the preferred - sometimes the only feasible - way to investigate such systems. Previous research focused primarily on Markovian models where the random time until an interaction happens follows an exponential distribution. In this work, we study a general framework to model systems where each agent is in one of several states. Agents can change their state at random, influenced by their complete neighborhood, while the time to the next event can follow an arbitrary probability distribution. Classically, these simulations are hindered by high computational costs of updating the rates of interconnected agents and sampling the random residence times from arbitrary distributions. We propose a rejection-based, event-driven simulation algorithm to overcome these limitations. Our method over-approximates the instantaneous rates corresponding to inter-event times while rejection events counterbalance these over-approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on models of epidemic and information spreading."
https://openalex.org/W3095078111,"The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the light-induced pupillary and lacrimation responses mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in migraine. Ten participants with episodic migraine and normal tear production, as well as eleven visually normal controls participated in this study. Following an initial baseline trial (no light flash), participants received seven incremental and alternating red and blue light flashes. Pupillometry recording of the left eye and a 1-min anesthetized Schirmer's test of the right eye (using 0.5% proparacaine) were performed simultaneously. Intrinsic and extrinsic ipRGC photoactivities did not differ between migraine participants and controls across all intensities and wavelengths. Migraine participants, however, had significantly lower lacrimation than controls following the highest blue intensity. A positive correlation was found between melanopsin-driven post-illumination pupillary responses and lacrimation following blue stimulation in both groups. Our results show that participants with self-reported photophobia have normal ipRGC-driven responses, suggesting that photophobia and pupillary function may be mediated by distinct ipRGC circuits. The positive correlation between melanopsin-driven pupillary responses and light-induced lacrimation suggests the afferent arm of the light-induced lacrimation reflex is melanopsin-mediated and functions normally in migraine. Lastly, the reduced melanopsin-mediated lacrimation at the highest stimulus suggests the efferent arm of the lacrimation reflex is attenuated under certain conditions, which may be a harbinger of dry eye in migraine."
https://openalex.org/W3097920179,"In this study, we present a novel strategy to the method of finite elements (FEM) of linear elastic problems of very high resolution on graphic processing units (GPU). The approach exploits regularities in the system matrix that occur in regular hexahedral grids to achieve cache-friendly matrix-free FEM. The node-by-node method lies in the class of block-iterative Gauss-Seidel multigrid solvers. Our method significantly improves convergence times in cases where an ordered distribution of distinct materials is present in the dataset. The method was evaluated on three real world datasets: An aluminum-silicon (AlSi) alloy and a dual phase steel material sample, both captured by scanning electron tomography, and a clinical computed tomography (CT) scan of a tibia. The caching scheme leads to a speed-up factor of ×2-×4 compared to the same code without the caching scheme. Additionally, it facilitates the computation of high-resolution problems that cannot be computed otherwise due to memory consumption."
