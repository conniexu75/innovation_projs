https://openalex.org/W2097040991,"The laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) is an indispensable tool in experimental medicine and drug development, having made inestimable contributions to human health. We report here the genome sequence of the Brown Norway (BN) rat strain. The sequence represents a high-quality ‘draft’ covering over 90% of the genome. The BN rat sequence is the third complete mammalian genome to be deciphered, and three-way comparisons with the human and mouse genomes resolve details of mammalian evolution. This first comprehensive analysis includes genes and proteins and their relation to human disease, repeated sequences, comparative genome-wide studies of mammalian orthologous chromosomal regions and rearrangement breakpoints, reconstruction of ancestral karyotypes and the events leading to existing species, rates of variation, and lineage-specific and lineage-independent evolutionary events such as expansion of gene families, orthology relations and protein evolution."

Here we show that there is a strong association in Han Chinese between a genetic marker, the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*1502, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome induced by carbamazepine, a drug commonly prescribed for the treatment of seizures. It should be possible to exploit this association in a highly reliable test to predict severe adverse reaction, as well as for investigation of the pathogenesis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome."

Electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and field-dependent resistance measurements show that boron-doped diamond is a bulk, type-II superconductor below the superconducting transition temperature Tc=4 K; superconductivity survives in a magnetic field up to Hc2(0)=3.5 T. The discovery of superconductivity in diamond-structured carbon suggests that Si and Ge, which also form in the diamond structure, may similarly exhibit superconductivity under the appropriate conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2062768506,"Here we report the identification of small molecules that specifically inhibit protein arginine N-methyltransferase (PRMT) activity. PRMTs are a family of proteins that either monomethylate or dimethylate the guanidino nitrogen atoms of arginine side chains. This common post-translational modification is implicated in protein trafficking, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation. Most methyltransferases use the methyl donor, S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), as a cofactor. Current methyltransferase inhibitors display limited specificity, indiscriminately targeting all enzymes that use AdoMet. In this screen we have identified a primary compound, AMI-1, that specifically inhibits arginine, but not lysine, methyltransferase activity in vitro and does not compete for the AdoMet binding site. Furthermore, AMI-1 prevents in vivo arginine methylation of cellular proteins and can modulate nuclear receptor-regulated transcription from estrogen and androgen response elements, thus operating as a brake on certain hormone actions.

Silver P.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 5-8Google Scholar). The methylation of arginine residues is catalyzed by Type I enzymes that facilitate the formation of asymmetric ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine (aDMA) residues, and by Type II enzymes that generate symmetric ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine (sDMA) residues (2Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Google Scholar). The cloning of the yeast Type I arginine methyltransferase enzyme (3Gary J.D. Lin W.J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Google Scholar), Hmt1p (also known as Rmt1p), provided the molecular framework for the identification of six homologues in mammals (PRMT1–6). Currently, known mammalian Type I enzymes include PRMT1 (5Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Lalioti M.D. Rossier C. Silver P.A. Henry M.F. Genomics. 1998; 48: 330-340Google Scholar, 6Lin W.J. Gary J.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Google Scholar), the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase PRMT4/CARM1 (8Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Google Scholar), and the nuclear enzyme PRMT6 (9Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Google Scholar). The only mammalian Type II PRMT identified to date is the Janus kinase-binding protein Janus kinase-binding protein 1/PRMT5 (10Branscombe T.L. Frankel A. Lee J.H. Cook J.R. Yang Z. Pestka S.

Activity for the SH3 domain-containing arginine methyltransferase, PRMT2, has yet to be clearly demonstrated. PRMTs target a wide array of different proteins for posttranslational modification. The majority of aDMA residues occur within glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) domains (12Rawal N. Rajpurohit R. Lischwe M.A. Williams K.R. Paik W.K. Kim S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 11-18Google Scholar). Proteins with methylated GAR domains include Sam68, hnRNP K, hnRNP U, ILF3, FUS, and PABPN1 (13Bedford M.T. Frankel A. Yaffe M.B. Clarke S. Leder P. Richard S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16030-16036Google Scholar, 14Cote J. Boisvert F.M. Boulanger M.C. Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 274-287Google Scholar, 15Smith J.J. Rucknagel K.P.

PRMT4/CARM1 displays more specificity than other Type 1 enzymes and does not methylate GAR domains. PRMT4 substrates include CBP/p300, PABP1, TARPP, histone H3, and HuR (8Chen D. Ma H. Hong H.

Bedford M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6464-6468Google Scholar). Known substrates that contain sDMA (Type II PRMT targets) are myelin basic protein (21Baldwin G.S. Carnegie P.R. Science. 1971; 171: 579-581Google Scholar) and Sm ribonucleoproteins D1 and D3 (10Branscombe T.L. Frankel A. Lee J.H. Cook J.R. Yang Z. Pestka S. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32971-32976Google Scholar, 22Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Google Scholar, 23Brahms H. Raymackers J. Union A. de Keyser F. Meheus L. Luhrmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17122-17129Google Scholar). Work in yeast unveiled the first identified biological role of arginine methylation: nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling of the hnRNP protein Npl3p requires Hmt1p activity (24Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that protein-protein interactions are regulated by arginine methylation. The asymmetric dimethylation of arginine residues flanking proline-rich motifs can inhibit the binding of SH3 domains in vitro but does not interfere with the binding of the WW domains (a domain with two conserved tryptophans that binds proline-rich sequences) to the same motif (13Bedford M.T. Frankel A. Yaffe M.B. Clarke S. Leder P. Richard S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16030-16036Google Scholar). An opposite effect is seen with interactions between the survival of motor neurons protein (SMN) and the snRNP proteins SmD1 and SmD3, where symmetrical arginine dimethylation of the snRNP proteins enhances their binding to the Tudor domain of SMN (22Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Google Scholar). Apart from regulating protein-protein interactions and protein trafficking, arginine methylation has also been implicated in the regulation of transcription. This became evident with the finding that the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase (PRMT4) binds the p160 family of nuclear hormone receptor coactivators. The presence of PRMT4 enhances transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors, possibly as a result of the specific methylation of histone H3 by PRMT4 (8Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Google Scholar). PRMT1, like PRMT4, can also bind p160, and these two PRMTs have been shown to act in a synergistic manner to enhance reporter gene activation by nuclear receptors (25Koh S.S. Chen D. Lee Y.H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1089-1098Google Scholar). The arginine methylation of histone H4 by PRMT1 facilitates the subsequent acetylation of H4 tails by p300 (26Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Google Scholar). In addition, PRMT4 can regulate the activity of p300/CBP (17Xu W. Chen H. Du K. Asahara H. Tini M. Emerson B.M. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2507-2511Google Scholar, 18Chevillard-Briet M. Trouche D. Vandel L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5457-5466Google Scholar). Thus, lysine acetylation and arginine methylation work together to enhance nuclear receptor-regulated transcription. Further attempts to elucidate the biological roles of arginine methylation have included the targeted disruption of the Prmt1 and Prmt4 genes in mice (20Yadav N. Lee J. Kim J. Shen J. Hu M.C. Aldaz C.M. Bedford M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6464-6468Google Scholar, 27Pawlak M.R. Scherer C.A. Chen J. Roshon M.J. Ruley H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4859-4869Google Scholar) and the use of broad-spectrum inhibitors of methylation. Studies involving small molecule inhibitors have revealed that a loss of methylation can change the subcellular localization of methylated proteins (28Nichols R.C. Wang X.W. Tang J. Hamilton B.J. High F.A. Herschman H.R. Rigby W.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 522-532Google Scholar, 29Pintucci G. Quarto N. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1249-1258Google Scholar), prevent nerve growth factor-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (30Cimato T.R. Ettinger M.J. Zhou X. Aletta J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1089-1103Google Scholar, 31Kujubu D.A. Stimmel J.B. Law R.E. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 58-65Google Scholar, 32Najbauer J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12717-12721Google Scholar), and inhibit the membrane ruffling seen within seconds after nerve growth factor is added to PC12 cells (33Seeley P.J. Rukenstein A. Connolly J.L. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 417-426Google Scholar). However, interpretation of these findings is impaired by the global nature of methylation inhibition, which makes it difficult to assign specific cellular functions to a distinct methylation event. The compounds used in these studies are of two types: first, small molecules that inhibit S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase, like adenosine dialdehyde (AdOx), result in a marked intracellular accumulation of AdoHcy. Most methylation reactions are affected through feedback inhibition by elevated levels of AdoHcy. Second, analogues of AdoMet like sinefungin and methylthioadenosine also function as inhibitors of methylation. The inhibition of AdoHcy hydrolase by small molecules and the use of AdoMet analogues can affect cellular methylation of phospholipids, proteins, DNA, and RNA. Recently, analogues of AdoMet were used to selectively inhibit a mutant form of the yeast protein methyltransferase, Hmt1p, using a “bump-and-hole” approach (34Lin Q. Jiang F. Schultz P.G. Gray N.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11608-11613Google Scholar). To date, no specific chemical modulators of endogenous protein methyltransferases or of specific arginine methyltransferases have been identified. Here we identify such molecules that will help elucidate the biological role of arginine methylation and perhaps serve as lead compounds for future drug development. Antibodies and Plasmids—The αGFP antibody was purchased (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The characterization of the 1E4 monoclonal antibody has been described previously (35Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13641-13646Google Scholar). The αSam68 and αPRMT1 antibodies were a gift from Stéphane Richard. All GST fusion proteins were subcloned in pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences), which allows for the induced production of recombinant proteins fused to the C-terminal end of glutathione S-transferase. GST-PABP1 (16Lee J. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 268-273Google Scholar) and GST-SmB′ (36Bedford M.T. Reed R. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Google Scholar) have been described. GST-PRMT1, GST-PRMT3, GST-PRMT4, and GST-PRMT6 have been described previously (9Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Google Scholar). GST-Suv39H1 and GST-Suv39H2 were a gift from Thomas Jenuwein and were described previously (37O'Carroll D. Scherthan H. Peters A.H. Opravil S. Haynes A.R. Laible G. Rea S. Schmid M. Lebersorger A. Jerratsch M. Sattler L. Mattei M.G. Denny P. Brown S.D. Schweizer D. Jenuwein T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9423-9433Google Scholar). GST-SET7 and GST-DOT1 were gifts from Yi Zhang (38Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Borchers C. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1207-1217Google Scholar). GST-Npl3 and GST-Hmt1p were a gift from Pam Silver and have been described previously (39Weiss V.H. McBride A.E. Soriano M.A. Filman D.J. Silver P.A. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1165-1171Google Scholar). For the GFP-Npl3 fusion construct, full-length Npl3 from pGEX-Npl3 was amplified by PCR primer 1 (5′-GTGGGATCCCACCATGTCTGAAGCTCAAGA-3′) and primer 2 (5′-AGAGGATCCAACCTGGTTGGTGATCTTTCACG-3′). The 5′ primer introduced a mammalian “Kozak” sequence (CACC) just upstream to the initiator ATG. The fragments were subcloned in pd2EGFP-N1 (Clontech) to generate a N-terminal fusion of Npl3. Histones H3 and H4 (calf thymus) were purchase from Roche Applied Science. Compound Screening—The 1E4 antibody was used to establish an ELISA-based high throughput screen for small molecule inhibitors of arginine methylation. We used a 384-well white high binding plates (Costar) coated with 100 ng of GST-Npl3 (the substrate). The plates were blocked with 5% BSA and incubated with GST-Hmt1p (500 ng of enzyme). Small molecules were then robotically transferred to individual wells to a final concentration of 10–15 μm. Finally, the enzyme reaction was initiated by the addition of the methyl donor, AdoMet (10 μm). The reaction was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed twice with TBST (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and blocked in TBST containing 2% BSA for 30 min. A mix of methyl-specific primary antibody (1E4 at 1:1000) and secondary antibody (αmouse-peroxidase at 1:10000) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for an additional hour. The wells were then washed three times with TBST and subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence. The chemiluminescent signal from each plate was detected by autoradiography and a Wallac multilabel counter. 9000 individual compounds from a diverse collection of synthetic chemicals (DIVETSet from Chembridge, San Diego, CA) were screened. This screen was performed in duplicate, and potential “hits” were those compounds that displayed at least a 60% reduction (in duplicate) in chemiluminescent signal as assayed by a Wallac multilabel counter. The compounds were solubilized in Me2SO to generate stock solutions. The molecular mass of AMI-1 (the primary compound) and AMI-5 were confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis, thus establishing that the structures are correct. Colorimetric Assay to Establish IC50 Values—A colorimetric assay was established to determine the IC50 of compounds. Briefly, 500 ng of GST-Npl3 in 50 μl of TBS was added to each well of an EIA/RIA 96-well plate (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). After incubation at 4 °C overnight, the plate was rinsed with TBST and once with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0). The compounds were added to the GST-Npl3-coated plates. After a 15-min incubation, 200 ng of PRMT1 or Hmt1p and 1 μl of AdoMet (from a 5 mm stock) were added into each well in a final volume of 50 μl of 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The plate was washed with TBST and then blocked with 5% BSA in TBST buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Anti-Npl3 antibody 1E4 (1:5,000) was then added to each well and shaken for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were washed with TBST. Secondary antibody (αmouse-peroxidase at 1:10,000) was then added to each well, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were again rinsed with TBST. The peroxidase substrate solution, ABTS, was added to each well, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h. The absorbance was measured at 415 nm with a plate reader (Bio-Rad). IC50 for compounds was calculated by linear regression analysis of percentage inhibition. In Vitro Methylation Assay—All methylation reactions were carried out in the presence of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]AdoMet, 79 Ci/mmol from a 12.6 μm stock solution in dilute HCl/ethanol 9:1, pH 2.0–2.5, Amersham Biosciences) and PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). The reactions were performed in a 30-μl volume in the presence of 5 μg of the small molecule inhibitors, this translates into the following concentration of each compound: AMI-1, 303 μm; AMI-2, 642 μm; AMI-3, 690 μm; AMI-4, 520 μm; AMI-5, 257 μm; AMI-6, 336 μm; AMI-7, 265 μm; AMI-8, 247 μm; AMI-9, 325 μm; AMA-1, 439 μm; AMA-2, 503 μm; and sinefungin, 437 μm. Additional information pertaining to individual reaction conditions is described in each of the figure legends. The samples were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, sprayed with Enhance™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), and exposed to film overnight. Band intensities were calculated using a Kodak Image Station 440 and 1D Image Analysis Software (Eastman Kodak Co.). In Vivo Methylation Assay—HeLa cells were labeled using a previously described in vivo methylation assay (40Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in a “mild” buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and immunoprecipitations were performed with αSam68 antibodies. Samples were then subjected to fluorography. Luciferase Assays and Transient MCF7 Transfections—ERE-TK-firefly has a single vitellogenin estrogen response element containing a basal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter linked to firefly luciferase (41Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Google Scholar). ARE-firefly and AR were a gift from Mickey Hu (42Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845Google Scholar). phRL-CMV has humanized Renilla luciferase driven by CMV promoter (Promega, Madison, WI). MCF7s were maintained in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum. Approximately 20 h before transfection, 40,000 cells were seeded into each well of 12-well culture dishes. The cells in each well were transfected with FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each transfection, 5 ng of phRL-CMV and 295 ng of ERE-TK-Luc were used for estrogen response and 5 ng of phRL-CMV, 148 ng of AR, and 148 ng of ARE were used for androgen response. After 4 h of transfection, cells were treated with either 10 nm estradiol (Sigma) or 10 nm R1881 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the indicated amounts of AMI-1. The indicated amounts of GFP-PRMT1 and pCAGGS-CARM1 were used for the rescue experiments. In all cases DNA in each well was adjusted to 500 ng with Bluescript plasmid. The reporter was constitutively active under these conditions. After 42–44 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested to perform luciferase assay using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Photoaffinity Competition Labeling of Methyltransferase Enzymes—UV cross-linking of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine to Hmt1p was performed as previously described (43Hurst J.H. Billingsley M.L. Lovenberg W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 499-508Google Scholar, 44Wenzel C. Moulard M. Lobner-Olesen A. Guschlbauer W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 147-151Google Scholar). A CL-1000 UV cross-linker was used (UVP, Upland, CA). GST-Hmt1p (10 μg) without any competitor or with 200 μm sinefungin, 200 μm AdOx, 200 μm AMI-1, and AMI-5, respectively, was exposed to UV light (254 nm) at a distance of 1 cm for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of 3.2 μm [3H]AdoMet (79 Ci/mmol, from a 12.6 μm stock solution in dilute HCl/ethanol 9:1, pH 2.0–2.5, Amersham Biosciences) and 5 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 50 μl of PBS. After UV cross-linking, samples were run on SDS-PAGE and subjected to fluorography. Chemical Screening for Arginine Methyltransferase Inhibitors—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA-binding protein, Npl3p, is arginine-methylated in vivo (35Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13641-13646Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody, 1E4, was raised against Npl3p (45Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Paddy M.R. Swedlow J.R. Swanson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1173-1184Google Scholar), and it was later found that the epitope recognized by 1E4 is generated by an arginine methylation event (35Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13641-13646Google Scholar). The 1E4 antibody does not recognize bacterial recombinant Npl3p. However, recombinant Npl3p that is methylated in vitro either with the yeast (Hmt1p) or the human (PRMT1) recombinant arginine methyltransferases generates the 1E4-binding epitope (Fig. 1A). These properties make the 1E4 antibody superlative for use in a small molecule screen for inhibitors of this post-translational modification. Using the 1E4 antibody, we established an ELISA-based method that was suitable for a high throughput small molecule screen for inhibitors of arginine methyltransferase activity. We used a 384-well plate format to immobilize GST-Npl3. The plates were then blocked with BSA and incubated with GST-Hmt1p. Small molecules were robotically arrayed into individual wells. Finally, the enzyme reaction was initiated by the addition of the methyl donor, AdoMet. As the primary read-out in the screen for arginine methyltransferase inhibitors we used the methylation-sensitive antibody, 1E4. 1E4 binding was detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. The chemiluminescent signal from each plate was detected by autoradiography (Fig. 1B) and a Wallac multilabel counter. This screen was performed in duplicate, on 9000 individual compounds from a diverse collection of synthetic chemicals (ChemBridge), with very reproducible results (Fig. 1B). In this manner, we identified nine compounds that inhibited the methylation of Npl3p by Hmt1p (Fig. 1C). We have called these compounds AMIs for arginine methyltransferase inhibitors. As would be expected from this type of screen, we found analogues of AdoMet (AMI-2) as well as compounds that are structurally related (AMIs-4, -5, and -6). Unexpectedly, we identified two compounds that enhance the in vitro methylation of Npl3p by Hmt1p (Fig. 1, B and C), and we refer to these compounds as AMAs for arginine methyltransferase activators. The IC50 (the concentration of compound required to reduce the enzyme activity by 50%) values for the AMIs ranged from 0.15 to 7 μm, and they were able to inhibit the mammalian orthologue of Hmt1p, PRMT1 (Table I). The activators stimulated methylation by both the yeast and the human enzymes up to 3-fold.Table IIC50 of inhibitors and properties of activatorsIC50Chembridge #AMI-Molecular weightFor PRMT1For Hmt1pμmInhibitors Sinefungin381.401.633.04 52558791548.458.813.03 51127592259.2811.183.37 52559103241.2516.294.25 51085094320.300.190.15 51221505647.901.410.78 51352836495.285.116.88 51572207627.901.611.50 51754648674.081.800.43 51930799512.520.280.26Chembridge #AMA-Molecular weightActivity of PRMT1Activity of Hmt1%Activators 52173391379.23326.6298.0 52299712330.89245.0285.0 Open table in a new tab AMI-1 Inhibits Arginine, but Not Lysine, Methyltransferases in Vitro—To investigate which of the AMIs to further analyze, we tested the specificity of these compounds on a panel of arginine methyltransferases. All the arginine methyltransferases (Hmt1p and PRMT1, -3, -4, and -6) that are active as GST fusion proteins were assayed against two different substrates each (Fig. 2). The nine AMIs inhibited all the tested PRMTs. The major protein methylation sites within cells are not only on arginine residues but also on the side-chain nitrogens of the amino acid lysine (46Aletta J.M. Cimato T.R. Ettinger M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 89-91Google Scholar). Mono-, di-, and trimethylation of lysine residues is catalyzed by a unique family of methyltransferases that harbor SET domains (47Bannister A.J. Schneider R. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2002; 109: 801-806Google Scholar). The cofactor-binding region of the SET domain is structurally distinct from the AdoMet binding folds of arginine and DNA methyltransferases (48Marmorstein R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 59-62Google Scholar). The fact that the active domains of SET domain-containing proteins and arginine methyltransferases are dissimilar increases the possibility of identifying specific inhibitors. Thus, we tested the ability of the AMIs to compromise lysine methyltransferase function. The SET domain-containing proteins Suv39H1, Suv39H2, and SET7 were assayed in the presence of the AMIs for their ability to methylate histones H3. In addition, the potency of the inhibitors was also assessed on the non-SET domain-containing lysine methyltransferase, DOT1 (49Feng Q. Wang H. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Struhl K. Zhang Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1052-1058Google Scholar). AMI-2, -3, -4, -5, -7, -8, and -9 were able to inhibit both lysine and arginine methyltransferases (Fig. 3) or displayed a lack of specificity and are, therefore, of less interest to us than the PRMT-specific inhibitors. Compounds that inhibited the tested arginine methyltransferases but not the tested SET domain-containing enzymes (Fig. 3, AMI-1 and -6) were the focus of further investigation. In addition, AMI-5 was used as an example of a nonspecific small molecule inhibitor in the following experiments. AMI-5 inhibits the tested PRMT enzyme set (Figs. 2 and 3) and the lysine methyltransferases DOT1 and SET7, but not Suv39H1 and -2 enzymes (Fig. 3). AMA-1 and AMA-2 were identified as activators of Hmt1p action in both the primary screen (Fig. 1B) and when using the colorimetric assay developed to assess the potency of the various compounds (Table I). In the in vitro methylation reaction, portrayed in Fig. 2 (lanes A1 and A2), this effect is not seen, possibly due to the fact that less peptide substrate is coated on an ELISA plate than is present in a [3H]AdoMet driven in vitro reaction, or that more AdoMet is present in the first set of experiments (Fig. 1B and Table I). However, the activators do display some unique properties. Apart from enhancing Hmt1p and PRMT1 activity, AMA-1 inhibited PRMT3, -4, and -6 (Fig. 2, lane A1). With regard to the SET domain-containing proteins tested, AMA-1 and -2 inhibited Suv39H1 and Suv39H2, but not SET7 or DOT1 (Fig. 3). AMA-2 was able to inhibit the methylation of SmB′ by PRMT4 (Fig. 2, lane A2) but not the methylation of PABP1 by the same enzyme. This phenomenon of substrate-specific inhibition is also seen with PRMT6. It should also be noted that AMI-2, -3, and -4 are not very effective inhibitors of PRMT4 methylation activity directed toward histone H3 (Fig. 3), but the same compounds effectively prevent the methylation of PABP and SmB′ by PRMT4 (Fig. 2). The substrate-dependent nature of enzyme/inhibitor pairs likely reflects different ways in which the various substrates interact with the active site of the same PRMT. AMI-1 Inhibits Methylation of GFP-Npl3 and Cellular Proteins—To determine whether the compounds that showed specific arginine methyltransferase inhibitory properties (AMI-1 and -6) were able to inhibit PRMT activity within a cellular context, we generated a fusion between the green fluorescence protein (GFP) and the yeast protein Npl3. We have established that mammalian PRMT1 can methyl"

The large clustered gene families, corresponding high G + C content, CpG islands and density of repetitive DNA indicate a chromosome rich in biological and evolutionary significance. Here we describe 55.8 million base pairs of highly accurate finished sequence representing 99.9% of the euchromatin portion of the chromosome. Manual curation of gene loci reveals 1,461 protein-coding genes and 321 pseudogenes. Among these are genes directly implicated in mendelian disorders, including familial hypercholesterolaemia and insulin-resistant diabetes. Nearly one-quarter of these genes belong to tandemly arranged families, encompassing more than 25% of the chromosome. Comparative analyses show a fascinating picture of conservation and divergence, revealing large blocks of gene orthology with rodents, scattered regions with more recent gene family expansions and deletions, and segments of coding and non-coding conservation with the distant fish species Takifugu."

We now describe functional roles for the actin-binding proteins cortactin and EC myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in mediating this response. Antisense down-regulation of cortactin protein expression significantly inhibits S1P-induced barrier enhancement in cultured human pulmonary artery EC as measured by transendothelial electrical resistance (TER). Immunofluorescence studies reveal rapid, Rac-dependent translocation of cortactin to the expanded cortical actin band following S1P challenge, where colocalization with EC MLCK occurs within 5 min. Adenoviral overexpression of a Rac dominant negative mutant attenuates TER elevation by S1P. S1P also induces a rapid increase in cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation (within 30 s) critical to subsequent barrier enhancement, since EC transfected with a tyrosine-deficient mutant cortactin exhibit a blunted TER response. Direct binding of EC MLCK to the cortactin Src homology 3 domain appears essential to S1P barrier regulation, since cortactin blocking peptide inhibits both S1P-induced MLC phosphorylation and peak S1P-induced TER values.

The pulmonary endothelium is a functionally dynamic tissue that serves as a semipermeable barrier between circulating vascular contents and the interstitium and airspaces of the lung. The regulatory mechanisms involved in maintenance of this barrier are poorly understood; however, we recently reported that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), 1The abbreviations used are: S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; CBP, cortactin SH3 blocking peptide; DN, dominant negative; DPV, diperoxovanadate; EC, endothelial cell(s); GFP, green fluorescent protein; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; IF, immunofluorescence; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; TER, transendothelial electrical resistance; AA, amino acids; SH3, Src homology 3; Ab, antibody; HPAEC, human pulmonary artery endothelial cell(s); HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s); GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation; MLC, myosin light chain. a potent phospholipid angiogenic factor released from activated platelets (1English D. Welch Z. Kovala A.T. Harvey K. Volpert O.V. Brindley D.N. Garcia J.G. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2255-2265Google Scholar), produces significant endothelial cell (EC) barrier enhancement through Edg receptor ligation and Rac GTPase-dependent cortical actin rearrangement (2Garcia J.G.

Although the rapid, sustained, and dose-dependent increase in EC transmonolayer electrical resistance (TER) generated by S1P requires an intact actin cytoskeleton capable of undergoing dynamic rearrangement (2Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamburg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 689-701Google Scholar), the specific mediators and regulatory mechanisms that effect these actin cytoskeletal changes remain unclear. The 80/85-kDa actin-binding protein, cortactin, has been implicated in cortical actin rearrangement (3Weed S.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6418-6434Google Scholar). Ideally suited for integrating multiple signals at sites of dynamic actin rearrangement, the amino acid structure of cortactin contains an N-terminal acidic region that stimulates actin polymerization by the Arp2-Arp3 complex (murine AA 1-90), a unique tandem repeat site for actin binding (AA 91-326), a Pro- and Tyr-rich area containing sites for p60src phosphorylation (AA 401-495), and a C-terminal SH3 domain (AA 496-546) (3Weed S.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6418-6434Google Scholar). Cortactin stimulates and stabilizes Arp2-Arp3-mediated polymerization of branched actin filaments at peripheral sites of cytoskeletal rearrangement (4Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Google Scholar, 5Weaver A.M. Karginov A.V. Kinley A.W. Weed S.A. Li Y. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 370-374Google Scholar), but regulation of cortactin's activity at these sites is poorly understood. Originally described as a target for p60src tyrosine kinase (6Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Google Scholar), increased cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation is observed after many stimuli associated with cytoskeletal rearrangement, including epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, thrombin, integrin activation, and shear stress (3Weed S.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6418-6434Google Scholar, 7Birukov K.G. Birukova A.A. Dudek S.M. Verin A.D. Crow M.T. Zhan X. DePaola N. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 453-464Google Scholar). The functional role of phosphorylated cortactin is unclear, but we recently reported an increased direct association of phosphocortactin with the barrier regulatory enzyme, EC myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), relative to nonphosphorylated cortactin (8Dudek S.M. Birukov K.G. Zhan X. Garcia J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 511-519Google Scholar). EC MLCK coprecipitates with both cortactin and p60src in cultured lung EC (9Garcia J.G. Verin A.D. Schaphorst K. Siddiqui R. Patterson C.E. Csortos C. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L989-L998Google Scholar), and the interaction of cortactin with EC MLCK attenuates cortactin-stimulated, Arp2-Arp3-catalyzed actin polymerization in vitro (8Dudek S.M. Birukov K.G. Zhan X. Garcia J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 511-519Google Scholar). Thus, cortactin-MLCK interaction may modulate EC cytoskeletal rearrangement. EC MLCK is an ATP- and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme essential for generation of centripetal cellular tension via its ability to enhance actomyosin motor activity (10Dudek S.M. Garcia J.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1487-1500Google Scholar). Nonskeletal muscle MLCK exists as high molecular mass (∼210 kDa) and low molecular mass (130-160 kDa) isoforms that are derived from a single gene (11Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Google Scholar). Human EC express only the high molecular weight form (EC MLCK) cloned by our group (12Garcia J.G. Lazar V. Gilbert-McClain L.I. Gallagher P.J. Verin A.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 489-494Google Scholar), with multiple splice variants also detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR (13Lazar V. Garcia J.G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 256-267Google Scholar). The two most predominantly expressed variants (EC MLCK 1 and 2) differ only by a single exon deletion (encoding AA 436-505), which results in EC MLCK 2 containing 69 fewer amino acids than EC MLCK 1. This deleted region contains two sites for p60src-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr464 and Tyr471) that serve to produce differential regulation of EC MLCK splice variant activity (14Birukov K.G. Csortos C. Marzilli L. Dudek S. Ma S.F. Bresnick A.R. Verin A.D. Cotter R.J. Garcia J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8567-8573Google Scholar). In multiple in vitro and in vivo models of EC permeability, increased MLCK activity produces increased MLC phosphorylation within newly formed stress fibers, intracellular tension, cell rounding, paracellular gap formation, and subsequent EC barrier disruption (15Garcia J.G. Davis H.W. Patterson C.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 510-522Google Scholar, 16Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Google Scholar, 17Parker J.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 2241-2248Google Scholar). However, we recently described increased MLC phosphorylation in a cortical distribution during S1P EC barrier enhancement (2Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamburg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 689-701Google Scholar), suggesting possible spatially defined MLCK activation that can differentially regulate permeability. These observations led us to speculate integral roles for cortactin and EC MLCK in regulating the dynamic actin changes seen at the EC periphery during S1P-induced vascular barrier enhancement (2Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamburg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 689-701Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that S1P induces rapid cortactin colocalization with EC MLCK at the EC periphery with functional roles for these proteins and their interaction in EC barrier enhancement. These results support important regulatory functions for cortactin and EC MLCK in dynamic actin rearrangements involved in enhancement of vascular integrity.

Recombinant Proteins and Expression Vectors—The EC MLCK and smooth muscle (SM) MLCK (His-tagged) fusion proteins were produced in our laboratory as previously described (14Birukov K.G. Csortos C.

GFP-tagged EC MLCK 2 expression vector was generated by subcloning EC MLCK 2 cDNA from the previously described pFastBac vector (14Birukov K.G. Csortos C. Marzilli L. Dudek S. Ma S.F. Bresnick A.R.

Recombinant GST-tagged N terminus of EC MLCK 1 was prepared by subcloning the DNA sequence for amino acids 1-922 into the pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) per the manufacturer's recommendations. PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) was used to remove the GST tag from the recombinant proteins. GST-tagged cortactin fusion proteins and c-Myc-tagged cortactin expression vectors were prepared as previously described (18Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Google Scholar). Cortactin antisense oligonucleotide (gcctgctgaagctttccacatctt) derived from the human cortactin sequence (Gen-Bank™ M98343) and scrambled control oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Johns Hopkins University Institute of Genetic Medicine Core Facility. All DNA sequencing was also performed by this facility. Dominant negative HA-tagged RacN17 and dominant negative Myc-tagged PAK1 transient transfection constructs were kindly provided by M. Nicolic (Harvard University). Adenoviral dominant negative Rac (triple HA-tagged) and control vectors were kindly provided by C. Waters (University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN). Rac GTPase Activity Assay—Determination of Rac activation (quantitation of Rac-GTP) was performed using a commercially available kit (UBI) as previously described (2Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamburg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 689-701Google Scholar). Transendothelial Monolayer Electrical Resistance—EC were grown to confluence in polycarbonate wells containing evaporated gold microelectrodes, and TER measurements were then performed using an electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing system obtained from Applied Biophysics (Troy, NY) as previously described in detail (2Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamburg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 689-701Google Scholar). TER values from each microelectrode were pooled at discrete time points and plotted versus time as the mean ± S.E. (19Garcia J.G. Schaphorst K.L. Verin A.D. Vepa S. Patterson C.E. Natarajan V. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 2333-2343Google Scholar). Transfection and Infection of EC—EC plated on coverslips or dishes to 50-70% confluence were exposed for 4-6 h to a transient transfection mixture consisting of 1 μg of plasmid DNA per 3 μl of FuGene6 per ml of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen). EC were then incubated in complete culture medium for an additional 48-72 h to allow protein expression. For antisense oligonucleotide studies, HPAEC were incubated with 1-2 μg of oligonucleotides/ml of medium plus FuGene6 for 4-10 h before being replaced with complete medium. Cortactin protein expression was assayed by Western blotting 48-72 h after oligonucleotide treatment. For experiments using myristoylated peptides, EC were incubated with 10 μm CBP or control peptide for 45 min prior to beginning other manipulations. HUVEC lines were infected with retroviral GFP-tagged wild-type cortactin or tyrosine-deficient mutant cortactin as previously described (20Li Y. Liu J. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37187-37193Google Scholar). Adenoviral infection with dominant negative Rac or control vector (multiplicity of infection = 20-40) was performed 48 h prior to the TER assay. Endothelial Imaging—EC were grown on gelatinized coverslips before being exposed to various conditions as described for individual experiments. EC were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, and then incubated for 60 min at room temperature with the primary Ab of interest. After washing, EC were then incubated with appropriate secondary Ab conjugated to IF dyes (or Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin for actin staining) for 60 min at room temperature. After further washing with phosphate-buffered saline, coverslips were mounted using Slow Fade (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 microscope and Sony Digital Photo camera DKC 5000. Confocal microscopy was performed using the Radiance Laser scanning 2100 system (Bio-Rad). Images were recorded and saved in Adobe Photoshop. GST Binding Assay—In vitro binding of recombinant MLCK proteins with GST-tagged cortactin constructs was performed exactly as previously described (8Dudek S.M. Birukov K.G. Zhan X. Garcia J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 511-519Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cortactin IP from confluent 60-mm HPAEC dishes was performed as follows. After treatment with vehicle or S1P, EC were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 50 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Lysates were boiled for 5 min, passed several times through a 26-gauge needle, and centrifuged for 5 min (16,000 × g). Supernatant was collected and added to 200 μl of H2O plus 250 μl of 2 × IP buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm NaVO4, 1:250 dilution of Calbiochem protease inhibitor mixture 3). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 10 μl of monoclonal cortactin Ab. 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added and then rotated at 4 °C for 60 min. The complex was washed in 1× IP buffer prior to the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, boiling, and subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), Western blotting was performed using α-phosphotyrosine primary Ab and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab prior to visualization using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to compare the means of data from two or more different experimental groups. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Cortactin Depletion Inhibits S1P-induced Barrier Enhancement—Our initial studies addressed the functional role of the actin-binding protein cortactin in human EC barrier regulation. We used antisense oligonucleotide techniques to manipulate cellular cortactin levels, and extensive screening of potential antisense oligonucleotides identified a sequence that reproducibly reduced cortactin protein expression (by an average of 50-60% after 48-72 h of treatment) as compared with untreated or missense oligonucleotide controls (Fig. 1B). This level of cortactin suppression is consistent with a prior report of cortactin antisense treatment (in cultured fetal chick neurons) (21Cheng Y. Leung S. Mangoura D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3161-3172Google Scholar). Reduction in cortactin expression produced >50% inhibition of peak S1P EC barrier enhancement as measured by TER (Fig. 1, A and C). This reduction in S1P barrier augmentation, similar in magnitude to that previously reported after down-regulation of Edg-1 receptor expression (2Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamburg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 689-701Google Scholar), indicates an essential role for cortactin in EC barrier regulation by S1P. Barrier-enhancing Stimuli Translocate Cortactin to the EC Periphery—We next explored cortactin's role in EC barrier regulation via immunofluorescent (IF) cellular localization of cortactin in cells exposed to agents known to alter EC permeability. Fig. 2 illustrates the typical pattern of diffuse cortactin staining that predominates in unstimulated HPAEC. Exposure of lung EC to S1P produces the previously noted increased cortical actin (2Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamburg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 689-701Google Scholar) and rapid translocation of cortactin to the cell periphery within 5 min (Fig. 2B), a time course that parallels the dramatic enhancement in barrier function observed after S1P (2Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamburg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 689-701Google Scholar) and with other barrier-enhancing stimuli such as HGF (Fig. 2C) (22Liu F. Schaphorst K.L. Verin A.D. Jacobs K. Birukova A. Day R.M. Bogatcheva N. Bottaro D.P. Garcia J.G. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 950-962Google Scholar) and shear stress (7Birukov K.G. Birukova A.A. Dudek S.M. Verin A.D. Crow M.T. Zhan X. DePaola N. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 453-464Google Scholar). Diperoxovanadate (DPV) is a potent up-regulator of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation, which produces a brief period of EC barrier enhancement (0-30 min) followed by prolonged increased permeability associated with p60src activation and focal contact alteration (19Garcia J.G. Schaphorst K.L. Verin A.D. Vepa S. Patterson C.E. Natarajan V. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 2333-2343Google Scholar, 23Shi S. Garcia J.G. Roy S. Parinandi N.L. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L441-L451Google Scholar). DPV induces substantial early translocation of cortactin to the periphery (Fig. 2E) in association with peak DPV barrier augmentation (15-30 min) (23Shi S. Garcia J.G. Roy S. Parinandi N.L. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L441-L451Google Scholar). This localization was followed by loss of cortactin staining intensity as the DPV barrier disruptive response evolved. Conversely, the potent edemagenic agent thrombin causes immediate and profound EC barrier impairment (24Schaphorst K.L. Pavalko F.M. Patterson C.E. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 443-455Google Scholar), actin stress fiber formation, and paracellular gap formation but fails to alter the base-line cytoplasmic distribution of cortactin (Fig. 2D). Thus, cortactin is rapidly concentrated in a cortical distribution by barrier-enhancing agents but not by thrombin, a barrier-disrupting agonist. Together, these observations strongly suggest an important role for cortactin at the EC periphery during stimuli-induced barrier enhancement. Essential Role for Cortactin Tyrosine Phosphorylation in S1P-induced EC Barrier Enhancement—Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is associated with multiple stimuli that evoke cell shape and cytoskeletal changes (3Weed S.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6418-6434Google Scholar). Whereas the functional role of tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin is unclear, models of cell migration (18Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Google Scholar, 25Liu J. Huang C. Zhan X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6700-6706Google Scholar) and H2O2-mediated morphological changes (20Li Y. Liu J. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37187-37193Google Scholar) demonstrate the importance of cortactin phosphorylation in regulating specific types of cytoskeletal changes. In our EC model, S1P rapidly increases tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin (within 30 s) (Fig. 3A), with levels declining by 5 min but remaining above base line for over 30 min. S1P barrier enhancement is therefore temporally associated with both rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and translocation of cortactin to the cell periphery. Consistent with our prior experiments (7Birukov K.G. Birukova A.A. Dudek S.M. Verin A.D. Crow M.T. Zhan X. DePaola N. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 453-464Google Scholar), the specific Src inhibitor PP2 (5 μm) failed to block S1P-induced cortactin translocation (Fig. 3B), suggesting that p60src activity may not be integral to this effect. To avoid difficulties inherent in chemical inhibitor specificity, HPAEC were transiently transfected with a mutant cortactin deficient in three critical tyrosine residues (Tyr421, Tyr466, and Tyr482), which account for >90% of p60src-catalyzed cortactin phosphorylation (18Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 3B, the tyrosine-deficient mutant cortactin strongly localizes to the periphery following S1P in a manner similar to endogenous protein. We confirmed that cortactin phosphorylation by p60src is not required for peripheral translocation of cortactin after S1P by using HUVEC infected with a retroviral form of the tyrosine-deficient mutant cortactin. Prior characterization of these retrovirally infected HUVEC demonstrated that similar amounts of GFP-tagged cortactin wild-type and cortactin tyrosine-deficient mutant protein are expressed by the respective HUVEC, whereas endogenous cortactin protein expression is relatively unaffected (20Li Y. Liu J. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37187-37193Google Scholar). In the present study, S1P induced cortical translocation of endogenous cortactin as well as GFP-tagged overexpressed cortactin protein in retroviral vector controls, cortactin wild-type, and tyrosine-deficient mutant cortactin HUVEC (data not shown). However, phosphorylation at these three critical tyrosine residues (Tyr421, Tyr466, and Tyr482) appears to be necessary for peak S1P barrier enhancement (Fig. 3C). HUVEC overexpressing the tyrosine-deficient mutant cortactin exhibited a sustained decrease in the TER response compared with vector controls or wild-type cortactin-overexpressing EC (Fig. 3D). Moreover, HUVEC overexpressing wild-type cortactin showed enhanced resistance after S1P, providing further novel evidence for the essential role of cortactin in EC barrier regulation. Rac GTPase Mediates S1P-induced Cortactin Translocation and Barrier Enhancement—The above results suggest that phosphorylation of cortactin by p60src is not essential for EC cortactin translocation by S1P. We next investigated the possible involvement of the Rac GTPase pathway in this translocation as we previously described rapid activation of EC Rac (within 1 min) after S1P (2Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamburg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 689-701Google Scholar), and Rac activation produces cortical localization of cortactin in growth factor-stimulated fibroblasts (26Weed S.A. Du Y. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2433-2443Google Scholar), in osmotically challenged Chinese hamster ovary cells (27Di Ciano C. Nie Z. Szaszi K. Lewis A. Uruno T. Zhan X. Rotstein O.D. Mak A. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C850-C865Google Scholar), and, as we have shown, in HPAEC exposed to shear (7Birukov K.G. Birukova A.A. Dudek S.M. Verin A.D. Crow M.T. Zhan X. DePaola N. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 453-464Google Scholar). HPAEC transiently transfected with dominant negative RacN17 exhibit markedly decreased cortactin translocation following S1P (Fig. 4A). Although we have shown that PAK1 is a key Rac downstream effector activated after S1P (2Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamburg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 689-701Google Scholar), PAK1 activity does not appear to mediate cortactin translocation. Transient transfection with dominant negative PAK1 fails to inhibit S1P-induced cortactin translocation (Fig. 4B). Thus, S1P-induced cortactin translocation is Rac GTPase-dependent but does not require PAK1 kinase activities. Moreover, this Rac activity is necessary for peak S1P-induced EC barrier enhancement, since inhibition of this activation by adenoviral overexpression of dominant negative Rac (Fig. 4D) significantly inhibits this barrier response (Fig. 4C). S1P Stimulation Translocates EC MLCK and Cortactin to the EC Periphery—We next utilized IF techniques to characterize EC MLCK cellular localization in living cells under various barrier-regulatory conditions. HPAEC were transiently transfected with a GFP-EC MLCK 2 construct, which we previously reported increased stress fiber formation compared with control cells (28Petrache I. Birukov K. Zaiman A.L. Crow M.T. Deng H. Wadgaonkar R. Romer L.H. Garcia J.G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 407-416Google Scholar). Using live cell imaging, under basal conditions (Fig. 5A), EC MLCK 2 is predominantly distributed along the actin fiber network within the cytoplasm. However, after exposure to physiologic levels of S1P, MLCK is clearly translocated within 5-10 min to peripheral areas of membrane ruffling (Fig. 5A, arrows). Thus, overexpressed EC MLCK appears to dynamically localize to the periphery during barrier augmentation in a manner similar to cortactin (see Fig. 2). We previously reported that cortactin, an actin-binding protein involved in dynamic cortical actin rearrangement, coprecipitates with EC MLCK in stimulated EC (9Garcia J.G. Verin A.D. Schaphorst K. Siddiqui R. Patterson C.E. Csortos C. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L989-L998Google Scholar) with direct interaction subsequently demonstrated in vitro (8Dudek S.M. Birukov K.G. Zhan X. Garcia J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 511-519Google Scholar). To explore the interaction of cortactin and EC MLCK in situ, we transiently transfected HPAEC with GFP-EC MLCK 2 and examined protein localization with confocal microscopy. Under basal conditions, overexpressed EC MLCK 2 is again observed along cytoplasmic actin cables, whereas cortactin exhibits a more diffuse cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 5B). Within 5 min of exposure to S1P, EC MLCK 2 is rapidly redistributed to areas of active membrane ruffling where colocalization with translocated cortactin occurs (Fig. 5B, merged image). Although these observations must be interpreted cautiously because of the artificial elevation in MLCK levels, they suggest rapid interaction of c"

Muscle biopsy samples were collected from seven males before (PRE) and after (POST) completing 120 min of continuous bicycle ergometry. Biopsies were sectioned and analyzed for the following: IL-6 protein detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), IL-6 mRNA content detected by in situ hybridization, fiber type measured by either IHC or myofibrillar ATPase activity stain, and glycogen content measured by periodic acid schiff (PAS) assay. Fibers were qualitatively categorized according to glycogen content to one of five groups (1-5), with 1 being very low (LOW) and 5 being very high (HIGH) glycogen. Total fluorescence (PRE vs. POST) and glycogen-dependent fluorescence (LOW vs. HIGH) of IL-6 protein were quantitated using Metamorph software. Total IL-6 protein was elevated from PRE to POST exercise (P<0.05). At PRE, IL-6 protein was evenly distributed across all fibers at low levels, consistent with glycogen distribution. At POST, IL-6 protein was greater (P<0.05) in HIGH compared with LOW glycogen fibers, which coincided with type 2 fibers. IL-6 mRNA was distributed peripherally in all fibers at PRE. At POST, however, IL-6 mRNA appeared predominantly in type 2 fibers, which also had higher glycogen content (P<0.05). These data demonstrate that myocytes per se are a source of IL-6 produced during contraction. Our data also suggest that type 2 fibers predominantly produce IL-6 during muscle contractile activity."

https://openalex.org/W2034731762,"The remarkable transport properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are determined by their unusual electronic structure. The electronic states of a carbon nanotube form one-dimensional electron and hole sub-bands, which, in general, are separated by an energy gap. States near the energy gap are predicted to have an orbital magnetic moment, mu(orb), that is much larger than the Bohr magneton (the magnetic moment of an electron due to its spin). This large moment is due to the motion of electrons around the circumference of the nanotube, and is thought to play a role in the magnetic susceptibility of CNTs and the magnetoresistance observed in large multiwalled CNTs. But the coupling between magnetic field and the electronic states of individual nanotubes remains to be quantified experimentally. Here we report electrical measurements of relatively small diameter (2-5 nm) individual CNTs in the presence of an axial magnetic field. We observe field-induced energy shifts of electronic states and the associated changes in sub-band structure, which enable us to confirm quantitatively the predicted values for mu(orb)."
https://openalex.org/W2171768996,"Erythropoietin (EPO), the principal hematopoietic cytokine that regulates mammalian erythropoiesis, exhibits diverse cellular effects in non-hematopoietic tissues. The physiologic functions of EPO are mediated by its specific cell-surface receptor EPOR. In this study, we demonstrate EPOR expression in adult rat cardiac myocytes and examine the direct effects of EPO on the heart to investigate whether recombinant EPO may exert an acute cardioprotective effect during ischemia-reperfusion injury. To determine whether EPO is cardioprotective, isolated rat hearts were perfused for 10 min in the Langendorff-mode with Krebs-Henseleit buffer in the absence or presence of brief recombinant EPO treatment while left-ventricular-developed pressure (LVDP) was measured continuously to assess contractile function. The hearts were then subjected to 20 min of normothermic global ischemia followed by 25 min of reperfusion. The post-ischemic recovery of LVDP in the untreated control hearts was 26 +/- 5% of their baseline LVDP, whereas hearts pretreated with EPO exhibited significantly improved post-ischemic recovery to 57 +/- 7%. We used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine whether modulation of intracellular pH and/or high-energy phosphate levels during ischemia contributed to EPO-mediated cardioprotection. These experiments revealed that the rapid cardioprotective effect of EPO during ischemia-reperfusion injury was associated with preservation of ATP levels in the ischemic myocardium."

The structure of the target site duplications flanking de novo L1 integrants suggests a model for second strand synthesis of L1 termed “microhomology-driven single strand annealing” (9Symer D.E.

Human ORF1 protein (ORF1p) could be detected in the cytoplasm of a number of testicular germ cell tumors, in breast carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and a variety of transformed cell lines (17Asch H.L. Eliacin E. Fanning T.G. Connolly J.L. Bratthauer G. Asch B.B. Oncol. Res. 1996; 8: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bratthauer G.L. Cardiff R.D. Fanning T.G.

Cancer. 1993; 71: 2383-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The only nonmalignant human tissue ORF1p has been detected in so far is the epithelium of normal mammary gland (17Asch H.L. Eliacin E. Fanning T.G. Connolly J.L. Bratthauer G. Asch B.B. Oncol. Res. 1996; 8: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar). ORF1p encoded by L1s in mice was verified in embryonal carcinoma cell lines, male and female germ cells, Leydig cells of embryonic testis, theca cells of adult ovary, and a large variety of transformed cell lines (21Branciforte D. Martin S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2584-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 22Martin S.L. Branciforte D. Mol. Cell.

However, all efforts to detect ORF2 proteins (ORF2p) in murine or human tissues using antibodies that detect baculovirus-produced or bacterially expressed ORF2p failed so far (10Ostertag E.M. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 501-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), and no direct evidence for in vivo translation of ORF2 has been provided hitherto. Although it is clear that L1 retrotransposition events have occurred in somatic and germ cells (for review, see Ref. 10Ostertag E.M. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 501-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), only those events that take place in cells destined for the next generation are evolutionarily successful. In mammals these cells include primordial germ cells, germ cells, and early embryos. Thus, if L1 retrotransposition takes place in these cell types, functional proteins encoded by ORF1 and ORF2 are expected to be present because of their absolute requirement for L1 retrotransposition (4Moran J.V. Holmes S.E. Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Boeke J.D. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Cell. 1996; 87: 917-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). During human fetal development, primordial germ cells and supporting somatic cells, the precursor Sertoli cells, are enclosed in seminiferous cords, where primordial germ cells differentiate into prespermatogonia. These multiply by mitosis, arrest in the G0/1 phase of the cell cycle, and subsequently enter another mitotic phase. Between embryonic weeks 10 and 22, primordial germ cells and all three types of prespermatogonia (mitotic, quiescent transitional, and mitotic transitional cells) appear side by side. After developmental week 26, only quiescent and mitotic prespermatogonia remain in fetal testis (24Wartenberg H. Hinrichsen K.V. Humanembryologie. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 745-820Crossref Google Scholar). In the seminiferous tubules of adult testis (Fig. 2), all intermediate cell types on the pathway to male gametes, like spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids, are present continuously throughout adulthood and can thus be viewed in single sections. Spermatogonia line the basal membrane of the seminiferous tubules. As germ cells undergo meiotic divisions and differentiation, they move toward the lumen, where mature spermatids are released. In the human testis, testosterone-producing Leydig cells and seminiferous tubules are connected by the microvasculature, which plays an essential role in the distribution of hormones and nutritional factors. To explore the potential of functional human L1s to expand during germ cell development, we examined gonadal and other tissues at different developmental stages for the presence of proteins encoded by ORF1 and ORF2. To this aim we raised a polyclonal antibody against polypeptides encoded by the 5′-end of ORF2 and employed a previously generated antibody directed against the p40 protein (25Leibold D.M. Swergold G.D. Singer M.F. Thayer R.E. Dombroski B.A. Fanning T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6990-6994Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Coexpression of ORF1- and ORF2-encoded proteins was detected in fetal prespermatogonia, spermatocytes, immature spermatids, as well as in somatic cell types, such as Leydig, Sertoli, and vascular endothelial cells and placental syncytiotrophoblasts. Identified ORF2-encoded proteins were characterized by peptide mass fingerprinting analysis. ORF1- and ORF2-encoded proteins that were detected in fetal early meiotic cell types destined for the next generation may represent the enzymatic machinery for L1 retrotransposition and genomic expansion. The existence of both proteins in human vascular endothelial cells and the apparent association with differentiation and maturation of these cells may also have functional relevance for vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis. Tissue Samples—Human adult testicular tissues were obtained from 40-70-year-old patients orchiectomized because of prostate cancer. Paraffin-embedded fetal tissues were provided by the Department of Pathology and Gynecopathology of the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf. Research on adult and fetal human tissues was approved by the ethics commission of the institution. Yeast Expression—To construct plasmid pCBW12 expressing a fusion of the L1-EN domain to the C terminus of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-DBD-EN), the DNA encoding L1-EN was inserted in-frame between NdeI and BamHI restriction sites of yeast expression vector pGBKT7 (Clontech). The empty parental vector pGBKT7 or pCBW12 was transfected into yeast AH109 cells to express Gal4-DBD proteins and Gal4-DBD-EN fusion proteins. Growth and manipulation of the yeast strain and preparation of cell extracts were performed according to standard procedures (26Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Primary Antibodies—The well characterized antibody AH40.1 directed against L1 ORF1-encoded p40 protein was a gift from Thomas G. Fanning, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, D. C. (19Bratthauer G.L. Fanning T.G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 507-510PubMed Google Scholar, 25Leibold D.M. Swergold G.D. Singer M.F. Thayer R.E. Dombroski B.A. Fanning T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6990-6994Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To raise antibodies detecting the EN domain (amino acids 1-239) of ORF2p, peptides 1420 and 1419, covering amino acids 48-63 and 152-166 of ORF2p, respectively (see Fig. 1, A and B), were chosen, based on algorithms that predict antigenic sites (Lasergene Software, DNASTAR). Numbering corresponds to the amino acid positions in the active L1.2 element (27Dombroski B.A. Mathias S.L. Nanthakumar E. Scott A.F. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Two chickens were immunized commercially (Eurogentec) by three boost injections of each of the two peptides. IgY antibodies were prepared from egg yolks (28Akita E.M. Nakai S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 160: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and purified by affinity chromatography. For that purpose peptides 1420 and 1419 (2.5 mg each) were covalently coupled to 1 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The gel was packed into a column and washed using standard methods. After equilibration with storage buffer (0.1 m phophate buffer, pH 7.6, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1% NaN3), the IgY fraction was passed over the column twice. Subsequently, the column was washed with storage buffer, and bound antibodies were eluted with 10 bed volumes of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and mixed with 1 bed volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The affinity-purified antibody, referred to as anti-EN antibody and directed against peptides 1419 and 1420, was dialyzed against storage buffer and stored at a concentration of 12.5 mg/ml at -80 °C. All experiments described were performed using the affinity-purified anti-EN antibody. Immunoblot Analysis—Purified L1-EN and cell extracts were separated on an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After transfer, membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% bovine serum albumin, incubated with the affinity-purified polyclonal anti-EN antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000 for 45 min, washed with PBS, and incubated with rabbit anti-chicken IgG horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:10,000. The membrane was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.5% Tween 20, once with TBS, 3% Tween 20, and twice with TBS, and immune complexes were visualized using the Amersham ECL enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. Immunofluorescence Imaging—HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 7% carbon dioxide and 100% humidity in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking pyruvate. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine calf serum and 0.4 mm glutamine. HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg of pJM101/L1RP (5Kimberland M.L. Divoky V. Prchal J. Schwahn U. Berger W. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1557-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or pCEP4 (Invitrogen) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 48 h after transfection, one set of transfected cells was fixed in 4% formaldehyde and preabsorbed with blocking buffer (10% donkey serum, 5% horse serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in PGS (0.5% glycine, 0.05% saponin in PBS)). Subsequently, coverslips were incubated with the affinity-purified anti-EN antibodies (1:50 dilution in PGS buffer) for 1 h, washed in PGS, and reacted with a 1:500 dilution of Cy3-labeled donkey anti-chicken IgG antibodies (Dianova). After washing and nuclear staining with DAPI, mounted coverslips were photographed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope equipped with a digital camera. Three days after transfection, another set of transfected cells was selected for the presence of pJM101/L1RP or pCEP4 by growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin. After 38 days of selection, hygromycin-resistant cells were fixed in formaldehyde, preabsorbed with blocking buffer, and stained as described before. Immunohistochemistry and Immunocytochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was carried out as described previously in detail (29Kilic N. Ergün S. Methods Mol. Med. 2001; 58: 125-148PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were fixed in Bouin's solution or 8% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned serially at 5-7 μm. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and incubated with the anti-EN or AH40.1 antibodies at a final concentration of 12.5 ng/ml or at a 1:100 dilution, respectively, in PBS buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3 for 24-48 h at 4 °C. After washing, sections were incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-chicken IgG (Abcam) or biotinylated swine anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Dako), respectively. The immunoreaction was visualized using a combination of the peroxidase-antiperoxidase and avidin-biotin complex methods enhanced by a modified nickel-enhanced glucose oxidase technique (29Kilic N. Ergün S. Methods Mol. Med. 2001; 58: 125-148PubMed Google Scholar). To test for the specificity of the anti-EN antibody, peptides 1419 and 1420 were immobilized separately on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and preincubated overnight with the antibody at a ratio of 1:3 (12.5 ng of anti-EN antibody and 37.5 ng of peptides/ml). The supernatant of this mixture containing the peptide-depleted antibody was used for immunohistochemistry in control experiments. The following controls were performed in addition: (i) primary or secondary antibody was replaced by PBS, (ii) peroxidase reaction alone was visualized without antibody pretreatment. Preabsorption experiments reexamining the specificity of the AH40.1 antibody were performed as described previously (19Bratthauer G.L. Fanning T.G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 507-510PubMed Google Scholar). Immunostained sections were counterstained with Calcium Red and photographed with a Leica microscope equipped with a digital camera. Human dermal microvascular endothelial (HDME) cells, derived from dermis (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) were cultured to confluence on gelatin-coated dishes in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium MV (PromoCell) and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated overnight at room temperature with anti-EN antibodies. The peroxidase reaction was carried out as described above. Immunoprecipitation and Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry (MS)—HDME cell lysates were incubated with affinity-purified anti-EN antibodies immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min at 600 × g and washed three times with 1 ml each of TBS and 0.5% Tween 20; TBS and 350 mm NaCl and 0.5% Tween 20; TBS and 350 mm NaCl and 3% Tween 20, and 3 × PBS. Finally, the bead fraction was separated on an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by silver staining. Two immunoprecipitated proteins with estimated molecular masses of ∼45 and ∼130 kDa (see Fig. 4B) were excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and extracted sequentially with 40% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After evaporation of the solvent, the peptides were resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, mixed with an equal volume of 1% α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and spotted onto a stainless steel plate for analysis by MALDI-TOF MS (Axima CRF, Shimadzu). Identified peptides were compared with peptide sequences of annotated coding regions by applying the MASCOT search program. Anti-EN Antibodies Directed against L1 ORF2p—To investigate human germ line tissues for expression of L1 ORF2p we raised antibodies against peptides within the N-terminal EN domain of ORF2p (Fig. 1, A and B). These anti-EN antibodies recognized the bacterially expressed EN domain (amino acids 1-239) with an apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa (13Cost G.J. Boeke J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 18081-18093Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C, lane 1) and Baculovirus-produced 150-kDa ORF2p. 2J. D. Boeke, personal communication. As a negative control we used whole cell extracts from chicken embryo fibroblasts because the chicken genome does not contain LINE-1 sequences. The chicken-specific retrotransposon CR1 is only distantly related to mammalian L1 elements and differs greatly in the relevant ORF2 sequences (30Silva R. Burch J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3563-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Malik H.S. Burke W.D. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). As expected, the anti-EN antibody failed to detect any protein in these extracts (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Next, we tested the antibody using a yeast plasmid expressing a fusion protein between the Gal4-DBD and the L1-EN domain (Gal4-DBD-EN). The fusion protein with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa was recognized in extracts from transfected yeast cells but not in extracts from control cells expressing the Gal4-DBD alone (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). To test the anti-EN antibody for its ability to detect native ORF2p in situ, we transfected the episomal retrotransposition reporter plasmid pJM101/L1RP carrying an RC-L1 element under the control of a heterologous promoter (5Kimberland M.L. Divoky V. Prchal J. Schwahn U. Berger W. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1557-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) into HeLa cells and performed immunofluorescence experiments (Fig. 1D). Although HeLa cells that were transfected with the empty vector pCEP4 (Fig. 1D, b, d, and f) as well as untransfected HeLa cells (data not shown) displayed only weak background immunoreactivity that may be explained by endogenous ORF2 expression, transfection with pJM101/L1RP resulted after only 48 h in much more intense immunostaining of the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D, a and c) of a subset of cells. 38 days of hygromycin selection of pJM101/L1RP-transfected cells resulted in strong fluorescence of the cytoplasm of each cell in the culture (Fig. 1D, e). In contrast, pCEP4-transfected hygromycin-resistant cells exhibited only weak background activity (f) that is also observed in untransfected HeLa cells. Because pJM101/L1RP differs from pCEP4 exclusively by an active RC-L1, the data strongly suggest that the difference in immunoreactivity is caused by the interaction of the affinity-purified anti-EN antibody with overexpressed L1RP ORF2p.

The 18-kDa phosphorylated protein is subunit ESSS from complex I and not as previously reported the 18 k subunit (with the N-terminal sequence AQDQ). The phosphorylated residue in subunit ESSS is serine 20. In the 10 kDa band, the complex I subunit MWFE was phosphorylated on serine 55. In the presence of protein kinase A and cAMP, the same subunits of purified complex I were phosphorylated by [32P]ATP at the same sites. Subunits ESSS and MWFE both contribute to the membrane arm of complex I. Each has a single hydrophobic region probably folded into a membrane spanning α-helix. It is likely that the phosphorylation site of subunit ESSS lies in the mitochondrial matrix and that the site in subunit MWFE is in the intermembrane space. Subunit ESSS has no known role, but subunit MWFE is required for assembly into complex I of seven hydrophobic subunits encoded in the mitochondrial genome. The possible effects of phosphorylation of these subunits on the activity and/or the assembly of complex I remain to be explored.

The reversible phosphorylation of proteins is one of the major ways of regulating cellular activities (1Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). Up to 30% of eukaryotic proteins are phosphorylated (2Cohen P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E127-E130Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), and there are more than 500 human genes encoding protein kinases including subunits of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases (protein kinase A) (3Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6160) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A regulates, for example, the functions of many enzymes, membrane receptors, ion channels, and transcription factors that are involved in a variety of cellular processes. Protein kinase A is localized at various cellular sites by protein kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs), and two forms, D-AKAP1 and D-AKAP2, have been identified in mammalian mitochondria (4Huang L.J.

The so-called “18 k subunit” of complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) with the N-terminal sequence AQDQ has been proposed to be the 18-kDa protein that becomes phosphorylated (10Papa S.

Mammalian complex I is an L-shaped assembly with one arm in the inner membrane and the other lying orthogonal to it protruding into the matrix of the mitochondrion. It is made of 46 different proteins, and the 18 k subunit (AQDQ) is a component of the matrix arm (12Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 13Carroll J. Shannon R.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol.

The identification of this subunit as a phosphorylated protein was based upon the separation of the subunits of 32P-phosphorylated complex I by SDS-PAGE followed by N-terminal sequencing of the radiolabeled band with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa (10Papa S. Sardanelli A.M. Cocco T. Speranza F. Scacco S.C. Technikova-Dobrova Z. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The site of phosphorylation was not determined experimentally, but it was deduced from sequence motifs. 26 subunits of bovine complex I migrate on SDS-polyacrylamide gels in the molecular mass range of 10–20 kDa, and many of them are not resolved into protein bands containing unique subunits (13Carroll J.

Moreover, 14 of these subunits have N-α-amino groups that are rendered inaccessible to N-terminal sequencing by post-translational modifications. Therefore, we have reanalyzed the phosphorylation of bovine complex I. Two predominantly phosphorylated subunits with molecular masses of 18 and 10 kDa were detected. By a combination of Edman sequencing and mass spectrometric analysis, the band migrating at 18 kDa on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel was shown to contain three proteins, namely the 18-kDa subunit, subunit ESSS and the N-α-acetylated subunit, B17. The site of phosphorylation is in subunit ESSS, and neither the 18-kDa subunit nor subunit B17 was phosphorylated. The phosphorylated protein with a molecular mass of 10 kDa is the complex I subunit, MWFE. In both proteins, the exact site of phosphorylation was identified experimentally.

Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. J. Hirst. Phosphorylation of Mitochondria and Membranes—A portion of washed mitochondria (200 μg) recovered from a Percoll gradient or of submitochondrial particles (200 μg) was resuspended in 33 μl of buffer consisting of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 20 μg/ml oligomycin, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. A 1-μl solution containing 10 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, 2.5 mm ATP in 0.8 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.6 μl of 3 mm cAMP was added to the suspension of mitochondria or membranes. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, when 7 μl of a solution of 30% SDS was added to terminate the reaction. Phosphorylation of Complex I—A 16.2-μl sample of a solution of 1. 6 mg/ml bovine complex I dissolved in buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm sodium chloride, and 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was mixed with 8 μl of 0.2% aqueous n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 0.22 μl of 10 μg/ml oligomycin, 0.44 μl of protease inhibitors, and 0.22 μl of 10 μm cantharidin. This mixture was divided into two aliquots. To each were added 1 μl of 1 unit/μl protein kinase A solution, 0.25 μl of 3 mm cAMP, 0.75 μl of 2 mm ATP containing 0.33 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1 mCi/ml). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and then 10 μl of 5% SDS was added. The reaction products were fractionated by SDS-PAGE as described below. Protein Fractionation—The products of phosphorylation reactions were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 12–22% polyacrylamide gradient gels in the system of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and also on 13–18% polyacrylamide gradient gels by Tricine 1The abbreviations used are: Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; CID, collision-induced dissociation; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; MS, mass spectrometry; TOF, time-of-flight. SDS-PAGE (19Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). The proteins were stained for at least 15 min with a 0.25% solution of Coomassie Blue R-250 dye dissolved in 50% aqueous methanol containing 7% acetic acid. Then the gel was destained in 20% aqueous methanol containing 7% acetic acid, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Subunits of complex I that had been 32P-phosphorylated in vitro were fractionated by reverse phase HPLC on a column of C8 Aquapore RP-300 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 100 × 2.1-mm inner diameter) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The proteins were eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min as follows: 0–15 min, 0–24% acetonitrile; 15–85 min, 24–60% acetonitrile; 85–95 min, 60–80% acetonitrile. The UV absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 225 nm, and 100-μl fractions were collected. The radioactivity of a 30-μl portion of each fraction was measured by scintillation counting. Fractions were dried down, redissolved in 1% SDS, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Proteolytic Digestion of Protein Bands in Gels—Stained protein bands in SDS-polyacrylamide gels were excised, and the proteins were digested “in-gel” with various proteolytic enzymes, essentially as described for trypsin digests, except that ammonium bicarbonate buffer was replaced with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (14Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 20Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7785) Google Scholar). Digestions were carried out overnight at 37 °C, except that those with chymotrypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C were performed at 25 °C. The digestion buffers for trypsin and chymotrypsin, but for no other protease, contained 5 mm calcium chloride. Usually a portion of the tryptic digest was analyzed in a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (see below). The remaining digests (and other digests) were stored at –20 °C before being subjected to various analyses (see below). Edman Degradation of Radiolabeled Phosphopeptides—The specificities of cleavage of several proteases, combined with the positions of 32P-phosphorylated residues in peptides in digests with those enzymes, determined by release of radioactivity at a particular cycle in a sequential Edman degradation, are often sufficient to allow the precise site of phosphorylation in a protein of known sequence to be determined (21Wettenhall R.E. Aebersold R.H. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 186-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Campbell D.G. Morrice N.A. J. Biomol. Techn. 2002; 13: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar, 23MacDonald J.A. Mackey A.J. Pearson W.R. Haystead T.A. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 314-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This approach was tried out on the 42 kDa radiolabeled band. It proved to be successful, and so it was employed with the 18 kDa and 10 kDa radiolabeled bands from mitochondrial membranes, and also with subunits ESSS and MWFE from complex I. The total radioactivity in the extracts from in-gel proteolytic digests of bands from gels was measured. Then a sample of the digest, usually containing (100–1,000 cpm), was transferred to half a disc of a Sequelon-AA membrane, which has amino-phenyl groups available for attachment of peptides via their C-terminal carboxyls (24Coull J.M. Pappin D.J. Mark J. Aebersold R. Koster H. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The membrane was dried at room temperature and then kept at 55 °C for 15 min. It was wetted with 5 μl of water and dried again. The membrane was cooled to room temperature and a 5-μl solution of 10 mg/ml N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride in MES coupling buffer, supplied as part of a kit by Millipore, was applied to the membrane. The membrane was allowed to dry, and the process of adding 5 μl of coupling reagent and drying was repeated. The radioactivity on the membrane was estimated by counting the Cerenkov radiation. The membrane was rinsed sequentially with 80% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and finally 90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The yield of radioactive peptide(s) coupled to the membrane was estimated by remeasurement of the Cerenkov radiation. Usually, it was at least 70%. Then the membrane was introduced into a vertical sequencing cartridge of an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 protein sequencer, modified to deliver 90% aqueous methanol to extract anilinothiazolinones released by the acid cleavage step in the Edman cycle and to collect the extracts in a fraction collector. The radioactivity released at each cycle was measured by scintillation counting. Before attachment to the membrane of the Asp-N digest of the 18 kDa radiolabeled band from mitochondria or from complex I, glutamate 1 was removed by Edman degradation (22Campbell D.G. Morrice N.A. J. Biomol. Techn. 2002; 13: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Peptides—Samples (0.5 μl) of tryptic and chymotryptic digests, respectively, of the 18 kDa and 10 kDa radiolabeled bands of complex I obtained by in-gel proteolysis (20Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7785) Google Scholar) were mixed in a MALDI target plate with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml in 60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The sample was dried, and MALDI-TOF spectra were measured in a TOF Spec 2E instrument (Micromass, Altrincham, Cheshire, UK) in the reflectron and positive ion modes. Spectra from the tryptic digest were calibrated internally with two autolysis products of trypsin (m/z values, 2273.1600 and 2163.0570) and with a product from the matrix (m/z, 1060.0482). Spectra from the chymotryptic digest were calibrated with peptides from subunit B9 (m/z values, 1918.5050 and 1165.6040, from subunit SDAP (m/z, 1887.0228) and from subunit MWFE (m/z, 1605.8138). The measured peptide masses were used to search data bases of masses of predicted proteolytic fragments of proteins using the MASSLYNX program with an error tolerance of 30 ppm. Once candidate phosphopeptides had been identified, 2 μl of 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate was deposited on the peptide-matrix cocrystal on the MALDI plate. The crystals were mixed into the solution, and the samples were allowed to dry. Then 2 μl of 0.2 unit/ml alkaline phosphatase was mixed into the same samples (25Liao P.C. Leykam J. Andrews P.C. Gage D.A. Allison J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the plates were kept for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified vessel. The samples were dried at room temperature and acidified with 60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Then they were reanalyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The tryptic digests of the 18 kDa and the 10 kDa radiolabeled bands from mitochondrial membranes and from complex I, and the chymotryptic digest of the 10 kDa radiolabeled band from complex I were fractionated by liquid chromatography on capillary reverse phase C18 columns (either 100 × 0.18-mm inner diameter or 150 × 0.075-mm flow rates 1 μl/min or 0.15 μl/min, respectively). The eluate was introduced directly into a Q-TOF (Micromass) or a Q-STAR hybrid tandem mass spectrometer (MDS Sciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada). A sample of the tryptic digest of the 18 kDa radiolabeled band from complex I was desalted in a microtip containing the reverse phase chromatography support, Poros R2 (Perseptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). The bound peptides were eluted in 1–2 μl of 60% acetonitrile in 2% formic acid directly into a nanoelectrospray needle. Then the loaded needle was attached to a Q-STAR mass spectrometer. In the initial “survey” scan of samples introduced both by liquid chromatography and nanoelectrospray, m/z values of peptides in the range 400–1,200 were measured. Selected ions were fragmented by CID with argon, and spectra were recorded in the second mass analyzer. The spectra were searched against an NCBI nonredundant data base with the search tool MASCOT MS/MS Ions search (www.matrixscience.com). Peptide sequence tags were deduced from the data and compared with protein sequence data bases with PeptideSearch (26Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). For the analysis of phosphopeptides in the tryptic digest of the 18 kDa radiolabeled band of complex I, the digest was desalted in a nanotip containing Poros R3. The bound peptides were eluted with 50% methanol directly into a nanoelectrospray needle and then introduced into a Q-STAR mass spectrometer. Phosphopeptides were identified in tandem MS experiments by examining the data for precursor ions that lose 79 Da by CID (27Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 28Wilm M. Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded in negative ion mode from 400–1000 m/z with a step size of 0.5 Da and a dwell time of 50 ms, yielding a spectrum that contained only phosphopeptides. Phosphopeptide precursor ions were selected, fragmented by CID, and positive ion fragment ion spectra recorded. Phosphorylation of Proteins in Mitochondria—Purified mitochondria were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence and in the absence of cAMP, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (see Fig. 1). Three radiolabeled bands with apparent molecular masses of 29, 18, and 10 kDa were phosphorylated strongly in the presence of cAMP, but much more weakly so in its absence (Fig. 1, lanes (d) and (c), respectively). In contrast, a band at about 42 kDa was radiolabeled heavily in both the presence and the absence of cAMP. This band is likely to contain the E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (see below), which is phosphorylated in a cAMP-independent manner by mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase protein kinase (29Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). A large amount of radioactivity was detected also at the foot of the gel below stained bands, and a lesser amount at the top. The intensities of these radiolabeled bands were not influenced noticeably by the presence of cAMP (Fig. 1, lanes (c) and (d)). The lower band probably arises from radioactive substrate and contains phospholipids, but without further investigation, the presence of a small radiolabeled protein obscured by large amounts of radioactive substrate cannot be excluded. To investigate the properties of the phosphorylated amino acids in the radiolabeled proteins, the proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and treated with either acid or alkali (Fig. 1, lanes (e)–(h)). The radioactivity associated with the 42, 18, 16, and 10 kDa bands (and also of a much weaker band at 29 kDa) was resistant to acid treatment but was removed by alkali (Fig. 1, lanes (g) and (h)). Because phosphotyrosine is stable in both acid and alkali, and phosphohistidine is stable above pH 8.0 but labile under acidic conditions, and phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues are resistant to acid but labile under alkaline conditions (30Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), these experiments suggest that the 42-, 18-, 16-, and 10-kDa proteins (and the 29-kDa protein) are all phosphorylated on either serine or threonine residues. In these experiments, there was also evidence for the presence of a phosphorylated protein at 39 kDa (partially resolved from the 42 kDa band in Fig. 1, lane (e)), which had the properties of a protein phosphorylated on a histidine residue (Fig. 1(h). This protein is likely to be the α-subunit of succinyl-CoA ligase, which is autophosphorylated on histidine 259 (31Steiner A.W. Smith R.A. J. Neurochem. 1981; 37: 582-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present work, no attempt has been made to confirm the identity of this band. Analysis of 18- and 10-kDa Proteins Phosphorylated in Mitochondria—The protein contents of the 18 kDa and 10 kDa bands that were radiolabeled in mitochondria were analyzed by peptide mass mapping and tandem MS sequencing of peptides in tryptic digests of bands excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels. By this means, evidence was obtained for the presence in the 18 kDa band of three subunits of bovine complex I, namely subunits ESSS, B17, and the 18 k subunit (N-terminal sequence AQDQ) and subunit IV of cytochrome c oxidase. The 10 kDa band contained subunits SDAP, B9, MWFE, and MNLL from complex I, subunit VIII of complex III, subunit VIb of complex IV, and subunits F6 and g of the ATP synthase complex (see Supplemental data). Although subunits ESSS and B17 and the 18 k subunit are not resolved in the SDS-PAGE system of Laemmli, as is known (14Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), it is also known that in Tricine-SDS-PAGE (or “Schägger”) gels, the 18 k subunit is resolved as a band with higher apparent molecular mass than subunits ESSS and B17. Therefore, the radiolabeled 18 kDa band was excised from a Laemmli gel and incorporated into a Schägger gel. Two stained bands were observed after the second gel, and only the lower one was radioactive (Fig. 2). By peptide mass mapping, the upper band was shown to contain the 18 k subunit of complex I, and the lower band, subunits ESSS and B17 of the same complex. The gels were also run in reverse order, and essentially the same result was obtained (data not shown). Therefore, these experiments do not support the attribution of the 18 k (AQDQ) subunit as a site of phosphorylation in complex I (10Papa S. Sardanelli A.M. Cocco T. Speranza F. Scacco S.C. Technikova-Dobrova Z. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation of Inner Membranes and of Complex I—Submitochondrial particles prepared from bovine heart mitochondria were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by [32P]ATP in the presence of cAMP, and the proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Radioactivity was detected in two major regions around 18 and 10 kDa. As expected, the radioactive bands at 42 and 39 kDa (representing two mitochondrial matrix components, the E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase and the α-subunit of succinyl CoA ligase, respectively) were not present, nor was the unidentified 29-kDa component, detected in phosphorylation experiments with mitochondria (lane (c) and Fig. 1). Incorporation of radioactivity into both the 18 kDa and 10 kDa bands was stimulated by the addition of purified complex I (compare lanes (a) and (b) in Fig. 3). In complex I alone (lane (e)), the 18 kDa and 10 kDa bands were radiolabeled heavily, and no phosphorylation of the complex was observed in the absence of exogenous protein kinase A. In complex I (lane (e)), three weakly radiolabeled bands were also observed. At present, no attempt has been made to identify them, but they do not include the 42-kDa subunit, which has been reported to be phosphorylated in mitochondria (32Schulenberg B. Aggeler R. Beechem J.M. Capaldi R.A. Patton W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27251-27255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Identities of the Phosphorylated 18- and 10-kDa Subunits of Complex I—The subunits of in vitro32-P-phosphorylated complex I were fractionated by reverse phase HPLC, and the UV absorbance and the radioactivity of the eluant were monitored. Two major radioactive peaks eluting at 46 and 58% acetonitrile were found (Fig. 4, (a) and (b)). They both contained more than one component detected by staining with Coomassie Blue dye, but only single radioactive species with molecular masses of 18 and 10 kDa, respectively, were present. From previous HPLC analyses conducted on subcomplexes of complex I (14Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Hirst J. Walker J.E. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), it is known that these elution positions correspond to the MWFE and ESSS subunits of complex I. Subunits B9, SDAP, and MNLL, which were all detected by tandem MS peptide sequencing of the radiolabeled 10 kDa band in mitochondria, elute at 57, 54, and 38% acetonitrile, respectively, and subunit B17 and the 18 k subunit, found in the same way in the 18 kDa band of radiolabeled mitochondria, elute at 54 and 32% acetonitrile, respectively. Taken with other experiments described above, these data are sufficient to identify the phosphorylated subunits of bovine complex I as subunits ESSS and MWFE and to eliminate the 18 k subunit as a site of phosphorylation. These conclusions are borne out by experiments described below in which the phosphorylation sites have been identified directly by Edman sequencing and mass spectrometry. Identification of Phosphorylation Sites by Edman Sequencing—The procedure was tested with the 42 kDa radiolabeled band from mitochondria. It confirmed that the E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase is phosphorylated on serine 264, at the so-called “site 1” (33Yeaman S.J. Hutcheson E.T. Roche T.E. Pettit F.H. Brown J.R. Reed L.J. Watson D.C. Dixon G.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2364-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Details of these experiments are presented in the Supplemental data. Then the procedure was used to analyze the 18 and 10 kDa radiolabeled bands from mitochondria and from complex I. Radioactivity was released by Edman degradation at cycles 3, 6, and 19 of the tryptic, chymotryptic, and endoproteinase Asp-N digests, respectively, of the 18 kDa radiolabeled band both in mitochondria and in complex I (Figs. 5 and 6). These results are consistent with the phosphorylation of serine 20 of the ESSS subunit. They cannot be reconciled with the sequences of either the"

The organization of these membrane assemblies is affected significantly in heterozygous ic (ichthyosis) mutants, resulting in a variety of structural abnormalities and nuclear defects. IntroductionA significant proportion of heterochromatin is localized in the periphery of the cell nucleus and maintains a close spatial association with the inner nuclear membrane (1Carvalho C.

This spatial association reflects a multiplicity of interactions between chromatin components and integral or peripheral proteins of the nuclear envelope (NE) 1The abbreviations used are: NE, nuclear envelope; HP1, heterochromatin protein 1; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; NG, nuclear ghost; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LBR, lamin B receptor; NEPH, nuclear envelope peripheral heterochromatin fraction.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3791-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Because chromatin is extensively and differentially modified (8Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 9Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), it is tempting to think that certain epigenetic marks or factors associated with histone modifying enzymes provide binding sites for NE proteins. However, it is equally possible that transcriptionally active, noncondensed chromatin is subjected to silencing and “heterochromatinization” upon contact to the NE. Both of these hypotheses receive experimental support: chromatin that is silenced through binding to SIRs can tether itself to the NE (10Spector D.L. Gasser S.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), whereas targeting of marker genes to the inner nuclear membrane suppresses their expression (11Andrulis E.D. Neiman A.M. Zappulla D.C. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1998; 394: 592-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar).One of the factors that have been implicated in chromatin anchorage to the NE is the lamin B receptor (12Worman H.J. Yuan J. Blobel G. Georgatos S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1988; 85: 8531-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). LBR is a polytopic inner nuclear membrane protein consisting of a long, N-terminal domain, seven or eight hydrophobic transmembrane regions, and a C-terminal tail (13Worman H.J. Evans C.D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of the molecule protrudes to the nucleoplasm and contains multiple serine-arginine motifs that are phosphorylated by the SRPK1 and the cdc2 kinases (14Nikolakaki E. Simos G.

Pezhman A. Worman H.J. Genomics. 1998; 54: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Immunodepletion of LBR from detergent-solubilized NE vesicles results in proteoliposomes with a diminished ability to bind chromatin. Furthermore, direct binding of electrophoretically purified LBR to metaphase chromosomes can be demonstrated by in vitro assays (17Pyrpasopoulou A. Meier J. Maison C. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7108-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Corroborating these observations, anti-LBR antibodies block nuclear assembly in sea urchin egg extracts (18Collas P. Courvalin J.C. Poccia D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), whereas direct (19Ye Q. Worman H.J. J. Biol.

To address these issues, we have isolated fragments of peripheral heterochromatin attached to the inner nuclear membrane. These subcellular fractions were utilized to affinity select mononucleosomes that associate with LBR and investigate LBR-LBR interactions. The results obtained reveal specific modification “signatures” in LBR-associated histones and indicate that LBR interacts with peripheral heterochromatin as a higher oligomer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—Chicken and turkey erythrocytes were obtained from whole blood. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 2 mm penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Mouse fibroblasts were maintained in RPMI medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 2 mm penicillin/streptomycin, 10% fetal calf serum, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol.Antibodies—The characterization of anti-chicken LBR antibodies has been described previously (17Pyrpasopoulou A. Meier J. Maison C. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7108-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Meier J. Georgatos S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 15: 1888-1898Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Anti-mammalian LBR antibodies were produced using an antigen His-tagged N-terminal domain of human LBR. Both antibodies were affinity-purified in Affi-Gel matrices to which the N-terminal domains of chicken and human LBR were coupled. Anti-dimethylated Lys4 and acetylated Lys14 histone H3 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The characterization of anti-trimethylated Lys9 histone H3 antibodies has been described (22Cowell I.G. Aucott R. Mahadevaiah S.K. Burgoyne P.S. Huskisson N. Bongiorni S. Prantera G. Fanti L.

Affinity-purified secondary antibodies and Alexa Fluor goat anti-rabbit and donkey anti-rat IgGs were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Cell Fractionation and Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—NEs were prepared from turkey erythrocyte nuclei, essentially as specified by Refs. 17Pyrpasopoulou A.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar with slight modifications. Briefly, after three rounds of DNase I digestion (80 μg/ml in 10 mm NaPO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF/protease inhibitors for 15 min at room temperature, with 200 μg/ml RNase A included in the last digestion step), the resulting nuclear ghosts (NGs) were washed in buffer I (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF), sonicated to induce vesiculation, and stored at -80 °C. NE vesicles were further purified in flotation gradients (70, 50, 30, and 20% sucrose cushions; 100,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C), collecting at the 50–30% interface. The extracts were prepared by thorough resuspension of NE vesicles or sonicated NGs in 300–600 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitors, plus or minus 1% Triton X-100 (buffers S and ST, respectively). After ultracentrifugation (200–350,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), the soluble extracts (SE, “just salt” extract using buffer S; STE, salt and Triton extract using buffer ST) were collected and either used immediately, or further fractionated in 5–20% sucrose density gradients (100,000 × g at 4 °C for 18 h). A euchromatin-enriched fraction was prepared by digesting whole nuclei with DNase I (80 μg/ml, as described above). The digest was adjusted to 300 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble phase was used in pull-down assays (see below).Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-fused, and His6-tagged proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells and purified from lysates according to standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Microscopy—For light microscopy, the samples were fixed with 1–4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 0.5% fish skin gelatin. DNA staining (4′,6-diamidino-2′-phenylindole-dihydrochrolide, propidium iodide) and probing with the relevant primary and secondary antibodies was performed according to Ref. 25Maison C. Horstmann H. Georgatos S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1491-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar. The specimens were visualized in a Leica SP confocal microscope.Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins (LBR-GST, M31-GST, or GST alone; 10–30 μg) were incubated first for 30 min at room temperature with 30 μl of glutathione-agarose beads in buffer S or ST (see above under “Cell Fractionation and Preparation of Nuclear Extracts”). After washing three times with the same medium, the beads were combined with nuclear extracts (SE, STE, or a DNase I digest of whole nuclei) and further incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed five times with buffer ST and once with isotonic buffer (buffer I, see “Cell Fractionation and Preparation of Nuclear Extracts”) before eluting the bound proteins with hot SDS sample buffer.Purification of Native LBR and Affinity Chromatography in Affi-Gel Matrices—Full-length, NE-associated LBR was isolated by preparative SDS-PAGE and elution from gel pieces, essentially as described in Ref. 17Pyrpasopoulou A. Meier J. Maison C. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7108-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar. The eluted protein was reconstituted in 100 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 2% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.05 mm DTT and dialyzed against 100 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm PMSF (for 5 h at room temperature). Coupling to Affi-Gel 10/15 was done as recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). SEs were applied to the Affi-Gel-LBR column and batch-incubated for 90 min at room temperature. After thorough washing with buffer S (15 column volumes), bound material was eluted either with hot SDS sample buffer or with 1 m NaCl, 5 m urea, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF.Other Methods—Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed at the Functional Genomics Unit of Moredun Research Institute (Edinburgh, UK). Protein bands were digested with R-specific protease. ΔM (the difference between the measured and calculated masses) was at the level of 1/10,000. Peak assignment was done either manually or using appropriate Expasy programs. Ambiguous peaks (e.g. those detected in histones precipitated by recombinant or endogenous LBR but not with the complex of recombinant and endogenous protein) were not taken into account. SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and column chromatography were practiced according to established procedures.RESULTSLBR Associates with Peripheral Heterochromatin—Subnuclear fractions highly enriched in peripheral heterochromatin were isolated from avian erythrocytes. Intact nuclei were extensively digested with DNase I and RNase A, yielding NGs. Consistent with previous observations (26Harris J.R. Brown J.N. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1971; 36: 8-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Harris J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 55-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), NGs were devoid of nuclear content and retained only a layer of peripheral heterochromatin (Fig. 1A). 2D. Makatsori, N. Kourmouli, H. Polioudaki, L. D. Shultz, K. Mclean, P. A. Theodoropoulos, P. B. Singh, and S. D. Georgatos, unpublished data. This “residual” chromatin was cut at multiple sites by DNase I and represented mononucleosomal particles with variable portions of linker DNA (see broad band at 150–200 bp in Fig. 1B). As could be expected (8Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar), NE-associated chromatin was essentially depleted of Lys4-dimethylated histone H3 but possessed Lys9-trimethylated histone H3 (Fig. 1D).On a mg/mg basis, NGs contained significantly more histones than NE proteins (e.g. lamins and LBR; Fig. 1C). However, upon further fractionation in sucrose flotation gradients, loosely attaching chromatin dissociated from the inner nuclear membrane and the material collecting at the 30–50% interface (nuclear envelope-peripheral heterochromatin fraction (NEPH)) possessed almost stoichiometric amounts of histones and NE proteins (Fig. 1C).To examine whether LBR associates with a specific fraction of chromatin, we performed pull-down experiments using exogenous (recombinant) LBR. As shown in Fig. 2 (A, B, and E), a GST fusion protein corresponding to the N-terminal domain of LBR precipitated roughly stoichiometric amounts of heterochromatin-derived core particles obtained from NG and NEPH salt extracts. However, unlike recombinant HP1 (M31), recombinant LBR did not precipitate nucleosomes when NEPH extracts were substituted with euchromatin-enriched DNase I digests of whole nuclei (Fig. 2C). The binding of HP1 to particles released by DNase I digestion is consistent with recent observations that reveal a role of this protein in the organization of both hetero- and euchromatin (28Piacentini L. Fanti L. Berloco M. Perrini B. Pimpinelli S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the selective association of LBR with nucleosomes that co-fractionate with the NE indicates a preference for peripheral heterochromatin. Consistent with this idea, when permeabilized HeLa cells were incubated with recombinant LBR, the nuclear periphery was intensely decorated, whereas under the same conditions, the staining of internal nuclear sites was rather faint (Fig. 2G).Fig. 2LBR binding to peripheral heterochromatin. A, material precipitated by recombinant LBR-GST from salt extracts (SE) of floated NEPHs.

Meier J. Maison C. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7108-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), native (endogenous) LBR purified by preparative electrophoresis and coupled to Affi-Gel also “selected” a fraction of nucleosomes contained in SEs (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 3). This enabled comparisons of the chemical modifications in histones H3/H4 associated with either the native or the recombinant protein (see below).Modification Signatures of NE/LBR-associated Chromatin—To characterize the LBR-associated chromatin fraction, we excised the histone H3/H4 bands from SDS gels (similar to those shown in Fig. 2, A, B, and D) and subjected the samples to mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS). To be more systematic, we also analyzed histones co-precipitating with a complex of recombinant and endogenous LBR (for details see Fig. 3A). As shown in Table I, nucleosomes affinity-selected by LBR and nucleosomes extracted from NEs yielded almost the same histone H3/H4 modification signatures. Some of the peaks detected in the histones that co-precipitated with recombinant or a complex of endogenous and recombinant LBR were not detected in the samples eluted from Affi-Gel columns containing exclusively endogenous LBR. However, these differences were minor and did not alter the overall picture emerging from the mass spectrometric data (for instance, most of the missing peaks corresponded to either nonmodified or partially modified peptides and not to fully modified ones).Fig. 3LBR self-association in STE extracts.

First, Lys4 of histone H3 was not modified, consistent with the indirect immunofluorescence data presented in Fig. 1D; second, although histone H3 monoacetylated in Lys18 or Lys23 could be readily identified, species acetylated in both residues were not detected. This was observed with several different preparations and did not change when the chromatin fractions were isolated in the presence of sodium butyrate.In LBR-associated nucleosomes, the histone fold domain of H3 and H4 was largely nonmodified (with the exception of Lys79 in histone H3). Lys27 and Lys36 of H3 were modified by trimethylation, whereas H4 was dimethylated in Lys20 and partially or fully acetylated at Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, and Lys16. Histone H3 was heavily modified in the region 9–17, which contains Lys9 and Lys14. Because the mass difference corresponding to lysine trimethylation is equal to that of lysine acetylation, a peak at 971.5 daltons could be assigned either to a dimethylated/acetylated or to a dimethylated/trimethylated 9–17 peptide. Likewise, another peak at 985.5 could be attributed either to a twice trimethylated or to a trimethylated/acetylated peptide. Pull-down assays with recombinant LBR and Western blotting with anti-histone modification antibodies showed that H3 subspecies trimethylated at Lys9 or acetylated Lys14 were present in the LBR precipitate, albeit to a different extent (Fig. 2F). Although this does not prove that LBR-associated nucleosomes contain histone H3 that is simultaneously modified at Lys9 and Lys14, it can be safely concluded that acetylation in Lys14 is not incompatible with heterochromatin association and LBR binding.LBR Self-associates under in Vitro Conditions—When salt/detergent extracts (STE) were used in the pull-down experiments instead of just salt SEs, we noticed that recombinant LBR consistently precipitated a protein co-migrating with endogenous, full-length LBR and traces of nuclear lamin B (Fig. 3A). The presence of endogenous LBR in the LBR-GST precipitate could be confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B) and explained either by “cross-linking” through nucleosomes/lamin B and/or direct LBR-LBR binding (oligomerization). To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed the pull-down assay at 0.3 m salt and subsequently washed the precipitates with increasing NaCl concentrations (notice that co-precipitation of native LBR and nucleosomes with recombinant LBR is abolished at 0.6 m NaCl; Fig. 3A). As illustrated in Fig. 3C, native LBR was retained in the LBR-GST precipitate after washing with 0.4, 0.45, or 0.5 m salt, when all of the nucleosomes had detached. Furthermore, direct evidence for in vitro oligomerization was obtained using GST-tagged and His6-tagged LBR. As shown in Fig. 4A, the two forms of recombinant LBR co-precipitated. In addition, LBR-GST/LBR-His6 complexes were readily detectable in nondenaturing acrylamide gels (Fig. 4B). Finally, LBR-His6 could be cross-linked by glutaraldehyde, yielding dimers and higher order oligomers. Under the same conditions, a control protein of analogous charge and molecular mass (cytochrome c) was not cross-linked (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4LBR oligomerization.

To explore this idea, we proceeded with morphological experiments. A striking, “lumpy” fluorescence pattern was observed when avian erythrocytes were decorated by chicken LBR-specific, affinity-purified antibodies and examined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5, C and D). This discontinuous pattern contrasted the smooth, uniform staining of the nuclear periphery with anti-lamin A and anti-lamin B antibodies (Fig. 5, A and B) and was apparent at both xy and xz optical sections (see below). Discrete LBR “islets” could also be discerned when Triton-permeabilized erythrocytes were examined by pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 5E).Fig. 5In situ organization of LBR in avian erythrocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2009542872,"Transferrin receptor (TfR) is a dimeric cell surface protein that binds both the serum iron transport protein transferrin (Fe-Tf) and HFE, the protein mutated in patients with the iron overload disorder hereditary hemochromatosis. HFE and Fe-Tf can bind simultaneously to TfR to form a ternary complex, but HFE binding to TfR lowers the apparent affinity of the Fe-Tf/TfR interaction. This apparent affinity reduction could result from direct competition between HFE and Fe-Tf for their overlapping binding sites on each TfR polypeptide chain, from negative cooperativity, or from a combination of both. To explore the mechanism of the affinity reduction, we constructed a heterodimeric TfR that contains mutations such that one TfR chain binds only HFE and the other binds only Fe-Tf. Binding studies using a heterodimeric form of soluble TfR demonstrate that TfR does not exhibit cooperativity in heterotropic ligand binding, suggesting that some or all of the effects of HFE on iron homeostasis result from competition with Fe-Tf for TfR binding. Experiments using transfected cell lines demonstrate a physiological role for this competition in altering HFE trafficking patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2066439422,"Interferon (IFN) α induces a caspase-dependent apoptosis that is associated with activation of the proapoptotic Bak and Bax, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and release of cytochrome c. In addition to the onset of the classical Jak-STAT pathway, IFNα also induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K activity by Ly294002 disrupted IFN-induced apoptosis upstream of mitochondria. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin or by overexpression of a kinase dead mutant of mTOR, efficiently blocked IFNα-induced apoptosis. A PI3K and mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 repressor was induced by IFNα treatment of cells and was strongly inhibited by Ly294002 or rapamycin. The activation of Jak-STAT signaling upon IFNα stimulation was not affected by abrogating PI3K/mTOR pathway. Neither was the expression of several IFNα target genes affected, nor the ability of IFNα to protect against virus-induced cell death affected by inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway. These data demonstrate that an intact PI3K/mTOR pathway is necessary for the ability of IFNα to induce apoptosis, whereas activation of the Jak-STAT pathway alone appears to be insufficient for this specific IFNα-induced effect."

Kanaar R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2030-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 4West S.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Each step of HR, including presynapsis, strand exchange, and postsynapsis, is catalyzed by a network of interacting proteins comprising Rad51, Rad52, and many other recombination mediator proteins (5Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The “catalytic triad” of presynapsis is Rad51, Rad52, and replication protein A (RPA). When double-strand breaks occur in DNA, RPA binds and protects exposed ssDNA ends until they can be coated by Rad51 (7Gasior S.L. Olivares H. Ear U. Hari D.M. Weichselbaum R. Bishop D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8411-8418Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It also removes secondary structures that prevent formation of a continuous Rad51 filament (8Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Rad51 forms a helical filament along the exposed ssDNA, hydrolyzing ATP in the process (9Yu X. Jacobs S.A. West S.C. Ogawa T. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8419-8424Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It then catalyzes the homologous pairing and strand exchange steps of HR (10Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Rad52 facilitates the displacement of RPA by Rad51, a step necessary for efficient nucleoprotein filament formation, via direct interactions with both RPA and Rad51 (11Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31663-31672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In strand exchange reactions, Rad52 catalyzes HR by helping Rad51 overcome the inhibitory effects of RPA-coated ssDNA (12Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 13New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The structural interactions of the presynaptic proteins have been studied extensively. NMR and x-ray crystal structures are available for each domain of RPA (14Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L.

Interactions between several of the domains have been characterized (16Mer G. Bochkarev A. Gupta R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Ingles C.J. Edwards A.M. Chazin W.J.

Biol. 2002; 321: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but there are no published structures of any complexes. Indeed, the structural basis for the catalytic effect of Rad52 is still not fully understood. One of the key unanswered questions is whether or not Rad52 facilitates a direct interaction between Rad51 and RPA. Evidence supporting this idea comes from studies of the yeast protein network that have shown that Rad52 cannot by itself displace RPA from ssDNA; Rad52 needs Rad51 (11Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31663-31672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Also, a direct interaction between human RPA and Rad51 has been reported by Golub et al. (23Golub E.I. Gupta R.C. Haaf T. Wold M.S. Radding C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5388-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Evidence against a direct RPA-Rad51 interaction is based on studies showing that Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein can substitute for RPA in several steps of the strand exchange reaction (8Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and on the fact that a ternary RPA-Rad51-DNA complex has never been isolated (11Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31663-31672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the latter findings pertain to yeast proteins, and species specificity may be a determining factor in how different systems perform HR. For instance, a RAD52-null mutation renders Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells nearly incapable of double-strand break repair, whereas the same mutation in mouse cells has only a modest effect on HR levels and no effect at all on DNA repair or meiosis (27Rijkers T. Van Den Ouweland J. Morolli B. Rolink A.G. Baarends W.M. Van Sloun P.P. Lohman P.H. Pastink A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6423-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Likewise, Rad51 protein is essential for viability of mammalian organisms, whereas in yeast cells it is dispensable (28Tsuzuki T. Fujii Y. Sakumi K. Tominaga Y. Nakao K. Sekiguchi M. Matsushiro A. Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6236-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Although functional redundancy may explain some or most of these phenomena, species-specific protein interactions likely also play a part. Indeed, Shen et al. (22Shen Z. Cloud K.G. Chen D.J. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 148-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) have pointed out that the Rad51-interacting region of human Rad52 has no sequence similarity with the same region of yeast Rad52, implying that the interaction is species-specific. Subsequent data from Kurumizaka et al. (24Kurumizaka H. Aihara H. Kagawa W. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) established that human Rad52 binds to a completely different domain of Rad51 than the yeast protein. This article reports the biochemical and structural characterization of a specific interaction between human RPA and Rad51. The initial work was carried out using the known minimal structural domains, and then the findings were tested in the context of the full-length proteins. Our results provide the first evidence that the physical interaction between RPA and Rad51 plays a role in initiating HR events in humans. They also support a general functional mechanism of regulating DNA processing by altering the ability of RPA to bind ssDNA. Protein Expression and Purification—The Rad51 expression plasmid was obtained from Dr. Jeffrey Holt of Vanderbilt University. Full-length Rad51 protein was purified by the method of Kurumizaka et al. (24Kurumizaka H. Aihara H. Kagawa W. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (Rad51N, residues 1–93) was subcloned into pET15b (Novagen) using PCR amplification followed by ligation into the predigested vector. RPA constructs (RPA70AB, residues 181–422; RPA70A, residues 181–291; and full-length RPA heterotrimer) were expressed as His6 N-terminal fusions from pET15b plasmids kindly provided by Dr. Alexey Bochkarev of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. For all constructs, protein expression was achieved by growing overnight cultures of Rosetta pLysS cells (Novagen) at 37 °C in LB. These were used to inoculate 1-liter batches of LB, which were grown at 37 °C until A600 ∼ 0.7. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and the cultures were incubated for 3 h longer. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at -80 °C until lysis. To obtain isotopically labeled proteins, cultures were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as a nitrogen source. For RPA70AB, RPA70A, and Rad51N, cell pellets were resuspended in an appropriate volume (∼5 ml/g) of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm BME, 10% glycerol. Cells were lysed by sonication in the presence of lysozyme, and the soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation. The cleared supernatant was loaded onto a 25-ml Ni2+ affinity column in lysis buffer. The His-tagged protein was eluted with a 25-ml gradient of 10–500 mm imidazole. RPA70AB was further purified by passage over a MonoQ column, followed by elution in a gradient of 10–500 mm KCl in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mm BME. His tags were removed from RPA70A and Rad51N as follows. The fractions from the Ni2+ column were exchanged by dialysis or centrifugal concentration into 10 mm Tris or Hepes, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm BME. Thrombin was added at ∼1 unit/mg of protein, and aliquots were taken at various time points to monitor cleavage of the His tag by SDS-PAGE. At completion, the sample was concentrated and loaded onto a 16/60 Superdex-75 sizing column in the same buffer. The desired protein was efficiently separated from both high molecular weight contaminants and the His tag by this step, and protein yields were typically 10–15 mg/liter. Full-length RPA heterotrimer was purified by essentially the same protocol as described for RPA70A, excluding the thrombin cleavage step. Proteolysis Reactions—20 ng of proteinase K were added to ∼20 μgof Rad51N or RPA70AB or the combination thereof in a reaction volume of 85 μl. 10-μl aliquots were removed at the specified times for SDS-PAGE analysis. Reactions were run in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm BME at room temperature. Protease stock solution was made fresh on the day of the experiment. NMR Data Acquisition—NMR samples of 15N-labeled Rad51N, RPA70A, and RPA70AB were prepared at 0.3–0.8 mm in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm BME, 1 μm NaN3. Standard 15N-1H HSQC experiments were performed at 300 K on a Bruker Avance 800-MHz spectrometer using an inverse detection probe head equipped with triple-axis gradients. Unlabeled protein additions were made directly from a concentrated stock with concentration and pH adjustments made to the NMR sample as needed. Spectra were processed and visualized in Felix2000 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Peak assignments for both RPA70A and Rad51N spectra were obtained by transfer from previously collected and published data (18Aihara H. Ito Y. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Bhattacharya S. Arunkumar A.I. Sullivan S.L. Botuyan M.-V. Arrowsmith C.H. Chazin W.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 195-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For the RPA displacement experiment, a single-stranded oligonucleotide (d-CTTCA) was added from a concentrated stock into a sample of the preformed RPA70A-Rad51N complex. Resonances were observed for the 15N-labeled Rad51N protein domain over three sequential additions resulting in a slight excess of oligonucleotide. Chemical shift mapping was performed by recording the chemical shift of each peak before the titration and again at saturation. The normalized change in chemical shift was calculated by the formula sqrt[(ΔH)2 + (ΔN/n)2], where ΔH and ΔN are the linear change along the 1H and 15N axes, respectively, and n is the ratio of the chemical shift dispersion in 15N and 1H. Chemical shift perturbations were determined to be significant if they were ≥0.03 ppm for RPA70A and ≥0.04 ppm for Rad51N. Fluorescence Data Acquisition—Titrations and displacement assays were carried out at 25 °C on a Fluoromax-3 fluorometer from Jobin Yvon. Tryptophan fluorescence was monitored by excitation at 295 nm and detection of emission at 345 nm. Slit widths were 1 mm. Contributions of buffer and Rad51N to the signal were subtracted from each measurement. RPA70A has two tryptophans, one at the DNA-protein-binding site and one at a remote location. For protein-DNA interaction titrations, RPA70A concentrations were ∼20 μm, and Rad51N was added up to a 3× molar excess. Single-stranded DNA (d-CTTCA) was added in 1–2 μm increments from a concentrated stock. Calculation of Dissociation Constants—The NMR and fluorescence data were plotted as cumulative fluorescence or chemical shift change versus concentration of the added protein or DNA molecule. The resulting curves were fit to the following equation ΔFobsΔFmax=Kd+No+Ro−(Kd+No+Ro)2−4RoNo2Ro(Eq. 1) which was derived from the basic formulas Kd=(Ro−RN)(No−RN)RN(Eq. 2) RN=Ro(ΔFobsΔFmax)(Eq. 3) where Fobs = the observed fluorescence change at each titration point, Fmax = the maximum observed fluorescence change during the titration, Ro = total RPA concentration, No = total Rad51N concentration, and RN = complex concentration. In each formula, F can be substituted with δ for the NMR chemical shift change; both types of data are fit in the same way. DNA concentration was substituted for protein where appropriate. The program Xmgr was used to perform the least squares-fitting procedure, and the values for Kd, Fmax, and the constant molecule concentration were allowed to float. Docking Calculations—The program HADDOCK (30Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar) was used to dock RPA70A and Rad51N using ambiguous restraints. Protein Data Bank files were obtained for Rad51N (code 1B22) and RPA70AB (code 1FGU). Only the coordinates for the A domain of RPA were used. Active and passive residues were selected according to the specifications of Dominguez et al. (30Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). The HADDOCK protocol defines active residues as those that undergo a significant chemical shift perturbation and have a high solvent accessibility in the free protein structure. Passive residues are those that either undergo a less significant chemical shift perturbation or are surface neighbors to active residues and that have a high solvent accessibility. Interface segments were defined as residues 16–22, 54–60, 66–70, and 70–78 for Rad51N and residues 208–220 and 258–277 for RPA70A. Chemical shift perturbations were the only experimental restraint type incorporated into the calculation. Default settings were used for the topology and parameter files, for structure sorting, and for all simulated annealing stages. In the final run reported here, 1000 structures were docked, and 200 of those were refined and analyzed according to the HADDOCK algorithm. The best 100 structures were selected for water refinement in the last stage. Minimum cluster size was set to 4 with a maximum pairwise backbone root mean square deviation of 1.5 Å. Structures were visualized in InsightII version 2000.1 (Accelrys Inc.). Rad51N Mutants—Point mutations were incorporated into the Rad51N or full-length Rad51 expression plasmids using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Briefly, PCR was performed using complementary primers that incorporated the desired mutation. The entire plasmid was amplified, and the methylated parental strand was digested by DpnI enzyme. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the Vanderbilt DNA-sequencing facility. Mutant proteins were expressed and purified as was done for the wild type, and their behavior in solution was indistinguishable from the wild type. ATP Hydrolysis Assays—The ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of Rad51 was measured following the protocol of Sugiyama and Kowalczykowski (11Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31663-31672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Experiments were performed in a buffer of 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm (NH4)2SO4. A standard experiment contained ∼1 μm Rad51 protein, 0.3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 8 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 13 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 2.5 mm ATP, and 250 μm NADH. For the Rad51-first conditions, the sample was equilibrated at 37 °C for 20 min, followed by addition of ΦX-174 viral ssDNA (New England Biolabs, 2.7 μm final concentration). The absorbance at 340 nm was monitored for the next 40–60 min, after which RPA was added to ∼1 μm. For RPA-first conditions, 0.3 μm RPA was equilibrated at 37 °Cinthe reaction buffer and assay components with 2.7 μm ssDNA. After 20–40 min, Rad51 protein was added at various concentrations as shown in Fig. 5A. A340 was recorded for 60 min thereafter. The rate of hydrolysis was determined from the difference in A340 at 45 and 55 min after the addition of Rad51 protein ((ΔA340/s × 9880) = rate of ATP hydrolysis in μm/min). Average background values (the ATP hydrolysis rates measured just prior to addition of Rad51 protein) were determined to be 0.21 and 0.22 for the wild-type and mutant data sets, respectively. The goal of these studies was to demonstrate that the exchange of RPA for Rad51 on ssDNA requires physical interaction between the proteins. Our strategy was to identify the exact points of contact and then use functional assays to test the relevance of the interaction. The domain mapping of the binding sites was greatly facilitated by the knowledge of the domain structures of both RPA and Rad51. This allowed a rapid determination of the contact points and the design of mutations to probe the accuracy of the structural model. The corresponding mutations in intact Rad51 were then used in an RPA displacement assay to demonstrate the functional relevance of physical interaction between the two proteins. Defining the Binding Site—The RPA heterotrimer consists of 70-, 32-, and 14-kDa subunits. The 70-kDa subunit (RPA70) possesses four structured domains: N, A, B, and C. The N domain is involved primarily in protein interactions, whereas domain C binds only to ssDNA. The bifunctional region comprising domains A and B (RPA70AB) contains both high affinity ssDNA-binding sites and protein association capability. Golub et al. (23Golub E.I. Gupta R.C. Haaf T. Wold M.S. Radding C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5388-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) have previously localized a Rad51-binding site to residues 181–326 of RPA70, which includes the A domain and about one-fourth of the B domain. Since fractional portions of a structured domain are not likely to be functionally relevant, we began this investigation by determining precisely where Rad51 interacts within the tandem RPA70AB construct (residues 181–422). Since the C-terminal domain of Rad51 is associated with catalytic activity, we surmised that the N-terminal domain (residues 1–93) might be involved in interactions with RPA. Indeed, limited proteolysis experiments on RPA70AB revealed that addition of Rad51N results in a reduction of the rate of digestion by proteinase K (Fig. 1A). Previous studies (18Aihara H. Ito Y. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Bhattacharya S. Arunkumar A.I. Sullivan S.L. Botuyan M.-V. Arrowsmith C.H. Chazin W.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 195-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) had shown that both RPA70AB and Rad51N are amenable to analysis by NMR spectroscopy. Consequently, this approach was used for detailed mapping of the binding sites. Previously determined assignments of the NMR signals for RPA70AB (29Bhattacharya S. Arunkumar A.I. Sullivan S.L. Botuyan M.-V. Arrowsmith C.H. Chazin W.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 28: 195-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) were used to localize the interaction with Rad51N to residues solely in the A domain (residues 181–291). Fig. 1B shows the NMR spectra for RPA70AB before and after addition of Rad51N. The spectra display specific resonance perturbations, all of which correspond to residues in the A domain. No significant changes are observed in any residues from RPA70B (residues 299–422), indicating a lack of interaction between Rad51N and this domain of RPA. This result is consistent with our previous finding that the individual A and B domains function independently as a result of their linkage by a flexible eight-residue tether (31Arunkumar A.I. Stauffer M.E. Bochkareva E. Bochkarev A. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41077-41082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It also confirms that the Rad51N-binding region is located within residues 181–326 of RPA70 (23Golub E.I. Gupta R.C. Haaf T. Wold M.S. Radding C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5388-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To map the binding site more specifically, reciprocal NMR titrations were performed for RPA70A and Rad51N. Our analysis involved titration of an unlabeled protein (the unobserved partner) into a sample of 15N-labeled protein (the observed partner), with spectra collected at each addition. Peaks that moved during the course of the titration correspond to amino acid residues whose chemical environments changed as a direct or indirect result of the protein interaction. Fig. 2A shows an overlay of spectra for each protein in the absence and presence of its binding partner. Significant chemical shift perturbations were observed for residues 15–21 and 85 in Rad51N (Fig. 2B). The large number of chemical shift changes at the N and C termini, as compared with the interior amino acids in the sequence, is due to the flexible nature of the structure in these regions (18Aihara H. Ito Y. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In RPA70A, residues 196, 209, 212, 214, 216, 218–220, 234, 263, 265–269, and 280 exhibited significant chemical shift perturbations (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C depicts the interacting surface of each protein based on NMR chemical shift mapping. The data reveal that Rad51N has separate binding sites for DNA and RPA, whereas RPA70A binds to both ssDNA and Rad51N at the same site. This result is suggestive of competition at the RPA70A binding site. Competition for the Binding Site in RPA70A—Modulation of the ssDNA binding affinity of RPA by protein interaction has its precedent in the SV40 viral replication system. Studies in our laboratory on the interaction of the origin-binding domain of T-antigen with RPA70AB reveal a clear allosteric effect on the binding of ssDNA by RPA70AB. 2A. I. Arunkumar and W. J. Chazin, unpublished results. This prompted us to test whether or not Rad51 operates by the same mechanism. Thus, the effect of the Rad51N-RPA70A interaction on the affinity of RPA70A for ssDNA was examined. Fluorescence titrations observing the addition of ssDNA to RPA70A were carried out in the presence and absence of saturating concentrations of Rad51N (Fig. 3A). The difference between the calculated dissociation constants in the absence and presence of Rad51N was well within the error of the measurement. Thus, the interaction between Rad51N and RPA70A has no significant effect on the ssDNA binding capacity of RPA70A. To confirm this conclusion, the NMR chemical shift perturbations of RPA70A upon addition of Rad51N were fit to the standard binding equation. The average dissociation constant of 108 ± 59 μm estimated in this manner is about 100× weaker than the average affinity for ssDNA (31Arunkumar A.I. Stauffer M.E. Bochkareva E. Bochkarev A. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41077-41082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In complementary NMR experiments, ssDNA was added to a sample of 15N-enriched Rad51N preloaded with RPA70A. Fig. 3B shows that when increasing amounts of ssDNA are added, the NMR signals of Rad51N revert from their positions in the protein complex back to locations characteristic of free Rad51N. This result confirms the location of the binding site indicated by chemical shift mapping and also shows direct competition between ssDNA and Rad51N for the binding site on RPA70A. We note that the inability of Rad51N to displace RPA70A from a pentadeoxynucleotide runs counter to its known biochemical function in vivo. To understand this, it is important to consider that recombination is initiated by full-length Rad51 and RPA on long tracts of DNA. Clearly, there are additional factors beyond what is found in this study of domains extracted from their normal biological context. It is therefore imperative to test the functional relevance of the Rad51N-RPA70A interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2012828106,"Neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase) has been proposed to mediate interleukin (IL)-1beta signaling in liver. In this paper, we used adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to inducibly express FLAG-tagged mouse NSMase-2 in primary rat hepatocytes in order to further elucidate the molecular nature of the NSMase involved. Initial studies confirmed that the EST clone used in these experiments encoded a Mg2+-dependent NSMase. The in vitro activity of the heterologously expressed enzyme was inhibited in the presence of 0.5% Triton or 50 mM EDTA. In addition, the expression of this NSMase-2 clone in primary hepatocytes led to increased cellular levels of ceramide, indicating that the enzyme is active in situ. Immunofluorescence studies in Hep G2 cells infected with NSMase-2 expressing adenoviruses showed that the FLAG-tagged NSMase-2 was localized to the plasma membrane. Cell viability remained unchanged 72 h following infection and induction. The effect of NSMase-2 expression on IL-1beta-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was tested. Expression of NSMase-2 increased JNK phosphorylation between 1.5- and 2-fold over the basal level. Furthermore, NSMase-2 was found to strongly increase the ability of IL-1beta to phosphorylate JNK. This potentiation was mediated by a phosphatase from the PP2A family, possibly by modulating the phosphorylation pattern of IL-1beta receptor-associated kinase (IRAK). In conclusion, the data presented suggest that NSMase-2 could be involved in IL-1beta-induced JNK activation in hepatocytes."

Although it was originally assumed that the fibrils were the toxic species, this assumption has recently been called into question. Accumulating evidence in several systems suggests that oligomeric intermediates on the aggregation pathway may be toxic. In the present study we used in situ atomic force microscopy to monitor aggregation in aqueous solution in real time. The sample used was an amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain, involved in AL or light chain amyloidosis. The nature of the observed oligomeric intermediates was dependent on the conditions of incubation, especially pH and ionic strength. Several different aggregation intermediates with a variety of morphologies, including annular or torus-shaped species, were observed. The data indicate that protein aggregation can be very complex, involving a variety of different oligomeric intermediates whose population will be determined by the kinetic and thermodynamic competition between them.

Amyloid fibril deposits play an important role in many diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, prion, and Huntington's diseases. Fibrillar protein aggregates show many common characteristics, regardless of the widely disparate nature of the protein from which they form. These include similar fibrillar morphology, a core of cross-β-sheet structure, and birefringence under cross-polarization after staining with Congo red. Numerous studies have linked cellular toxicity to fibrils (1El Agnaf O.M. Irvine G.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 559-565Google Scholar, 2Bellotti V. Mangione P. Merlini G. J. Struct.

However, more recently, increasing evidence suggests that cytotoxicity associated with amyloid deposits is likely to be mediated by multiple aggregated forms of the protein. For example, fibril precursors, protofibrils, or soluble oligomeric aggregates have been suggested to be the primary toxic species and principally responsible for the resultant disease (6Conway K.A.

In addition to typical globular oligomeric aggregates, a ring-like aggregate of α-synuclein and a core-like aggregate of Aβ peptide have been observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) 1The abbreviations used are: AFM, atomic force microscopy; EM, electron microscopy. and EM techniques (9Lashuel H.A.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10209-10217Google Scholar). Some of these species appear in the early stages of the assembly process, but others seem to be off-pathway species. A better understanding of aggregate morphology will be useful for the elucidation of the detailed molecular mechanism of protein deposition diseases and the design of therapeutic strategies against amyloid and related protein deposition diseases. AL or light chain amyloidosis is a deposition disease that involves the fibrillar aggregation of the variable domain of immunoglobulin light chains (2Bellotti V. Mangione P. Merlini G. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 280-289Google Scholar, 11Buxbaum J.N. Chuba J.V. Hellman G.C. Solomon A. Gallo G.R. Ann. Intern. Med. 1990; 112: 455-464Google Scholar, 12Solomon A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 116: 101-121Google Scholar). Previous in vitro experiments have demonstrated that the variable domain SMA predominantly forms fibrils at low pH and amorphous aggregates at neutral pH (13Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Talapatra A. Minert L.J. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Millett I. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3525-3535Google Scholar). In solution, SMA forms fibrils via a hierarchical process in which two smooth protofilaments twist together to form a protofibril; two protofibrils then interact to form mature fibrils (14Ionescu-Zanetti C. Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Petrick J.S. Trabachino L.C. Minert L.J. Carter S.A. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13175-13179Google Scholar). In vivo light chain deposits are usually associated with surfaces such as arterial walls and basement membrane (15Gallo G. Goni F. Boctor F. Vidal R. Kumar A. Stevens F.J. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1397-1406Google Scholar). In previous work, we demonstrated that fibril formation on surfaces might be significantly different from the mechanism in solution (16Zhu M. Souillac P.O. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Carter S.A. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50914-50922Google Scholar). Fibrils can be formed on native mica at much lower concentrations and temperatures and without agitation, conditions under which fibrils do not form in solution. In addition to dramatically accelerating fibrillation, bidirectional assembly of oligomeric units and linear fibril growth from amorphous cores were characteristic features of fibrillation on the hydrophilic mica surface. These results suggested that variable domains of light chains might have significantly different fibrillation mechanisms in different environments. In situ AFM allows direct observation of protein aggregates in solution (17Blackley H.K. Sanders G.H. Davies M.C. Roberts C.J. Tendler S.J. Wilkinson M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 833-840Google Scholar, 18Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Google Scholar, 19Kowalewski T. Holtzman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Morphology of the individual molecules and aggregates can be monitored as a function of time. In the present investigation the time course of the aggregation process of the light chain variable domain SMA was followed by continuous imaging of a mica surface in aqueous buffer, and the early events of aggregation and fibrillation were observed. Protein Purification—The SMA expression system was a gift from Dr. Fred Stevens (Argonne National Laboratories) and purified as described previously (13Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Talapatra A.

In Vitro Protein Aggregation and Thioflavin T Assays—A filtered protein sample (0.22 μm) was treated with 0.001 m NaOH for 10 min to remove any pre-formed aggregates and then adjusted to neutral pH. Protein aggregation was initiated for in situ AFM observation by incubation of SMA at a concentration 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm buffer solution in the fluid cell of the atomic force microscope with a sheet of mica on the bottom of the cell. Intermediate or high ionic strength was obtained with 30 or 100 mm NaCl. Buffers used were pH 2.0, 0.02 m HCl; pH 3.0, pH 4.5, 20 mm acetate; pH 7.5, 20 mm Tris-HCl. For aggregation experiments in solution, SMA was incubated at concentrations from 0.02 to 0.5 mg/ml in the presence of 20 mm buffer solution and 100 mm NaCl at 37 °C in a glass vial. The solution was continuously shaken at 960 rpm with a glass bead to increase the agitation. Fibril formation was monitored by removing aliquots from the incubation solution at each time point using light scattering and a standard Thioflavin T assay (13Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Talapatra A. Minert L.J. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Millett I. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3525-3535Google Scholar, 24Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Google Scholar). Both static light scattering and fluorescence intensities were measured using a Fluoromax-3 (Jobin-Yvon/SPEX Inc.) spectrofluorometer. In Situ and ex Situ AFM Methods—In situ AFM images were collected with a PicoScan SPM microscope (Molecular Imaging, Phoenix, AZ) equipped for MAC Mode in which the magnetically coated probe oscillates near its resonant frequency under an alternating magnetic field. This technique (MAC-AFM) has proven advantageous for measuring soft samples in liquid media. Probes with a 2.8 N/m spring constant and a 30-kHz resonance frequency (Molecular Imaging) were used for the MAC Mode imaging. The imaging was carried out at a scan rate of 1 line/s with 512 data points/line. The amplitude change of the probe was sufficiently low that the imaging was essentially non-destructive to the sample. Heights ranging from 1–100 nm were estimated by section analysis using the PicoScan program (Version 4.18) without calibration. Lateral sizes in the range of 10 to 1000 nm were calibrated using a calibration grid and standard gold colloid particles (5 and 20 nm). SPIP software (Image Metrology) was used for the roughness analysis. We measured the roughness of the mica in the absence of the aggregates, and it was 0.41 ± 0.12 nm. Ex situ experiments were performed by incubating the protein in solution as described above and removing aliquots as a function of time. The samples (5 μl) were deposited on freshly cleaved mica, dried, and washed twice with water prior to AFM imaging. Images were collected with an Autoprobe CP Multiple AFM (Park Scientific) in non-contact (tapping) mode using silicon cantilevers with a resonance spring constant of 50 N/m and a frequency of 290–350 kHz (Park Scientific). At least three regions of each surface were examined to verify that similar structure existed throughout the sample. Globular Oligomers Were the Only Aggregated Species Formed at Low pH and Low Ionic Strength in in Situ AFM Measurements—In situ AFM observations of SMA aggregation on mica were performed using the AFM fluid cell. These experiments were performed with protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, pH 3.0, with no added salt, at room temperature, and with no agitation. It was not possible to do in situ experiments at pH 2.0, because the magnetic cobalt and chromium coated on the silicon nitride tips dissolved. At pH 3.0, no fibrils were found on the mica surfaces within 32 h. However, globular oligomeric deposits of different sizes were observed (Fig. 1). The sizes of these aggregates were analyzed using Origin 7.0 (Originlab Co.) with the statistical histograms shown in Fig. 1. At the earlier times (≤15 h) the data were fit to two populations of height. Monomers and dimers of 0.81 ± 0.01 and 1.8 ± 0.06 nm in height were the predominant species at early times (0.4 and 0. 9 h), whereas at 15 h small oligomers (2.4 ± 0.04 and 3.8 ± 0.07 nm in height) predominated. At 22 and 25 h larger oligomers, 7.0 ± 0.1 nm in height, were the major species. Minor species with sizes higher than 10 nm were also seen after 22 h of incubation. At 32 h the major species had a height of 13.0 ± 0.28 nm. The surface density (coverage) of the observed oligomers increased linearly as a function of time (Fig. 1). Protein aggregation at pH 3.0 in the presence of 30 mm NaCl was also examined by in situ AFM, yielding the images shown in Fig. 2. Under these conditions SMA was adsorbed onto the mica at the earliest times and more protein oligomers were observed after 0.5 h compared with the no-salt conditions. The salt may screen the charges of both the protein and mica (negatively charged), which will enhance the protein adsorption. At longer time periods, globular oligomers are still the predominant species in addition to a few fibrils (Fig. 2, circles). Annular-shaped Aggregates Were Formed under Weakly Acidic Condition in in Situ AFM—Topographic MAC Mode AFM images of the SMA aggregates in the in situ experiments at pH 4.5 are shown in Fig. 3. The donut-like oligomers appearing at 8 h are the predominant associated species on the mica surface, although a few globular oligomers and fibrils were observed under these conditions as well (the surface area coverage is 66.8% for annular oligomers, 29.8% for fibrils, and 3.4% for small spherical oligomers). Most of the donut-shaped oligomers are intact closed circles, but a few are not closed and are more crescent-shaped. Growth of an annular intermediate is indicated by the yellow arrows in Fig. 3, a–e; the images show that it arises from a semi-circular oligomer. The typical dimensions of these annular oligomeric intermediates varied at different stages of incubation (Figs. 3 and 4), with heights of 25–50 nm, outside diameters of 240–550 nm, and inner diameters of 125–130 nm. These dimensions would correspond to ∼50,000 SMA molecules (assuming a monomer size of 4.0 × 2.8 × 1.3 nm3 based on the crystal structure of the closely related light chain domain, LEN). Images were collected at intervals of half an hour. An annular oligomer in Fig. 3b (green arrow) was not evident in the previous image half an hour earlier, shown in Fig. 3a. Additional rapidly growing torus-shaped oligomers are also observed in Fig. 3, a–c, green arrows. Comparison of the position of the toroidal intermediate indicated by blue arrows in Fig. 3, a–c, as a function of time strongly suggests lateral (two-dimensional) diffusion of the intermediate on the mica surface. It is possible that these annular oligomers or their precursors are formed in the solution prior to adsorption on the mica. There is evidence for the disappearance of annular intermediates from Fig. 3a to 3b (see red arrows in all figures). This means that these oligomers can also be desorbed from the mica surface.Fig. 4Annular aggregates were scanned at 30-m intervals after incubation for 18 h under the same conditions as in Fig. 3. Scale bars, 1 μm. Red arrows mark the disappearance of annular-shaped intermediates. Green arrows mark the appearance of annular-shaped intermediates; green circles represent the growth of multiple tails from the annular intermediates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Another group of AFM images was collected at 30-m intervals after incubating SMA solution at pH 4.5 under salt-free conditions in the fluid cell for 18 h without scanning. The annular oligomers are the major species observed, but after a longer period of incubation more thread-like fibrils were observed (Fig. 4). The disappearance (Fig. 4, red arrows) and appearance (green arrows) of annular-shaped intermediates was occasionally observed, but most annular oligomers remained in their same positions. In addition to the typical circular hollow toruses (Fig. 5a), a figure-eight-shaped double “donut” was seen (Fig. 5b). Toruses with one “tail” (Fig. 5c) or multiple tails (Fig. 5d) were also observed. Thus the annular oligomers can be linked together or opened to give linear fibrils (Fig. 5e), suggesting similar mechanisms for the formation of these two kinds of ordered aggregates. It should be noted that the experimental conditions for formation of the annular aggregates are crucial because these species were only observed at pH 4.5 at low salt, indicating the decisive roles that the solution pH and ionic strength play in the aggregation mechanism and which are tested below. Fibrils Formed on Mica at pH 7.5 at Low Ionic Strength—At pH 7.5 and low ionic strength, a globular oligomer formed in the early stages of aggregation, and fibrils were observed after 30 h (Fig. 6). AFM in situ images were collected every 3 h but failed to reveal individual fibril growth because of tip contamination. AFM tips become broadened because of corrosion by continuously scanning for a long period of incubation in the protein solution. The fibrils formed have a 7–8 nm height, which is consistent with the mature fibrils formed in solution. Amorphous Aggregates Are Predominant at High Ionic Strength at pH 7.5—We found that ionic strength plays an important role in the aggregation process in the in situ fibrillation experiments. At pH 7.5, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer without NaCl, oligomers were initially formed, followed by fibrils as described above. When 30 mm NaCl was present in the incubation solution, globular amorphous deposits with sizes from 10–16 nm were formed (data not shown). When 100 mm NaCl was used with the same pH and concentration of SMA, the protein assembled rapidly to form small oligomers at 9–11 h and then larger spherical amorphous aggregates with a height 10–280 nm after 19 h, shown in Fig. 7 along with the corresponding height profiles. Similarly, increasing the ionic strength at pH 4.5 also leads to a change in the predominant form of aggregated material from annular oligomers and fibrils in the presence of 30 mm NaCl to amorphous aggregates at 100 mm NaCl (data not shown). Oligomeric Aggregates, Not Fibrils, Were Formed at Low Protein Concentration in Solution—The kinetics of SMA aggregation in solution (without mica, i.e. no wafers) was examined using ThT at pH 2.0. These acidic conditions were chosen because these are the conditions for the most rapid formation and highest yield of fibrils in solution (13Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Talapatra A. Minert L.J. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Millett I. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3525-3535Google Scholar). Fig. 8d shows typical sigmoidal kinetics curves for 0.5 mg/ml SMA; direct observation with EM and AFM confirmed the presence of amyloid fibrils (Fig. 9d).Fig. 9AFM images of SMA aggregates formed after incubation at pH 2.0 in 100 mm NaCl, 37 °C, with shaking at 960 rpm. SMA concentrations: 0.2 mg/ml (a), 0.3 mg/ml (b and c), and 0.5 mg/ml (d). Height profiles are shown in the lower panels for the black lines in the corresponding image. Scale bars, 1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A “bell-shaped” ThT curve was observed when lower protein concentrations were used, as shown in Fig. 8, a–c. The ThT fluorescence dropped dramatically after the initial exponential growth phase in the ThT curve, and no plateau region was observed. However, monitoring the reaction with light scattering revealed a typical sigmoidal curve; no reduced intensity was observed at the long time periods when the ThT fluorescence dropped. Simultaneously, the length of the lag measured by ThT decreased from 25 h at 0.5 mg/ml to 8 h at 0.2 mg/ml, and 5 h at 0.05 mg/ml; no lag was observed at 0.02 mg/ml. This inverse dependence of fibrillation rate on protein concentration is not common for amyloid fibrillation but in this case reflects formation of SMA dimers at higher protein concentrations and the fact that it is the monomers that lead to fibrils. The bell-shaped ThT kinetics profiles suggest competition between kinetic and thermodynamic control for fibrillar and non-fibrillar aggregates. An aliquot was removed from the incubation solution of 0.2 mg/ml SMA at each time point and imaged by AFM. We found oligomers (of identical size) were formed at 13 h when the ThT signal started to increase (Fig. 10a). Subsequently the oligomeric units associated with each other, forming a loosely associated aggregate in two dimensions (i.e. no increase in height) (Fig. 10b) or three dimensions (increased height as well as width) (Fig. 10c) at the time when the ThT signal reached its maximum. Subsequently, the larger aggregates decreased in size to form similar-sized smaller aggregates, some of which are distinctly crescent-shaped (Fig. 10, e and f). We also examined the morphology of aggregates using protein concentrations of 0.2–0.5 mg/ml. AFM images in Fig. 9 show a transition in morphology at 0.3 mg/ml, suggesting that this is a critical concentration for fibril formation. AFM images show the morphology is a network of fibrillar and oligomeric aggregates. The aggregates in Fig. 9b are mostly similar to those in Fig. 10a, whereas the species in Fig. 9c are more similar to those in Fig. 10d. Some of the aggregates resemble linear associations of globular oligomers that might be precursors to fibrils (e.g. Fig. 9c). Accumulating evidence in several amyloidogenic systems suggests that oligomeric intermediates on the aggregation pathway may be toxic (26Lashuel H.A. Hartley D. Petre B.M. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Google Scholar, 27Hoshi M. Sato M. Matsumoto S. Noguchi A. Yasutake K. Yoshida N. Sato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6370-6375Google Scholar, 28Volles M.J.

Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Google Scholar, 26Lashuel H.A. Hartley D. Petre B.M. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Google Scholar, 29Mirzabekov T.A. Lin M.C. Kagan B.L. J.

Peptides. 2002; 23: 1311-1315Google Scholar). In the present study we have shown that SMA, an immunoglobulin light chain involved in AL or light chain amyloidosis, forms aggregation intermediates with a variety of morphologies, including annular species. This is the first time annular-shaped aggregates of light chains have been reported. These intermediates are much larger than the annular protofibrils reported for α-synuclein (9Lashuel H.A. Petre B.M. Wall J. Simon M. Nowak R.J. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1089-1102Google Scholar, 10Ding T.T. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10209-10217Google Scholar). Although it has been assumed that in light chain amyloidosis the formation of amyloid plaque is the pathogenic event, it is also possible that the observed annular intermediates, given their size, could lead to the formation of pores in membranes. Multiple Types of SMA Aggregates Were Observed under Different Conditions of pH and Ionic Strength—The data indicate that pH is a major factor affecting the aggregation mechanism of SMA. At pH 3.0, globular oligomeric deposits with different sizes were the only aggregated species observed, with heights of 0.8–13 nm depending upon incubation time. At pH 4.5, at low ionic strength, the annular aggregates were the predominant species, whereas fibrils and amorphous deposits predominated at high ionic strength. As the pH increased to 7.5, at low ionic strength, amorphous aggregates were the major species. In the presence of 30 mm NaCl amorphous deposits were the only species observed, suggesting that neutral pH accelerated the formation of amorphous aggregates on the mica surface. In a control experiment, a solution of 1 mg/ml lysozyme in pH 4.5 buffer was incubated under comparable conditions to SMA for in situ MAC-AFM imaging. No aggregates of any sort were observed. Thus, the aggregation of SMA can lead to a variety of different types of intermediates, ranging from small and large oligomers to various types of fibrillar and amorphous aggregates. Any or all of these structures may contribute to the pathogenesis of AL amyloidosis. Comparison of Aggregates Grown on Mica and in Solution— Previous studies of SMA aggregation in solution in the absence of mica surfaces have shown that both fibrils and amorphous aggregates are found, depending on the conditions (14Ionescu-Zanetti C. Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Petrick J.S. Trabachino L.C. Minert L.J. Carter S.A. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13175-13179Google Scholar, 32Khurana R. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Pope M.

Solomon A. Fink A.L. Amyloid. 2003; 10: 97-109Google Scholar). When small wafers of mica are added to solutions of SMA at low concentration, a number of different types of deposit are observed on the mica (16Zhu M. Souillac P.O. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Carter S.A. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50914-50922Google Scholar). Table I shows a comparison of the types of SMA aggregates formed in solution, on mica wafers suspended in solution, and in situ in the AFM liquid cell (a combination of mica surface and solution). In solution, typical amyloid fibrils formed at pH 2.0–5.0, with increasing yield of fibrils at lower pH. At pH 5.0 and 7.5, amorphous aggregates were the predominant aggregates (13Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Talapatra A. Minert L.J. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Millett I. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3525-3535Google Scholar). In an ex situ experiment focusing on the aggregates formed on the mica surface, only oligomers assembling linearly on the mica were observed at pH 2.0. Fibrils radiating from amorphous deposits were seen at pH 5.0. At neutral pH, oligomeric aggregates appeared after 6 days and, subsequently, larger amorphous aggregates rather than fibrils (16Zhu M. Souillac P.O. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Carter S.A. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50914-50922Google Scholar). The differences between the nature of aggregates observed on mica when SMA is incubated in the fluid cell of the AFM compared with incubation of wafers in bulk solution result from the different experimental conditions, namely different temperatures and extensive washing with water for the samples incubated in bulk solution when the mica wafers are prepared for AFM imaging.Table IComparison of the nature of SMA aggregates in solution and on mica Ex situ refers to samples that were incubated in solution and the samples either transferred to mica and air-dried for AFM imaging or grown on mica wafers submersed in the incubation solution.

Souillac P.O. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Carter S.A. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50914-50922Google Scholar). In the present study various aggregate morphologies, including globular aggregates, annular oligomeric intermediates, fibrils, and amorphous aggregates were observed at various pH and ionic strength conditions. At lower pH, globular oligomeric aggregates were the only species detected, which is consistent with solution conditions. Annular oligomers were not observed in solution or in the presence of mica wafers (at low pH), consistent with the in situ AFM experiments. Attempts to grow annular intermediates in solution and transfer them to mica for AFM measurements were unsuccessful. In another experiment, a mica wafer was suspended in the protein solution under conditions in which the annular intermediates formed in the in situ AFM experiments and then moved from the solution for ex situ AFM measurements, but again no annular intermediates were observed. One explanation is that in solution, without the constraints of the surface, the annular intermediates rapidly are converted into linear fibrils. The images in Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that annular oligomers can be deposited on the surface from solution or leave the surface, presumably entering the solution phase. The de novo appearance of the annular oligomers suggests that they can exist in solution; whether they are oligomers that desorb from the surface and rapidly redeposit at a new location is not clear. In Situ AFM Can Monitor the Growth of Oligomers and Aggregates in Solution Over Time—In situ AFM permits the observation of single oligomeric assemblies. The advantage of MAC Mode imaging for soft samples in fluid environments is that the cantilever is driven directly by the magnetic field. The species imaged with the in situ AFM are those present on the mica surface; however, they will also include species that deposit from the solution. Therefore, the observed species arise from the combination of both surface and solution conditions. Proteins, as well as their aggregates, are prone to adsorb on mica surfaces from solution. Large amounts of protein on the mica will lead to too great a coverage and make the imaging very difficult; therefore, only relatively low concentrations of protein can be used for in situ AFM observations. The protein-concentrating effect of the surface might be responsible for the formation of fibrils or aggregates even at very low solution concentration. Our results suggested that the main source of protein molecules for the growth or elongation of oligomers and fibrils was from the solution; for example, mica wafers that were removed from solution after a short incubation time period and then incubated in protein-free buffer solution failed to develop fibrils. However, assembly of large oligomers was observed on the mica, indicating that lateral diffusion of adsorbed protein on the surface might be one of the mechanisms for the aggregation. A ThT-positive, but Non-fibrillar, Aggregate—ThT is a relatively specific dye for amyloid fibrils (34LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Google Scholar), and its interaction with fibrils is believed to involve the β-sheet structure. Binding to amyloid fibrils dramatically increases ThT fluorescence around 482 nm. However, the binding of this dye is not restricted to amyloid fibrils; it has been shown to exhibit significantly increased fluorescence with granular aggregates of β-lactoglobulin (35Carrotta R. Bauer R. Waninge R. Rischel C. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1312-1318Google Scholar), α-synuclein (36Kim Y. Lee D. Lee E. Sung J.Y. Chung K.C. Kim J. Paik S.R. Brain Res. 2001; 908: 93-98Google Scholar), a PrP fragment (37Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49065-49070Google Scholar), and Aβ (25Tomski S.J. Murphy R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 630-638Google Scholar). At pH 2.0, SMA forms aggregates in solution at low concentration (below 0.3 mg/ml) that have a strong ThT signal but a bell-shaped kinetics curve (rather than the normal sigmoid, Fig. 8) when monitored by ThT, whereas monitoring by light scattering shows a sigmoidal curve. The morphology of the aggregates showed that a loose association of individual oligomeric units was seen when the ThT signals reached their maximum. We assume that the association of the oligomers provides an extended region of β-structure analogous to that in fibrils and to which ThT could bind. When these aggregates subsequently dissociate, as observed by AFM (Fig. 10), these are no longer the predominant structures and the ThT signal drops, but light scattering, which is also an indicator of soluble associated species, remains at a high level, reflecting the presence of non-ThT binding oligomers. Thus, care must be taken when using ThT as an indicator for the presence of fibrils. An imaging technique such as AFM is best for identifying the morphology of aggregates. In conclusion, the aggregation and fibrillation of the immunoglobulin light chain SMA involves several different aggregation intermediates with a variety of morphologies, including annular or torus-shaped species. Our results indicate that protein aggregation can be very complex, involving a variety of different oligomeric intermediates whose population will be determined by the kinetic and thermodynamic competition between them."

It carries genes involved in cancer including the breast cancer type 2 (BRCA2) and retinoblastoma (RB1) genes, is frequently rearranged in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and contains the DAOA locus associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. We describe completion and analysis of 95.5 megabases (Mb) of sequence from chromosome 13, which contains 633 genes and 296 pseudogenes. We estimate that more than 95.4% of the protein-coding genes of this chromosome have been identified, on the basis of comparison with other vertebrate genome sequences. Additionally, 105 putative non-coding RNA genes were found. Chromosome 13 has one of the lowest gene densities (6.5 genes per Mb) among human chromosomes, and contains a central region of 38 Mb where the gene density drops to only 3.1 genes per Mb."
https://openalex.org/W1978411472,"The 7-transmembrane or G protein-coupled receptors relay signals from hormones and sensory stimuli to multiple signaling systems at the intracellular face of the plasma membrane including heterotrimeric G proteins, ERK1/2, and arrestins. It is an emerging concept that 7-transmembrane receptors form oligomers; however, it is not well understood which roles oligomerization plays in receptor activation of different signaling systems. To begin to address this question, we used the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, a key regulator of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis that in specific context has been described to activate ERKs without activating G proteins. By using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, we demonstrate that AT1 receptors exist as oligomers in transfected COS-7 cells. AT1 oligomerization was both constitutive and receptor-specific as neither agonist, antagonist, nor co-expression with three other receptors affected the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 2 signal. Furthermore, the oligomerization occurs early in biosynthesis before surface expression, because we could control AT1 receptor export from the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi by using regulated secretion/aggregation technology (RPD™). Co-expression studies of wild type AT1 and AT1 receptor mutants, defective in either ligand binding or G protein and ERK activation, yielded an interesting result. The mutant receptors specifically exerted a dominant negative effect on Gαq activation, whereas ERK activation was preserved.

The 7TM receptors activate or interact with numerous signaling proteins including heterotrimeric G proteins, arrestins, adaptor proteins, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) at the intracellular face of the plasma membrane (1Brady A.E. Limbird L.E. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 297-309Google Scholar). Although 7TM receptors traditionally have been considered to work as monomeric entities, increasing evidence has shown that these receptors form both homoand heterodimers or oligomers in vivo and in vitro. Whereas heterodimerization may provide a means to expand pharmacological diversity, the functional role of homodimerization is less well defined (2Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Google Scholar, 3Gomes I. Jordan B.A. Gupta A. Rios C. Trapaidze N. Devi L.A. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 226-242Google Scholar). 7TM receptor heterodimerization has been shown to modify biological function, receptor trafficking, ligand binding properties, and signal transduction of several 7TM receptors (2Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Google Scholar, 3Gomes I. Jordan B.A. Gupta A. Rios C. Trapaidze N. Devi L.A. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 226-242Google Scholar). The GABAB “receptor pair” provides an example of two different receptor subunits, the GABAB1 and GABAB2, that both are necessary for receptor surface expression and function (4Duthey B. Caudron S. Perroy J. Bettler B. Fagni L. Pin J.P. Prezeau L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3236-3241Google Scholar). The bradykinin B2 has been shown to potentiate AT1 receptor signaling drastically (5AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Google Scholar), whereas the angiotensin II, type II, receptor inhibits AT1 receptor signaling (6AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39721-39726Google Scholar). The β1/β2-adrenergic receptor heterodimerization regulates MAPK signaling efficacy, whereas G protein activation remains unaffected (7Lavoie C. Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Umapathy D. Breit A. Villeneuve L.R. Zhu W.Z. Xiao R.P. Lakatta E.G. Bouvier M. Hebert T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35402-35410Google Scholar). The role of 7TM receptor homodimerization is experimentally more difficult to assess. Studies of functionally compromised mutants co-expressed with wild type receptors suggest that homodimerization perhaps plays a role in receptor biogenesis, ligand binding, and receptor signaling (2Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Google Scholar, 3Gomes I. Jordan B.A. Gupta A. Rios C. Trapaidze N. Devi L.A. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 226-242Google Scholar). Mutant receptors of the β2-adrenergic receptor, CCR5, and dopamine D2 receptors have exerted a dominant negative effect on wild type receptor cell surface expression (8Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F. Koup R.A. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30603-30606Google Scholar, 9Lee S.P. O'Dowd B.F. Ng G.Y. Varghese G. Akil H. Mansour A. Nguyen T. George S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 120-128Google Scholar, 10Zhu X. Wess J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15773-15784Google Scholar). In contrast, surface expression of a mutant β2-adrenergic receptor could be rescued by co-expression of WT receptor (11Hebert T.E. Loisel T.P. Adam L. Ethier N. Onge S.S. Bouvier M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 287-293Google Scholar), and internalization of an α-factor receptor that could not internalize was rescued by co-expression of wild type receptor (12Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that dimerization may be important for G protein coupling. Wild type α-factor receptor signaling is inhibited by co-expression of a signaling-deficient receptor (12Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Google Scholar), and it is possible to inhibit both β2-adrenergic receptor activation and dimerization with a peptide derived from transmembrane domain 6 of the receptor (13Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Google Scholar). A double cysteine M3 muscarinic receptor that has lost the ability to form covalent dimers and multimers displays an approximately 50-fold reduction in binding affinity compared with wild type and a greater than 10,000-fold reduction in agonist potency (14Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19487-19497Google Scholar), and recently mutations that abolish dimerization of the α-factor (15Overton M.C. Chinault S.L. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49369-49377Google Scholar), CCR2, and CCR5 (16Hernanz-Falcon P. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Serrano A. Juan D. del Sol A. Soriano S.F. Roncal F. Gomez L. Valencia A. Martinez A.C. Mellado M. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 216-223Google Scholar) receptors have been shown to also decrease or abolish agonist-induced signaling. Although it is well established that 7TM receptors form homodimers, we are still far from understanding the functional consequences of this process. Two types of experiments are currently of great interest: experiments directed at defining the receptor domains involved in oligomerization, and studies examining the role of oligomerization for ligand binding and signaling. We speculated that the AT1 receptor could be a means to advance our understanding of how receptor dimerization affects signaling. This receptor has been reported to engage in both homo- and heterodimerization (5AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Google Scholar, 6AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M.

Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472Google Scholar). Most important, it has been suggested that AT1 receptor G protein and ERK activation pathways can be separated. Thus, different angiotensin II peptide analogues and AT1 receptor mutants can activate ERK1/2 without stimulating G proteins (21Seta K. Nanamori M. Modrall J.G. Neubig R.R. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9268-9277Google Scholar, 22Olivares-Reyes J.A. Smith R.D. Hunyady L. Shah B.H. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37761-37768Google Scholar, 23Hunyady L. Baukal A.J. Balla T.

In the present study, we examined the effect of homodimerization on Ang II-induced G protein and ERK1/2 signaling. We created two receptor mutants defective in signaling or binding. Most interesting, when co-expressed with wild type receptors, the mutant receptors inhibit G protein signaling, whereas ERK activation and β-arrestin recruitment remained unaffected, suggesting that the receptor oligomerization has differential effects on different signaling systems. These results support and expand the notion that AT1 receptor oligomerization plays an important role for activation of cellular signaling systems.

LipofectAMINE™ 2000, cell culture media, and serum were from Invitrogen. Cell culture plates were from Techno Plastic Products AG (Trasadingen, Switzerland) except for 48-well plates that were obtained from Nunc. Angiotensin II, other ligands, and chemicals were all from Sigma. cDNA Constructs—The EGFP-tagged bovine β-arrestin 2, as described previously (26Penn R.B. Pascual R.M. Kim Y.M. Mundell S.J. Krymskaya V.P. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32648-32656Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Jeffery Benovic. The AT1-luc and GFP2 and CaR-Luc are described in Ref. 27Jensen A.A. Hansen J.L. Sheikh S.P. Brauner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5076-5087Google Scholar. ETa-luc was cloned by removing the stop codon in an N-terminally c-Myc-tagged version of the human ETa receptor, kindly provided by T. Nakagawa and as described previously (28Okamoto Y. Ninomiya H. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6439-6446Google Scholar), and inserting this product into the reading frame of the Rluc-NI at an EcoRV site. The PCR amplification was performed by using DNA oligonucleotides with 5′-phosphorylated ATGs (resembling an open EcoRV site). To generate the EGFTM-luc receptor, we PCR-amplified the first 2010 bases, i.e. the sequence coding for the N-terminal region and the transmembrane segment of the human EGF receptor (NM_005228; NCBI-Entrez Nucleotides Database), by using a 5′-DNA oligonucleotide with a HindIII site and three additional bases, AAG, to ensure digestion of the site, and a 3′-oligonucleotide with a KpnI site and three additional bases, AAG, to ensure digestion of the site. After digestion with KpnI and HindIII, this product was inserted in the reading frame of the pLuc N3 vector between the HindIII and KpnI sites. Both fusion receptors were verified by sequencing. Point mutations were introduced using the QuickChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). Each mutant receptor was subcloned back into the original plasmid vector and sequenced to eliminate potential noncoding PCR-generated mutations. BRET2 Assay—Except for minor differences, the BRET2 assay was performed as described previously (27Jensen A.A. Hansen J.L. Sheikh S.P. Brauner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5076-5087Google Scholar). (BRET2 is a specific patented assay from Packard Biosciences that uses bioluminescence from luciferase to GFP2, a second generation modification of GFP.) Briefly, 0.5 million COS-7 cells per well were seeded into a 6-well plate and grown in 10% fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) overnight. After 24 h the cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol (varying amounts of DNA were used to ensure equal expression levels between the different receptors). After 2 days, the cells were washed twice with PBS to remove the indicator dye before detachment in PBS. The cells were then spilt into two portions. The first portion was used to examine the GFP levels by fluorescent measurements as described previously (27Jensen A.A. Hansen J.L. Sheikh S.P. Brauner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5076-5087Google Scholar), and next the Rluc expression was determined by measuring the Coelenterazine h induced luminescence as described previously (27Jensen A.A. Hansen J.L. Sheikh S.P. Brauner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5076-5087Google Scholar). The second portion of the cells was submitted to DeepBlueC excitation, and the luminescence at the dual bands (515/30 nm and 410/80) was measured on a fusion reader (Packard Instrument Co.). The BRET2 ratio was determined according to the principle described previously (29Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar). BRET2 ratio equals ((emission (515/30)–(emission (410/80) × Cf))/(emission (410/80), where Cf denotes the cross-Rluc luminescence cross-talk ratio into the 515/30 filter defined as emission (515/30)/(emission (410/80) when Rluc expressed alone is excited. Regulated Secretion/Aggregation Technology—This assay was developed by Rivera et al. (30Rivera V.M. Wang X. Wardwell S. Courage N.L. Volchuk A. Keenan T. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Orci L. Cerasoli Jr., F. Rothman J.E. Clackson T. Science. 2000; 287: 826-830Google Scholar) and is available from Ariad Pharmaceuticals at www.ariad.com/regulationkits. To perform this assay, we seeded 2.5 × 106 COS-7 cells in a p10 dish, and we transfected the cells with 10 μgofFm4-AT1-EEA(A) cDNA and in the co-expression experiments also with 2 μg of wild type receptor DNA using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, the cells were split into 48-well plates coated with 0.25% poly-l-lysine (100,000 cells/well) and stimulated (with or without AP21998 at 2 μm) for 2 h prior to performing the inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation or binding assays as described below. Whole Cell Competitive Radioligand Binding Assay—Except for minor changes, this assay was performed as described previously (31Hansen J.L. Haunsø S. Brann M. Sheikh S.P. Weiner D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 770-777Google Scholar). Cells were prepared as described above for the regulated secretion/aggregation technology. Next, cells were washed once in cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), supplemented with CaCl2 (0.9 mm) and MgCl2 (1.05 mm), and then cooled down to 4 °C for 30 min. The HBSS was aspirated, and cells were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h in 0.25 ml of HBSS containing the radioligand ([tyrosyl-3,5-3H]angiotensin II (5-l-isoleucine)) at various concentrations either alone or in the presence of 10–5m unlabeled Telmisartan. After incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold HBSS before addition of 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (1.0% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the lysis buffer was transferred to a vial containing 4 ml of Ultima-Gold (Packard Instrument Co.); vials were capped and shaken, and 1 h later total radioactivity was measured on a Tri-Carb 2900 TP liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.). IP Assay—Briefly, cells were transfected as described for the regulated secretion/aggregation technology. After 1 day, the cells were seeded into 48-well plates coated with 0.25% poly-l-lysine (100,000 cells/well) and incubated in inositol-free DMEM supplemented with myo-[2-3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences). Twenty hours after application of the radioligand, the cells were assayed as described previously (27Jensen A.A. Hansen J.L. Sheikh S.P. Brauner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5076-5087Google Scholar). ERK Phosphorylation Assay—Except for minor modifications, this assay was performed as described previously (32Hansen J.L. Servant G. Baranski T.J. Fujita T. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 753-759Google Scholar, 33Theilade J. Lerche Hansen J. Haunso S. Sheikh S.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 195-199Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 million COS-7 cells were seeded into a p10 dish and grown in 10% fetal calf serum/DMEM overnight. After 24 h, the cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. On the day after transfection they were seeded onto 6-well plates. Next, 45 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 3 h, incubated with agonist for 12 min at 37 °C, and then lysed. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (33Theilade J. Lerche Hansen J. Haunso S. Sheikh S.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 195-199Google Scholar), and the bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). To quantify the densitometry of the bands, the gels were scanned, and the density of each band was measured using NIH-Image 1.62. β-Arrestin Recruitment—This assay was performed as described previously (29Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar) except for minor changes. Briefly, 2.5 million COS-7 cells were seeded into a p10 dish and grown in 10% fetal calf serum/DMEM overnight. After 24 h, the cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 according to manufacturer's protocol. We used 3 μg of EGFP-bovine-β-arrestin 2; either 3 μg of vector or AT1 receptor together with varying amounts of Rluc-tagged receptor DNA to reach equal expression levels between the different receptors were studied. Next, 48 after transfection cells were washed twice in PBS and detached. Cells were divided into two parts; the first part was used to examine GFP and luciferase expression as described above, and the other part was submitted to either basal or agonist treatment for 20 min at room temperature before measuring the BRET2 ratios as described above. Data Analysis—All pharmacological data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. For whole cells radioligand binding data were analyzed by one-site competitive binding analysis, whereas phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis data were analyzed using nonlinear regression curve fitting. Regarding statistical analysis, all values obtained for variant receptors were directly compared with those observed for WT receptor. A Bartlett test confirmed that there were no significant differences in the variance of the compared groups of data sets. Subsequently, one-tailed, paired Student's t tests were performed. All statistically significant results at the p < 0.05 level are reported. AT1 Receptors Form Constitutive Homodimeric Complexes— We used two different approaches to examine AT1-homodimerization: the BRET2 technology from Packard Instrument Co., and the regulated secretion/aggregation technology (RPD™) from ARIAD Pharmaceuticals (30Rivera V.M. Wang X. Wardwell S. Courage N.L. Volchuk A. Keenan T. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Orci L. Cerasoli Jr., F. Rothman J.E. Clackson T. Science. 2000; 287: 826-830Google Scholar). To analyze homodimerization using BRET2 experiments, AT1 and control receptors were fused to either Renilla luciferase (Rluc) or green fluorescent protein 2 (GFP2) as described previously (27Jensen A.A. Hansen J.L. Sheikh S.P. Brauner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5076-5087Google Scholar), and these constructs were expressed in COS-7 cells either alone or together (Fig. 1A). When AT1-luc and AT1-GFP2 were co-expressed and Rluc was excited with the substrate DeepBlueC, we detected a robust BRET2 signal with a value of 0.15 ± 0.01 (Fig. 1A). The BRET2 signal was not affected by incubation with the receptor agonist Ang II or the inverse agonist Telmisartan (Fig. 1A). To verify that the BRET2 signal results from specific proteinprotein interactions, we performed two types of experiments. First, we co-expressed three other luciferase-tagged receptors with the AT1-GFP2 receptor at the same expression levels (expression data not shown). For this experiment, we chose two 7TM receptors (the endothelin 1a (Eta) receptor and the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR)) and a truncated version of the EGF receptor dubbed EGFTM. Although we observed BRET2 signals in these experiments, these were significantly smaller (0.01–0.08; p < 0,05) than that of the AT1 receptors (Fig. 1A). Next, we co-expressed the wild type receptors (AT1, Eta, CaR, and EGFTM) together with AT1-luc and AT1-GFP2 receptors at similar expression levels as above to see if they could reduce the BRET2 signal. Confirming that most of the BRET2 signal is caused by specific homodimeric protein-protein interactions, the AT1-WT lowered the AT1-luc/AT1-GFP2 BRET2 signal significantly to a value of 0.06 (±0.02; p < 0,05), whereas none of the three other wild type receptors did (Fig. 1B). Studies by others have indicated that some 7TM receptors form homodimeric/homo-oligomeric complexes as early as the ER (34Terrillon S. Durroux T. Mouillac B. Breit A. Ayoub M.A. Taulan M. Jockers R. Barberis C. Bouvier M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 677-691Google Scholar, 35Floyd D.H. Geva A. Bruinsma S.P. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35354-35361Google Scholar, 36Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Google Scholar). To examine whether AT1 receptors dimerize during biosynthesis, we used the regulated secretion/aggregation technology (RPD™) developed by Rivera et al. (30Rivera V.M. Wang X. Wardwell S. Courage N.L. Volchuk A. Keenan T. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Orci L. Cerasoli Jr., F. Rothman J.E. Clackson T. Science. 2000; 287: 826-830Google Scholar). In principle, the protein of interest is N-terminally fused to a protein (dubbed Fm) that accumulates as aggregates in the ER and Golgi. However, incubation with a synthetic small molecule drug (AP21998) alleviates aggregation and allows the fusion proteins to escape the ER and Golgi in an AP21998-gated fashion. Furthermore, a furin cleavage site has been implemented so that the Fm repeats can be enzymatically removed in the Golgi to ensure irreversible disaggregation of the proteins of interest (30Rivera V.M. Wang X. Wardwell S. Courage N.L. Volchuk A. Keenan T. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Orci L. Cerasoli Jr., F. Rothman J.E. Clackson T. Science. 2000; 287: 826-830Google Scholar). Our idea of using this assay to study homooligomerization was to generate a mutant receptor that showed AP21998-gated surface expression but did not activate Ang II-mediated IP accumulation. If this receptor dimerizes with the AT1-WT, the prediction would be that co-expression of these two receptors would result in AP21998-gated Ang II-mediated signaling. We therefore N-terminally fused a signaling-deficient AT1R mutated in the DRY motif (D125E/R126E/ Y127A/M134A) with four consecutive Fm fusion domains, and we expressed this fusion receptor (dubbed Fm4-AT1-EEA(A)) in COS-7 cells. When exposed to AP21998, the Fm4-AT1-EEA(A) receptor surface expression approximately doubled (from 8 (±0.02) to 17 (±0.04) fmol/105 cells, p < 0,05), but as expected the receptor was still not able to induce IP accumulation in response to Ang II (Fig. 1, C and D). We then co-expressed AT1-WT and Fm4-AT1-EEA(A) receptors, and we analyzed the effect of AP21998 on the Ang II-induced IP accumulation. Preincubation with AP21998 approximately doubled the IP response, showing that the AT1-WT expression is indeed AP21998-gated p < 0.05 (Fig. 1E). This finding strongly suggests that AT1 receptor dimerization occurs early during biosynthesis and that the dimer interaction occurs with relatively high affinity. Furthermore, to analyze if Fm4-AT1-EEA(A) retention of the AT1-WT was because of a specific protein-protein interaction rather than ER or Golgi clotting that unspecifically may retain protein, we subsequently co-expressed the ETaR and CaR with the Fm4-AT1-EEA(A). These experiments confirmed the specificity of the response because the endothelin II and calcium-induced IP accumulation responses were independent of AP21998 (Fig. 1F). Co-expression of Mutant Receptors and Wild Type Inhibit Gαq Protein but Not ERK Activation—Co-expression studies of wild type and mutant receptor have so far had three different outcomes. 1) The mutant receptor does not affect wild type signaling; 2) the mutant receptor inhibits wild type signaling either by inhibiting surface expression or the activation of signaling (8Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F. Koup R.A. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30603-30606Google Scholar, 9Lee S.P. O'Dowd B.F. Ng G.Y. Varghese G. Akil H. Mansour A. Nguyen T. George S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 120-128Google Scholar, 10Zhu X. Wess J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15773-15784Google Scholar); or 3) the wild type receptor can functionally rescue the mutant receptor (11Hebert T.E. Loisel T.P. Adam L. Ethier N. Onge S.S. Bouvier M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 287-293Google Scholar, 12Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Google Scholar, 37Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Caron C.A. Gaudreau R. Volkov L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12548-12554Google Scholar). In addition, co-expression of two nonfunctional receptors can create functional receptors (17Monnot C. Bihoreau C. Conchon S. Curnow K.M. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1507-1513Google Scholar, 38Schulz A. Grosse R. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2381-2389Google Scholar). Several studies employing the AT1 receptor and other 7TM receptors imply the existence of distinct “active” conformations of 7TM receptors. Thus, it has been suggested that some receptor conformations selectively can activate β-arrestin and ERK activation, whereas a different set of receptor conformations cause Gαq signaling (21Seta K. Nanamori M. Modrall J.G. Neubig R.R. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9268-9277Google Scholar, 22Olivares-Reyes J.A. Smith R.D. Hunyady L. Shah B.H. Catt K.J. J. Biol.

If so, would a selective binding or signaling-deficient receptor mutant affect all confirmations equally? To answer these questions, we generated two mutants as follows: the AT1-EEA(A) that does not activate Gαq protein but binds Ang II, and AT1-K199A, mutated in the Ang II-binding site.

https://openalex.org/W2103594464,"Oncolytic viruses used for gene therapy have been genetically modified to selectively target tumor cells while sparing normal host tissue. The multimutant virus G207 has been attenuated by inactivation of viral ribonucleotide reductase and by deletion of both viral gamma134.5 genes. Deletion of gamma134.5 greatly decreases the neurovirulence of this mutant virus but also reduces its antitumor efficacy. The mammalian homologue to the gamma134.5 gene product is the GADD34 protein. This protein can functionally substitute for the gamma134.5 gene and is also up-regulated during DNA damage. We postulated that combining use of the chemotherapy agent mitomycin C (MMC) with G207 will selectively up-regulate GADD34 in tumor that may complement the gamma134.5 gene deletion and augment viral antitumor efficacy. This hypothesis was tested in human gastric cells in vitro and in vivo. Using both the isobologram method and combination-index method of Chou-Talalay, significant synergism was demonstrated between MMC and G207. As a result of such synergism, a dose-reduction for each agent can be accomplished over a wide range of drug-effect levels without sacrificing tumor cell kill. Northern blot analysis confirmed that expression of GADD34 mRNA was increased by MMC treatment. SiRNA directed at GADD34 decreased MMC-associated enhancement of viral proliferation and resulted in decreased viral synergy with MMC. These data indicate that induction of GADD34 selectively restores the virulent phenotype of the deleted gene in G207 and thus provides a cellular basis for the combined use of DNA-damaging agents and gamma134.5 HSV mutants in the treatment of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2123113539,"A major challenge in understanding nuclear hormone receptor function is to determine how the same ligand can cause very different tissue-specific responses. Tissue specificity may result from the presence of more than one receptor subtype arising from multiple receptor genes or alternative splicing. Recently, high affinity analogs of nuclear receptor ligands have been synthesized that show subtype selectivity. These analogs can greatly facilitate the study of receptor subtype-specific functions in organisms where mutational analysis is problematic or where it is desirable for receptors to be expressed in their normal physiological contexts. We describe here the effects of the synthetic thyroid hormone analog GC-1 on the metamorphosis of the frog Xenopus laevis. The most potent natural thyroid hormone, 3,5,3′-triidothyronine or T3, shows similar binding affinity and transactivation dose-response curves for both thyroid hormone receptor isotypes, designated TRα and TRβ. GC-1, however, binds to and activates TRβ at least an order of magnitude better than it does TRα. GC-1 efficiently induces death and resorption of premetamorphic tadpole tissues such as the gills and the tail, two tissues that strongly induce thyroid hormone receptor β during metamorphosis. GC-1 has less effect on the growth of adult tissues such as the hindlimbs, which express high TRα levels. The effectiveness of GC-1 in inducing tail resorption and tail gene expression correlates with increasing TRβ levels.

These results illustrate the utility of subtype selective ligands as probes of nuclear receptor function in vivo. Nuclear hormone receptors and their ligands are essential regulators of metazoan development, reproduction, and homeostasis. One of the most dramatic nuclear receptor-mediated events in nature is amphibian metamorphosis (1Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Crossref Google Scholar, 2Tata J.R. Cell Res. 1998; 8: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the frog, metamorphosis occurs as a result of gene expression cascades induced by thyroid hormone (TH) 1The abbreviations used are: TH, thyroid hormone; TR, TH receptor; T3, 3,5,3′-triidothyronine; BTEB, basic transcription element-binding protein; FAP, fibroblast activation protein; x, X. laevis (prefix).1The abbreviations used are: TH, thyroid hormone; TR, TH receptor; T3, 3,5,3′-triidothyronine; BTEB, basic transcription element-binding protein; FAP, fibroblast activation protein; x, X. laevis (prefix). secreted from the developing tadpole's thyroid gland (3Brown D.D. Wang Z. Kanamori A. Eliceiri B. Furlow J.D. Schwartzman R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 309-315PubMed Google Scholar). These cascades result in dramatically different morphological responses such as the growth and differentiation of the limbs, the death and resorption of the larval gills and tail, and the remodeling of a large number of larval organs for new adult functions (1Dodd M.H.I. Dodd J.M. Lofts B. Physiology of the Amphibia. Academic Press, New York1976: 467-599Crossref Google Scholar). As in all vertebrates, TH exerts its effects via a pair of TH receptor subtypes encoded by separate genes, TRα and TRβ (4Yaoita Y. Shi Y.B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). TRs are ligand-regulated transcription factors that are thought to repress target gene transcription in the absence of hormone and activate transcription upon hormone binding (5Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The most detailed molecular studies on amphibian metamorphosis have been done on the frog Xenopus laevis. Xenopus TRα is expressed early in development (6Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 7Banker D.E. Bigler J. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5079-5089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), long before the embryo and larval tadpole have a functional thyroid gland. Just prior to metamorphosis, xTRα is ubiquitously expressed, but particularly high levels of it are detected in the brain, limb buds, skin, and other tissues that are destined to respond to TH by proliferating and differentiating into adult organs (8Berry D.L. Rose C.S. Remo B.F. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 9Kawahara A. Baker B.S. Tata J.R. Development. 1991; 112: 933-943PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, much lower levels of Xenopus TRβ mRNA are detectable prior to metamorphosis (6Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 10Kanamori A. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 739-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At metamorphosis, TRβ is strongly induced by TH in larval tissues such as the tail that will die and resorb. TRβ levels remain very low in the growing limbs, although expression in this tissue may be highly localized (11Fairclough L. Tata J.R. Dev. Growth Differ. 1997; 39: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In remodeling tissues, such as the intestine and cartilage of the head, TRβ mRNA is up-regulated in both dying and proliferating cells, suggesting a possible role for TRβ in both processes (8Berry D.L. Rose C.S. Remo B.F. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Shi Y.B. Su Y. Li Q. Damjanovski S. Int. J. Dev.

Xenopus TRs are extremely well conserved in comparison with their avian and mammalian counterparts (4Yaoita Y. Shi Y.B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). xTRα is >95 and 91% conserved in its DNA and ligand-binding domains, respectively, when compared with rat TRα. xTRβ is >96 and 94% conserved in those domains compared with rat TRβ. The major difference between the two Xenopus TR subtypes is the lack of an amino-terminal domain in xTRβ that may participate in cell-specific transcriptional activation or altered DNA binding properties in xTRα. A recently developed synthetic thyroid hormone analog, GC-1 (Fig. 1, bottom), preferentially binds and transactivates mammalian TRβ versus TRα (14Chiellini G. Apriletti J.W. Yoshihara H.A. Baxter J.D. Ribeiro R.C. Scanlan T.S. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In human TRs, a single amino acid difference in the ligand binding pocket is responsible for this selectivity (15Wagner R.L. Huber B.R. Shiau A.K. Kelly A. Cunha Lima S.T. Scanlan T.S. Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. West B.L. Fletterick R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 398-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and this amino acid difference is conserved in Xenopus TRs. In vivo, GC-1 selectively decreases plasma lipids and thyroid-stimulating hormone secretions without increasing the heart rate in hypothyroid rats (16Trost S.U. Swanson E. Gloss B. Wang-Iverson D.B. Zhang H. Volodarsky T. Grover G.J. Baxter J.D. Chiellini G. Scanlan T.S. Dillmann W.H. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3057-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The effects of GC-1 are consistent with the known relative expression patterns of rat TR subtypes in the liver, the pituitary, and the heart. Recently, we have established that X. laevis metamorphosis provides a simple screening assay for the biological activity of thyroid hormone receptor antagonists (17Lim W. Nguyen N.H. Yang H.Y. Scanlan T.S. Furlow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35664-35670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because the Xenopus and mammalian TRs are strongly conserved and the tissue-specific responses to TH are very dramatic, we used GC-1 to probe TR subtype function in living X. laevis tadpoles during induced metamorphosis. Protease Protection Assays—[35S]methionine-labeled (Amersham Biosciences) TRα and TRβ proteins were synthesized using the TnT SP6-coupled wheat germ extract in vitro transcription and translation system (Promega). 2 μl of translated 35S-labeled TR was mixed with the indicated concentrations of T3, GC-1, NH-3, or vehicle and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 2 μg of type IV elastase (Sigma) was mixed with the TR and hormone in 96-well plates (Costar 9017), bringing the total volume to 20 μl. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added followed by four 1-min freezethaw cycles. Samples were boiled for 10 min before SDS-PAGE analysis. The SDS-PAGE gel was fixed with 25% isopropanol and 10% acetic acid and dried for 2 h. The gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen overnight and scanned with Storm 860 (Amersham Biosciences). The bands were quantitated using ImageQuant software. Transient Transfection Assays—DNA encoding the Xenopus TRα ligand-binding domain (amino acids 132–418) or Xenopus TRβ ligand-binding domain (amino acids 85–369) was amplified by PCR using proofreading (Pfu) DNA polymerase from cDNA encoding X. laevis TRα or TRβ using specific primers flanked by BamHI sites (5′ and 3′). These fragments were subcloned in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain into pSG5 Gal4 DBD vector (a gift from Marty Privalsky, University of California, Davis) between the BamHI and BglII sites of the dephosphorylated vector. All clones were verified by DNA sequencing (University of California, Davis DNA Sequencing Facility). All cell culture media and transfection reagents were obtained from Invitrogen unless indicated otherwise. XLA kidney cells or XTC fibroblast cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well in 70% Leibovitz L-15 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin. The cells were maintained at room temperature without CO2 supplementation. XLA cells were transfected with 50 ng of pSG5 Gal4/TRa or pSG5 Gal4/TRb, 100 ng of MH100X4 (a luciferase reporter gene with four upstream activation stream or Gal4 binding sites, kindly provided by David Mangelsdorf, University of Texas Southwestern), and 350 ng of pCS2-βgalactosidase per well (18Turner D.L.

XTC cells were transfected with 100 ng of X. laevis TR expression vector (miw TRα, miw TRβ, or miw chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as control (19Furlow J.D. Brown D.D. Mol.

DNA for XLA or XTC cell transfections were mixed with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) per well and added to the cells for 24 h. Cells were allowed to recover for 12–16 h in the culture medium and then treated for 48 h with the indicated doses of T3, GC-1, or vehicle. Cells were harvested by scraping in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, and cell pellets were resuspended in 125 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) followed by a single freeze-thaw cycle. Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity as described elsewhere (19Furlow J.D. Brown D.D. Mol.

(Fort Atkinson, WI) and staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (20Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Tables of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). Garland Publishing, New York1994Google Scholar). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. For hormone treatments, a 1 mm stock of T3 was dissolved in 4 mm NaOH, and a 10 mm GC-1 stock was made in dimethyl sulfoxide. GC-1 was synthesized as described elsewhere (14Chiellini G. Apriletti J.W. Yoshihara H.A. Baxter J.D. Ribeiro R.C. Scanlan T.S. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). For whole animal treatments, stage 52 and stage 53 tadpoles were placed in 1× Steinberg's solution (10 mM HEPES, 60 mM NaCl, 0.67 mM KCl, 0.34 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.83 mM MgSO4, pH 7.4) with 1 mm methimazole and the indicated hormone concentrations or appropriate vehicle and observed daily. After 1 week, animals were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% formalin. Animals were photographed with a Nikon F-5 camera, and slides were scanned into Adobe Photoshop 5.0 using a Kodak RFS 3570 Plus film scanner. Images were then assembled in Adobe Pagemaker 6.5. Tail Organ Culture—Tadpole tails were cultured in vitro as described previously (21Tata J.R. Kawahara A. Baker B.S. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Staged tadpoles were pre-treated in 1× Steinberg's solution containing gentamycin (70 μg/ml) and streptomycin (200 μg/ml) 24 h before removal of the tail tips for culture. The tadpoles were anesthetized briefly in water containing 0.01% MS222 (aminoesterbenzoic acid; Sigma), after which 6 mm of the tail tip was cut and placed in 1 ml of Steinberg's solution with antibiotics and 5 μg/ml insulin in 12-well Falcon tissue culture dishes (BD Biosciences). Tail tips were left in the culture media for 24 h before the first hormone treatment. T3 (Sigma) and GC-1 were diluted to the appropriate final concentration. The same final dilution of the vehicle was added to control cultures. Afterward, the culture media with hormones were changed every 48 h. The length of each tail was measured every 24 h, and each experimental point consisted of the mean change of 4 to 6 tails. Each experiment was repeated twice. RNA Analysis—Tadpoles of the indicated stage were treated with T3 or GC-1 in 1× Steinberg's solution for 48 h. Tails were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern hybridization using cDNA probes as described previously (22Furlow J.D. Berry D.L. Wang Z. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 284-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The amount of hybridized probe was determined using an Amersham Biosciences Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software and normalized to the expression of the ribosomal protein rpL8 gene (23Shi Y.B. Liang V.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). GC-1 Binds Preferentially to X. laevis TRβ over TRα—GC-1 is an iodine-free thyromimetic that preferentially binds mammalian TRβ over TRα (14Chiellini G. Apriletti J.W. Yoshihara H.A. Baxter J.D. Ribeiro R.C. Scanlan T.S. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To determine the relative binding affinity of GC-1 for each of the Xenopus TRs, protease protection assays were performed. Protease protection assays have been used previously to both estimate binding affinity and reveal different conformations induced by various natural and synthetic nuclear receptor ligands (24Yoh S.M. Privalsky M.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 202: 129-152PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the assay is performed at equilibrium and bound and free ligands are not separated, so results tend to accurately reflect the relative transcriptional activation potency of the ligands in question (25Blumberg B. Bolado Jr., J. Derguini F. Craig A.G. Moreno T.A. Chakravarti D. Heyman R.A. Buck J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4873-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of T3, the most potent form of TH (Fig. 1, top), induce a major protected band of ∼35 kDa in both xTRα and xTRβ (Fig. 2A). The binding curves generated for xTRα and xTRβ were virtually identical (Fig. 2B). Using GC-1, a major protected band of the same size was produced; however, GC-1 bound to xTRβ at a concentration at least 10 times lower than that observed for xTRα (Fig. 2, A and B). Our protease protection assay revealed a preference of GC-1 for TRβ over TRα, which is remarkably consistent with the results of competitive ligand binding assays used for mammalian TRs. Therefore, GC-1 is a TRβ-selective ligand for Xenopus TRs. Activation of X. laevis Thyroid Hormone Receptors by GC-1—We next tested the ability of GC-1 to activate TRs in X. laevis cells using a transient transfection assay. Using X. laevis XLA kidney cells, which express functional TRs, we examined the T3- and GC-1-regulated transactivation properties of the TRα and TRβ ligand-binding domains as Gal4 fusion proteins. The dose-response curves for T3 activation of TRα and TRβ on an upstream activation sequence-based reporter gene were virtually identical, whereas GC-1 activated TRβ at lower concentrations than TRα (Fig. 3, A and B). The leftward shift in the GC-1 dose-response curve was ∼10–20-fold at 50% maximal induction, which essentially mirror the protease protection assay results shown in Fig. 2. We next tested the relative ability of GC-1 to activate full-length Xenopus TRα and TRβ by transfecting expression vectors for each subtype individually into the Xenopus XTC fibroblast cell line, which in our hands expresses a low level of functional TRs relative to XLA cells. For example, in the absence of transfected TR, T3 or GC-1 only activated a TH response element-based reporter gene by <2-fold (see insets, Fig. 3, C and D). In response to T3, both TRα and TRβ strongly activated reporter gene transcription. In this case, the maximum level activation is different for TRα versus TRβ, but the EC50 (∼10 nm) does not change, as has been reported previously for mammalian TR (26Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14274-14280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When GC-1 is used, the maximum activation is similar, but the EC50 value (∼20 nm for TRβ versus 200 nm for TRα) is shifted in favor of TRα. (Fig. 3, C and D). Therefore, in both ligand binding and transactivation assays GC-1 is a TRβ-selective ligand for Xenopus as well as mammalian TRs. Effect of GC-1 on X. laevis Tadpoles—An important advantage of metamorphosis as an assay system is that thyroid hormone can be added directly to the rearing water, causing accelerated effects that mimic what occurs during spontaneous metamorphosis. We treated premetamorphic tadpoles (stages 52 and 53) with increasing doses of both T3 and GC-1. These developmental stages are just prior to the time when the thyroid gland becomes active but after the animals are fully competent to respond to exogenous hormones. We observed the first clear response to GC-1 at 50 nm, where obvious gill resorption and modest tail resorption are induced (Fig. 4A). As the dose of GC-1 is increased, progressively more gill and tail resorption occurs. Very little change is observed in the limbs except for a loss of tissue around the forelimb buds, allowing them to extend away from the body. At high doses of GC-1 (>200 nm) the animals develop a beak-like appearance because of the expansion of Meckel's cartilage. Finally, at 500 nm GC-1 the treated tadpoles are considerably smaller than the controls with an almost complete loss of the tail and gills. Internally, we noted extensive resorption of the intestine beginning above 100 nm GC-1, similar to what is observed with T3 treatments above 10 nm. Like T3, the effects of GC-1 on intact tadpoles are first apparent about 2 days after treatment begins, and most animals survive the 1-week treatments even at the highest doses of GC-1. In some batches of animals we observed limited limb growth and some widening of the brain at concentrations of GC-1 >200 nm, but these effects occurred infrequently and at higher concentration than those required for tail and gill resorption that were always observed. Our results with GC-1 contrast significantly with the results obtained with the endogenous hormone T3. Low doses of T3 (2 nm) induced hindlimb and forelimb growth and differentiation without significant loss of tail tissue (Fig. 4A). In dorsal views (Fig. 4B), expansion of the brain is readily observed at low T3 doses; we observe a consistent 30–40% expansion of the brain in response to 2 nm T3. Higher T3 concentrations (10 nm) induced limb growth to a greater extent, and gill loss becomes clearly noticeable. Both the growth of adult structures such as the limbs and the resorption of larval tissues such as the tail and gills are apparent at the highest doses of T3 used in these studies (50 nm). A “hunchbacked” appearance is also apparent at these higher T3 doses that is not seen in GC-1 treated animals. This results presumably from the accelerated development of adult dorsal muscle (44Nishikawa A. Hayashi H. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Toxicity was observed when T3 was used in excess of 50 nm, with many animals dying within a few days after treatment. Thus, when GC-1 and T3 dose responses are compared, GC-1 induces death and resorption of larval tissues at lower concentrations than are required to induce limb growth. This is completely opposite to the developmental program induced by the natural hormone T3, where growth responses generally precede larval tissue death and resorption. The Sensitivity of Tadpole Tails to GC-1 Increases with Increasing TRβ Expression—Because higher levels of GC-1 than of T3 were required to cause tissue responses in premetamorphic tadpoles, we next tested whether the efficiency of GC-1 in inducing larval cell death would improve in later developmental stages when TRβ levels are significantly elevated. TRβ protein expression increases 8–10-fold as tadpoles develop from premetamorphosis (prior to thyroid gland maturation) to metamorphic climax when tail resorption commences in earnest (27Eliceiri B.P. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24459-24465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, despite a modest increase in TRα message the TRα protein levels remain constant throughout metamorphosis. Therefore, we predicted a modest increase in sensitivity to T3 but a large increase in sensitivity to the TRβ-selective ligand GC-1 at two developmental stages as follows: (i) premetamorphic stages 52–54 with low TRβ levels; and (ii) prometamorphic stages 57 and 58, when TRβ levels were nearly maximal but tail resorption had not yet begun. We first established that isolated tail tips from premetamorphic tadpoles would resorb in a T3 dose-responsive and reproducible manner (Fig. 5A). Maximal resorption rates occurred at concentrations above 32 nm T3. We then measured the efficiency of tail resorption in response to increasing T3 and GC-1 at stages 53 and 54 and stages 57 and58. Tails were measured after 6 days of treatment, when the control tails were still healthy and there were clear differences in the response to various doses of hormones (Fig. 5B). Stage 57 and stage 58 tails were modestly more sensitive to T3 (∼2-fold at 50% resorption) than were stages 52–54 tails. Strikingly, the stage 57 and stage 58 tails were >12-fold more sensitive to GC-1 than the stages 52–54 tails when the doses required to induce 50% resorption are compared. This increased sensitivity to GC-1 is especially apparent at low doses of GC-1 (50 nm) where there is no response in young tadpoles, but a robust response is observed in older tadpoles. Induction of TH Response Genes by T3 and GC-1—A large collection of TH response genes has been cloned from X. laevis tadpole tails (28Wang Z. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as from several other tissues (29Shi Y.B. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Buckbinder L. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25786-25791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Denver R.J. Pavgi S. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8179-8188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Tail TH response genes include rapidly induced early genes that generally encode transcription factors and delayed genes that mostly encode membrane-bound, secreted, or intracellular proteases and extracellular matrix components and receptors (28Wang Z. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Brown D.D. Wang Z. Furlow J.D. Kanamori A. Schwartzman R.A. Remo B.F. Pinder A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1924-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Delayed gene expression is more tissue-specific than early gene expression and is especially strong in fibroblasts under the epidermis and between muscle fibers of the tail and in the gills (13Berry D.L. Schwartzman R.A. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the induction of tail TH response genes by increasing doses of T3 and GC-1, again using stages of development with different levels of TRβ expression. xBTEB (33Furlow J.D. Kanamori A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3295-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) is a zinc finger transcription factor, the expression of which is typical of early gene responses to both T3 and GC-1 (Fig. 6, A and B). xBTEB is quite sensitive to T3 because it is induced by as low as 1 nm T3 in stage 54 tadpoles. The induction of xBTEB by T3 at stage 57 is similar. GC-1 induces xBTEB above 100 nm in stage 54 tadpoles; however, at stages 57 and 58 GC-1 is unable to induce xBTEB expression above baseline. Gene 12, TH/bZIP, and TRβ itself are other early genes that show a similar dose-response profile to T3 and GC-1 as xBTEB does (data not shown). We next looked at the delayed class of tail response genes, exemplified by the membrane-bound protease fibroblast activation protein α (FAPα) (32Brown D.D. Wang Z. Furlow J.D. Kanamori A. Schwartzman R.A. Remo B.F. Pinder A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1924-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, C and D). First, a 5–10-fold higher level of T3 is required to activate delayed genes like FAPα than early genes like xBTEB. In response to GC-1, FAPα mRNA is first induced above base-line at 100 nm with a dose-response curve similar to that of xBTEB. Strikingly, FAPα becomes more, not less, sensitive to GC-1 in older animals that are expressing more TRβ. A clear induction of FAPα is seen in response to as low as 20 nm GC-1 in stage 57 and stage 58 animals. Other genes in this delayed class that show the same pattern of responses are the secreted matrix metalloproteinase collagenase-3 and the intracellular protease pepE (data not shown). We also noted that the dose-response curves for delayed gene expression closely parallel both the T3 and GC-1 dose-response curves in tail culture assays, further implicating these genes as key players in the process of tail resorption. A recently developed TRβ selective agonist, GC-1, preferentially induces a subset of TH-regulated developmental programs in X. laevis tadpoles, namely the death and resorption of larval tissues. Thus, we provide compelling evidence for different functional roles of the two TR subtypes during metamorphosis, extending earlier expression studies that were strictly correlative (8Berry D.L. Rose C.S. Remo B.F. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13Berry D.L. Schwartzman R.A. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 28Wang Z. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270-16278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results agree well with known TR isotype gene expression in that GC-1 induces TRα rich tissues poorly but is most effective in tissues that have low TRα levels but that strongly induce TRβ. TRβ expression in the tail is particularly high in fibroblasts under the skin and around the notochord that also strongly express delayed tail response genes like FAPα. The pronounced effects of GC-1 on gill and tail resorption are intriguing in light of recent experiments on the expression of TRα and TRβ in various salamander species. Obligatorily neotenic species like Necturus are unable to complete metamorphosis in that the external gills and tail fins of these animals are resistant to TH even though they have fully developed limbs. Interestingly, they express TRα in those tissues, but there is no detectable baseline or inducible TRβ message even though an apparently normal TRβ gene exists in the genome (34Safi R. Begue A. Hanni C. Stehelin D. Tata J.R. Laudet V. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Most tail response genes are induced by similarly high doses of GC-1 in premetamorphic animals (>100 nm) but show very different responses at later developmental stages when TRβ is the predominant receptor isotype. Based on these results, we propose that there are two classes of genes in terms of TR subtype control. In young animals, sufficient TRβ must be induced via TRα to activate delayed genes, but other early genes like xBTEB and gene 12 are also being induced in parallel. At later stages only the delayed genes become more sensitive to both T3 and GC-1, indicating that this gene class, at least in the tail, is preferentially controlled by TRβ. Our tail culture results are also most consistent with at least a partial requirement for activation for xTRα to induce sufficient xTRβ levels for a response in larval tissues like the tail. Indeed, the xTRβ gene contains a strong thyroid hormone response element near its transcription start site (35Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Machuca I. Esslemont G. Fairclough L. Tata J.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 96-107PubMed Google Scholar), and TRβ can be induced in tadpoles even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors (10Kanamori A. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 739-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are other possibilities to account for the differences in tissue sensitivity to T3 and GC-1. There may be a less efficient uptake of GC-1 than of T3 from the rearing media in young tadpoles or stage differences in the metabolism of the ligands. In rats, GC-1 accumulates in the liver to a higher degree than in the heart, potentiating its TR subtype-selective properties (16Trost S.U. Swanson E. Gloss B. Wang-Iverson D.B. Zhang H. Volodarsky T. Grover G.J. Baxter J.D. Chiellini G. Scanlan T.S. Dillmann W.H. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3057-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In this study, we deliberately focused on limb versus tail responses rather than on internal organs because of the equal access of each tissue to the media. Although our results are consistent with a dominant role for TRβ in larval tissue death and resorption, we cannot completely rule out a role for TRβ in the formation of adult structures during metamorphosis. For instance, TRβ activation may be important in the differentiation of adult cells after several rounds of TRα-mediated proliferation have occurred. TRβ mRNA is detectable in certain remodeling tissues undergoing both resorption and growth such as head cartilage and the intestine (8Berry D.L. Rose C.S. Remo B.F. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Shi Y.B. Su Y. Li Q. Damjanovski S. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 107-116PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the effects of GC-1 on premetamorphic tadpoles are perhaps more dramatic than expected based on the dose-response profiles of transient transfection assays alone. It is possible that inappropriately timed TRβ activation may antagonize TRα function. The estrogen-inducible progesterone receptor antagonizes estrogen receptor function in the mammalian uterus (37Tong W. Pollard J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Another interpretation of our results is that the effects of GC-1 on premetamorphic tadpoles may simply reflect where each isotype is most abundant as the tissue responds. In this model, the two TR isotypes differ quantitatively but not qualitatively. To test this possibility, transgenic approaches are now available in Xenopus, where it should be possible to express xTRβ in xTRα-dominated tissues and vice versa, depending on the availability of appropriate tissue-specific promoters. There is growing evidence in other animals for isotype-specific functions of nuclear receptors. In insects, ecdysone receptor diversity is generated by alternate promoter usage of the same gene to create different amino-terminal transactivation domains (38Talbot W.S. Swyryd E.A. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1323-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Three ecdysone receptor subtypes in Drosophila melanogaster are expressed in different ratios in different tissues, which correlate with different tissue fates at metamorphosis (38Talbot W.S. Swyryd E.A. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1323-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Specific ecdysone receptor-B1 mutations prevent salivary gland histolysis and development of a subset of imaginal disks that cannot be rescued by overexpression of the ecdysone receptor-A subtype (39Bender M. Imam F.B. Talbot W.S. Ganetzky B. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 777-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, knockout studies of each TR gene alone and in combination in mice have demonstrated both overlapping and distinct functions for the two TR genes (40Forrest D. Vennstrom B. Thyroid. 2000; 10: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). For instance, proper functional development of the inner ear appears to require TRβ (41Forrest D. Hanebuth E. Smeyne R.J. Everds N. Stewart C.L. Wehner J.M. Curran T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3006-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and TRα appears to play a more dominant role in TH control of resting heart rate and body temperature (42Johansson C. Gothe S. Forrest D. Vennstrom B. Thoren P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H2006-H2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Wikstrom L. Johansson C. Salto C. Barlow C. Campos Barros A. Baas F. Forrest D. Thoren P. Vennstrom B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). However, other processes, such as negative feedback control of the thyroid stimulating hormone gene, were at least partially affected in both TR knockouts (40Forrest D. Vennstrom B. Thyroid. 2000; 10: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It is possible that TR subtype-specific function is more distinct in taxa other than mammals. Certainly, the study of receptor signaling during development is easier in model systems with externally developing embryos. Our findings illustrate the utility of subtype-selective ligands as probes of nuclear receptor function in vivo and demonstrate the potential of natural systems such as amphibian metamorphosis for use as simple bioassays for the development of selective agonists and antagonists of thyroid hormone receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2165562199,"Grb14 is an effector of insulin signaling, which directly inhibits insulin receptor catalytic activity in vitro. Here, we investigated whether the expression of Grb14 and its binding partner ZIP (PKC zeta interacting protein) is regulated during insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic rodents and humans. Grb14 expression was increased in adipose tissue of both ob/ob mice and Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, whereas there was no difference in liver. An increase was also observed in subcutaneous adipose tissue of type 2 diabetic subjects when compared with controls. ZIP expression was increased in adipose tissue of ob/ob mice and type 2 diabetic patients, but it did not vary in GK rats. Hormonal regulation of Grb14 and ZIP expression was then investigated in 3T3-F442A adipocytes. In this model, insulin stimulated Grb14 expression, while TNF-alpha increased ZIP expression. Moreover, the insulin-sensitizing drugs thiazolidinediones (TZDs) decreased Grb14 expression in 3T3-F442A adipocytes. Finally, we investigated the dynamic regulation of Grb14 expression in ob/ob mice in several conditions improving their insulin sensitivity. Prolonged fasting and treatment with metformin significantly decreased Grb14 expression in peri-epidydimal adipose tissue, while there was only a trend to a diminution after TZD treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that the regulation of Grb14 expression in adipose tissue may play a physiological role in insulin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2071560736,"The assembly of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules with peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a critical step in the presentation of viral antigens to CD8+ T cells. This process is subject to quality control restrictions that prevent free class I heavy chains (HCs) and peptide-free HC-β2-microglobulin (β2m) dimers from exiting the ER.

These chaperones also associate with ERp57, an ER thiol oxidoreductase, and together they cooperate in proper disulfide bond formation in newly synthesized glycoproteins. Calreticulin, a soluble ER resident protein, shares considerable sequence and structural homology with the luminal domain of calnexin, an ER transmembrane protein. Both chaperones are predicted to possess a globular domain with an extended arm comprised of proline-rich repeats known as the P domain (3Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J.M. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3133-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The globular domain possesses the lectin-like binding site with a specificity for monoglucosylated glycans (3Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J.M. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 5Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29686-29697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and the P-domain has been mapped as the site of interaction with ERp57 (6Frickel E.-M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the ER glycoprotein quality control cycle (2Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), the core Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide is transferred to newly synthesized proteins and quickly trimmed by glucosidases I and II to the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 processing intermediate, which is the specific ligand of calreticulin and calnexin. Associated ERp57 catalyzes the formation or rearrangement of disulfide bonds within the folding glycoprotein via covalent intermediates. It has yet to be conclusively established if trimming of the terminal glucose by glucosidase II induces or follows dissociation of substrate from the chaperones. An affinity in the micromolar range for monoglucosylated proteins (7Patil A.R. Thomas C.J. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24348-24356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) might allow an equilibrium between bound and free glycoprotein, thus providing sufficient free material to serve as a substrate for glucosidase II. Nonetheless, if the released and de-glucosylated glycoprotein does not acquire its native state, it is re-glucosylated by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, which allows it to re-engage with calnexin or calreticulin. UDP-glucose:glyco-protein glucosyltransferase serves as a folding sensor, preferentially recognizing and re-glucosylating non-native glycoproteins with some degree of tertiary structure (8Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Successive cycles of re-glucosylation and glucose trimming coincident with association with and dissociation from the chaperones continue until the glycoprotein acquires its native structure and is exported to the Golgi bearing non-glucosylated oligomannose glycoforms. Alternatively, if the glycoprotein remains unfolded, it is targeted for degradation. The precise location of the glycan may coordinate the recruitment of the quality control machinery to local domains to facilitate proper folding and disulfide bond formation (9Ritter C. Helenius A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 278-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Daniels R. Kurowski B. Johnson A.E. Hebert D.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). One question not yet resolved is whether calreticulin and calnexin can act as folding sensors in addition to UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. Two conflicting models have been proposed for their role in the quality control pathway (1Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 69-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In the lectin-only model, calreticulin and calnexin interact solely with the monoglucosylated glycan and are not capable of discriminating between conformational states of a protein. In contrast, the dual binding model proposes that they recognize and bind to polypeptide-based determinants in addition to the oligosaccharide and thus behave more like classic chaperones. To date, it has not yet been possible to resolve this debate with the available experimental substrates and methods. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule was one of the first substrates of calnexin and calreticulin to be identified and has been extensively studied as an in vivo model of ER quality control (11Cresswell P. Traffic. 2000; 1: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is a trimeric complex composed of a glycosylated heavy chain (HC), β2-microglobulin (β2m), and an 8- to 10-amino acid peptide, which is expressed on the surface of most cells and presents peptides derived from viral antigens to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. The peptides are generated from cytosolic proteins by the proteasome and translocated via the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) into the ER where they may be trimmed by an ER aminopeptidase (12Serwold T. Gonzalez F. Kim J. Jacob R. Shastri N. Nature. 2002; 419: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 13York I.A. Chang S.-C. Saric T. Keys J.A. Favreau J.M. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) prior to binding to the HC-β2m heterodimer. Once assembled, the MHC class I-peptide complex escapes the ER quality control machinery and is exported to the Golgi. The assembly of MHC class I molecules is a multistep process that requires a host of molecular chaperones. Minor differences have been observed between the human and murine pathways, but the general schemes are very similar (14Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). In the human system, the free MHC class I HC transiently associates with calnexin shortly after synthesis, and, upon dissociation, assembles with β2m. The empty HC-β2m heterodimer next interacts with the MHC class I peptide loading complex, which is composed of the class I-specific chaperone tapasin, calreticulin, ERp57, and TAP. MHC class I genes are highly polymorphic and vary in their association with the loading complex (15Greenwood R. Shimizu Y. Sekhon G.S. DeMars R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5525-5536PubMed Google Scholar, 16Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), which facilitates peptide binding to the class I molecule. The structure of the loading complex, the mechanism of peptide loading, and the precise roles of calreticulin, ERp57, and tapasin have yet to be defined. The peptide loading complex is thought to be stabilized by multiple, cooperative interactions between the individual components. Direct binding has been demonstrated between tapasin and TAP (17Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), calreticulin and ERp57 (18Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and tapasin and ERp57 (19Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The latter interaction is stabilized by an interchain disulfide bond. Human class I HCs have a single N-linked glycan at Asn-86 that is presumed to be the site of association with calreticulin based on its glucosylation status in the peptide loading complex (20Radcliffe C.M. Diedrich G. Harvey D.J. Dwek R.A. Cresswell P. Rudd P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46415-46423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, it has not been possible to date to properly analyze the calreticulin-MHC class I interaction in isolation. Using sophisticated “genetic tailoring” to control glycan structure (21Jakob C.A. Burda P. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Roth J. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we have developed glycosylation mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to express recombinant HLA-B8 bearing a monoglucosylated N-linked glycan. These molecules were purified and refolded in vitro to mimic various folding intermediates. We demonstrate that calreticulin binds directly to native as well as non-native MHC class I molecules via the oligosaccharide alone. Thus, the in vitro interaction of calreticulin with a substrate that closely mimics its in vivo counterpart is glycan-dependent and conformation-insensitive. These findings provide insight into the nature of MHC class I peptide loading as well as the chaperone activity of calreticulin. Chemicals of the highest grade were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA). Yeast medium was obtained from BIO 101 Systems (Carlsbad, CA). The rat monoclonal Ab 3B10.7, which recognizes free MHC class I HC, has been previously described (22Lutz P.M. Cresswell P. Immunogenetics. 1987; 25: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-calreticulin polyclonal Ab was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO), and the rabbit anti-β2m polyclonal Ab was purchased from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). The transformed human B cell line .220.B8 was previously described (15Greenwood R. Shimizu Y. Sekhon G.S. DeMars R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5525-5536PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) with 5% bovine calf serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA). YG780 was obtained as an ascospore from crossing a MATa ade2–101 ura3–52 tyr1 his3Δ200Δmns1::KanMX yeast strain (YG746; (23Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J.

Jakob, unpublished data. and subjecting the resulting diploid to sporulation. The gls2 and mns1 deletions were identified and confirmed by PCR. The strain was not temperature-sensitive indicating a wild-type KAR2 allele; PCR investigation proved the PRC1 locus to be wild-type. Standard protocols were followed for yeast growth, mating, sporulation, and ascus dissection (24Guthrie G. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1991Google Scholar). Glycosylated MHC Class I HC—Inserts encoding GF-B8 and GS-B8 were generated by PCR and cloned into the pNB530 plasmid, which is an integrating vector with the URA3 marker allowing expression in S. cerevisiae controlled by the GAL1 promoter. PCR primers were designed to introduce the pre-pro α-factor signal sequence MRFPSIFTAVLFAASSALA at the N terminus and a His6 tag at the C terminus. The pNB530 constructs were linearized using StuI and stably integrated into the YG556, YG562, and YG780 strains using the lithium acetate transformation procedure. Transformants were selected by growth on medium lacking uracil. Clones expressing the highest levels of HLA-B8 were used to inoculate large scale cultures in media containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% raffinose. Cells were grown to mid-log phase (0.5–0.8 ODU/ml), and protein expression was induced for 5 h at 30 °C by adding 2% galactose. The cells were harvested, washed in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4), and lysed by boiling in 1% SDS, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mm DTT. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was diluted 10-fold with 1% Triton X-100 in TBS with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin. GS-B8 was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using 3B10.7 coupled to CNBr-activated Biogel A15m beads (Bio-Rad). Protein was eluted in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and further purified using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were stored in 8 m urea, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.1 mm DTT. Non-glycosylated MHC Class I HC—The insert encoding NGS-B8, incorporating a C-terminal His6 tag, was generated by PCR and cloned into the pQE60 vector from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). BL21 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) transformed with the pQE60 NGS-B8 construct were induced for 3 h at 30 °C with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cell lysates were prepared as above and applied to an Ni-NTA-agarose column. Protein was eluted under denaturing conditions and dialyzed into 8 m urea, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.1 mm DTT. Calreticulin—The mature sequence of calreticulin was cloned into the pGEX-2T expression vector from Amersham Biosciences as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The pGEX-2T GST-CRT construct was made using PCR to introduce the human calreticulin sequence with a His6 tag C-terminal to GST. BL21 cells transformed with pGEX-2T GST-CRT were induced for 3 h at 30 °C with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and lysed with B-PER II reagent (Pierce), and GST-CRT was isolated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Calreticulin was released from GST by incubation of the beads at 37 °C for 16 h with 60 units/ml thrombin. After further purification using Ni-NTA-agarose, it was stored in TBS-C (TBS with 2 mm CaCl2). Samples were analyzed on 10 and 14% Laemmli gels. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (19Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) using Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Human Cell Lines—.220.B8 cells were harvested and depleted for 1 h in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were pulse-labeled with 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in methionine-free medium and then chased in media with 5% bovine calf serum and 1 mg/ml methionine at 37 °C for the times indicated. All steps were performed in the absence or presence of 1 mm deoxymannojirimycin (Sigma). Cells were harvested and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in TBS for 15 min on ice. The cell extract was centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g and then pre-cleared for 1 h at 4 °C with normal rabbit serum and Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation was performed with the 3B10.7 Ab for 2 h at 4 °C followed by three washes with 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS and analysis by SDS-PAGE. Yeast Cells—Cultures in raffinose medium were grown to mid-log phase and induced for 3 h with 2% galactose at 30 °C. The cells were harvested, exchanged into minimal medium with 2% galactose and lacking methionine, depleted for 20 min, and then pulsed with 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine for the indicated times. For kinetic experiments, cells were resuspended into raffinose medium with 1 mg/ml methionine and chased for up to 90 min. Cell lysates were prepared as described for the yeast purification and immunoprecipitation was performed using the 3B10.7 Ab. Glycan analysis was performed essentially as previously described (20Radcliffe C.M. Diedrich G. Harvey D.J. Dwek R.A. Cresswell P. Rudd P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46415-46423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified GS-B8 was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and separated by SDS-PAGE (25Kuster B. Wheeler S.F. Hunter A.P. Dwek R.A. Harvey D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The band was excised and digested with N-glycanase F. The released glycans were extracted, dried, and fluorescently labeled with 2-aminibenzamide by reductive amination (26Bigge J.C. Patel T.P. Bruce J.A. Goulding P.N. Charles S.M. Parekh R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) and then separated by NP-HPLC using a TSK amide-80 4.6-× 250-mm column (Tosoh Bioscience, Japan) calibrated using a dextran ladder (27Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Digestions with jack bean mannosidase and α-1,3-glucosidase II were performed as described (20Radcliffe C.M. Diedrich G. Harvey D.J. Dwek R.A. Cresswell P. Rudd P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46415-46423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The refolding of MHC class I complexes was performed essentially as described (28Garboczi D.N. Ghosh P. Utz U. Fan Q.R. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar) using human β2m purified from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies with either GS-B8 to generate glycosylated complexes or NGS-B8 to generate non-glycosylated complexes. The NP380–388 peptide was synthesized by the Keck facility (Yale University). Final concentrations of 1 μm soluble HLA-B8, 3 μm β2m, and 30 μm peptide were employed. Following three serial injections and incubations at 10 °C for 8–24 h each, the refolding reaction was concentrated, centrifuged to remove aggregates, and separated by gel filtration chromatography. To generate empty HC-β2m heterodimers, a modification of the protocol of Bouvier and Wiley (29Bouvier M. Wiley D.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was used. Refolded MHC class I complexes with an excess of free β2m were adjusted to a final concentration of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. The sample was dialyzed using 10,000-Da molecular weight cut-off membranes first into 8 m urea, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and then three times into TBS. The sample was concentrated and analyzed by gel filtration to confirm the presence of empty, refolded complexes. ELISA—To assay for the binding of calreticulin to free class I HC, 0.25 μg of GS-B8, NGS-B8, β2m, and BSA were coated onto the wells of an Immulon 96-well plate (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) in 100 μlof8 m urea, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, overnight at 4 °C. The wells were blocked with 1% BSA in TBS-C for 1 h at room temperature and then washed. One set of wells was mock treated, and the other was incubated with either endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science, 20 milliunits for 16 h at room temperature) or recombinant S. cerevisiae α-glucosidase (Sigma, 50 units for 4 h at 37 °C). To assay for binding to MHC class I complexes, refolded GS-B8 and NGS-B8 with and without bound peptide were first incubated with 3B10.7 beads to deplete any existing free HC. The complexes, native β2m (Sigma), and BSA were then coated in equivalent amounts onto an Immulon plate in 100 μl of TBS-C for 2 h at 4 °C and blocked as above. For all assays, calreticulin (5 μgin100 μl of TBS-C with 0.1% Tween 20) was added for 1 h at room temperature, and the plate was chilled on ice. The wells were incubated with the anti-calreticulin Ab for 45 min, and the HRP-conjugated secondary Ab for 30 min with three washes following all steps. Turbo-TMB reagent (100 μl, Pierce) was added for 5 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 8 n H2SO4, and the absorbance at 450 nm was recorded. Pull-down Assays—To analyze binding to free MHC class I HC, purified NGS-B8 and GS-B8 were pre-bound to 3B10.7 beads and then incubated with 5 μg of calreticulin in 100 μl of TBS with 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBS-TC). Samples were washed three times with ice-cold buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and probed with the anti-calreticulin Ab. To analyze binding to MHC class I complexes, GST-CRT and GST were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. Equivalent amounts of beads loaded with ∼5 μg of protein were incubated with 0.5 μg of GS-B8 and NGS-B8 complexes without or without peptide as well as 2 μg of native β2m as a negative control. The suspension was mixed for 1 h at room temperature in 100 μl of TBS-TC. The beads were washed with ice cold TBS-C, and the associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and probed with the rabbit anti-β2m Ab. [125I]Calreticulin Spin Column Assay—Calreticulin was labeled with [125I] (ICN) using the chloramine T method. Free class I HC (GS-B8 and NGS-B8) were prebound to 3B10.7 beads and then incubated at a concentration of 0.1 μm with 0–6 μm [125I]calreticulin in 100 μl of TBS-TC for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then chilled and placed into Micro Bio-spin columns (Bio-Rad) and washed individually by three brief centrifugations with 500 μl of ice-cold TBS-C. The calreticulin specifically associated with MHC class I HC was eluted by incubation with 10 mm EDTA in TBS for 5 min at room temperature and counted using a gamma counter. [125I]Calreticulin Plate Assay—Approximately 0.2 μg of denatured GS-B8 HC and refolded GS-B8 complexes were coated onto the wells of an Immulon plate for 16 h at 4 °C. It is noted that free HC was more effectively adsorbed to the wells and also that it was not possible to accurately quantitate the relative amount of free HC versus class I complexes immobilized on the plate. Next, the wells were blocked with 1% BSA and washed. [125I]Calreticulin was added at concentrations ranging from 0 to 6 μm in 70 μl of TBS-TC for 1 h at 37 °C. The plate was then chilled on ice, and the wells were quickly washed four times with 200 μl of ice-cold TBS-C. Calreticulin was released from the class I molecules by the addition of 10 mm EDTA in TBS for 5 min at room temperature and counted using a gamma counter. Expression of MHC Class I HC in S. cerevisiae Glycosylation Mutants—Certain MHC class I alleles are more dependent than others on the peptide loading complex for high affinity peptide binding and might therefore form more stable interactions with loading complex components in vitro. We chose to express recombinant HLA-B8 molecules, which have reduced cell surface expression in the tapasin-negative .220 cell line and are readily detected in association with the loading complex (15Greenwood R. Shimizu Y. Sekhon G.S. DeMars R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5525-5536PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J. Grandea III A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampe R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Because glycan processing has been reported to variably affect the association of different MHC class I alleles with calnexin (31Danilczyk U.G. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25532-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation that the interaction of HLA-B8 with the peptide loading complex in .220 cells was dependent on glycosylation and glucose trimming (data not shown). These findings were in agreement with our previous studies of HLA-A3 (17Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). To express MHC class I HC with the glycan structure Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 we took advantage of S. cerevisiae mutants missing several genes in the pathways for the biosynthesis and processing of N-linked oligosaccharides (21Jakob C.A. Burda P. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Roth J. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The genotypes of the yeast strains used in this study are detailed in Table I. The YG556 strain has no glycosylation mutations and was used as a control. YG562 is a related strain with deletions of the ALG8 and GLS2 genes. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, ALG8 catalyzes the addition of the second glucose residue to the dolichol pyrophosphate-linked glycan precursor. Deletion of this gene results in a lipid-linked Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 core oligosaccharide that can be transferred to newly synthesized proteins by the oligosaccharyltransferase (21Jakob C.A. Burda P. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Roth J. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Additional deletion of GLS2, which encodes the enzyme responsible for trimming the single glucose residue, allows glycoproteins to retain the desired Glc1 structure. Intact HLA-B8 cDNA (glycosylated, full-length (GF)-B8), and a truncated version (glycosylated, soluble (GS)-B8) encoding amino acids 1–273 of the luminal domain, were cloned into yeast expression vectors with the pre-pro α-factor signal sequence and a His6 tag (Fig. 1B). An analogous construct (non-glycosylated, soluble (NGS)-B8) was made to express the luminal domain of HLA-B8 without a glycan in Escherichia coli.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypePredicted glycan structureYG556Matα ura3-52 his3 lys2-801 sec18-50Glc0Man8-9GlcNAc2aPreviously shown to be Man8-9"
https://openalex.org/W2134907726,"Although adenovirus early region 1A (AdE1A) can modulate protein expression through its interaction with transcriptional regulators it can also influence the ability of the cell to degrade proteins by binding to components of the 26 S proteasome. We demonstrate here that AdE1A interacts with the S2 subunit of the 19 S regulatory complex in addition to the ATPase subunits S4 and S8 previously identified. S2 forms complexes with both the 13 and 12 S AdE1A proteins both in vivo and in vitro. Mutational analysis has shown direct binding through a short sequence toward the N terminus of conserved region 2 of AdE1A, which encompasses the LXCXE motif, involved in interaction with the pRb family of proteins. In vivo, additional contacts are made between AdE1A and proteasomal components, as well as within the proteasome, such that deletion of the N-terminal region of E1A as well as part of conserved region 2 is required to completely disrupt S2 binding. Mutation of AdE1A, which disrupts complex formation with S2, results in the loss of its ability to stabilize the p53 protein. Similarly down-regulation of S2 expression using small interfering RNAs leads to the inhibition of p53 degradation. These effects were observed in normally growing cells and those subjected to UV irradiation. Furthermore, AdE1A had no effect on the Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. We suggest therefore that interaction of AdE1A with S2, as well as with the ATPases S4 and S8, directly causes inhibition of proteasomal activity and consequent increase in the protein levels of p53. Although adenovirus early region 1A (AdE1A) can modulate protein expression through its interaction with transcriptional regulators it can also influence the ability of the cell to degrade proteins by binding to components of the 26 S proteasome. We demonstrate here that AdE1A interacts with the S2 subunit of the 19 S regulatory complex in addition to the ATPase subunits S4 and S8 previously identified. S2 forms complexes with both the 13 and 12 S AdE1A proteins both in vivo and in vitro. Mutational analysis has shown direct binding through a short sequence toward the N terminus of conserved region 2 of AdE1A, which encompasses the LXCXE motif, involved in interaction with the pRb family of proteins. In vivo, additional contacts are made between AdE1A and proteasomal components, as well as within the proteasome, such that deletion of the N-terminal region of E1A as well as part of conserved region 2 is required to completely disrupt S2 binding. Mutation of AdE1A, which disrupts complex formation with S2, results in the loss of its ability to stabilize the p53 protein. Similarly down-regulation of S2 expression using small interfering RNAs leads to the inhibition of p53 degradation. These effects were observed in normally growing cells and those subjected to UV irradiation. Furthermore, AdE1A had no effect on the Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. We suggest therefore that interaction of AdE1A with S2, as well as with the ATPases S4 and S8, directly causes inhibition of proteasomal activity and consequent increase in the protein levels of p53. IntroductionAdenovirus early region 1A (AdE1A) 1The abbreviations used are: AdE1A, adenovirus early region 1A; CR, conserved region; CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein; RC, regulatory complex; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; wt, wild type; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; RT, reverse transcriptase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. is the first protein to be expressed following viral infection and is essential for adenovirus-mediated cell transformation (1Mymryk J.S. Bayley S.T. Int. J. Onc. 1994; 5: 425-444PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shenk T. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 2111-2148Google Scholar, 3Shenk T. Flint J. Adv.

Two major E1A components are expressed that are of 289 and 243 amino acids in Ad2/5, differing only in the presence of a 46-amino acid sequence located toward the C terminus of the larger molecule. These proteins are referred to as 13 and 12 S products, respectively, based on the sedimentation coefficients of their mRNAs. Comparison of the sequences of AdE1As from different virus serotypes has allowed four highly conserved regions (CR) to be identified (5Avvakumov N. Wheeler R. D'Halluin J.C. Mymryk J.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7968-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6Kimelman D. Miller J.S. Porter D. Roberts B.E. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 399-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These conserved regions in Ad2/5E1A are distributed throughout the molecule with CR1 extending from residues 41 to 80 and CR2 from residues 121 to 139. CR3 is located in the region unique to the larger 13 S AdE1A species, and CR4 encompasses the C-terminal region.AdE1A exerts its effect on the target cell, during both infection and transformation, by binding to and radically altering the activity of a large number of cellular proteins (4Gallimore P.H. Turnell A.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7824-7835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Grand R.J. Virus, Cell Transformation and Cancer. Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands2001: 43-83Google Scholar). Many of the sites of interaction on AdE1A coincide with the conserved regions. For example, the pRb family of tumor suppressor proteins bind through CR1 and CR2 (8Whyte P. Ruley H.E. Harlow E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 257-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Egan C. Jelsma T.N.

Virol. 1992; 66: 4606-4611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas components of the general and specific transcriptional machinery (e.g. TATA-binding protein and activating transcription factor 2) bind to CR3 (11Geisberg J.V.

Nature. 1994; 368: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Similarly, C-terminal binding protein is targeted by the C terminus of E1A (CR4) (13Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It is notable, however, that certain significant partner proteins interact through the less highly conserved N-terminal region. For example, the transcriptional coactivators CBP/p300 (14Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), TATA-binding protein (15Song C.Z. Loewenstein P.M.

Gallimore P.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4759-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) all bind close to the N terminus.Although AdE1A is primarily able to modulate the level of expression of cellular proteins through its regulation of transcription, it can also affect the rate of protein degradation by targeting the 26 S proteasome (17Turnell A.S. Grand R.J. Gorbea C. Zhang X. Wang W. Mymryk J.S. Gallimore P.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4759-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Grand R.J. Turnell A.S. Mason G.G. Wang W. Milner A.E. Mymryk J.S. Rookes S.M. Rivett A.J. Gallimore P.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is the major nonlysosomal cellular mechanism of protein proteolysis (19Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 20Glickman M.H. Maytal V. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 268: 43-72PubMed Google Scholar, 21Voges D. Zwecki P. Baumeister W.

It comprises a 19 S regulatory complex (RC) and a 20 S proteolytic core. The 19 S RC itself is composed of a lid and base subcomponents. Present in the base are six homologous ATPases, at least some of which will bind to AdE1A, both in vitro and in vivo. We have previously shown that S4 and S8 interact with AdE1A mainly through a short sequence located toward the N terminus of the molecule (amino acids 15–19 appear to be essential for interaction) (17Turnell A.S. Grand R.J. Gorbea C. Zhang X. Wang W. Mymryk J.S. Gallimore P.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4759-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The interaction of AdE1A with S4 and/or S8 results in the inhibition of the activity of 26 S proteasomes directed against p53 in in vitro assays. Moreover, deletion mutants of AdE1A, which do not bind the proteasomal ATPase components have lost their ability to stabilize p53 protein in vivo. However, because AdE1A tends to target multiple components in many pathways, we have investigated the possibility that it might bind to non-ATPase subunits of the 19 S RC. Here we show that AdE1A will form a complex with the S2 subunit both in vitro and in vivo. The sites of interaction on the two proteins have been mapped with S2 binding to a sequence in CR2 overlapping that involved in interaction with pRb and AdE1A binding to the C terminus of S2. Further, we have demonstrated that interaction of AdE1A with S2 inhibits the ability of the 26 S proteasome to degrade p53 in both in vitro and in vivo assays. siRNA-mediated reduction of S2 levels in vivo similarly stabilizes p53 in a variety of assay systems. In addition, the ability of AdE1A to modify ubiquitination of p53 has been assessed. p53 stabilized by AdE1A is ubiquitinated in vivo, similar to the stabilization by S2 siRNA. AdE1A does not affect Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 in vitro. We have concluded therefore that regulation of p53 level by AdE1A is largely due to direct inhibition of proteasome activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Transient Transfection—Ad5HEK293 cells were derived from the transformation of human embryo kidney cells with sheared Ad5 DNA and express Ad5E1 proteins. H1299 and HCT116 are colon carcinoma cell lines. A549 cells were isolated from a human small cell lung carcinoma and have been used for the viral infection experiments. Both HCT116 and A549 cells express wild type (wt) p53, whereas H1299 does not express p53. The cells were grown in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. For transient transfection experiments, the cells at 60–70% confluency were transfected with plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) 24 h prior to harvesting or UV treatment. The total amount of DNA added to each dish was kept constant using the corresponding empty vector pcDNA3.Viruses and Viral Infection—The mutant adenoviruses used in the coimmunoprecipitation studies are based on dl520, which expresses Ad512SE1A but not 13SE1A. These viruses have various mutations created in the 12SE1A gene as described in Table I. For viral infection, subconfluent A549 cells were infected with dl520 and mutant viruses in serum-free medium at 50 plaque forming units/cell for 2 h at 37 °C with intermittent rocking. Infected cells were then washed once and incubated in fresh complete medium for a further 24 h.Table IAd5E1A mutants used in this studyMutantsMutation positionsAd5 plasmids 13SwtE1A13 S only dl1101Δ4-25 RG2Point mutation 2 Exon1Δ188-289 dl1108Δ124-127 RG2dl1108RG2, Δ124-127 dl0108Δ4-25, Δ124-127 L122PPoint mutation 122 T123NPoint mutation 123 C124RPoint mutation 124 H125DPoint mutation 125 E126QPoint mutation 126 12SwtE1A12 S onlyAd5 viruses wt dl520no 13 S or E3 dl1101Δ4-25 dl1104Δ48-60 dl1141Δ61-69 dl1106Δ96-105 dl1107Δ111-123 dl1108Δ124-127 dl0106Δ4-25, Δ96-105 dl0107Δ4-25, Δ111-123 dl0108Δ4-25, Δ124-127 dl1143Δ38-60 dl4308Δ38-60, Δ124-127 dl1520no E1B 55K Open table in a new tab Plasmids and Fusion Protein Production—Plasmid constructs encoding human 26 S proteasome subunits were described previously (23Gorbea C. Taillandier D. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 875-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Human Mdm2 and p53 plasmids were kindly provided by Prof. David Lane (University of Dundee). Constructs containing various Ad5 E1A mutants have been described previously (24Mymryk J.S.

Virology. 1989; 171: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and are shown in Table I. Intact AdE1A inserts were excised from parental plasmids with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites of a GST vector (pGEX-4T1) to generate GST-E1A fusion proteins or into pcDNA3 for in vitro transcription/translation and mammalian expression. Point mutations in the LXCXE motif were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene). The sequences of the AdE1A mutants were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. To induce GST-E1A fusion protein expression, a unique colony for each expression vector transformed with a GST-E1A plasmid was cultured in Luria broth in the presence of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C. To purify the GST fusion proteins, bacterial lysates were mixed with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) with rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting beads were washed, and GST fusion protein was eluted with the reduced form of glutathione (25 mm) for a further 1 h at 4 °C. The GST-E1A protein was carefully collected and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.3).In Vitro GST Pull-down Assays—Ad5 E1A mutants, human S5b, and intact S2 and S2 fragments were expressed by in vitro transcription/translation, either in the absence or presence of l-α-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), using the TnT®-coupled wheat germ or rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Typically, to assay in vitro binding capacity, 5–10 μgof GST conjugates were mixed with 10 μl, or equivalent proportions, of the respective translation mixture for 2 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.825 m NaCl and 1% Nonidet P-40. GST complexes were precipitated using 30 μl of packed, preswollen, glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitated complexes were washed four times with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 5% sucrose (w/v), 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40. The beads were washed once more with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.125 m NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40, prior to being resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by fluorography and autoradiography.Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, and Antibodies—The cells were harvested, after washing in ice-cold saline, by aspiration. For Western blotting studies the cells were lysed in 9 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), and 0.15 m β-mercaptoethanol, and the proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE in the presence 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m Bicine, and 0.1% SDS or in the presence of 7 m urea, 93 mm Tris, and 15 mm glycine but in the absence of SDS. After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the antigens were detected using appropriate antibodies. For immunoprecipitation studies the cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.825 m NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40. The antigens were immunoprecipitated using the appropriate antibodies and protein G-linked agarose (Sigma). Ad5E1A was detected with the mouse monoclonal M58 (Pharmingen) and M73. Human S2 and S8 were detected with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (23Gorbea C. Taillandier D. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 875-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), p53 was detected in Western blots with the monoclonal antibody DO1.In Vitro Protein Degradation Assays—Human p53 and HPV16E6 were in vitro translated using the TnT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte system in the presence or absence of l-α-[35S]methionine. AdE1A proteins were generated from GST fusion vectors. HPV16 E6-mediated degradation of p53 was as described by Crook et al. (27Crook T. Tidy J. Vousden K. Cell. 1991; 67: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) as modified by Turnell et al. (17Turnell A.S. Grand R.J. Gorbea C. Zhang X. Wang W. Mymryk J.S. Gallimore P.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4759-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In vitro translated p53 and HPV16 E6 (at a ratio of 2:1) were incubated in degradation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 3 mm dithiothreitol) containing additional rabbit reticulocyte lysates to a final concentration of 40%. In incubations containing GST-AdE1A or GST-AdE1A mutants, rabbit reticulocyte lysates were preincubated with AdE1A prior to the addition of p53 and HPV16 E6. After the allotted time the aliquots were withdrawn and mixed with SDS sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—The assays contained 35S-labeled p53 (1 μl), 100 mm Tris (pH 7.6), GST-Mdm2 (40 ng), ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 (75 ng), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 (UbcH5a, 75 ng), ubiquitin (2.5 μg), ubiquitin aldehyde (140 ng), 10 μm ATP, and MgCl2. GST-AdE1A was added at an equal molar concentration to Mdm2 or in 5-fold molar excess. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. 35S-Labeled p53 was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. GST-Mdm2 was a gift from Prof. David Lane (University of Dundee). E1 and E2 proteins were kindly provided by Prof. Ron Hay (University of St. Andrews).RNA Interference Assays—All purified, annealed double-stranded siRNAs were purchased from Qiagen. The targeted sequences of proteasome subunits are as follows: 5′-aag aac aag gac cac gga atg tt-3′ (nucleotides 1201–1223) for S2 and 5′-aa gaa gtg atc gag ctg cct gtt-3′ (nucleotides 485–507) for S8. Transient transfection of siRNAs into cells was performed using OligofectAMINE reagent according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The concentration of siRNAs used in the study is indicated in the figure legends. A nonsilencing siRNA was used as a negative control. The experiments were repeated two to four times depending on the experiment with duplicate plates, and highly reproducible results were generated.Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Expression of specific messenger RNAs was determined using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System. RT-PCR was carried out in 25-μl volumes on 96-well plates, in a reaction buffer containing 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, 100–200 nmol of TaqMan probe, and 900 nmol of primers. The predesigned probe and primers to detect p53 were purchased from PE Biosystems. S2 primers (5′-GCCAAGGACCCAAACAACCT and 3′-CCCCGGCACGCTCTGT) and S2 probe (TCATGGTGCGCTTGGCACAGGTA) were designed in-house and purchased from Eurogentec. All of the reactions were multiplexed with a preoptimized control probe for 18 S ribosomal RNA (PE Biosystems), enabling data to be expressed in relation to an internal reference, to allow for differences in RT efficiency. p53 and S2 probes were labeled with FAM dye, and the 18 S probe was labeled with VIC dye. The reactions were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and then 44 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min.UV Irradiation—Medium was removed from cells to be irradiated. The cells were exposed to UV irradiation at a wavelength of 254 nm for an appropriate time to give a dose of 10, 30, or 60 J/m2. The medium was then added back to the cells, which were incubated at 37 °C for a further 24 h prior to harvesting for p53 detection and apoptosis analysis.Apoptosis Assays—FACS analysis was employed to evaluate apoptosis by determining the proportion of sub-G1 cells in a particular population labeled with propidium iodide. Apoptosis was confirmed by staining the cells with acridine orange dye and examination for apoptotic characteristics under the microscope. At the required time point, adherent cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and detached from the culture dish with trypsin/EDTA and combined with the non-adherent cells. The cell pellet was then washed and resuspended in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 1 h. Following fixation, the cells were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μg of RNase A and 5 μg of propidium iodide prior to separation by FACS using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. The percentage of labeled apoptotic cells was determined using multicycle WinMDI software, version 2.8.RESULTSInteraction of AdE1A with the 26 S Proteasome Subunit S2—It has previously been shown that AdE1A will bind directly to the S4 and S8 ATPase subunits of the 19 S RC (17Turnell A.S. Grand R.J. Gorbea C. Zhang X. Wang W. Mymryk J.S. Gallimore P.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4759-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Grand R.J. Turnell A.S. Mason G.G. Wang W. Milner A.E. Mymryk J.S. Rookes S.M. Rivett A.J. Gallimore P.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It can be seen from the data presented in Fig. 1 showing that when the non-ATPase subunit S2 is immunoprecipitated from Ad5 HEK293 cells, Ad5E1A is coprecipitated (Fig. 1A). When the immunoprecipitates were fractionated on a “urea gel” (i.e. in the absence of SDS) the 12 and 13 S forms of AdE1A were distinguishable, both having interacted with S2 (Fig. 1B). Similarly, when AdE1A was immunoprecipitated from either Ad5 transformed human cells (Ad5 HEK293) or Ad5 wt virus-infected A549 cells, S2 was coprecipitated (Fig. 1C).Because AdE1A will bind to several proteasomal components, it is possible that the results shown in Fig. 1 could be attributable to coprecipitation of intact proteasomes and binding of AdE1A to the ATPase subunits. To demonstrate direct interaction S2 was expressed using an in vitro transcription/translation kit and labeled with l-α-[35S]methionine. This material was incubated with GST-Ad5E1A (or GST alone), and bound protein was identified by PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2). Direct binding of S2 to GST-AdE1A was clearly evident, although no interaction of GST with S2 was observed (Fig. 2A). To confirm the specificity of the interaction between S2 and AdE1A, GST-Ad5E1A was also incubated with the l-α-[35S]methionine-labeled unrelated proteasome component S5b. AdE1A did not bind to S5b (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Ad5E1A binds to S2 but not S5b in vitro. Bacterially expressed GST or GST-Ad5E1A protein (10 μg) was incubated with l-α-[35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated S2 or S5b (10 μl) for 2 h at 4 °C. Glutathione-agarose beads were added, and GST, GST-AdE1A, and bound proteins were isolated. After washing, the beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and the proteins fractionated by SDS-PAGE. 35S-labeled S2 or S5b was detected by fluorography and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Site of Interaction for AdE1A on S2—To determine the binding site for AdE1A, three l-α-[35S]methionine-labeled fragments of S2 (encoding amino acids 1–416, 417–701, and 702–908; Fig. 3A) were incubated with GST Ad5E1A, and bound protein was detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. It can be seen (Fig. 3B) that GST-Ad5E1A bound strongly and specifically to only the C-terminal fragment. No interaction with the N-terminal and intermediate polypeptides of S2 was observed, nor did any S2 polypeptide bind to GST alone.Fig. 3Ad5E1A binds to the C-terminal region of S2. A, full-length S2 (amino acids 1–908) and three fragments of S2: S2-NT (amino acids 1–416), S2-I (amino acids 417–701), and S2-CT (amino acids 702–908), were in vitro translated and l-α-[35S]methionine-labeled using wheat germ lysates. B, 35S-labeled S2 and fragments (10 μl) were incubated with GST or GST-Ad5E1A (10 μg) for 2 h at 4 °C. Using glutathione-agarose GST proteins were isolated. The bound proteins were detected after SDS-PAGE by fluorography and autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Site of Interaction for S2 on AdE1A—The S4 and S8 ATPase subunits of the 19 S proteasome bind to the N terminus of AdE1A between amino acids 4 and 25 (17Turnell A.S. Grand R.J. Gorbea C. Zhang X. Wang W. Mymryk J.S. Gallimore P.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4759-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It was therefore of considerable interest to investigate whether S2 bound through the same region. Initially a series of Ad5E1A mutants (summarized in Table I) were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli and purified. These proteins were incubated with l-α-[35S]methionine-labeled S2. Bound S2 was detected by PAGE and autoradiography. It can be seen from Fig. 4A that a deletion at the N terminus of AdE1A, which interfered with S4 and S8 interaction (dl1101) had no effect on binding to S2. Similarly the C-terminal fragment of S2 formed a complex with these AdE1A derivatives (Fig. 4B). However, when a second set of mutants with lesions in CR2 were examined in the in vitro assay, it was observed that that loss of amino acids 124–127 (dl1108), toward the N-terminal end of CR2, disabled the binding capacity of the protein (Fig. 4C). Amino acids 124–127 comprise part of the Rb-binding site LXCXE (28Dyson N. Buchkovich K. Whyte P. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 58: 249-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, mutation of any single residue in this site did not negate binding of S2 (Fig. 4D). It is presumed that several of the amino acids in this short sequence are required for interaction.Fig. 4Binding of S2 to Ad5E1A mutants in vitro. S2 or S2-CT was in vitro transcribed/translated and labeled with l-α-[35S]methionine. Radiolabeled S2 was incubated with purified GST or GST-E1A fusion proteins. Bound S2 proteins were detected by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE. A, radiolabeled S2 bound to GST-E1A wt, exon 1, dl1101, and RG2 but not to GST. B, as A except the C-terminal region of S2 was used in the binding reaction. C, additional mutant GST-E1A proteins were used in the S2 binding assay: dl1108 and RG2dl1108.

Mutant AdE1A proteins have been used to establish a binding site for S2 in vitro (Fig. 4). Mutant viruses were used to investigate whether the same and/or additional sites on AdE1A are required for interaction in vivo. Viruses carrying mutations in AdE1A (summarized in Table I) were used to infect A549 cells. After 24 h the cells were harvested, and S2 was immunoprecipitated. Bound AdE1A was detected by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). AdE1A and S2 were expressed at comparable levels in all of the samples (Fig. 5A, two lower panels). Interestingly, when S2 was immunoprecipitated from cells infected with dl1108 (the CR2 deletion that did not bind to S2 in vitro), AdE1A was coprecipitated (Fig. 5A, top panel). However, the deletion of a second region (amino acids 4–25) at the N terminus of AdE1A disrupted interaction between Ad5E1A and S2 (mutant dl0108), although deletion of the N-terminal region alone (dl1101) had no effect on binding of AdE1A to S2 (Fig. 5A). A second virus (dl0107) carrying deletions in the N-terminal region and CR2 expressed an AdE1A that also failed to bind S2 (Fig. 5A). These results suggested that deletion of both the N-terminal and CR2 regions was required to disrupt completely the interaction between AdE1A and S2 in vivo. Because the in vitro study showed that the direct site for interaction resides in CR2 (Fig. 4C), we considered that the involvement of the N-terminal region in in vivo binding to S2 could be a consequence of indirect binding, in which AdE1A binds to S4 and S8, which in turn interact with S2 (23Gorbea C. Taillandier D. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 875-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This was supported by the observation that immunoprecipitation of S8 can result in the coprecipitation of S2 in vivo (Fig. 5B). We have concluded that the site of interaction on AdE1A for S2 in CR2 is between residues 111 and 127. Given the requirement for both CR1 and CR2 in binding to the pRb family, we inves"

We examined whether hsp10 can reduce myocyte death by its mitochondrial function or by interacting with cytoplasmic signaling pathways. Overexpression of hsp10 by adenoviral infection decreased myocyte death induced by hydrogen peroxide, sodium cyanide, and simulated ischemia and reoxygenation (SI/RO). We generated an adenoviral vector coding for a temperature-sensitive mutant hsp10 protein (P34H), incapable of cooperatively refolding denatured malate dehydrogenase with hsp60. Overexpression of the hsp10 mutant potentiated SI/RO-induced myocyte death. Analysis of electron transport chain function revealed increased Complex I capacity with hsp10 overexpression, whereas hsp10(P34H) overexpression decreased Complex II capacity. Hsp10 overexpression preserved both Complex I and II function after SI/RO. Examination of the Ras GTP-ase signaling pathway indicated that inhibition of Ras was required for protection by hsp10. Constitutive activation of Ras abolished the effects afforded by hsp10 and hsp10(P34H). Hsp10 overexpression inactivated Raf, ERK, and p90Ribosomal kinase (p90RSK) before and after SI/RO. Our results suggest that complex mechanisms are involved in the protection by hsp10 against SI/RO-induced myocyte death. This mechanism may involve the hsp10 mobile loop and attenuation of the Ras GTP-ase signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2023410139,"Overlapping mechanisms that function simultaneously in the intracellular sorting of mammalian membrane proteins often confound delineation of individual sorting pathways. By analyzing sorting in the evolutionarily simpler organism Toxoplasma gondii, we demonstrate a role for transmembrane domain (TMD) length in modulating the signal-dependent segregation of membrane proteins to distinct intracellular organelles. The dense granule localization of the single pass transmembrane protein GRA4 could be completely rerouted to the Golgi and cell surface simply by replacement of its TMD with that from either vesicular stomatitis virus G or the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. Mutational and biochemical analyses suggested that this effect was not caused by any specific sequence motif or strength of membrane association of the GRA4 TMD. Instead, a property imparted by the vesicular stomatitis virus G or LDL receptor TMDs, both of which are longer than the GRA4 TMD, appeared to be a decisive factor. Indeed, shortening the LDL receptor TMD to a length similar to that of GRA4 resulted in dense granule localization, whereas lengthening the GRA4 TMD resulted in rerouting to the Golgi. From these data, we conclude that although the TMD may not necessarily be a sole determinant in membrane protein sorting, its properties can markedly modulate the utilization of more conventional signal-mediated sorting pathways.

A hallmark of eukaryotic cells is their extensive intracellular membrane systems that permit the organized compartmentalization of myriad proteins and their associated biochemical activities. The most well understood paradigm of protein sorting involves the encoding within proteins of specific sequence motifs, termed sorting signals, that are recognized by cellular machinery to mediate their selective segregation and compartmentalization (see Refs. 1Antonny B. Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar and 2Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Many proteins, particularly of complex systems such as mammalian cells, contain multiple overlapping and/or degenerate sorting signals. Understanding how these signals are organized into a hierarchy, are interpreted, and are regulated to mediate high fidelity sorting into various intracellular compartments represents a major challenge of cell biology. The role of the transmembrane domain (TMD) 1The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BAP, bacterial alkaline phosphatase; LDL, low density lipoprotein; VSVG, vesicular stomatitis virus G; IF, immunofluorescence; LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.1The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BAP, bacterial alkaline phosphatase; LDL, low density lipoprotein; VSVG, vesicular stomatitis virus G; IF, immunofluorescence; LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. in sorting membrane proteins remains poorly defined.

Statistical analyses correlating features of the TMD to cellular localization have suggested that retention of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi may be mediated in many cases by TMD length (10Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Longhi R. Bulbarelli A. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 899-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In one prevailing model, an increasing gradient of membrane thickness through the secretory pathway from the ER to the plasma membrane would allow proteins with shorter TMDs to be retained in earlier organelles (14Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). However, because many of the proteins under study are also in larger complexes with other luminal and/or membrane proteins, each of which may contain sorting information, it has been difficult in most cases to clearly demonstrate a physiological role for the TMD in either sorting or retention. Therefore we explored this problem using a simpler model system, the Apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. This organism likely possesses fewer redundancies in sorting mechanisms than other eukaryotes (15Hoppe H.C. Joiner K.A. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The T. gondii secretory pathway is minimalized, containing a polarized transitional ER, a single Golgi stack, and limited N-linked glycosylation (16Hager K.M. Striepen B. Tilney L.G. Roos D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2631-2638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like all members of the Apicomplexan family, including the Plasmodium species, the parasite also contains three other distinct specialized secretory organelles termed rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules (17Dubey J.P. Lindsay D.S. Speer C.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 267-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these organelles contains distinct sets of proteins, the segregation and sorting of which are incompletely understood. All 10 dense granule proteins (18Cesbron-Delauw M.F. Guy B. Torpier G.

Curiously, GRA proteins with putative transmembrane domains behave aberrantly in subcellular fractionation assays (29Ossorio P.N. Dubremetz J.F. Joiner K.A. J. Biol.

Regardless of whether GRA3–GRA8 are sorted as soluble or as membrane proteins, no common feature or sequences have been identified that may serve to target GRA proteins to dense granules. Work from our laboratory (32Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and others (33Striepen B. He C. Matrajt M. Soldati D. Roos D. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 2001; 113: 45-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that soluble proteins, including the heterologous reporters Escherichia coli β-lactamase and bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP), are targeted to dense granules via the bulk flow pathway and are subsequently secreted into the vacuolar space surrounding the intracellular parasites. Chimeras containing BAP fused to the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of either the endogenous dense granule protein GRA4 (to give BAP·GRA4) or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (to give BAP·VSVG) were targeted to dense granules and Golgi, respectively. Although trafficking beyond the dense granule or Golgi to the cell surface or parasitophorous vacuole was found to be influenced by residues in the cytoplasmic tail (32Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the basis for the initial segregation of proteins between the Golgi and dense granules has remained unclear. We have now explored this issue in further detail using GRA4 as a model substrate. Our results have revealed a previously unappreciated modulatory role for the TMD in mediating segregation between the Golgi and dense granule sorting pathways. All BAP fusion constructs were cloned into the vector pNTP/Sec, which contains an expression cassette for secreted proteins (5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of the NTPase gene, and the NTPase signal peptide) as described earlier (32Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The following fragments were generated by the polymerase chain reaction using appropriate templates: residues 23–449 of E. coli BAP, a domain of GRA4 containing 8 luminal amino acids and the complete transmembrane (19 amino acids) and C-terminal domain (52 amino acids), and the TMD (23 amino aids) of the LDL receptor. The appropriate combination of these fragments was coligated into the AvrII/BglII cloning site of pNTP/Sec. The leucine substitutions for the BAP·GRA4 transmembrane domain mutants in Fig. 2 were prepared using mutagenic primers and PCR. 5′-poly(L)ext was prepared by introducing complementary, phosphorylated oligonucleotides encoding the residues ALLLLLL after residue 290 (into a NotI site of the GRA4 transmembrane domain) of the 5′-poly(L) construct. Each of the coding regions was subcloned into plasmid SP64 (Promega, Madison, WI) for in vitro translation studies. A construct encoding wild type VSVG in the SP64 vector has been described (35Lopez C.D. Yost C.D. Prusiner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1990; 48: 226-229Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Sequences of all PCR-amplified fragments were verified by dideoxy sequencing at the WM Keck Sequencing Center, Yale University School of Medicine. The RH strain of T. gondii was maintained in Vero cells, and transient transfections by electroporation were as described previously (36Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence (IF), monolayers of human foreskin fibroblasts grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates were infected with transfected parasites and were processed for IF 20–24 h post-transfection as described (32Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). BAP chimeras were detected with purified rabbit anti-BAP polyclonal antibody (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) as described previously (32Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For dense granule colocalization samples were incubated with anti-BAP antibodies and the monoclonal antibody to GRA3 followed by a mixture of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antiserum and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse anti-serum, respectively (Calbiochem-Novachem Corp.). Coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted in Moviol for examination by epifluorescence microscopy. Images were captured with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) and were processed with Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The preparation and use of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and canine pancreatic rough microsomes for in vitro translocation assays were as described (37Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Translation reactions were at 32 °C for 60 min. Proteolysis reactions used 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K for 60 min on ice. Immunoprecipitations were as described (32Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and utilized a rabbit polyclonal antibody to BAP or mouse polyclonal antibodies raised against residues that were either N-terminal or C-terminal to the GRA4 TMD. For alkaline extractions, microsomes from translation reactions were isolated by sedimentation (50,000 rpm for 10 min in a TL100.1 rotor, Beckman Instruments) and were resuspended in 20 times the original translation volume in 0.1 m NaCO3, pH 11.5. After 20 min on ice, the membrane fraction was isolated by centrifugation (100,000 rpm for 20 min in a TL100.1 rotor, Beckman Instruments). Proteins in the supernatant were collected by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. SDS-PAGE was on 12% Tris-Tricine gels. In vitro translated material was solubilized under native conditions in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100. This mixture was layered onto a 5–25% glycerol gradient, spun for 14 h at 55,000 rpm in a TLS-55 rotor, fractionated into 11 fractions, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Marker proteins migrated as follows: cytochrome C (14 kDa) in fractions 2 and 3, bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) in fractions 6 and 7, native globin (tetramer of 14 kDa) in fractions 6 and 7, GRP94 (dimer of 94 kDa) in fraction 9, and catalase (11 S) in fraction 11. Under these conditions, GRA4 migrated in fraction 5, and BAP·GRA4, BAP·VSVG·GRA4, and BAP·VSVG migrated in fraction 6 and 7. Hydropathy was assessed by the method of Kyte and Doolittle (38Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17098) Google Scholar) using MacVector software. Window size was 7 residues. Hydrophilicity was plotted (with hydrophobic residues attaining negative values). The TMD was defined in the present study as the contiguous stretch of residues with a hydrophilic value of less than –0.6. Note that the definition of what segment of a hydrophobic domain is considered the TMD has varied in previous studies. Therefore, the exact number of residues noted in Table I may be slightly different from that cited in previous studies. However, the use of other cutoff values (ranging from 0 to –1.0) for assessing TMD length resulted in similar differences in length between the various constructs and did not affect the close correlation between TMD length and localization.Table ILocalization and biochemical behavior of GRA4 constructsConstructTMD lengthaTMD length was defined as the number of contiguous amino acids scoring less than -0.6 on the Kyte-Doolittle scale (38).LocalizationTopologyIntegratedbPercent integration (rounded to the nearest 10%) was assessed by extraction at pH 11.5 as in Figs. 1E and 2B.%GRA417DGcDG, dense granule.Type I TM<10BAPGRA417DGType I TM<102L29717DGNDdND, not determined.ND2L30317DGType I TM403L30717DGType I TM>90BAPLDLRΔGRA417DGType I TM805′-poly (L)19DGType I TM>904L31020DGType I TM803-poly(L)20DGType I TM>90BAPLDLRGRA423GolgiType I TM>90BAPVSVG24GolgiType I TM>905′-poly(L)ext26GolgiNDNDa TMD length was defined as the number of contiguous amino acids scoring less than -0.6 on the Kyte-Doolittle scale (38Kyte J.

Open table in a new tab We tested whether determinants in the TMD of GRA4 were involved in the localization to dense granules. We analyzed three chimeric constructs containing BAP fused to the TMD and cytoplasmic tail derived from either GRA4, VSVG, or low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (Fig. 1A). Each chimera was transfected into parasites, which were then used to infect cultured fibroblasts. The subcellular distribution of the chimeras within the intracellular parasites, termed tachyzoites, was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy (39Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. Methods. 1997; 13: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). BAP·GRA4 was localized to dense granules as evidenced by colocalization with the endogenous dense granule protein GRA3 (32Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). By contrast, expression of either BAP·VSVG or BAP·LDLR·GRA4 in T. gondii resulted primarily in an anterior perinuclear staining pattern typical for Golgi localization and distinct from the dense granule pattern revealed by GRA3 staining. That the perinuclear structures are Golgi is supported by the observation that they are disrupted by treatment with the fungal metabolite Brefeldin A (data not shown) as well as by immunoelectron microscopy (32Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Overexpression of these two constructs resulted in their delivery to the parasite cell surface, whereas BAP·GRA4 was ultimately delivered to the parasitophorous vacuole and the membrane network located therein (data not shown). Thus, BAP·GRA4 and BAP·LDLR· GRA4, which differ only in their TMD, are distinctly segregated within T. gondii. Constructs were compared biochemically by analyzing translocation and topology at the ER using an in vitro translation and translocation system. Both endogenous GRA4 and BAP·GRA4 were efficiently translocated across the ER membrane (Fig. 1C) as evidenced by the signal cleavage of GRA4 (note slightly faster mobility of the translation product in the presence, but not absence, of microsomal membranes) and the efficient glycosylation of BAP·GRA4 (resulting in decreased mobility). A small percentage of GRA4 was also glycosylated, which was consistent with the presence of a poorly utilized single potential site for N-linked glycosylation. The glycosylation of these proteins was confirmed by an increase in mobility upon treatment with endoglycosidase H or the absence of more slowly migrating forms if translations were performed in the presence of a competitive inhibitor of glycosylation (data not shown). Upon treatment with exogenous protease the translation products were reduced in size by ∼4 kDa, which is consistent with the removal of a cytoplasmically oriented tail. This was confirmed by demonstrating that the proteolytically protected domain was immunoprecipitated with N- but not C-terminally directed antibodies (Fig. 1C, lanes 4–7). Inclusion of 0.5% of the non-denaturing detergent Triton X-100 in the protease digestion reactions resulted as expected in complete digestion of both GRA4 and BAP·GRA4 (data not shown). A similar analysis of BAP·VSVG and BAP·LDLR·GRA4 revealed that they were in the identical topology (Fig. 1D). Importantly, all detergent-extracted chimeras migrated as monomers by sucrose density gradient analysis (data not shown; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). From these data, we conclude that GRA4, BAP·GRA4, BAP·VSVG, and BAP·LDLR·GRA4 all achieve a type I transmembrane topology at the ER with the N-terminal domain in the lumen and a cytosolically disposed C-terminal tail. Analysis of membrane integration by alkaline extraction revealed surprising differences between the constructs (Fig. 1E). Both GRA4 and BAP·GRA4 were unexpectedly and nearly quantitatively extracted upon treatment with 0.1 m NaCO3, pH 11.5. By contrast, neither wild type VSVG (a known integral membrane protein control) nor the chimeras BAP·VSVG or BAP·LDLR·GRA4 were extracted with carbonate (Fig. 1E). Thus, carbonate extraction, in contrast to topology, is a feature that distinguishes between these constructs in a manner that correlates with their subcellular localization. Furthermore, the extractability of GRA4 may provide an explanation for the previous enigmatic observations that GRA proteins containing transmembrane domains, when liberated from parasites or infected cells by mechanical disruption, fractionate by differential centrifugation as partially soluble and partially membrane-associated molecules (29Ossorio P.N. Dubremetz J.F. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15350-15357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Labruyere E. Lingnau M. Mercier C. Sibley L.D. Mol. Biochem.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the case of GRA5 these earlier results had been interpreted to suggest that the molecule inserts post-translationally into membranes of the parasitophorous vacuole following secretion as a soluble protein (31Lecordier L. Mercier C. Sibley L.D. Cesbron-Delauw M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In view of the current results, it is possible instead or in addition that transmembrane-anchored GRA proteins (GRA3–GRA8) are synthesized as membrane proteins that behave anomalously in traditional subcellular fractionation assays. Most importantly for the current study, however, is the fact that the TMD of GRA4, in addition to its unusual behavior upon carbonate extraction, appears to be directly involved in its sorting to dense granules. Two principal ways in which the TMD may control localization of a membrane protein may be envisioned. Specific sequence elements within the TMD could be recognized by machinery that mediates sorting. Alternatively, biophysical features that distinguish the GRA4 TMD from those of VSVG and LDLR could be exploited to mediate sorting. To distinguish between these alternatives, especially as they relate to differences in alkaline extraction (Fig. 1E), we generated a series of mutations within the GRA4 TMD of the BAP·GRA4 reporter (Fig. 2A). These mutations were designed to disrupt putative sorting sequence motifs as well as alter the biophysical characteristics of the TMD. In vitro analysis revealed that each of the mutations was made as a type I transmembrane protein (Fig. 2B, top panel). By contrast, replacement of various residues within the TMD with leucines resulted in an alteration of the alkaline extractability of the protein (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). The 2L283 mutant was ∼50% extracted, whereas the other mutants were largely resistant to extraction. In particular, the 5′-poly(L) and 3′-poly(L) constructs in which entire halves of the TMD were replaced with leucines were as resistant to extraction as the VSVG or LDLR TMDs (compare Fig. 2B with Fig. 1E). All of the constructs localized to dense granules (Fig. 2C). These data argue strongly against a sequence motif within the TMD mediating targeting to dense granules, as none of the changes that together encompassed every residue within the TMD altered localization. More surprising however was the finding that altering the extractability of BAP·GRA4, which was a principal feature distinguishing it from BAP·VSVG and BAP·LDLR·GRA4, also did not affect localization. For example, despite the fact that the 3′-poly(L) and BAP·LDLR·GRA4 constructs are identical in their luminal domains, cytosolic tails, topology, and resistance to alkaline extraction, they are nonetheless efficiently segregated to different compartments within the parasite. Sequence comparisons between the LDLR and VSVG TMDs did not reveal known sorting motifs or sequence similarities. Thus, it seemed unlikely that positive sorting signals in these TMDs segregated them from the construct containing the GRA4 TMD. Therefore we searched for other systematic differences between the various constructs that might correlate with their differential sorting. Notably, all of the TMDs from constructs shown in Figs. 1 and 2 that localize to dense granules were 20 or fewer residues in length, whereas the LDLR and VSVG TMDs were 23 and 24 residues in length, respectively (Table I). This distinction is readily illustrated by Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plots of the TMD regions of BAP·GRA4, 3′-poly(L), BAP·LDLR·GRA4, and BAP·VSVG (Fig. 3A), where residues comprising the hydrophobic core of the TMD are indicated with black bars. These observations raised the possibility that TMD length may be another feature that influences sorting between the Golgi versus dense granules. We tested this hypothesis in two ways. We reasoned that we should be able to redirect a Golgi-localized protein (such as BAP·LDLR·GRA4) to dense granules simply by shortening the TMD. Conversely, lengthening the TMD of a dense granule-localized protein (such as the 5′-poly(L) construct) should result in localization to the Golgi. The LDLR TMD of BAP·LDLR·GRA4 construct was shortened by 6 residues to generate BAP·LDLR·Δ6GRA4. Hydropathy analysis showed this shortened TMD to now be of similar length, hydrophobicity, and character to the native GRA4 TMD (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the deletion construct was still made as a type I transmembrane protein that was largely resistant to alkaline extraction (Table I). Notably, however, this construct localized to dense granules in contrast to the clear Golgi localization for BAP·LDLR·GRA4 (Fig. 4, a–f). To perform the complementary experiment, the 5′-poly(L) TMD was lengthened by the insertion after residue 290 of 7 hydrophobic amino acids (ALLLLLL, to generate 5′-poly(L)ext; hydropathy plot shown in Fig. 3B). This extension of the TMD resulted in an apical, perinuclear localization upon expression in parasites (Fig. 4, g–i). This localization pattern is consistent with the Golgi and is clearly distinguished from dense granules. The data presented in this study allow us to conclude that transmembrane domain length can modulate sorting between the dense granule and Golgi pathways. The strongest argument for this conclusion is the observation that matched constructs invariant in their luminal and tail domains were nonetheless differentially localized on the basis of their TMDs. Overall hydrophobicity of the various TMDs tested did not appear to be a major determinant for sorting, because neither hydropathy analyses (Fig. 3), topology (Figs. 1D and 2B), nor alkaline extractability (Figs. 1E and 2B) correlated to localization behavior (Table I). Furthermore, no sequence homology or structural features within the TMD correlated to localization, arguing against specific recognition of sequences within the TMD or TMD-mediated protein-protein interactions involved in sorting. By contrast, the only feature that could be altered to influence localization involved the length of the TMD. Although the precise aspects of TMD length that most affect localization remain to be elucidated, the collective data argue that sorting mediated by either luminal or cytoplasmic tail motifs of a membrane protein can be modulated by the TMD. This modulating effect could be mediated by changes in the thickness of the membrane bilayer in different compartments of the secretory pathway. In this model, a gradient of cholesterol (and perhaps other lipids) in the membranes from the ER to the cell surface results in a progressive increase in membrane thickness. Thus, shorter TMDs may not be as stable in a thick bilayer, resulting in their preferential retention in earlier compartments of the secretory pathway. As described above, resident Golgi enzymes in mammalian cells appear to have statistically shorter TMDs than plasma membrane proteins (12Munro S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), suggesting that perhaps they are prevented from progressing further in the secretory pathway. Unfortunately, this model has been confounded by observations that many of the Golgi enzymes interact with each other, suggesting the alternate possibility that “kin recognition” results in complexes too large to enter transport carrier exiting the Golgi. Similar confounding variables have prevented a clear understanding of how resident ER membrane proteins such as components of the oligosaccharyl transferase complex are retained. The present study argues that endogenous dense granule proteins of T. gondii are sorted partly on the basis of their TMD lengths (all of which are less than 20 amino acids by the criteria applied in this study). It is not yet clear where proteins destined for dense granules are segregated from other secreted molecules, such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins destined for the parasite surface. Sorting into dense core vesicles has classically been a feature of the trans-Golgi network or more distal compartments, in particular the immature secretory granule (Refs. 40Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar and 41Tooze S.A. Martens G.J. Huttner W.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 116-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, two observations suggest that these may not be the sites of dense granule protein sorting in T. gondii. First, the parasite does not contain compartments with morphological characteristics of immature secretory granules. Second, no processing of dense granule proteins occurs, which is unlike the situation in many secretory cells. In fact, TMD length-mediated sorting of dense granule proteins may occur at the ER because the ER membrane (by analogy to mammalian cells) is likely to be cholesterol-poor and relatively thin. Thus, proteins that are marginally stable in the ER membrane may not be able to progress to the Golgi where the membrane may be thicker. Indeed, the GRA4 TMD, although sufficiently stable to quantitatively attain a membrane spanning orientation at the ER, is nonetheless entirely extractable with a high pH (Fig. 1). Our results suggest indirectly that the GRA4 cytoplasmic tail is sufficient to mediate sorting to dense granules if juxtaposed to the GRA4 transmembrane domain. In contrast, the GRA4 cytoplasmic tail is not sufficient to mediate dense granule sorting for constructs with long heterologous transmembrane domains (for example BAP·LDLR·GRA4). The sorting motif within the GRA4 cytoplasmic tail may be the tyrosine-containing YXXØ (tyrosine-X-X-bulky hydrophobic) sequence. We have demonstrated previously that selected YXXØ motifs are recognized by the μ1 chain of the T. gondii AP-1 adaptor complex (42Hoppe H.C. Ngo H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 43Ngô H.M. Yang M. Pypaert M. Hoppe H.C. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5343-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and that mutation of these motifs alters targeting of the rhoptry proteins ROP2 and ROP4 (42Hoppe H.C. Ngo H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although secretion of GRA4 is impaired by mutation of the YXXØ motif (32Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the GRA4 cytoplasmic tail is not recognized by the T. gondii μ1 chain (43Ngô H.M. Yang M. Pypaert M. Hoppe H.C. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5343-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) suggesting that another adaptor may be involved. Clearly, mutation of the GRA4 cytoplasmic tail within the context of the various constructs used herein is a logical future direction of study. Such experiments are likely to shed light on the molecular mechanism in which TMD-mediated sorting of GRA4 (demonstrated in this study) is influenced by coexisting conventional sorting signals proposed in previous studies (32Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 43Ngô H.M. Yang M. Pypaert M. Hoppe H.C. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5343-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Finally, one interesting although speculative implication of these findings is the possibility that the sorting pathway utilized by particular proteins could be altered in response to changes in the environment or metabolic state of the cell. For example, TMD-mediated sorting, if it depends on lipid bilayer properties, could be either dominant or recessive to other sorting signals depending on cellular parameters such as cholesterol abundance. In this manner, the subcellular distribution and hence potential function of selected proteins could change in response to cellular need. In the context of the Apicomplexan parasites, such marked changes in metabolism may accompany different stages of a complicated life cycle that includes multiple diverse environments and hosts. Further studies will be required to determine whether such potential types of regulated sorting are exploited by organisms in a physiologically productive manner."

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, homologous recombination (HR) 1The abbreviations used are: HR, homologous recombination; ssDNA, single strand DNA; dsDNA, double strand DNA; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; HU, hydroxyurea; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SC, synthetic complete; YEPD, yeast extract peptone dextrose. represents an important means for the repair of DNA double strand breaks and other types of DNA damage and also for restarting stalled replication forks (1Cox M.M.

S. A. 2001; 98: 8181-8188Google Scholar). HR depends on the use of a homologous DNA molecule as a template to eliminate double strand breaks and other lesions mostly with high fidelity. Impaired HR results in genetic instability and sensitivity to genotoxic agents (6Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Google Scholar) and can lead to cancer in humans (7Pierce A.J. Stark J.M. Araujo F.D. Moynahan M.E. Berwick M. Jasin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11 (suppl.): S52-S59Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Double strand break repair by HR is dependent on genes of the RAD52 epistasis group, RAD50, RAD51, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, RDH54/TID1, MRE11, and XRS2, in which structure and function have been highly conserved (6Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Google Scholar). Before repair can occur, the ends of double strand breaks are processed by nucleolytic resection of the 5′ ends of the breaks to yield ssDNA, which is then bound by Rad51 to form a helical nucleoprotein filament often referred to as the presynaptic filament. Nucleation of Rad51 onto the ssDNA is facilitated by recombination mediators, including Rad52, the Rad55-Rad57 complex, and Rad54 (6Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Google Scholar, 8Krejci L. Chen L. Van Komen S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 74: 159-201Google Scholar). Once assembled, the presynaptic filament mediates a search for homology in the homologous dsDNA partner and forms a DNA joint molecule (called D-loop) with the latter. The length of the nascent DNA joint molecule is extended by DNA branch migration (9Sung P. Krejci L. Van Komen S. Sehorn M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42729-42732Google Scholar), and the D-loop is resolved by one of several pathways that yields recombinants with or without associated crossovers (6Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Google Scholar). The RAD54 gene encodes a dsDNA-dependent ATPase of the Swi2/Snf2 family (10Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Google Scholar). Rad54 protein physically interacts with Rad51 protein (11Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Google Scholar, 12Jiang H.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2535-2544Google Scholar) and binds ssDNA preferentially. Rad54 utilizes the free energy from ATP hydrolysis to translocate on dsDNA and induces dynamic topological changes in the DNA (8Krejci L. Chen L. Van Komen S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 74: 159-201Google Scholar, 14Ristic D. Wyman C. Paulusma C. Kanaar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8454-8460Google Scholar, 15Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Google Scholar). The ATPase and DNA supercoiling activities of Rad54 are stimulated by Rad51 (15Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Google Scholar, 16Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Google Scholar). Rad54 protein appears to play a role in different steps of the HR process. Rad54 promotes assembly of the presynaptic filament apparently by loading Rad51 onto ssDNA and enhancing filament stability (17Wolner B. Van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Google Scholar, 18Mazin A.V. Alexeev A.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14029-14036Google Scholar). Although Rad51 has only a weak ability to form the D-loop, the inclusion of Rad54 renders D-loop formation highly robust (11Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Google Scholar, 15Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Google Scholar, 19Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H.

The negative supercoils produced by Rad54 result in transient opening of the DNA strands (15Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Google Scholar), which may aid in strand invasion by the presynaptic filament in the D-loop reaction. Rad54 also stimulates DNA branch migration by severalfold (21Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8447-8453Google Scholar) and cooperates with the presynaptic filament in chromatin remodeling (22Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Google Scholar, 23Alexeev A. Mazin A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 182-186Google Scholar, 24Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Google Scholar). In addition, Rad54 can dissociate Rad51 from duplex DNA, an activity believed to be germane for Rad51 recycling and the promotion of DNA repair synthesis during recombination (25Solinger J.A. Kiianitsa K. Heyer W.D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1175-1188Google Scholar). The protein encoded by RDH54/TID1 is structurally related to Rad54 protein. Rdh54/Tid1 protein is important for meiotic recombination but has a relatively minor role in mitotic recombination (26Klein H.L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1533-1543Google Scholar, 27Shinohara M. Shita-Yamaguchi E. Buerstedde J.M. Shinagawa H. Ogawa H. Shinohara A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1545-1556Google Scholar). Rdh54/Tid1 also possesses a dsDNA-activated ATPase activity via its dsDNA, binds Rad51, translocates on and supercoils dsDNA, and greatly stimulates D-loop formation (8Krejci L. Chen L. Van Komen S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 74: 159-201Google Scholar, 28Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether or not Rdh54/ Tids affects presynaptic filament assembly, stimulates DNA branch migration, functions in chromatin remodeling, and removes Rad51 from duplex DNA. Two Rad54 homologous proteins have been found in different eukaryotic species (29Kanaar R. Troelstra C. Swagemakers S.M. Essers J. Smit B. Franssen J.H. Pastink A. Bezzubova O.Y. Buerstedde J.M. Clever B. Heyer W.D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 828-838Google Scholar). The human hRad54 protein has 68% similarity with ScRad54 protein. A second human homologue, RAD54B, was described subsequently (30Hiramoto T. Nakanishi T. Sumiyoshi T. Fukuda T. Matsuura S. Tauchi H. Komatsu K. Shibasaki Y. Inui H. Watatani M. Yasutomi M. Sumii K. Kajiyama G. Kamada N. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3422-3426Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal region of RAD54B shares homology with yeast RDH54. In vitro experiments show a dsDNA-dependent ATPase in hRad54 and that hRad54 translocates on dsDNA (14Ristic D. Wyman C. Paulusma C. Kanaar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42790-42794Google Scholar) and promotes transient separation of the strands in duplex DNA (31Sigurdsson S. Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42790-42794Google Scholar). Interaction with hRad51 stimulates the ATPase activity, DNA supercoiling, and the DNA strand opening activities of hRad54. hRad51 and hRad54 cooperate in the formation of D-loops (31Sigurdsson S. Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42790-42794Google Scholar). Except for the demonstration of a dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity (32Tanaka K. Kagawa W. Kinebuchi T. Kurumizaka H. Miyagawa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1346-1353Google Scholar), the Rad54B protein remains poorly characterized. In vertebrate cells, interference with HR has a strong impact on viability and genomic stability. For instance, cells with hypomorphic mutations in the RAD51 gene are genetically unstable and sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, and disruption of the RAD51 gene is lethal (33Lim D.S. Hasty P. Mol.

Cells with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are impaired for HR and show a high rate of chromosome aberration, sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, and elevated mutation rates (35Stark J.M. Jasin M. Mol.

Thacker J. Ashworth A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4704-4716Google Scholar, 41Tutt A.N. van Oostrom C.T. Ross G.M. van Steeg H. Ashworth A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 255-260Google Scholar, 42Xia F. Taghian D.G. DeFrank J.S. Zeng Z.C. Willers H. Iliakis G. Powell S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8644-8649Google Scholar). As expected, Rad54 and Rad54B both function in HR in mammalian cells. Inactivation of the mouse RAD54 gene causes a marked sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents in embryonic stem cells, but somatic cells deleted for Rad54 show only a slight increase in radiosensitivity (43Bezzubova O. Silbergleit A. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. Buerstedde J.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 185-193Google Scholar, 44Essers J. Hendriks R.W. Swagemakers S.M. Troelstra C. de Wit J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.

Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Google Scholar). Inactivation of the RAD54B gene in a colon cancer cell line resulted in a severe reduction of targeted integration frequency, whereas sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and sister chromatid exchange was not significantly affected (47Miyagawa K. Tsuruga T. Kinomura A. Usui K. Katsura M. Tashiro S. Mishima H. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 175-180Google Scholar). hRad54 protein colocalizes with hRad51 and BRCA1 in the nucleus (48Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Google Scholar, 49Tan T.L. Essers J. Citterio E. Swagemakers S.M. de Wit J. Benson F.E. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 325-328Google Scholar), and significant colocalization of Rad54B with hRad51 and BRCA1 has also been observed (50Tanaka K. Hiramoto T. Fukuda T. Miyagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26316-26321Google Scholar). Interestingly, several point mutations in conserved regions of the hRAD54 and RAD54B genes have been found in primary tumors (30Hiramoto T. Nakanishi T. Sumiyoshi T. Fukuda T. Matsuura S. Tauchi H. Komatsu K. Shibasaki Y. Inui H. Watatani M. Yasutomi M. Sumii K. Kajiyama G. Kamada N. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3422-3426Google Scholar, 51Matsuda M. Miyagawa K. Takahashi M. Fukuda T. Kataoka T. Asahara T. Inui H. Watatani M. Yasutomi M. Kamada N. Dohi K. Kamiya K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3427-3430Google Scholar), but the functional consequences of these mutations on gene function and their causal relationship to the tumor phenotype is not known. To ascertain the possible effects of the tumor-associated hRAD54 and RAD54B mutations on protein functions, we introduced these mutations into the homologous sites in the S. cerevisiae RAD54 gene. We found that two mutations, rad54 N616S and rad54 D442Y, engendered little or no phenotype but that another mutation, rad54 G484R, behaved similarly to the rad54Δ null allele. The severe phenotype seen with the rad54 G484R allele was because of an inability of the mutant protein to hydrolyze ATP. The implications of our results are discussed. Media, Growth Condition, and Genetic Analysis—Standard media were prepared as described (52Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). All strains were grown at 30 °C. Genetic analysis was performed according to standard procedure (52Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Construction of rad54 Mutants—Mutations were introduced into the S. cerevisiae RAD54 gene using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenic PCR primers were used in PCR reactions with the RAD54 gene cloned into the pUC18 vector as a template. Mutation confirmation was performed by restriction enzyme digestion, which specifically recognizes each change, and by DNA sequencing to ensure that no other mutations were introduced inadvertently. For genetic analyses, pRS306 (URA3, integrating) derivatives containing the rad54 D442Y, rad54 G484R, or rad54 N616S allele were linearized by HindIII, purified, and then used for transforming wild type yeast strain HKY579-1A. Chromosomal integrants were selected on SC-ura media. After 2 days of growth on YEPD, the integrants were transferred to 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing media. 5-Fluoroorotic acid-resistant colonies were analyzed for the presence of the RAD54 mutations by PCR analysis of the genomic RAD54 gene, using the restriction enzymes diagnostic for each mutation and DNA sequencing of the PCR products. For protein purification, the rad54 G484R and rad54 N616S alleles were cloned into pPM231.6His (2μ, LEU2-d, GAL-PGK-6His) to add a six-histidine sequence at the NH2-terminal end of the rad54-encoded products and place the histidine-tagged mutant genes under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL-PGK promoter for expression in yeast cells (11Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Google Scholar). Plasmids pR54.G484R.1 (2μ, LEU2-d, GAL-PGK-6His-rad54 G484R) and pR54.N616S.1 (2μ, LEU2-d, GAL-PGK-6His-rad54 N616S) were transformed into the protease-deficient strain BJ5464. Yeast Strains—Yeast strains for genetic studies were all derived from the W303 RAD5 strain and have the basic genotype ade2-1 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 trp1-1 ura3-1 can1-100. Strains with point mutations in the RAD54 gene were crossed with strains HKY660-2B MATa leu2-rI::URA3::leu2-bsteII, HKY661-4D MATa rdh54::HIS3 leu2-rI::URA3::leu2-bsteII, HKY590-6D MATa srs2::HIS3, HKY885 MATa pol30-50, and MSY127-5A MATa top3::HIS3. For the chromosome-loss assay, we constructed diploids from a set of strains with ade2-1 can1-100 hom3-10 (or ADE2 CAN1 HOM3) in addition to the RAD54 mutations. Sources of the markers were strains HKY1025-47D MATa CAN1 ADE2 HOM3 and HKY1026-8C MATa can-100 ade2-1 hom3-10. The protease-deficient strain BJ5464 used in protein purification has the genotype MATa, ura3-52, trp-1, leu2Δ1, his3Δ200, pep4::HIS3, prbΔ1.6R. DNA Substrates—ϕX 174 viral (+) strand DNA was purchased from New England Biolabs, and the ϕX-replicative form I DNA (∼90% supercoiled) was from Invitrogen. Relaxation of the ϕX-replicative form I DNA by calf thymus topoisomerase I was carried out as described previously (19Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Google Scholar). pBluescript form I dsDNA was prepared using standard methods (53Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For the DNA binding experiments, the 83-mer oligonucleotide (Oligo 3) (19Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Google Scholar) with the sequence 5′-TTG ATA AGA GGT CAT TTT TGC GGA TGG CTT AGA GCT TAA TTG CTG AAT CTG GTG CTG TAG CTC AAC ATG TTT TAA ATA TGC AA-3′ was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The unincorporated nucleotide was removed with a Spin 30 column (Bio-Rad), and the radiolabeled oligo was annealed to its exact complement. The resulting duplex was purified from a 10% polyacrylamide gel by overnight diffusion at 4 °C into TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA) (19Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Google Scholar). The 90-mer oligonucleotide D1 used in the D-loop reaction is complementary to pBluescript SK DNA from positions 1932 to 2022 and has the sequence 5′-AAA TCA ATC TAA AGT ATA TAT GAG TAA ACT TGG TCT GAC AGT TAC CAA TGC TTA ATC AGT GAG GCA CCT ATC TCA GCG ATC TGT CTA TTT-3′. The oligonucleotide was 5′ end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and then purified using the MERmaid spin kit (Bio101). All the DNA substrates were stored in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EDTA). Determination of Intrachromosomal Recombination Rates—Recombination rates were determined as described previously (54Aguilera A. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1988; 119: 779-790Google Scholar). Spore segregants from crosses of the rad54 mutants with the recombination reporter strains were used. Nine colonies from each spore segregant were used for each fluctuation test, and three to six fluctuation tests were performed for each rad54 mutant. MMS and HU Sensitivity—To determine methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and hydroxyurea (HU) sensitivity of the rad54 mutants, cells were grown in liquid YEPD to saturation. The cells were then diluted, and 4-μl aliquots were spotted onto fresh YEPD plates containing 0.016% MMS or 200 mm HU. For UV sensitivity, cells from overnight cultures were diluted, and 4-μl aliquots were spotted onto fresh YEPD plates and exposed to UV irradiation. After exposure, the plates were kept in the dark to avoid photoreactivation. Determination of Chromosome Loss Rates in Diploids—Rates of chromosome loss were determined as described previously (55Klein H.L. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1501-1509Google Scholar). Fresh zygotes were isolated for each genotype. After growth for 3–4 days at 30 °C on YEPD medium, zygotic colonies were resuspended in water. Appropriate dilutions were applied onto SC plates for measurement of the total number of colony-forming units and onto SC plates plus canavanine to select for canavanine-resistant mitotic segregants. These were then replica-plated to SC plates lacking threonine. Colonies that grew only on SC plus canavanine plates, Canr Hom–, were counted to determine the chromosome loss rates. Fluctuation tests were conducted according to the median method (56Lea D.E. Coulson C.A. J. Genet. 1948; 49: 264-284Google Scholar). These tests were repeated three to five times for each genotype. Protein Expression and Purification—The rad54 N616S and rad54 G484R mutant proteins were purified to near homogeneity from cells of the BJ5464 strain harboring pR54.G484R.1 or pR54.N616S.1 using the procedure described for wild type Rad54 protein (11Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Google Scholar). The two mutant rad54 proteins behaved like the wild type protein in all of the fractionation steps. Rad51 was overexpressed and purified to near homogeneity from yeast as described by Sung (57Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Google Scholar). Escherichia coli topoisomerase I was purified to near homogeneity from E. coli JM103 (Stratagene) cells transformed with pJW312 as described by Lynn et al. (58Lynn R.M. Bjornsti M.A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3559-3563Google Scholar). The concentration of purified Rad54, rad54 G484R, rad54 N616S, and E. coli topoisomerase I was determined by densitometric scanning of 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with multiple loadings of these proteins against known quantities of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and ovalbumin. The concentration of purified Rad51 was determined using the extinction coefficient 1.29 × 104 (59Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Google Scholar). ATPase Assay—The indicated amounts of Rad54, rad54 G484R, and rad54 N616S proteins were incubated with ϕX174-replicative form I DNA (30 μm base pairs) in 10 μl of buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, and 100 μg/ml BSA) and 1.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) for the indicated times at 23 °C. The amount of ATP hydrolysis was determined by thin layer chromatography as described by Petukhova et al. (11Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Google Scholar). To examine the effect of Rad51 on ATP hydrolysis by Rad54 and the rad54 mutants, Rad51 (360 nm) was premixed with Rad54, rad54 G484R, and rad54 N616S (50 nm each) at 0 °C for 15 min prior to the addition of DNA and incubation at 23 °C. DNA Mobility Shift—The indicated amounts (40–200 nm) of Rad54, rad54 G484R, and rad54 N616S and the 32P-labeled 83-mer duplex substrate (1.5 μm nucleotides) were incubated for 8 min at 23 °C in 10 μl of buffer A with 2.5 mm ATP and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 10 mm creatine phosphate and 30 μg/ml creatine kinase. After adding 2 μl of loading buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% orange G, 50% glycerol), the reaction mixtures were analyzed in 9% native polyacrylamide gels run in TAE buffer at 4 °C. The gels were dried and subject to analysis in a Personal FX phosphorimaging device employing the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Rad51 and Rad54 Complex Formation—Rad51 and BSA were covalently conjugated to Affi-Gel 15 beads (Bio-Rad) to yield matrices containing 3 mg/ml Rad51 and 12 mg/ml BSA as described by Petukhova et al. (11Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Google Scholar). To examine binding of Rad54, rad54 G484R, and rad54 N616S to the affinity beads, these proteins (4 μg each) were gently mixed with 6 μl of Affi-Rad51 or Affi-BSA beads every 3 min for 45 min at 4 °Cin30 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 150 mm KCl. The beads were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed. After being washed twice with 100 μl of binding buffer with 300 mm KCl, the Affi-Rad51 and Affi-BSA beads were treated with 30 μl of 3% SDS at 37 °C for 10 min to elute the bound Rad54 or mutant rad54 protein. The supernatant containing unbound Rad54 or mutant rad54 protein (10 μl), the two washes (15 μl), and the SDS eluate (10 μl) were subject to SDS-PAGE in an 8% gel to determine their content of Rad54 or mutant rad54 protein. D-loop Reaction—The radiolabeled oligonucleotide D1 (3.6 μm nucleotides) was incubated with Rad51 (1.5 μm) in 10.5 μl of buffer A and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 20 mm creatine phosphate and 30 μg/ml creatine kinase for 5 min at 37 °C followed by the incorporation of the indicated amounts (80–400 nm) of Rad54, rad54 G484R, or rad54 N616S in 1 μl storage buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 300 mm KCl) and a 2-min incubation at 23 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding the pBluescript-replicative form I DNA (35 μm base pairs) in 1 μl TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 23 °C for 4 min and processed for electrophoresis in 0.9% agarose gels in TAE buffer at 23 °C as described previously (20Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43578-43587Google Scholar). The gels were dried, and the radiolabeled DNA species were visualized and quantified in the phosphorimaging device. The percent D-loop refers to the quantity of the replicative form I substrate that had been converted into D-loop. Topoisomerase I-linked DNA Supercoiling Assay—The indicated amounts of Rad54, rad54 G484R, and rad54 N616S were incubated with topologically relaxed ϕX 174 DNA (18.5 μm base pairs) for 3 min at 23 °C in 9.5 μl of buffer R (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and an ATP regenerating system consisting of 20 mm creatine phosphate and 30 μg/ml creatine kinase) with 50 mm KCl followed by the addition of 150 ng of E. coli topoisomerase I in 0.5 μl of storage buffer. The reactions were incubated at 23 °C for 10 min and processed for agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (19Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Google Scholar). To examine the effect of Rad51, it was mixed with Rad54, rad54 G484R, and rad54 N616S at 4 °C for 20 min prior to the addition of the"
https://openalex.org/W2045009938,"Human protein-tyrosine kinase-6 (PTK6, also known as breast tumor kinase (Brk)) is a member of the non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family and is expressed in two-thirds of all breast tumors. To understand the structural basis of PTK6 function, we have determined the solution structure and backbone dynamics of the PTK6-Src homology 2 (SH2) domain using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The solution structure clearly indicates that the SH2 domain of human PTK6 contains a consensus α/β-fold and a Tyr(P) peptide binding surface, which are common to other SH2 domains. However, two of the α-helices (αA and αB) are located on opposite faces of the central β-sheet. In addition, the topological arrangement of a central four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (strands βA, βB, βC, and βD) differs from that of other Src family members. Backbone dynamics and Tyr(P) peptide titration experiments revealed that the putative ligand binding sites of the PTK6-SH2 domain undergo distinctive internal motions when compared with other regions of the protein. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the Tyr(P) peptide had a dissociation constant of about 60 μm, which is substantially weaker binding than previously reported for Src family members. The solution structure together with data from the ligand binding mode of PTK6-SH2 provides insight into the molecular basis of the autoinhibitory role of PTK6.

Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; SH, Src homology; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlated spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; SA, simulated annealing; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. play an important role as regulators of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Hyperactivation of PTKs often occurs in tumorigenesis through mutation, rearrangement, or gene amplification. The human PTK6 (also known as breast tumor kinase (Brk)) is a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase that was identified from a partial cDNA clone during a survey of PTK mRNAs in human melanocytes (1Lee S.-T. Strunk K.M. Spritz R.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3403-3410PubMed Google Scholar). It has been found that PTK6 is overexpressed in breast carcinomas (2Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and colon tumors (3Llor X. Serfas M.S. Bie W. Vasioukhin V. Polonskaia M. Derry J. Abbott C.M. Tyner A.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1767-1777PubMed Google Scholar). Since the expression of PTK6 in human mammary epithelial cells resulted in an activation of the mitogenic response of the cells to epidermal growth factor (4Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Dean C.J. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30956-30963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), its expression serves as a probe of the tumor development process. PTK6 is considered to be most closely related to the Frk family proteins; however, it differs from Src family kinases both in lacking an N-terminal myristoylation site (5Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Martindale J.E. Kamalati T. Lowe P.N. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2383-2390PubMed Google Scholar) and in having low sequence identity with members of this family. In addition, PTK6 showed an evolutionary divergence in the genomic structure (6Lee H. Kim M. Lee K.-H. Kang K.-N. Lee S.-T. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar). Although mouse Sik (a mouse homologue of PTK6) did not phosphorylate GTPase-activating protein-associated p65 protein, a phosphotyrosine residue of GTPase-activating protein-associated p65 interacts with and activates Sik through its Src homology 2 (SH2) domain in mouse keratinocytes (7Vasioukhin V. Tyner A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14477-14482Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Derry et al. (8Derry J.J. Richard S. Valderrama C.H. Ye X. Vasioukhin V. Cochrane A.W. Chen T. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6114-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) reported that PTK6 phosphorylated Sam68, a nuclear RNA-binding protein. Recently a protein, BKS, encoded by cDNA that was isolated using a yeast two-hybrid method was found to contain an N-terminal pleckstrin homology-like domain connected to an SH2 domain, suggesting that BKS protein would be a strong candidate for phosphorylation mediated by the kinase domain of PTK6 (9Mitchell P.J. Sara E.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4273-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary structure of PTK6 showed that it is composed of SH3, SH2, and catalytic domains (5Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Martindale J.E. Kamalati T. Lowe P.N. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2383-2390PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lee H. Kim M. Lee K.-H. Kang K.-N. Lee S.-T. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar). For the case of the non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, the SH2 domain is typically involved in negative regulation of kinase activity by binding to a phosphorylated tyrosine residue near to the C terminus. A recent report suggested that the inactive form of Src was further stabilized by interactions between the SH3 domain and a polyproline linker near the kinase domain (10Gonfloni S. Williams J. Hattula K. Weijland A. Wierenga R. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7261-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain has been determined as an independent folded module involved in a number of intracellular signaling pathways (Fig. 1) that binds to specific amino acid sequences in growth factor receptors and other molecules with phosphotyrosine residues. A number of reports have revealed that, in most cases, the SH2 domain adopts a common α/β-folding motif with two binding pockets for the phosphotyrosine peptide (11Pascal S.M. Singer A.U. Gish G.

Schaffhausen B. Liu Y. Gunther U.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 26: 15860-15869Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The structure of ligand peptide has also been determined as an extended or turnlike conformation, which enables the anchoring of its phosphotyrosyl group to the ligand binding pocket of the SH2 domain. It was recently proposed that the C-terminal sequence of PTK6 (PTSpYENPT where pY is phosphotyrosine) might be a self-ligand for the SH2 domain. The solution structure of PTK6-SH2 revealed a distinct binding surface, providing evidence for an interdomain interaction of PTK6. Therefore, the structural data together with the binding mechanism of the ligand peptide derived from the C-terminal sequence of PTK6 would add to our understanding of the biochemical data and the biological activity of PTK6. In this report, we present the high resolution solution structure of the human PTK6-SH2 domain together with its ligand binding mode determined using heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance analysis. Protein Expression and NMR Sample Preparation—The cDNA segment encoding the PTK6-SH2 (residues 75-174) was amplified using a primer pair (5′-cGGgaTCcGAACCGTGGTTCTTTGGC-3′ and 5′-ggaattcaCTCGTGCTTCCGGCAGG-3′ where lowercase letters indicate nucleotides that were introduced to generate restriction enzyme sites and a termination codon) by PCR from the full-length PTK6 cDNA (6Lee H. Kim M. Lee K.-H. Kang K.-N. Lee S.-T. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX 4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences), an Escherichia coli expression vector. The recombinant protein contained a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag encoded from the vector sequence in its N terminus. This vector was used to transform the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS for expression of the fusion protein. Uniformly 13C/15N- and 15N-labeled protein samples were prepared by growing cells in M9 minimal media containing 15NH4Cl, either with or without 13C6-d-glucose. The purified GST-PTK6-SH2 was digested using bovine thrombin (Amersham Biosciences), and the final purification of PTK6-SH2 was performed using fast protein liquid chromatography with a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column in 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5. The NMR samples were concentrated and transferred to a 5-mm symmetrical microcell (Shigemi). The protein-peptide complex solution was prepared by titrating Tyr(P) peptide into PTK6-SH2 with a final molar ratio of 1:2 (protein:peptide). Preparation of the Tyr(P) Peptide Sample—The peptide (Ac-SSFTS-pYENPT-COOH) derived from the C-terminal region of PTK6 (residues 442-451) was synthesized commercially (Anygen Co., Kwangju, Korea) by solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (17Swartz K.J. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1995; 15: 941-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). After trifluoroacetic acid cleavage, the peptide was eluted by analytical HPLC with the pH value of 3-4. The purity of synthetic peptide was confirmed by preparative HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed at 298 K on a Bruker DRX500 or DRX600 or Varian Unity INOVA 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe and shielded triple axis gradients. The 1H chemical shifts were referenced to internal sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate. The 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly using the 1H/13C or 1H/15N frequency ratios of the zero point: 0.101329118 (15N) and 0.251449536 (13C) (18Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J.

Pulsed-field gradient techniques with a WATERGATE pulse sequence (21Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V.

Reson. 1993; B102: 103-106Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), were collected for backbone resonance assignment. All NMR data were processed on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 work station using NMRPipe/NMRDraw software (Biosym/Molecular Simulations, Inc.). SPARKY 3.95 (37Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2002Google Scholar) and XEASY programs (38Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) were used for spectral analysis. Structure Calculations—The solution structures were calculated by the distance geometry and dynamic simulated annealing (SA) procedures with the CNS 1.0 program on an Silicon Graphics Indigo2 work station. Structural calculations were carried out following methods published previously (39Lee W. Moore C.H. Watt D.D. Krishna N.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 218: 89-95Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Driscoll P.C. Gronenborn A.M. Beress L. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2188-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 41Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brunger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The target functions for the molecular dynamics and energy minimization consisted of the covalent structure, van der Waals repulsion, NOE, and torsion angle terms. All restraints for the structure calculations were derived from the distance, torsion angle, and hydrogen bond information. Based on cross-peak intensities of NOESY spectra, distance constraints were classified as strong, medium, and weak corresponding to the upper distance bound of 2.7, 3.3, and 5.0 Å, respectively. Appropriate pseudoatom corrections were also applied to non-stereospecifically assigned methylene, methyl groups, and ring protons (42Wuthrich K. Billeten M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond constraints were used by defining two upper limit distances for each hydrogen bond: rN(i)-O(j) < 3.3 Å and rNH(i)-O(j) < 2.3 Å). Angle constraints for the ϕ torsion angles were set to -120 ± 50° for 3JHNa > 8 Hz and -60 ± 35° for 3JHNa < 6 Hz, respectively. The 20 lowest energy structures (SAk) from 50 simulated annealing conformers were selected for further structural analysis. None of the 20 SAk structures had any constraint violation greater than 0.5Å for distance and 3° for angle constraints. Structural analysis of the final 20 SAk structures was done using the MOLMOL (36Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) program. Backbone Dynamics—NMR pulse sequences for backbone dynamic experiments were used as reported previously (43Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). To eliminate the effects of cross-correlation between 15N-1H dipolar and 15N chemical shift anisotropy relaxation mechanisms, 1H 180° pulses were inserted during the relaxation times (44Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Chazin W.J. Wright P.E. Rance M. Mol. Phys. 1992; 75: 699-711Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 45Boyd J. Hommel U. Campbell I.D. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1990; 175: 477-482Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 46Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar). Longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation data for the backbone amide 15N nuclei were recorded as 2048 × 64 data sets with 64 scans per point using 1 s of relaxation recovery time. Seven different relaxation times for T1 and T2 experiments were recorded with T1 = 5, 65, 145, 246, 366, 527, and 757 ms and T2 = 8.3, 25.1, 41.8, 58.6, 75.3, 108.8, and 142.3 ms, respectively. For the estimation of noise levels, duplicate spectra were recorded for values of T1 = 246 ms and T2 = 56.8 ms. The steady-state heteronuclear NOE (43Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar, 47Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) experiment was obtained using a relaxation delay of 5 s. All data were processed on Silicon Graphics Indigo2 work stations using the NMRPipe software. The standard errors of T1 and T2 values were calculated from the non-linear least square fit. The overall tumbling motion of the SH2 domain was calculated from the T1/T2 ratios of N-H groups using the program Quadric Diffusion 1.11 (A. G. Palmer, Columbia University). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed by the BIACORE biosensor and BIAe-valuation version 3.1 interactive software (Biocore) (48Ladbury J.E. Lemmon M.A. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M.C. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 49Ladbury J.E. Hensmann M. Panayotou G. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11062-11069Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GSTPTK6-SH2 was immobilized at a flow rate of 10 μl/min using phosphate-buffered saline buffer solution (pH 6.5 with 2 mm dithiothreitol). Equal volumes of 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.4 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide were mixed and injected into a CM5 sensor chip to activate the carboxymethylated dextran surface. The volume was adjusted to achieve immobilization levels of GST-PTK6-SH2, making 6000 resonance units. After injection of GST-PTK6-SH2, the residual N-hydroxysuccinimide esters were deactivated by 25 μl of ethanolamine (1 m, pH 8.5). The Tyr(P) peptide at a concentration of 5.2-166.8 μm was injected into the immobilized sensor chip of GSTPTK6-SH2 at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Modeling of the PTK6-SH2·Tyr(P) Peptide Complex—The energy-minimized average structure of PTK6-SH2 was used as a template to generate a model of the protein·peptide complex. The template structures of the peptides were derived from the p56lck-peptide (Protein Data Bank accession code 1LCJ) and Grb2-peptide (Protein Data Bank accession code 1QG1) structure. The initial structure of the PTK6-SH2·Tyr(P) complex was further optimized using consistent valence force field on the DISCOVER3 module. To obtain the lowest energy conformation, restrained molecular dynamics was performed for 250 ps at 298 K. The lowest energy conformers were sampled every 100 steps during the molecular dynamic calculation. The restrained energy minimization procedure using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfard method was performed for the final structure until its energy gradient deviation decreased to 0.001 kcal·mol-1. Resonance Assignments and Secondary Structures—The backbone resonance assignments were completed by data from HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, and HCACO spectra. For the assignment of the residues preceding proline, HCACO data proved useful (50Hong E. Shin J. Bang E. Kim M. Lee S.-T. Lee W. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 291-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Most of the side chain assignments were accomplished by three-dimensional HCCH-TOCSY and 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC experiments. The secondary structures were determined from the chemical shift indices (51Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar), NOEs, 3JHNα coupling constant, and slowly exchanging amide hydrogen information (Fig. 2). PTK6-SH2 is composed of two α-helices, six β-strands, and seven flexible loops. Three-dimensional Structure of PTK6-SH2—A total of 1532 distance constraints, including 250 intraresidue, 374 sequential, 271 medium range, and 637 long range constraints, were derived from NOESY spectra. For 23 backbone hydrogen bonds, 46 corresponding interatomic distance constraints were used for the structure calculation. Fig. 3 summarizes backbone-backbone, side chain-side chain, and backbone-side chain NOEs. The structural statistics associated with the 20 SAk structures are listed in Table I. The final structures are well converged with a root mean square deviation of 0.29 Å for secondary structural regions and 0.78 Å for all backbone heavy atoms, respectively. The PTK6-SH2 fold consists of a central four-stranded β-sheet (βA, βB, βC, and βD), two α-helices (αA and αB), and a small β-sheet (βE and βF) near the second helix. The structure of PTK6-SH2 is relatively rigid, and a central β-barrel is well defined (Fig. 4). The topology of PTK6-SH2 is similar to that of other SH2 domains (52Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar); however, it shows some differences from a canonical SH2 domain. A spatial rearrangement of the secondary structures especially in the central β-barrel region due to different length of β-strands was clearly observed (Fig. 5). In addition, the C-terminal β-strand (βG), which is involved in not only β-barrel formation but also in ligand binding, is not observed in PTK6-SH2. This implies that PTK6-SH2 might have a unique binding feature for its specific ligand peptide.Table IStructural statistics for the 20 final simulated annealing structures of PTK6 SH2 domainSAkSAkrr.m.s.d.ar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. from experimental distance restraints (Å)All (1600)0.025 ± 0.0010.023Sequential (|i - j| = 1) (374)0.028 ± 0.0030.046Medium range (i < |i - j| ≤ 5) (271)0.026 ± 0.0050.023Long range (|i - j| > 5) (637)0.031 ± 0.0020.018Intraresidue (250)0.0002 ± 0.00050.0009Hydrogen bond (23)0.015 ± 0.0020.019r.m.s.d. from experimental dihedral restraints (Å)Dihedral angle restraints (45)0.472 ± 0.0190.273Energies (kcal/mol)ENOE53.33 ± 3.9454.057Ecdih0.982 ± 0.2310.007Erepel50.03 ± 5.3910.072EL-JbEL-J is the Lennard-Jones/van der Waals potential calculated using CHARMm empirical energy function.−344.479−413.598Deviation from idealized covalent geometryBond (Å)0.003 ± 0.00010.0005Angles (°)0.472 ± 0.0190.272Impropers (°)0.383 ± 0.0230.079a r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.b EL-J is the Lennard-Jones/van der Waals potential calculated using CHARMm empirical energy function.

Electrostatic surfaces are shown in red (negative potential), in blue (positive potential), and in white (neutral).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Backbone Dynamics—Of the 96 backbone amide protons, the relaxation parameters for 81 residues have been reliably quantified. The experimental T1, T2, and steady-state 15N-{1H} heteronuclear NOE data are summarized in Fig. 6. The average values of T1 and T2 were determined to be 365.9 and 131.6 ms, respectively. The 15N-{1H} heteronuclear NOEs for most residues were observed to be 0.8-1.0. The profile of heteronuclear NOEs shows that the secondary structural regions are relatively rigid. The overall rotational correlation time (τm) determined from the T1 and T2 values and NMR structure is 6.5 ns (Fig. 7). The calculated order parameters (S2) were in the range 0.7-0.95; however, small order parameters were found for the residues in the loops and the terminus of the secondary structural regions. The effective correlation time for internal motions, τe, was determined as 55 ps. Interestingly most residues of the protein involved in Tyr(P) peptide binding exhibited smaller 15N-{1H} steady-state heteronuclear NOEs and order parameters as well as longer internal correlation times than those of residues in the structured regions, implying that the ligand binding site could be intrinsically dynamic in the absence of its ligand molecule (Figs. 6 and 7).Fig. 7Plots of the optimized model-free and extended model-free parameters as a function of residue number for PTK6-SH2. Optimized values of the generalized order parameter (S2) are shown in A, values of effective correlation time (τe) are shown in B, and exchange parameters (Rex) are shown in C, values of the effective correlation time for internal motions on a slow time scale (τs) are shown in D, and values of the generalized order parameter for the fast motion (Sf2) are shown in E. The parameters and their uncertainties are shown as a function of the protein sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Chemical Shift Change upon Ligand Binding—The ligand binding pocket was predicted from the backbone dynamics together with sequence alignment data. To determine residues involved in ligand binding, a phosphorylated peptide derived from the C-terminal region (spanning residues 442-451) of PTK6 was used for NMR titration experiments. It has been observed that the autophosphorylated oligopeptide at Tyr-447 of PTK6, but not the unphosphorylated peptide, was successfully bound to PTK6-SH2 (16Qiu H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34634-34641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra of PTK6-SH2 were collected with different concentrations of phosphopeptide. Fig. 8A shows a superposition of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of free PTK6-SH2 and peptide-bound PTK6-SH2 showing the chemical shift perturbations upon ligand binding more graphically. Most of the observed chemical shift perturbations occurred at residues involved in phosphopeptide binding. Chemical shift changes (Δδtot) between free SH2 and complexed SH2 were calculated using the equation, Δδtot=((ΔδHNWHN)2+(ΔδNWN)2)1/2(Eq. 1) where δi is the chemical shift of nucleus i, and Wi denotes its weight factor (WHN = 1, WN = 0.2) (53Ayed A. Mulder F.A. Yi G.S. Kay L.W. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A single resonance peak was observed for each residue of PTK6-SH2 during titration, showing that the PTK6-SH2·Tyr(P) peptide is in fast exchange on the NMR time scale (Fig. 8A). The chemical shift perturbations upon Tyr(P) peptide binding were plotted as a function of residue number (Fig. 8B). The model structure of PTK6-SH2·Tyr(P) peptide agrees well with this data, showing that the peptide ligand interacts mainly with residues comprising a continuous patch of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, which are αA (Arg-85 and Val-89), βB (Arg-105), BC loop (Glu-108), βD (His-126, Tyr-127, and Lys-128), DE loop (Ala-133), βE (Leu-139), EF loop (Glu-141), αB (Tyr-154), and BG loop (Leu-160 and Leu-164) (Fig. 8C). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—The binding affinity of the Tyr(P) peptide to the SH2 domain was measured by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy using GST-PTK6-SH2. Fig. 9 illustrates a surface plasmon resonance sensorgram for the ligand peptide binding mode of PTK6-SH2. A rapid response curve indicates that the binding of peptide occurs with a fast association rate (kon) and dissociation rate (koff). Based on surface plasmon resonance data, an apparent dissociation constant (Kd = kon/koff) for the interaction between PTK6-SH2 and Tyr(P) peptide is 60 μm. Since the relative affinities for various SH2-Tyr(P) peptide interactions have been reported as Kd values from 10 μm to 0.1 nm, the binding affinity of Tyr(P) peptide to PTK6-SH2 is lower than those of previously reported phosphopeptide-SH2 binding (48Ladbury J.E. Lemmon M.A. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M.C. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, this weak binding is clearly supported by previous biological data showing that the enzyme activity of PTK6 increased about 1.4-fold with 1 mm Tyr(P) peptide, and no activity change has been observed within the micromolar range of peptide concentration (16Qiu H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34634-34641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although the molecular topology of PTK6-SH2 is similar to that of the SH2 domains, the spatial arrangement of a central four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (strands βA, βB, βC, and βD) clearly differs due to the missing βG strand, which is commonly found in most SH2 structures. The structural superposition with other SH2 domains of p56lck, Hck, and Blk clearly supports the differences; the pairwise backbone (N, Cα, and C′) root mean square deviations for these structures are 2.016 Å (p56lck), 2.196 Å (Hck), and 3.271 Å (Blk), respectively. Several notable structural differences were clearly observed in the ordered secondary structural regions, and high root mean square deviation values in the BC, EF, and BG loops between PTK6-SH2 and other SH2 domains were also observed. For example, a dramatic difference was found in loops; PTK6-SH2 has a shorter CD loop and longer AB loop than those of the canonical SH2 domains (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the structural rearrangement of the central β-barrel due to different loop length might enable its ligand specificity for PTK6 signaling. A surface charge distribution of PTK6-SH2 calculated with the Delphi program suggests that a cluster of positively charged surface residues would be a ligand binding site for the negatively charged phosphotyrosine peptide, providing a strongly favorable electrostatic interaction between protein and ligand molecules. A continuous stretch of the ligand binding surface between BC and βG loop was also observed (Fig. 5B). Since it is well known that one of the major interactions between Tyr(P) peptide and SH2 domain is a hydrophobic interaction, it is expected that the hydrophobic patch of PTK6-SH2 should play a critical role in ligand binding. Fig. 5B clearly shows that the hydrophobic amino acids (Leu-139 and Leu-160) of PTK6-SH2 contact the proline residue of the Tyr(P) peptide, which is the Tyr(P) +3 position of the ligand. The addition of Tyr(P) peptide to PTK6-SH2 also supports the structural data based on chemical shift perturbation of the residues involved in Tyr(P) peptide binding. For example, several charged residues in αA (Arg-85) and βD (His-126 and Lys-128) undergo large chemical shift perturbation upon ligand binding (Fig. 10). A significant change of the NMR resonance intensities was also observed for residues Val-89 (αA) and Tyr-127 and Ile-129 (βD). Most of the residues in the BC, EF, and BG loops experience chemical shift perturbations upon ligand binding. Recently Qiu and Miller (16Qiu H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34634-34641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggested that the phosphorylation of Tyr-447 of PTK6 might play an important role in its negative regulation of the enzyme activity. They have shown that a single mutation at Tyr-447 increased SH2 domain accessibility to a synthetic ligand and resulted in 2.5-fold higher catalytic activity than that of the wild type. In this study, Tyr(P) peptide derived from the C-terminal region of PTK6 including Tyr(P)-447 successfully bound to the SH2 domain, supporting the autoinhibitory role of PTK6 protein. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) between Tyr(P) peptide and PTK6-SH2 was determined as 60 μm, which is much weaker than that of other SH2 domains. However, this might be explained by the fact that the local concentration of the phosphorylated C-terminal region of PTK6 is high in vivo because the actual binding will occur as an intramolecular interaction. Our data indicate that the structural motif of PTK6-SH2 would be of importance for specific recognition of ligand because the binding of phosphorylated C-terminal region to SH2 domain would be highly specific for the optimum autoregulation of PTK6 activity. In addition, it could be possible that the enzymatic activity of PTK6 would be tightly regulated through an autophosphorylation process at Tyr-447. Although a recent report suggests that PTK6 phosphorylates two other proteins, Sam68 and BKS in vivo (54Serfas M.S. Tyner A.L. Oncol. Res. 2003; 13: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the downstream signaling of PTK6 is still not known in detail. Further structural study of PTK6 together with its interacting molecules will elucidate the signaling network and negative autoregulation process of this family of proteins at the atomic scale."

Here, noninvasive (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P NMRS) was used to study human quadriceps muscle energetics and pHi during incremental bicycling exercise to exhaustion in six normally active subjects. Cellular energy charge (CEC; [PCr]/([PCr]+[Pi])) linearly (r 0.90) dropped 83 +/- 3% during ramp exercise to exhaustion from 0.92 +/- 0.01 at rest to 0.16 +/- 0.03 at maximal sustained work rate (WR) (166+/-17 W; range: 108-223 W). Surprisingly, pHi likewise dropped linearly (r 0.82) no more than 0.2 units over the entire range of WR between rest and maximal (pHi 7.08+/-0.01 and 6.84+/-0.02, respectively). But after termination of exercise pHi dropped rapidly to textbook acidic values of 6.6 explaining classic biopsy results. Comparative coresponse analysis of pHi and CEC changes during 2L- vs. 1L-cycling showed that homeostatic control of quadriceps pHi during bicycling is robust and unique to natural locomotor exercise. These results highlight the robustness of the integrative set of physicochemical and physiological control mechanisms in acid-base balance during natural locomotor activity in man."
https://openalex.org/W2109960870,"Coliphage T4 Pnkp is a bifunctional polynucleotide 5′-kinase/3′-phosphatase that catalyzes the end-healing steps of a RNA repair pathway. Here we show that mycobacteriophages Omega and Cjw1 and vibriophage KVP40 also encode bifunctional Pnkp enzymes consisting of a proximal 5′-kinase module with an essential P-loop motif, GXGK(S/T), and a distal 3′-phosphatase module with an essential acyl-phosphatase motif, DX- DGT. Biochemical characterization of the viral Pnkp proteins reveals several shared features, including an alkaline pH optimum for the kinase component, an intrinsic RNA kinase activity, and a homotetrameric or homodimeric quaternary structure, that distinguish them from the monomeric DNA-specific phosphatase/kinase enzymes found in mammals and fission yeast. Whereas the phage 5′-kinases differ from each other in their preferences for phosphorylation of 5′ overhangs, blunt ends, or recessed ends, none of them displays the preference for recessed ends reported for mammalian DNA kinase. We hypothesize that Pnkp provides phages that have it with a means to evade an RNA-damaging antiviral host response. Genetic complementation of the essential end-healing steps of yeast tRNA splicing by the Omega and Cjw1 Pnkp enzymes establishes their capacity to perform RNA repair reactions in vivo.

Breaks in the phosphodiester backbone of genomic DNA or essential RNA molecules can lead to cell death if not repaired. Such breaks can be triggered by physical or chemical insults, enzymatic hydrolysis, exposure to cytotoxic drugs, etc. Although DNA repair pathways have been the focus of much attention in light of the connections between DNA damage, mutagenesis, and cancer, there is an emerging appreciation that distinctive pathways exist to maintain or manipulate RNA structure in response to breakage events.

When breakage of a 3′-5′ phosphodiester results in the formation of 5′-PO4 and 3′-OH termini at the break site, the ends can be rejoined to each other (or to novel partner strands) by the action of DNA-specific or RNA-specific polynucleotide ligases. However, when breakage occurs with the opposite polarity, resulting in 5′-OH and 3′-PO4 (or 2′,3′-cyclic PO4) termini, the broken ends must be “healed” before they can be sealed. Healing entails two steps: (i) hydrolysis of the 3′-PO4 (or 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate) to form a 3′-OH and (ii) phosphorylation of the 5′-OH to form a 5′-PO4 end. The bacteriophage T4 proteins polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (Pnkp) and RNA ligase 1 (Rnl1) are the prototypal RNA healing and sealing enzymes (1Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two of the essential phosphatase residues, Asp165 and Asp167, are located within a 165DXDXT169 motif that defines a superfamily of phosphotransferases that act through a covalent aspartyl phosphate intermediate (23Collet J.F.

The native T4 Pnkp tetramer is assembled via pairwise kinase-kinase and phosphatase-phosphatase dimer interfaces (15Wang L.K. Lima C.D. Shuman S.

It is noteworthy that the host bacterium E. coli appears not to encode homologs of T4 polynucleotide kinase and RNA ligase; nor do most other bacterial species for which genomic sequence is available. The closest relative of the T4 RNA repair enzyme system is the multifunctional Rnl1 protein of the Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV). AcNPV is a prototype of the baculovirus family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, which replicate in arthropod hosts. The 694-aa baculovirus Rnl1 protein consists of an autonomous N-terminal RNA-specific ligase domain and an autonomous C-terminal end-healing domain (26Martins A. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18220-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The end-healing domain is composed of a proximal polynucleotide kinase module with an essential P-loop motif and a distal polynucleotide 3′-phosphatase module with an essential acyl-phosphatase motif. The Rnl1 kinase-phosphatase domain has a homodimeric quaternary structure. The similarities between the phage T4 and AcNPV enzymes prompted the speculation that AcNPV may have acquired an RNA repair system to contend with an RNA-damaging antiviral pathway that exists in its natural ecological niche (26Martins A. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18220-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although T4 Pnkp is an RNA repair enzyme in vivo, it modifies either RNA or DNA ends in vitro (1Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The eukaryal DNA-specific Pnkp enzymes are distinguished structurally from the phage T4 Pnkp in two major respects. First, the domain organization is inverted in the eukaryal enzymes (i.e. the acyl-phosphatase module precedes a C-terminal kinase module) (Fig. 1A). Second, the eukaryal Pnkp has a monomeric quaternary structure (38Mani R.S. Karimi-Busheri F. Cass C.E. Weinfeld M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12967-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Based on available data, we can classify two groups of Pnkp proteins that arose via fusions of ancestral P-loop and DXDXT phosphoryl transfer domains: (i) the oligomeric T4-like kinase-phosphatase flavor that appears to mediate RNA repair reactions and (ii) the monomeric eukaryal-type phosphatase-kinase group that is dedicated to DNA repair reactions. A major impediment to evaluating the merits of this classification and, indeed, to understanding the prevalence and relevance of RNA repair pathways is that T4-like Pnkp proteins have only been characterized from T4 and AcNPV viruses. Broadly speaking, RNA-based “immune” responses to viral infection are common in virology, as exemplified by the key role of double-stranded RNA, RNase L, and the RNA-activated protein kinase PKR in the interferon response pathway in animals (39Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). By analogy to the T4 tRNA restriction and eukaryal RNase L systems, it is conceivable that many viruses trigger the incision of an essential host or viral RNA molecule, thereby impeding virus replication or pathogenesis, in which case such viruses might encode T4-like RNA repair functions. Here we identify and characterize homologs of T4 Pnkp from two mycobacteriophages, Omega and Cjw1 (40Pedulla M.L. Ford M.E. Houtz J.M. Karthikeyan T. Wadsworth C. Lewis J.A. Jacobs-Sera D. Falbo J.

The recurrence of Pnkp enzymes in disparate viral pathogens suggests that RNA damage-based responses to virus infection may be widespread. The Omega gp136 and Cjw1 gp89 genes encoding Pnkp homologs were amplified by PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase using primers designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site at the start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The template DNAs used for amplification (a pBluescript plasmid containing the Omega gp136 gene and Cjw1 genomic DNA, respectively) were a generous gift of Dr. Graham Hatfull (University of Pittsburgh). The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b (Novagen) to generate expression plasmids encoding the phage Pnkp polypeptides fused to an N-terminal His10 tag. Alanine substitution mutations were introduced by PCR using the two-stage overlap extension method. The inserts of the wild-type and mutant pET-Pnkp plasmids were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification and cloning. Wild-type and mutant pET-Pnkp plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Cultures (100 ml) of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-Pnkp were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached 0.6. The cultures were adjusted to 0.5 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside and then incubated at 17 °C for 15 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were stored at -80 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% sucrose, 15 mm imidazole). Lysozyme and Triton X-100 were added to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatants were applied to 1-ml columns of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) that had been equilibrated with lysis buffer. The columns were washed with 10 ml of lysis buffer and then eluted stepwise with 2-ml aliquots of buffers containing 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, 10% glycerol. The polypeptide compositions of the fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. Omega Pnkp was recovered predominantly in the 200 mm imidazole eluate fraction (containing 3 mg of protein). Cjw1 Pnkp was recovered predominantly in the 300 mm imidazole eluate fraction (containing 5 mg of protein). The protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The recombinant Pnkp proteins were stored at -80 °C. KVP40 gene 90 encoding a Pnkp homolog was amplified by PCR from KVP40 genomic DNA (a generous gift of Dr. Eric Miller, North Carolina State University) using primers designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site at the start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b to generate an expression plasmid encoding KVP40 Pnkp fused to an N-terminal His10 tag. The pET-Pnkp plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). A 1-liter culture of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-Pnkp was grown and induced to express the KVP40 protein as described above for the mycobacteriophage proteins. The thawed bacterial pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 10% sucrose). Lysozyme and Triton X-100 were added to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extract was applied to a 2-ml column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was washed with 20 ml of the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 3-ml aliquots of 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 1200 mm imidazole in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100). The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. KVP40 Pnkp was recovered predominantly in 1000 mm imidazole eluate fraction (containing 12 mg of protein). Oligonucleotide Substrate—Reaction mixtures contained a 5′-OH oligodeoxyribonucleotide or oligoribonucleotide substrate, [γ-32P]ATP, and other components as specified in the figure legends. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Oligoribonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and deprotected as instructed by the vendor. Concentrations of oligonucleotide stock solutions were determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm, using extinction coefficients calculated according to their base compositions. The kinase reactions were initiated by adding Pnkp and terminated with formamide/EDTA. The products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 15-cm polyacrylamide gel (either 12 or 15% acrylamide) containing 7 m urea in 90 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA. The radiolabeled oligonucleotide products of expected size were visualized by autoradiography of the gel and quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujix BAS2500 imaging apparatus. Mononucleotide Substrate—Reaction mixtures contained 3′-CMP (Sigma), [γ-32P]ATP, and other components as specified in the figure legends. The reactions were initiated by adding Pnkp and terminated with formic acid. Aliquots (4 μl) of the mixtures were applied to a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, which was developed with 1 m formic acid, 0.5 m LiCl. The [γ-32P]ATP substrate and [32P]pCp product were visualized and quantified by scanning the TLC plate with a Fujix BAS2500 imaging apparatus. Linear Plasmid DNA Substrate—Circular pUC19 plasmid DNA was digested with BamHI, KpnI, or SmaI, and the linear products were recovered by extraction with phenol/chloroform and precipitation with ethanol. The 5′-PO4 termini were removed by treatment of the DNA with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs), and the DNA was again recovered by extraction with phenol/chloroform and precipitation with ethanol. The DNA was resuspended in water, and its concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm. Kinase reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 for Cjw1 Pnkp, pH 9.0 for Omega Pnkp, or pH 7.6 for T4 Pnkp), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 μg of linear 5′-OH pUC19 DNA, either 1 μm or 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of Cjw1, Omega, or T4 Pnkp were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched with EDTA, and the DNA was purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) according to the vendor's instructions. The isolated DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis through a horizontal 1% agarose gel in 40 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm EDTA buffer with 0.02% ethidium bromide. The ethidium-strained DNA was visualized by UV transillumination. The gel was then dried under vacuum on DEAE paper (Whatman), and the radiolabeled DNA was visualized by autoradiography. Reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris (pH 6.5), 5 mm MgCl2,5mm DTT, 1 mm ADP, 5′-32P-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide d(ATTCCGATAGTGACTACA) as specified and Omega or Cjw1 Pnkp as specified were incubated at 37 °C. Reactions were initiated by adding Pnkp. Aliquots (6 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified and quenched immediately by adding 2 μl of 100 mm EDTA. The quenched samples were applied to a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, which was developed with 1 m formic acid, 0.5 m LiCl. Unlabeled ATP, ADP, and AMP markers were chromatographed in parallel. The [32P]ATP product and the 32P-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrate were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scanning the plate with a Fujix BAS2500 imaging device. Reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 3′-TMP (Sigma) and other components as specified in the figure legends. The reactions were quenched by adding 75 μl of cold water and 1 ml of malachite green reagent (purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Release of phosphate was determined by measuring A620 and interpolating the value to a phosphate standard curve. Aliquots (40 μg) of Omega or Cjw1 Pnkp were mixed with catalase (30 μg), BSA (30 μg), and cytochrome c (30 μg) in 200 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 15% glycerol. The protein mixtures were applied to 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradients containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. An aliquot (50 μg) of KVP40 Pnkp was mixed with 50 μg each of catalase, BSA, and cytochrome c in 200 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol. The mixture was applied to a 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradient containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradient was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50 rotor. Fractions (∼0.2 ml) were collected from the bottoms of the tubes. Aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and assayed for kinase and phosphatase activity as specified in the figure legends. New Bacteriophage Homologs of T4 Pnkp—The recently completed genome sequence of the T4-like vibriophage KVP40 (41Miller E.S. Heidelberg J.F. Eisen J.A. Nelson W.C. Durkin A.S. Ciecko A. Feldlyum T.V.

The conservation of Pnkp in KVP40 is notable given that only 26% of the predicted KVP40 proteins have homologs in phage T4 and only 36% of T4 proteins have homologs in KVP40 (41Miller E.S.

We describe an experimental approach using native gel electrophoresis for studying interactions of elongation factors with isolated Pol II elongation complexes. The gel distinguishes Pol IIA and Pol IIB containing complexes. The interaction of DSIF (Spt4/Spt5) with the elongation complexes can be readily detected, and this association is not dependent on the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit of Pol II.

Traditional purification techniques have identified numerous proteins that modulate transcriptional elongation by Pol II 1The abbreviations used are: Pol II, polymerase II; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; HA, hemagglutinin. (1Shilatifard A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Work during the past few years employing genetic and proteomic approaches has significantly increased this number (2Krogan N.J. Kim M. Ahn S.H. Zhong G. Kobor M.S. Cagney G. Emili A. Shilatifard A.

Cell. 2004; 13: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Many of these factors appear to execute general cellular functions required for the transcription of all protein-encoding genes. Factors such as TFIIS and elongin act directly on Pol II to counteract the tendency of the enzyme to pause. Others such as FACT and Swi/Snf alter chromatin structure. A significant number of proteins are involved in coupling RNA processing to transcription elongation (4Bentley D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 5Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). In contrast to these general elongation factors, DSIF and NELF have been implicated in regulating transcription of specific genes (6Wu C.H. Yamaguchi Y. Benjamin L.R. Horvat-Gordon M. Washinsky J.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1055-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Much is not known about how the factors interact with the elongation complex and which can bind simultaneously or in competition with each other. The unusual carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II has been implicated in mediating the activity of various elongation factors (9Buratowski S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The CTD consists of multiple repeats of 7 amino acids, called heptad repeats, with the consensus Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser (10Corden J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). A cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of serines 2 and 5 of the heptad repeats accompanies transcription initiation, elongation, and termination (11Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Pol II appears to associate with a promoter in an unphosphorylated state known as Pol IIA. During initiation or shortly thereafter, serine 5 in the heptads becomes phosphorylated. This could be important for RNA capping as the phosphorylated CTD interacts with guanylyltransferase (12McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 13Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). As Pol II departs from the promoter region, it is phosphorylated on serine 2 (11Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 14Boehm A.K. Saunders A. Werner J. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7628-7637Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Serine 2 phosphorylation has recently been shown to be important for proper 3′ end formation (3Ahn S.H. Kim M. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 15Ni Z. Schwartz B.E. Werner J. Suarez J.R. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The CTD has also been implicated in RNA splicing (16McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 17Hirose Y. Tacke R. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Both the CTD and the polyadenylation signal in the nascent transcript contribute to transcription termination, although contrary to earlier proposals, it appears that termination does not require cleavage of the nascent transcript (18Sadowski M. Dichtl B. Hubner W. Keller W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Kim S.J. Martinson H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41691-41701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We set out to develop an experimental approach that would allow us to monitor associations of proteins with elongation complexes formed from purified Pol II so we could begin to analyze the interdependencies of these interactions and the potential impact of the CTD. Using native gel electrophoresis, elongation complexes containing Pol IIA have been distinguished from elongation complexes containing Pol IIB, a form of Pol II that lacks the CTD. We show that the binding of the elongation factor DSIF does not require the CTD even though the phosphorylation state of the CTD has been implicated in regulating the action of DSIF (20Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 21Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7395-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We also provide evidence that binding of a protein to the CTD can trigger termination. This could have important implications for transcription termination on protein-encoding genes. Purification of Pol IIA/IIB Mixture—Drosophila nuclear extracts were prepared from 150 to 200 grams of Drosophila embryos as described previously (48Biggin M.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 53: 699-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and dialyzed into 150 mm KCl-HGEDPX Buffer (HGEDPX corresponds to 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm sodium bisulfite, 1 mm benzamidine HCl). Extract (15 ml at ∼20 mg/ml protein) was loaded onto a 30-ml DEAE-column equilibrated in 150 mm KCl-HGEDPX and washed with 150 ml of 150 mm KCl-HGEDPX and then with 150 ml of 250 mm KCl-HGEDPX. Pol II was eluted with 600 mm KCl-HGEDPX, and fractions with peak activity were pooled to give a total volume of 15 ml. The KCl concentration was adjusted to 150 mm with 10 mm KCl-HGEDPX, and the protein was loaded onto a 15-ml heparin column (POROS 50 HE, Applied Biosystems) previously equilibrated with 150 mm KCl-HGEDPX. The heparin column was washed with 50 ml of 150 mm KCl-HGEDPX and 50 ml of 250 mm KCl-HGEDPX. Pol II was eluted with 500 mm KCl-HGEDPX. Peak fractions of Pol II were pooled and dialyzed into 150 mm KCl-HGEDPX. The Pol II was loaded onto a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences, HR5/5). The column was washed with 20 ml of 150 mm KCl-HGEDPX, and bound proteins were eluted in 0.5-ml fractions using a 15-ml gradient from 150 mm KCl-HGEDPX to 400 mm KCl-HGEDPX, followed by a 10-ml gradient from 400 mm KCl-HGEDPX to 600 mm KCl-HGEDPX. Pol II activity was measured in fractions using a promoter independent transcription assay (28Zehring W.A. Lee J.M. Weeks J.R. Jokerst R.S. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3698-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Peak fractions of activity eluted at ∼550 mm, and the protein concentration was 1 mg/ml. Preparation of Pol IIB—1 ml of Pol IIA/IIB mixture was treated for 30 min with 0.25 μg/ml chymotrypsin at 30 °C and repurified on the Mono Q column as described above. DNA Template—DNA template was generated by PCR from plasmid containing a G-less cassette. One PCR primer generated a BglII site at one end and the other primer introduced a biotin tag at the opposite end. The resulting PCR product had a 110-residue G-less cassette and 110 nucleotides of flanking G-containing sequence. The PCR fragment was cut with BglII, dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and finally ligated to a phosphorylated oligonucleotide with the sequence GATCAAAAAAAATTA. The resulting 11-nucleotide overhang served as an initiation site for Pol II in the presence of UpG. Transcription Reactions—Transcription reactions were performed in 15 μl containing 150 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1.0 mm MnCl2, 12% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm UpG, 20 units of RNasin, 1.0 μl of purified Pol II (1 μg), and 100 ng of tailed G-less template. Pol II was preincubated with the template for 5 min to allow formation of preinitiation complexes. Transcription was initiated by adding a mixture of nucleotides yielding final concentrations of 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.025 mm UTP, and 1 μCi/reaction of [α-32P]UTP. Each reaction mixture was incubated at 21 °C for 25 min. Analysis of Transcripts—Forty microliters of stop buffer (20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 1% SDS, 0.25 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K) was added to each transcription reaction. Samples were incubated at 42 °C for 30 min and extracted once with 55 μl of a phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol mixture (25:24:1). The RNA was precipitated with ethanol and analyzed on 8 or 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Radioactive RNA was detected and quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Analysis of Elongation Complexes by Native Gel Electrophoresis— Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as previously described for TFIID-DNA complexes (34Purnell B.A. Gilmour D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Transcription reactions were loaded directly into the wells without addition of bromphenol blue. Bromphenol blue was run in adjacent lanes to within 1 cm of the bottom of the gel. Gels were transferred to paper, dried, and analyzed with a PhosphorImager. Transcription on Immobilized DNA—Biotinylated DNA templates (0.2 ug) were bound to 20 μl of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal Inc.). Beads were washed once with 150 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1.0 mm MnCl2, 12% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol before use in transcription reactions. A 15-μl transcription mixture lacking nucleotides was incubated with the beads for 5 min. Nucleotides were added, and samples were incubated at room temperature for 25 min. The immobilized elongation complexes were washed two times with transcription buffer and finally incubated for 20 min with antibody or buffer in 15 μl of transcription buffer minus nucleotides. RNA was isolated from bound and free fractions and analyzed on a denaturing gel. Preparation of DSIF—Sequences encoding the two subunits of DSIF, spt4 and spt5, were subcloned into the baculovirus expression vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). Spt4 was tagged at its COOH terminus with the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA), and Spt5 was tagged at its COOH terminus with the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). The Spt4 coding region was PCR amplified from the cDNA clone LD44495 (BDGP) with sequences encoding the HA epitope and appropriate restriction sites included in the PCR primers. The Spt4 PCR product was cut with EcoRI and XhoI and subcloned in EcoRI/XhoI cut pFastBac1 to produce a plasmid called pFB-Spt4-HA. The Spt5 coding region was PCR amplified in two parts from the cDNA clone LD10265 (49Kaplan C.D. Morris J.R. Wu C. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2623-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The two parts were ligated by an AvrII site, which was present in the Spt5 coding sequence. The PCR primers had introduced EcoRI and XhoI sites at the end of this fragment and sequences encoding the FLAG epitope. The resulting fragment was inserted into EcoRI/XhoI cut pFastBac1. The resulting plasmid was called pFB-Spt5-FLAG. Viral particles encoding Spt5-FLAG and Spt4-HA were produced according to the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). To co-express the two subunits, 500 ml of Sf9 cells grown in Sf9 serum-free medium (Invitrogen) were infected with each recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3. Three days post-infection, the cells were collected and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were suspended in 30 ml of TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1× complete proteinase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) and sonicated 5 times for 8 s intervals. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was mixed with a 1-ml packed volume of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) and gently agitated at 4 °C for 2 h. The suspension was packed into a column, and the fluid was allowed to drain. The packed resin was washed with 10 ml of TBS buffer. dDSIF was eluted with five consecutive 1-ml aliquots of TBS buffer supplemented with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide. Peak fractions were stored at -80 °C. Greater than 80% of the dDSIF could be immunoprecipitated with antibody against the HA tag located on Spt4 indicating that the majority of the Spt5 was associated with Spt4. Antibodies—8WG16 antibody (ascites fluid) was obtained from Covance. ARNA-3 antibody (ascites fluid) was obtained from Research Diagnostics Inc. One microliter of antibody was used per transcription reaction. Formation of Stalled Elongation Complexes on a Tailed Template—Pol II normally requires several general transcription factors to initiate transcription (22Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). We sought to develop a facile way for analyzing elongation complexes that could be set up with purified Drosophila Pol II. It was previously shown that purified yeast Pol II would initiate transcription at a 3′ tail similar to the one illustrated in Fig. 1A when transcription was initiated with the UpG dinucleotide (23Lang W.H. Morrow B.E. Ju Q. Warner J.R. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 527-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We attached the 3′ tail to a G-less cassette so that elongation complexes stalled at the end of the cassette when GTP was omitted from the transcription reaction. Fig. 1B (lane 1) shows that one major transcript of the expected size was produced when the tailed template was incubated with purified Drosophila Pol II, UpG, ATP, CTP, and radiolabeled UTP. Transcription was dependent on UpG indicating that the Pol II was initiating from the 3′ tail (Fig 1B, lane 5). As expected for Pol II, transcription was inhibited by α-amanitin (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Sometimes transcription of tailed templates occurs anomalously. The nascent transcript hybridizes along its entire length to the transcribed strand of DNA, displacing the non-transcribed strand of DNA (24Dedrick R.L. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2245-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The RNase sensitivity of the transcripts indicated that Drosophila Pol II was transcribing our tailed template without extensive DNA strand displacement. The nascent transcript was degraded by RNase A indicating that the transcript was single-stranded (Fig. 1B, lane 3). The nascent transcript was not degraded by RNase H confirming that it had not hybridized to the transcribed strand of DNA (Fig. 1B, lane 2). We verified that the RNase H was active by showing that an oligonucleotide complementary to a specific region of the nascent transcript could target cutting by RNase H (data not shown). If the elongation complexes stalled at the end of the G-less cassette were to be a suitable model for an elongation complex, they should resume elongation when provide GTP. Fig. 1C (lane 1) shows the nascent transcript produced in the absence of GTP. Fig. 1C (lane 3) shows that all stalled complexes resumed elongation following addition of GTP to produce a run-off transcript. The weak band marked with an asterisk in lane 1 appeared to be formed by a low level of Pol II reading through the four Gs located at the end of the G-less cassette, since formation of this product was inhibited by the chain terminator, 3′-methoxy-GTP (lane 2). Most likely, one of the nucleotides was contaminated with a low level of GTP. Detection of Pol IIA and Pol IIB Elongation Complexes by Native Gel Electrophoresis—Native gel electrophoresis has been widely used to analyze protein-nucleic acid complexes. However, there have been relatively few reports using this to analyze Pol II-containing elongation complexes. When we subjected our stalled elongation complexes to electrophoresis on a native gel, two distinct complexes were observed (Fig. 2A, lane 2). To detect these complexes, radionucleotides were incorporated into the nascent transcript prior to loading the complexes on the gel. Both complexes were determined to contain Pol II because they shifted mobility when incubated with a monoclonal antibody called ARNA-3 (25Kramer A. Haars R. Kabisch R. Will H. Bautz F.A. Bautz E.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 180: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that bound to the largest subunit outside the region of the CTD (Fig. 2A, lane 3). We wondered if the existence of two complexes might be due to the presence of different forms of Pol II. The elongation complexes were incubated with a monoclonal antibody called 8WG16 that binds the CTD (26Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody caused the disappearance of the slower migrating complex indicating that this complex contained Pol IIA (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Further analysis of the Pol II preparation indicated that the preparation was a mixture of Pol IIA and Pol IIB. The CTD is often proteolyzed during Pol II purifications resulting in the formation of Pol IIB. Two bands corresponding to the largest subunits of Pol IIA and Pol IIB (designated IIa and IIb) were detected in a silver-stained gel and on immunoblots probed with ARNA-3 (Fig. 2, B, lane 1, and C, lane 1). In contrast, 8WG16 only binds to the slower migrating IIa (Fig. 2D, lane 1). To determine whether the rapidly migrating complex detected in the native gel contained Pol IIB, we converted all of the Pol II in the mixture to Pol IIB by gently digesting the mixture with chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsin has been shown to remove the CTD without destroying the rest of Pol II (27Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 28Zehring W.A. Lee J.M. Weeks J.R. Jokerst R.S. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3698-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting showed that all of the largest subunit was successfully converted to the Pol IIB form (Fig. 2, B, lane 2, and C, lane 2). The resulting elongation complex detected by native gel electrophoresis co-migrated with the more rapidly migrating complex formed by the Pol IIA/IIB mixture (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 5 and 2). The mobility of this complex was altered by ARNA-3 but not by 8WG16 indicating that the complex did indeed contain Pol IIB (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 6). DSIF Associates with Both Pol IIA and Pol IIB-containing Elongation Complexes—Our motivation for developing the native gel assay was to investigate the interactions of proteins with elongation complexes. DSIF has been implicated in both stimulating and inhibiting transcriptional elongation (8Kwak Y.T. Guo J. Prajapati S. Park K.J. Surabhi R.M. Miller B. Gehrig P. Gaynor R.B. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1055-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 29Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 30Bourgeois C.F. Kim Y.K. Churcher M.J. West M.J. Karn J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Its inhibitory action depends on another protein called NELF (20Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Since the CTD has also been implicated in regulating the action of DSIF, we were interested in determining whether direct interactions between DSIF and our elongation complexes could be detected by native gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 3 (lanes 1 and 2), DSIF associated with both Pol IIA and Pol IIB elongation complexes. In addition to Pol II, elongation complexes contain both DNA and RNA. Hence, it was possible that the shift in mobility was due solely to binding between DSIF and nucleic acid. If binding involved contact with Pol II, we reasoned that damaging the surface of Pol II in the elongation complex should interfere with binding of the DSIF. It had been reported previously that elongation complexes were remarkably resistant to proteolysis (31Ackerman S. Bunick D. Zandomeni R. Weinmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 6041-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Treating the elongation complexes with proteinase K prior to electrophoresis resulted in a detectable increase in the mobility of the elongation complexes in the gel (Fig. 3, lane 5). DSIF was unable to associate with the proteolyzed complex indicating that binding depended on the intact surface of the Pol II (Fig. 3, lane 4). PMSF was used to inhibit proteinase K after the protease had inflicted damage on the elongation complexes. The result in lane 3 (Fig. 3) shows that the level of PMSF used to inhibit proteinase K was sufficient to inactivate the proteinase K. When PMSF was added prior to adding proteinase K, DSIF was still capable of binding the pol II elongation complexes. The CTD Monoclonal Antibody Caused Transcription Termination—Unlike the ARNA-3 antibody, 8WG16 appeared to disrupt the elongation complexes, since there was no evidence of a slower migrating complex (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 3). Disruption depended on association with the CTD, since 8WG16 had no effect on the Pol IIB elongation complexes present in the same sample (Fig. 2, lane 1). We found this surprising for two reasons. First, the CTD does not appear to be an integral part of the Pol II molecule involved in transcription (32Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Second, the elongation complexes were quite resistant to disruption by protease treatment (Fig. 3). The ability of 8WG16 to disrupt Pol IIA elongation complexes was examined in another way. Stalled complexes were formed on immobilized templates and then challenged with buffer or antibody. Very little transcript was released from the immobilized complexes when they were treated with buffer or ARNA-3 (Fig. 4, lanes 3-6, compare B (bound) to R (released)). In contrast, 8WG16 caused release of approximately half of the transcripts produced by the mixture of Pol IIA and Pol IIB (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). Since 8WG16 did not cause Pol IIB to release transcript (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8), we conclude that the antibody was causing Pol IIA complexes to release transcript. It is likely that Pol IIA has dissociated from the immobilized template because the presence of an 8-10-nucleotide RNA-DNA heteroduplex located at the active site is essential for stable association of Pol II with DNA (33Kireeva M.L. Komissarova N. Waugh D.S. Kashlev M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6530-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The CTD Antibody Inhibits Transcription at Low Nucleotide Concentrations—We were puzzled by a previous report showing that 8WG16 did not inhibit transcription elongation by purified Pol IIA (26Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pol II pauses transiently when transcribing most DNA, so we anticipated that there would be transient opportunities for the antibody to terminate elongation. To address this issue, the effect of 8WG16 during transcription under different nucleotide concentrations was analyzed. In the presence of 500 μm ATP, 500 μm CTP, and 25 μm UTP, the antibody had no effect on the amount of transcript produced (Fig. 5, A, lanes 1 and 2, and C, column 1). In contrast, lowering nucleotide concentrations to 25 μm ATP, 25 μm CTP, and 10 μm UTP renders transcription sensitive to 8WG16. 8WG16 inhibited transcription by the Pol IIA/IIB mixture by 2-fold (Fig. 5, A, lanes 3 and 4, B, lanes 3 and 4, and C, column 2). The residual transcription that occurred in the presence of antibody could be ascribed to Pol IIB, since Pol IIB transcription was insensitive to the antibody (Fig. 5, B, lanes 1 and 2, and C, column 3). Low nucleotide concentrations increase the frequency and duration of pauses. We conclude that elongation complexes were only susceptible to termination by 8WG16 when the lifetime of the pause was of sufficient duration. Evidence That Binding of a Single Antibody Molecule to the CTD Is Sufficient to Trigger Termination—The CTD is often described as an array of heptad repeats related to the consensus YSPTSPS (10Corden J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The CTD of human and yeast contain, respectively, 21 and 19 heptads that exactly match the consensus. As shown in Fig. 6, however, Drosophila Pol II only has two heptads that exactly match the consensus. This raises the possibility that the 8WG16 antibody terminates transcription by binding a single site rather than multiple sites in the CTD. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed what effect limiting amounts of 8WG16 had on the elongation complexes. If binding were to occur without dissociation of the elongation complex, these associations should shift the mobility of the complex. As shown in Fig. 6, there was no evidence that 8WG16 shifts the mobility of the complex even at levels that are insufficient to disrupt all of the complexes. Two possibilities could explain these results. Binding of the antibody anywhere in the CTD could trigger termination. Alternatively, the antibody binds most readily to a single site on the CTD and this is sufficient to trigger termination. We favor the latter possibility because of the paucity of heptad repeats in the Drosophila CTD that exactly match the consensus. Analysis of Elongation Complexes by Native Gel Electrophoresis—We were pleased to find that Pol IIA and Pol IIB-containing elongation complexes could be distinguished by native gel electrophoresis. This could be very useful in deciphering the functions of the CTD in elongation. We tested several gel systems, but only the system we used previously to analyze TFIID-DNA complexes proved effective (34Purnell B.A. Gilmour D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Purnell B.A. Emanuel P.A. Gilmour D.S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 830-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Most attempts to monitor physical interactions between Pol II and other proteins are done when Pol II is not transcriptionally engaged on a template. The structure of Pol II engaged on DNA is significantly different from free Pol II (32Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 36Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). These differences in conformation from the free enzyme could present unique surfaces for interaction with elongation factors that might be best observed in the context of a bona fide elongation complex. Any protein that associates solely with nucleic acid has the potential to shift the mobility of the elongation complex. We have found a simple way to test for contact with Pol II. Treatment of the elongation complexes with proteinase K damages the Pol II surface without disrupting all of the ternary complexes. A protein binding solely to a nucleic acid component of the elongation complex should still shift the mobility of the damaged complex, whereas a protein that interacts with the Pol II is less likely to. Equally effective controls might be generated with bacterial or phage polymerases that should generate elongation complexes that are unlikely to interact with Pol II-specific elongation factors. An important characteristic of our elongation complexes is that they do not exhibit the anomalous strand displacement often associated with elongation complexes formed on tailed templates (24Dedrick R.L. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2245-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We chose the specific tail and dinucleotide to initiate transcription because Lang et al. (23Lang W.H. Morrow B.E. Ju Q. Warner J.R. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 527-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) had reported previously that strand displacement did not occur with yeast Pol I, Pol II, or Pol III. The reformation of the DNA duplex on the upstream side of the transcription bubble and the resulting presentation of the nascent transcript will likely be important for analyzing elongation processes involving the nascent transcript. Association of DSIF Is Independent of the CTD—Since our system could distinguish Pol IIA and Pol IIB elongation complexes, we took the opportunity to determine whether the CTD impacted on binding of DSIF. The issue interested us because the CTD has been implicated in regulating the action of DSIF (20Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In collaboration with another factor called NELF, DSIF acts as an inhibitor of elongation. NELF and DSIF were observed to inhibit transcription elongation by Pol IIA and Pol IIB but not by Pol IIO. This is a conundrum because Pol IIB lacks the CTD, while the difference between Pol IIA and Pol IIO suggests that the CTD regulates the action of NELF and DSIF. Our native gel electrophoresis result clearly shows that the CTD is not required for binding of DSIF. Future work will employ this assay to determine how phosphorylation of NELF, DSIF, and Pol II affect the interactions of these components in the context of an elongation complex. A Protein Binding the CTD Triggers Termination—Three independent types of experiments provided evidence that the 8WG16 monoclonal antibody caused termination. This is a surprising observation for several reasons. First, stalled elongation complexes have been observed to be remarkably stable. They resist disruption by a variety of chaotropic treatments including high salt, detergent, heparin, and even proteolysis (31Ackerman S. Bunick D. Zandomeni R. Weinmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 6041-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 37Brown S.A. Imbalzano A.N. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Gnatt A. Fu J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30799-30805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Second, removal of the CTD has not been observed to alter the enzymatic properties of purified Pol II (39Kim W.Y. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18880-18885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the CTD appears to constitute a distinct domain of Pol II. The structure of Pol II deduced from x-ray crystal data reveals that 10 of the subunits form a functioning unit (32Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 40Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 1014-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Two additional subunits, rpb4 and rpb7, dock on the surface (41Armache K.J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 42Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6969-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The CTD is not visible in the x-ray structure indicating that it is unstructured or mobile (36Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The linker region that connects the CTD to the rest of the enzyme projects out from the body of the enzyme suggesting that the CTD is not intimately associated with the rest of the protein. Thus, the situation appears to be one in which an antibody binding to a domain of the enzyme distinct from the domain involved in catalysis triggers disruption of an extremely stable nucleoprotein complex. Understanding how the antibody causes termination of paused complexes requires much more investigation. Learning more about the structure of the CTD within the context of an elongation complex should be enlightening. We are intrigued by reports that the CTD interacts with DNA (43Suzuki M. Nature. 1990; 344: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 44Douziech M. Forget D. Greenblatt J. Coulombe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19868-19873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). If the association of the CTD with DNA is slow, this association might only occur during long pauses, which seems to be a prerequisite for 8WG16-mediated termination. It will also be important to learn where 8WG16 binds the CTD. The binding site could be highly localized in the Drosophila CTD. The CTD of human and yeast Pol II have, respectively, 21 of 52 and 19 of 26 heptads that exactly match the consensus (10Corden J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CTD of Drosophila Pol II only has two heptads that exactly match the consensus (Fig. 6). 8WG16 has been shown to recognize a synthetic peptide composed of three consensus heptads, but no information is available concerning the recognition of heptad repeats deviating from the consensus (26Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Possible Implications for Transcription Termination on Protein-encoding Genes—Previous studies have implicated the CTD in transcription termination in humans (16McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Truncation of the CTD caused the resulting Pol II expressed in human cells to ignore a termination signal. Mutations in specific polyadenylation factors impair termination (46Birse C.E. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lee B.A. Keller W. Proudfoot N.J. Science. 1998; 280: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and two of these factors, Pcf11 and Rna14, associate with the CTD (18Sadowski M. Dichtl B. Hubner W. Keller W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Termination appears to depend on the polyadenylation signal located in the nascent transcript, but recent data indicate that cleavage of the nascent transcript, which is a prerequisite for polyadenylation, is not required for termination (18Sadowski M. Dichtl B. Hubner W. Keller W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 47Tran D.P. Kim S.J. Park N.J. Jew T.M. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7495-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Termination appears to be stochastic once the Pol II has transcribed the polyadenylation signal. Perhaps the polyadenylation signal in the nascent transcript causes a factor bound to the CTD to cue termination by a mechanism that is fortuitously mimicked by the 8WG16 monoclonal antibody. We thank Michael Sypes for providing the Pol II used in the early phases of this project and all members of the Gilmour laboratory for commenting on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2125391492,"The relative amount of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) and its crucial inhibitor phospholamban (PLN) are closely regulated and play a pivotal role in maintaining muscle function. The functional importance of PLN has been intensively investigated in cardiac muscle. However, little is known about the role of PLN in the slow-twitch skeletal muscle, which expresses a significantly lower level of PLN but a similar level of SERCA2a compared with cardiac muscle. Thus, to define the physiological significance of PLN in slow-twitch skeletal muscle, we generated transgenic mice with PLN-specific overexpression in soleus, which is largely composed of slow-muscle fibers. The PLN protein levels and the PLN/SERCA2a ratio in transgenic soleus were comparable with those in cardiac muscle. Assessment of isometric-twitch contractions indicated that PLN overexpression was associated with depressed rates of contraction and relaxation, which were not linked to reduced SERCA2a abundance, although the levels of other key Ca2+-handling proteins, including ryanodine receptor, FKBP12, and L-type Ca2+ channel, were significantly decreased. However, isoproterenol stimulation reversed the inhibitory effects of PLN on the transgenic soleus twitch kinetics. Furthermore, the PLN-overexpressing soleus had smaller muscle size, mass, and cross-sectional area compared with wild-types. Interestingly, the percentage of slow fibers was increased in PLN-overexpressing soleus. Taken together, these findings indicate that increased PLN expression in slow-twitch skeletal muscle is associated with impaired contractile function and muscle remodeling."

Therefore, it is still unclear how specific elements of the αIIb subunit contribute to integrin αIIbβ3 function. Here we describe a refined model of the αIIb N-terminal portion of integrin αIIbβ3 obtained by using the αVβ3 template combined with a new method for predicting the conformations of the unique αIIb loop regions comprising residues 71-85, 114-125, and 148-164.

A three-dimensional model of this protein was first proposed from homology modeling using the β subunit of the G-protein transducin as a template (4Kamata T. Tieu K.K. Irie A. Springer T.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44274-44283Google Scholar). Subsequently, the crystal structures of a cognate template (αVβ3) (5Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Google Scholar, 6Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. French M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Google Scholar) with higher identity in sequence between αV and αIIb (∼40%) as compared with transducin (∼19%) enabled the construction of more accurate overall three-dimensional models of αIIbβ3 (7Arnaout M.A. Goodman S.L. Xiong J.-P. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2002; 14: 641-651Google Scholar, 8Mitchell W.B. Li J.H. Singh F. Michelson A.D. Bussel J. Coller B.S. French D.L. Blood. 2003; 101: 2268-2276Google Scholar) using standard homology-based modeling techniques. The αVβ3 crystallographic data support the folding of the N terminus of αIIb into a seven-blade β-propeller, as was originally predicted by Springer (9Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Google Scholar), and identify the propeller as the major site of interaction between αIIb and β3. However, αIIb differs from αV in loop regions that are strategically located with regard to interaction with β3 and ligand binding, and standard homology-based modeling techniques do not usually provide accurate prediction of the structures of non-conserved loops. In particular, the αIIb N-terminal region contains three interacting non-conserved loop regions (residues 71-85, 114-125, and 148-164) that deserve special attention for their position in the integrin complex. Loops 114-125 and 148-164 are located at the interface between the αIIb and β3 subunits, and loop 71-85 is in proximity to, and thus potentially influences, loop 114-125.In general, segments (or loop regions) connecting elements of defined secondary structure in proteins are likely to be the more flexible portions of the structure. This flexibility can impart significant functional roles to these loops, allowing their structural adaptation during interaction with other regions of the protein, with ligands, or with other molecules. For this same reason, however, these segments are also more difficult to predict by homology and, in many cases, are difficult to resolve by high resolution crystallographic techniques due to their large thermal fluctuations or crystal disorder (10Hassan S.A. Mehler E.L. Weinstein H. Lecture Notes in Computational Science. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2002: 197-231Google Scholar). Thus, the three αIIb loops we have chosen for structural refinement are likely to contribute significantly to the unique features of αIIbβ3, and their conformational preferences may be difficult to establish even with the benefit of crystallographic data.We present here a refined model of an initial αIIb structure obtained from a homology modeling protocol based on the αVβ3 crystal structure (5Xiong J.-P.

Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Google Scholar). Specifically, an ab initio molecular mechanics structure prediction method recently developed (10Hassan S.A. Mehler E.L. Weinstein H. Lecture Notes in Computational Science. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2002: 197-231Google Scholar) and evaluated (11Mehler E.L. Periole X. Hassan S.A. Weinstein H. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2002; 16: 841-853Google Scholar, 12Hassan S.A. Guarnieri F. Mehler E.L. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 6478-6489Google Scholar) in our laboratory was employed to explore the conformational space of the three flexible loop regions of αIIb described above. The method uses the CHARMM PAR22 force field in conjunction with the screened coulomb potential-implicit solvent model (SCP-ISM) 1The abbreviations used are: SCP-ISM, screened coulomb potential-implicit solvent model; SA, simulated annealing; SCV, scaled collective variables; MC, Monte Carlo; mAb, monoclonal antibody. for electrostatics. The refined model of the N-terminal portion of αIIb obtained by using this computational method was then validated experimentally. In particular, the intermolecular contact between Lys-118 of αIIb and Glu-171 of β3, predicted by our model but not a standard homology model, was supported by cross-linking of the corresponding cysteine mutants. In the absence of a high resolution experimental structure of the αIIbβ3 complex, we propose the refined model presented here as a structural context to generate experimentally testable hypotheses and guide the design of future experiments to explore the functional roles of key structural elements.MATERIALS AND METHODSExperimental ProceduresGeneration of cDNA Construct—pEF-αIIb, pCDNA3.1-β3, pEF-αIIbR320C, and pCDNA3.1-β3 R563C were a generous gift from Drs. Junichi Takagi and Timothy Springer, Harvard Medical School. Vectors containing the cysteine mutants of αIIb Lys-118 and β3 Glu-171, pEF-αIIbK118C and pCDNA3.1-β3 E171C, were generated using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), as per the manufacturer's instructions.Stable Cell Lines Generation—HEK 293 cells were transfected with either normal or mutant cDNA using PerFectin (Gene Therapy System, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, cells were selected in media containing 500 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. To obtain a population of cells expressing higher levels of human and chimeric receptors, cells were labeled with the mAb 10E5 (αIIbβ3-specific) (13Coller B.S. Peerschke E.I. Scudder L.E. Sullivan C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 325-338Google Scholar) and sorted using a FACScalibur cell sorter (BD Biosciences).Flow Cytometry—Cells (4-6 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled 10E5 antibody (labeling as per the manufacturer's protocol; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (5 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum, and analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Background controls were cells transfected with pEF-αIIb and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled 10E5.Biochemical Analysis of the Receptors—To vectorially label surface molecules, 106 resuspended cells/ml were incubated on ice for 30 min with sulfo-N-hydroxyl-succinimido biotin (1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) (Pierce). The reaction was stopped by adding glycine (5 mm final concentration), and then the cells were lysed with buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (protease inhibitors mixture set III; Calbiochem). Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and supernatants were precleared with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 30 min. Immunoprecipitations were performed using mAb 10E5 (8 μg/ml). Protein G-Sepharose (5%) was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and then the bound protein was eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 100 °C. Samples (reduced and nonreduced) were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel) and electro-transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and washed. To identify biotin-labeled cell surface proteins immunoprecipitated by mAb 10E5, the membranes were hybridized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed and developed using chemiluminescence, as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).Computational ApproachThe refined three-dimensional model of the N-terminal portion of the αIIb subunit of integrin αIIbβ3 proposed here was built in two steps. First, a standard homology modeling-based approach using the crystal structure of the cognate template αVβ3 was employed to obtain an initial three-dimensional model of the αIIbβ3 β-propeller domain. Second, an ab initio molecular mechanics structure prediction method was used to refine the three non-conserved loop regions (residues 71-85, 114-125, and 148-164 of human αIIb) of the N-terminal portion of the αIIb subunit discussed above.Construction of an Initial Three-dimensional Model of the β-Propeller Domain of Integrin αIIbβ3—The initial three-dimensional model of the αIIb N-terminal portion (residues 1-451) of αIIbβ3 was based on homology with the αV subunit (residues 1-438) of integrin αVβ3 (sequence identity of 41%), for which atomic coordinates are available from x-ray crystallography (5Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Google Scholar, 6Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. French M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Google Scholar), using MODELLER Release 6 (salilab.org/modeller/modeller.html) (14Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Google Scholar, 15Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Google Scholar) and the sequence alignment shown in Fig. 1. The resulting model of αIIb-(1-451) was then used to replace the corresponding segment of αV within the known structure of αVβ3 in complex with a cyclic peptide containing the prototypical RGD sequence found in a number of integrin ligands (7Arnaout M.A. Goodman S.L. Xiong J.-P. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2002; 14: 641-651Google Scholar) to obtain a three-dimensional model of the ligand-bound N-terminal portion of integrin αIIbβ3, including αIIb-(1-451) and β3-(109-352).Refinement of the Structure of αIIb-(1-451)—The three non-conserved loops 71-85, 114-125, and 148-164 of the N-terminal portion of integrin αIIb were refined using the molecular mechanics ab initio computational method that we have recently developed to predict the structures of flexible loop regions in proteins (10Hassan S.A. Mehler E.L. Weinstein H. Lecture Notes in Computational Science. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2002: 197-231Google Scholar). Details of this method and its application are reported elsewhere (10Hassan S.A. Mehler E.L. Weinstein H. Lecture Notes in Computational Science. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2002: 197-231Google Scholar).Briefly, the method employs simulated annealing Monte Carlo (SAMC) simulations combined with biased scaled collective variables (SCV) Monte Carlo techniques (SCV-MC), which were specially designed to model segments with 8-13 amino acid residues that include parts of the defined secondary structure motifs to which they are attached. The higher yield isotropic trial moves performed in the space of the scaled collective variables correspond to anisotropic trial moves in the space of the (real) dihedral angles (for details of the methodology, see Refs. 10Hassan S.A. Mehler E.L. Weinstein H. Lecture Notes in Computational Science. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2002: 197-231Google Scholar and 11Mehler E.L. Periole X. Hassan S.A. Weinstein H. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2002; 16: 841-853Google Scholar)). To incorporate solvent effects, the method uses a continuum electrostatic model based on screened coulomb potentials (SCP-ISM) (12Hassan S.A. Guarnieri F. Mehler E.L. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 6478-6489Google Scholar). The screening function used in the SCP-ISM and the theoretical and experimental basis of its form have been discussed and illustrated in detail (12Hassan S.A. Guarnieri F. Mehler E.L. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 6478-6489Google Scholar, 16Hassan S.A. Guarnieri F. Mehler E.L. J. Phys. Chem. 2000; 104: 6490Google Scholar, 17Hassan S.A. Mehler E.L. Proteins. 2002; 47: 45-61Google Scholar). In this ISM approach, the electrostatic representation of the protein in the solvent is determined by following a standard thermodynamic path in which the protein particles are first solvated individually and subsequently brought together to form the solvated protein. General expressions for the electrostatic, ESCP and the polar component of the solvation free energies for macromolecules, ΔGVspol, are derived from this model. The work done in each step is evaluated, and the total electrostatic energy ESCP of the macromolecule (or “effective energy” in the nomenclature of Ref. 18Lazaridis T. Karplus M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 139-145Google Scholar) is calculated (non-electrostatic effects are treated separately). The electrostatic energy is calculated from the equation, ESCP=12∑i=jnqiqjD(rij)rij+12∑i=1nqi2Ri,B[1D(Ri,B)−1]where qi are the partial charges of the particle i, n is the total number of atoms in the protein, D(r) are the screening functions of the electrostatic interactions within the protein in the solvent, and Ri,B are the effective Born radii of the atom i in the protein, estimated as described in Refs. 12Hassan S.A. Guarnieri F. Mehler E.L. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 6478-6489Google Scholar, 16Hassan S.A. Guarnieri F. Mehler E.L. J. Phys. Chem. 2000; 104: 6490Google Scholar, 17Hassan S.A. Mehler E.L. Proteins. 2002; 47: 45-61Google Scholar, and 19Hassan S.A. Mehler E.L. Zhang D. Weinstein H. Proteins. 2003; 51: 109-125Google Scholar. Since a special treatment of hydrogen bonds has been shown to be necessary when continuum models are used (12Hassan S.A. Guarnieri F. Mehler E.L. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 6478-6489Google Scholar, 16Hassan S.A. Guarnieri F. Mehler E.L. J. Phys. Chem. 2000; 104: 6490Google Scholar), the short range donor-acceptor interactions were stabilized in the SCP-ISM independently of the strength of the long range electrostatic interactions that are controlled by the macroscopic screening D(r). The algorithm developed in the SCP-ISM stabilizes each single donor-acceptor partner available in the protein according to experimental hydrogen bond values, and a geometrical dependence of these interactions is introduced based on the state of hybridization of both acceptor and donor groups (16Hassan S.A. Guarnieri F. Mehler E.L. J. Phys. Chem. 2000; 104: 6490Google Scholar). Hydrophobic interactions (including entropic effects of the solvent and energy of cavity formation) are treated as a term proportional to the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of the molecule, i.e. Ehp = α + βSASA, where α and β are parameters usually obtained by fitting to solvation energies of hydrocarbons.To refine the three loop regions 71-85, 114-125, and 148-164 of the N-terminal portion of integrin αIIb, the procedure consisted of a first SA-MC phase followed by three distinct SCV-MC simulations. The first SA-MC phase of the method explored the conformational space for each fully solvated loop, tethered at the N terminus to a rigid protein segment of similar length. The internal structural preferences of each loop, including the effect on local folding of the region of the protein that is attached to the N terminus, were identified in this phase. The starting temperature in the SA-MC simulations performed was T = 3000 K, and the final temperature was T = 300 K. The three loop regions were initially placed in their extended conformations. A logarithmic schedule was used for the annealing in which the temperature was decreased in 12 steps. Trial moves of 29,000, 22,500, and 30,000 per temperature for loops 71-85, 114-125, and 148-164, respectively, were performed by selecting at random two dihedral angles (backbone or side chain) of the segment. 10 independent runs were performed for each segment, and structures were collected at the final temperature of 300 K. Specifically, 1148 different conformations were identified for loop 148-164, 768 were identified for loop 114-125, and 1106 were identified for loop 71-85. 100 representative conformations were selected from each of these three sets based on root mean square deviation values calculated among all conformations within a specific set (for details of the procedure, see Ref. 10Hassan S.A. Mehler E.L. Weinstein H. Lecture Notes in Computational Science. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2002: 197-231Google Scholar). These representative conformations were considered as potential candidates to fold into the native structure of the segment in the following steps of the protocol.In the subsequent phase of the method, a first application of SCV-MC drove the C terminus of each representative loop conformation toward its final attachment point by using an adjustable harmonic constraint protocol imposed on the dummy residue attached to the C terminus. Starting with a force constant k = 0, an SCV-MC simulation at T = 300 K was carried out for each of the representative conformations obtained previously to relax the peptide around the closest local minimum in the free energy surface. This first simulation allowed the initial conformation of the segment to adjust to the characteristics of the new environment while partially preserving its intrinsic structural conformation calculated in the first step. The eigenvalues of the Hessian were updated twice to maintain the acceptance rate in the range 0.3-0.5; a total of 7000 SCV-MC steps were performed. Next, the harmonic constant k was increased in successive steps to facilitate the shift of the C terminus toward the attachment point. The migration of the conformations of the segment from its intrinsic folding to its “closed” folding was simulated with the SCV-MC for each particular value of the harmonic constant k. For each k, the simulation protocol was the same as described above for k = 0, with an acceptance rate maintained in the range 0.3-0.5 in all cases. In previous calculations, it was observed that a power schedule of the form k = 10m-6 kcal/mol/Å2, where m is an integer that represents the successive increment of the constant k (m = 1,..., 10), was appropriate in practice to slowly close the segments, and the same protocol was followed here.After performing 250 minimization steps to eliminate bad contacts that could remain after the SCV-MC simulation, the closed conformations of each loop were sorted by energy. The lowest energy conformations within a 5 kcal/mol range were then selected for each loop. Specifically, the procedure yielded three different conformations for loop 71-85, 5 for loop 114-125 and six different conformations for loop 148-164 within this energy range. Assembly of all of these conformations into the protein yielded 90 (= 6 × 5 × 3) different conformations of the three interacting loops in the αIIb-(1-451) subunit. A second application of SCV-MC, using the same protocol described above for the first SCV-MC simulation, allowed relaxation of the three interacting loops in the environment created by the native protein and the solvent, where all the loops could move and interact simultaneously. This step produced the optimized structure of the αIIb-(1-451) subunit with the three refined loops, which was then used to replace the initial model of αIIb in the N-terminal portion of the αIIbβ3 complex. Specifically, this optimized structure corresponded to the lowest energy conformation among the 90 structures that were relaxed using SCV-MC.The three interacting loops of the αIIb-(1-451) optimized structure were subjected to a final relaxation process in the presence of the β3-(109-352) subunit by a third application of SCV-MC, using the same protocol reported above. The protein side chains of the resulting conformation of the αIIb-(1-451)-β3-(109-352) complex were then energy-minimized using a few steps of steepest descent followed by conjugated gradient.RESULTSStructural Features of the Refined αIIb-(1-451) Model—Fig. 2 shows a superposition of the αVβ3 crystal structure (in magenta) in complex with the RGD peptide (colored by atom code) with our proposed model of the αIIb-(1-451)-β3-(109-352) complex (green for αIIb and red for β3). The three refined nonconserved loops of the αIIb subunit are shown in brown (loop 71-85), orange (loop 114-125), and blue (loop 148-164). The refined model of the N-terminal portion of αIIb differs from a standard homology modeling-based structure in the conformational preferences of loops 71-85, 114-125, and 148-164. Interestingly, αIIb residues that, in the refined model, are involved in intermolecular interactions with the “specificity-determining loop” (SDL) of the β3 subunit (residues 159-188 in human β3) were not predicted to be located at the interface between the subunits in a previous model obtained from standard homology modeling. However, the predictions of α-β intermolecular contacts are key to understanding the biogenesis and function of the receptor. Most importantly, the predictions are amenable to experimental verification that can test the validity of the refined αIIb model proposed here.Fig. 2Superposition of the αVβ3 crystal structure (magenta) in complex with RGD (colored by atom code) with our proposed model of the αIIb-(1-451)-β3 (109-352) complex (green for αIIb and red for β3). The three refined interacting loops of the αIIb subunit are shown in brown (loop 71-85), orange (114-125), and blue (148-164).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Validation of the Refined Model—Among the intermolecular interactions predicted using our refined model was the interaction between αIIb Lys-118 and β3 Glu-171. As shown in Fig. 3, in our refined model of the N-terminal portion of αIIb (in light blue), the location of Lys-118 allows it to form a salt bridge with β3 Glu-171, whereas in a standard homology modeling-based model built using MODELLER 6.0 (in magenta), Lys-118 is far away from the interface. To test the validity of this predicted intermolecular interaction, we reasoned that the proximity of these residues could be determined by substituting them with cysteines and testing their ability to form disulfide bonding between αIIb and β3. A similar strategy was recently employed by Takagi et al. (20Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Google Scholar) to demonstrate the proximity of αIIb Arg-320 to β3 Arg-563, and this construct was used as a control.Fig. 3Comparison of the positions of αIIb Lys-118 in the αIIb models produced by a standard homology modeling-based approach using MODELLER 6.0 and the ab initio structural prediction method used here. The adjacent region of β3 is shown in red on the right with Glu-171 indicated. The 114-125 loop built using the standard homology modeling-based approach is shown as a thin magenta line, and Lys-118 is labeled in magenta (left). The refined αIIb model is depicted in ribbon format in light blue, and Lys-118 is labeled in light blue (right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4 demonstrates that when we mutated both αIIb Lys-118 and β3 Glu-171 to cysteines, the resulting heterodimer was expressed on HEK 293 cells, as judged from mAb 10E5 binding. The level of 10E5 binding to the mutant construct was comparable with that of cells transfected with normal human αIIb and β3 or cells transfected with αIIb R320C and β3 R563C.Fig. 4A, binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-10E5 to cells transfected with αIIb alone (Mock), αIIbβ3, αIIb R320C β3 R563C, or αIIb K118C β3 E171C.

Samples were electrophoresed under nonreduced and reduced conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)When biotin-labeled surface proteins from cells transfected with normal human αIIbβ3 were immunoprecipitated with mAb 10E5 and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the αIIb and β3 subunits demonstrated their typical patterns of migration under nonreducing conditions (αIIb ∼140 kDa, β3 ∼90 kDa) and reducing conditions (αIIb ∼120 kDa, β3 ∼110 kDa). In contrast, and consistent with the previous report by Takagi et al. (20Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Google Scholar), the αIIb R320C-β3 R563C heterodimer migrated under nonreducing conditions as a dimer of ∼230 kDa; with reduction of disulfide bonds, the dimer disappeared, and the individual subunits migrated at approximately their expected positions (∼120 and 110 kDa, respectively). Therefore, the dimer obtained under nonreducing conditions likely reflects a disulfide bond between αIIb R320C and β3 R563C. The results with αIIb K118C and β3 E171C are nearly identical to those with αIIb R320C and β3 R563C, with the presence of a dimer under nonreducing conditions and the individual chains under reducing conditions. To assess whether the cross-linking was actually occurring between the αIIb Cys-118 and β3 Cys-171, we tested the ability of antibody 7E3 to immunoprecipitate the complex since we have recently localized the 7E3 epitope to an adjacent region in β3 including the Cys-177-Cys-184 loop and Trp-129 (21Artoni A.
