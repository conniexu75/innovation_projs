https://openalex.org/W2029496299,"FOLLOWING the US and USSR atmospheric test series in 1954–1962, numerous microbarograph records1–8 of air waves generated by nuclear bomb tests were published. Previous theoretical interpretations7,9 of such waveforms have required some explicit knowledge of the average atmospheric temperature and wind profiles above the path connecting source to microbarograph. Such profiles are never sufficiently well known and vary from point to point, and as seemingly small changes in the profiles cause relatively large changes in the waveforms, it would seem to be difficult to estimate the explosion energy yield to even order of magnitude accuracy from such records. Recently, however, in a further account of this work to be published elsewhere, we have succeeded in deriving an approximate theoretical relationship between certain waveform features and energy yield which is insensitive to changes in atmospheric structure. This relationship is given by where E is energy release, pFPT is the first peak to trough pressure amplitude (see Fig. 1), re is radius of the Earth, r is the great circle distance from burst point to observation point, Hs is a lower atmosphere scale height, c is a representative sound speed, and T1,2 is the time interval between first and second peaks. The purpose of the present communication is to describe the extent to which the above relation agrees with the existing available data."

https://openalex.org/W1998116405,"AN estimation of the body height of two robust australopithecines (Sk 82 and Sk 97) is attempted here on the basis of a ratio between femoral head diameter and body height in modern Homo sapiens. Coon, using the fibula and tibia from the “Zinjanthropus” living floor at Olduvai, has estimated1 three different heights for this creature or creatures: 144.5 cm (4 feet 8 inches; 136 cm (4 feet 6 inches); and 152.4 cm (5 feet). Lovejoy and Heiple, using specimens from Sterk-fontein (STS 14, STS 34 and TM 1513), have reconstructed2 a height for the gracile australopithecines at 106.7 cm–109.2 cm (3 feet 6 inches–3 feet 7 inches). An estimation has never been made, however, for the height of an undisputed robust australopithecine."

https://openalex.org/W1995874951,"X-RAY measurements and limits on the Coma and Virgo clusters of galaxies have been said to limit the mass of hot gas in them to 2% of the amount required for stabilization according to the virial theorem1. Such a conclusion is strongly dependent on the value of the Hubble constant H0. The linear diameter of the cluster D and the cluster mass M, estimated by the virial theorem, each vary as H0−1. Therefore, the density ρ has the dependence ρ∼H02. The predicted X-ray flux F from this gas is ∼ρM/R2, where R is the distance to the cluster. R varies as H0−1. We therefore have the relation Meekins et al.1 appear to have used the value H0 = 95 km s−1 Mpc−1 found by van den Bergh2, because they took R= 70 Mpc. If Abell's value3H0 = 47 is used, the predicted flux is reduced by a factor of 0.12. A reduction of H0 to a value as low as 20 is not inconceivable. Although clumpiness increases F/M2, the presence of helium as a mass fraction f reduces F for fixed M in the ratio (1–½f)."
