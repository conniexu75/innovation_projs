https://openalex.org/W2119807130,"The c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) is activated when cells are exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, the functional consequence of JNK activation in UV-irradiated cells has not been established. It is shown here that JNK is required for UV-induced apoptosis in primary murine embryonic fibroblasts. Fibroblasts with simultaneous targeted disruptions of all the functional Jnk genes were protected against UV-stimulated apoptosis. The absence of JNK caused a defect in the mitochondrial death signaling pathway, including the failure to release cytochrome c. These data indicate that mitochondria are influenced by proapoptotic signal transduction through the JNK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2013150886,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can provide maps of brain activation with millimeter spatial resolution but is limited in its temporal resolution to the order of seconds. Here, we describe a technique that combines structural and functional MRI with magnetoencephalography (MEG) to obtain spatiotemporal maps of human brain activity with millisecond temporal resolution. This new technique was used to obtain dynamic statistical parametric maps of cortical activity during semantic processing of visually presented words. An initial wave of activity was found to spread rapidly from occipital visual cortex to temporal, parietal, and frontal areas within 185 ms, with a high degree of temporal overlap between different areas. Repetition effects were observed in many of the same areas following this initial wave of activation, providing evidence for the involvement of feedback mechanisms in repetition priming."
https://openalex.org/W2043141000,"To determine why proteasome inhibitors prevent thymocyte death, we examined whether proteasomes degrade anti-apoptotic molecules in cells induced to undergo apoptosis. The c-IAP1 and XIAP inhibitors of apoptosis were selectively lost in glucocorticoid- or etoposide-treated thymocytes in a proteasome-dependent manner before death. IAPs catalyzed their own ubiquitination in vitro, an activity requiring the RING domain. Overexpressed wild-type c-IAP1, but not a RING domain mutant, was spontaneously ubiquitinated and degraded, and stably expressed XIAP lacking the RING domain was relatively resistant to apoptosis-induced degradation and, correspondingly, more effective at preventing apoptosis than wild-type XIAP. Autoubiquitination and degradation of IAPs may be a key event in the apoptotic program."
https://openalex.org/W2017193677,"Zn2+ is present at high concentrations in the synaptic vesicles of hippocampal mossy fibers. We have used Zn2+ chelators and the mocha mutant mouse to address the physiological role of Zn2+ in this pathway. Zn2+ is not involved in the unique presynaptic plasticities observed at mossy fiber synapses but is coreleased with glutamate from these synapses, both spontaneously and with electrical stimulation, where it exerts a strong modulatory effect on the NMDA receptors. Zn2+ tonically occupies the high-affinity binding site of NMDA receptors at mossy fiber synapses, whereas the lower affinity voltage-dependent Zn2+ binding site is occupied during action potential driven-release. We conclude that Zn2+ is a modulatory neurotransmitter released from mossy fiber synapses and plays an important role in shaping the NMDA receptor response at these synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2057761743,"The most obvious conclusion from this survey is that neuronal signaling proteins, for the most part, have been highly conserved throughout evolution. Despite the dramatic differences in complexity and organization of nervous systems and behavioral outputs in worms, flies, and mammals, the key proteins, and presumably the functional mechanisms they govern, are remarkably similar. Apparently, the basic framework for neuronal signaling and synaptic organization was completed early in metazoan evolution, and evolution of much more complicated nervous systems did not entail extensive alteration of this framework. Thus, genomic analysis fully confirms the belief that one can obtain fundamental neurobiological insights from studies of simple model organisms.Still, at this point, it is easier to catalog the information obtained from sequence analysis than to decipher all the functional implications. It is not in any way apparent, for example, why C. elegans, with only 302 neurons, encodes more than 90 K+ channels. Drosophila with a nominally more complex nervous system and behavioral repertoire has a set of only about 30 K+ channel genes. Indeed, most ion channel gene families contain more members in worms than flies. Apparently, increased behavioral complexity does not require an increase in molecular complexity but may depend instead on increases in the number of neurons and the complexity of the wiring diagram. Although somewhat counterintuitive, a greater number of ion channels may be required in worms than flies to provide its simple nervous system with the potential for more extensive signaling capabilities than would otherwise be possible.With the identification in this analysis of new channel subfamilies, it is likely that all the major classes of channel pore-forming subunits have now been described and the complete set of evolutionarily conserved ion channels has been defined. Although this would not have been obvious a priori, there is a striking difference between ion channel pore-forming subunits and auxiliary subunits with respect to evolutionary conservation. With the exception of Ca2+ channels, very few of the accessory subunits identified in mammals have homologous counterparts in worms or flies. The acquisition of novel ion channel subunits that modify the biophysical properties of pore-forming subunits may represent one way of adding additional functional complexity to the basic set of channels.It remains an open question whether the more complex nervous systems of vertebrates, particularly mammals, employ any signaling mechanisms that are fundamentally different from those in invertebrates. If so, the strong conservation of the basic set of signaling proteins argues that these mechanisms either depend on an unknown set of proteins or involve the same components that can be incorporated into novel molecular and cellular networks that generate unique functions and outputs.From the perspective of the genome, it seems safe to predict that elucidation of the fundamental molecular mechanisms of neuronal signaling applicable to all organisms will continue to derive enormous benefit from invertebrate model systems. With future emphasis on understanding the distinctive in vivo functions of the array of proteins now defined only by sequence, the availability of forward and reverse genetic techniques in worms and flies will continue to be of critical importance. The identification of the entire set of ion channels and neuronal signaling proteins opens up a new era in which neurobiologists can work back from the complete gene set toward an understanding of how they function to produce behavior.‡To whom correspondence should be addressed (e-mail: troy@mit.edu)."
https://openalex.org/W2052296894,"Studies of the neural correlates of short-term memory in a wide variety of brain areas have found that transient inputs can cause persistent changes in rates of action potential firing, through a mechanism that remains unknown. In a premotor area that is responsible for holding the eyes still during fixation, persistent neural firing encodes the angular position of the eyes in a characteristic manner: below a threshold position the neuron is silent, and above it the firing rate is linearly related to position. Both the threshold and linear slope vary from neuron to neuron. We have reproduced this behavior in a biophysically plausible network model. Persistence depends on precise tuning of the strength of synaptic feedback, and a relatively long synaptic time constant improves the robustness to mistuning."
https://openalex.org/W2149476505,Human herpesviruses are large and structurally complex viruses that cause a variety of diseases. The three-dimensional structure of the herpesvirus capsid has been determined at 8.5 angstrom resolution by electron cryomicroscopy. More than 30 putative α helices were identified in the four proteins that make up the 0.2 billion–dalton shell. Some of these helices are located at domains that undergo conformational changes during capsid assembly and DNA packaging. The unique spatial arrangement of the heterotrimer at the local threefold positions accounts for the asymmetric interactions with adjacent capsid components and the unusual co-dependent folding of its subunits.
https://openalex.org/W2098576607,"A growing number of reports suggest that elevated levels of extracellular Alzheimer's β-amyloid protein alter the homeostasis of free [Ca2+]i in different cell types of the mammalian brain. In line with these results, we have previously shown that AβP[1–40] forms cation-selective channels (Ca2+ included) across artificial planar bilayers formed from acidic phospholipids and across excised membrane patches from immortalized hypothalamic GnRH neurons (GT1-7 cells), suggesting that the nonregulated Ca2+-influx through these spontaneously formed “amyloid channels” may provide a mechanism to explain its toxicity (1.Kawahara M. Arispe N. Kuroda Y. Rojas E. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 67-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We have now found and report here that the application of AβP[1–40] to GT1-7 neurons consistently elevates [Ca2+]i levels. We also found that human islet amylin and the prion protein fragment (PrP106–126), peptides that acquire β-pleated sheet conformation in water solutions and have been reported to form ion channels across planar bilayer membranes, also increase cytosolic free calcium in GT1-7 neurons. Searching for protective agents, we found that soluble cholesterol, known to decrease the fluidity of the cell membrane, inhibits AβP[1–40]-evoked [Ca2+]i rise. These results suggest that unregulated Ca2+ entry across amyloid channels may be a common mechanism causing cell death, not only in diseases of the third age, including Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, but also in prion-induced diseases.

These results suggest that unregulated Ca2+ entry across amyloid channels may be a common mechanism causing cell death, not only in diseases of the third age, including Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, but also in prion-induced diseases. Alzheimer's disease amyloid β-protein Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is a dementia characterized by the loss of mental and physical functions and the presence in the brain of protein deposits called extracellular plaques and intracellular aggregates called fibril tangles (2.Kosik K.S. Science. 1992; 256: 780-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 3.Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). The principal constituents of these deposits are peptides, 39–43 residues long, termed amyloid β-proteins (AβP), that exhibit distinct domains that acquire β-pleated sheet structure and α-helical architecture. These peptides originate from the proteolytic degradation by secretases of the amyloid precursor protein defined by a locus on chromosome 21 (4.Tanzi R.E. Gusella J.F. Watkins P.C. Bruns G.A.P. St. George-Hyslop P. Van Keuren M.L. Patterson D. Pagan S. Kurnit D.M. Neve R.L. Science. 1987; 235: 880-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 5.Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). It is well established that β-amyloid peptides in water solutions acquire β-pleated sheet architecture and form insoluble aggregates. Earlier studies showed that application of AβP[1–40] to either primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons (6.Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar) or hippocampal slice cultures (7.Malouf A.T. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) had toxic effects. These results provide support for the idea that AβP[1–40] might be the causal agent of neuronal death in AD (8.Kowall N.C. McKee A.C. Yankner B.A. Beal M.F Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Interestingly, islets of Langerhans of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, which like AD is an age-dependent disease, also exhibit protein deposits. The major constituent of the pancreatic islet plaques is an amyloid peptide termed amylin (9.Moore C.X. Cooper G.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that human islet amylin (37-amino acid residues), found in protein deposits within islets of Langerhans of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is toxic to both cultured islet cells (10.Lorenzo A. Razzaboni B. Weir G.C. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) and rat hippocampal neurons (11.May P.C. Boggs L.N. Fuson K.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2330-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and also induces apoptosis in rat cortical neurons (12.Tucker H.M. Rydel R.E. Estus S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although there is ∼93.5% sequence homology between human and rat amylin, the latter peptide was found to be without effect on pancreatic islet cells. As to the mechanism by which amylin is toxic, it has been recently shown that human amylin forms ion channels across planar lipid bilayer membranes, but rat amylin does not (13.Mirzabekov T.A. Lin M. Kagan B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1988-1992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that AβP[1–40] also form cation channels across planar bilayers formed from negatively charged phospholipids (14.Arispe N. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 15.Arispe N. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, other results (17.Cooper G.J. Leighton B. Dimitriadis G.D. Parry-Billings M. Kowalchuk J.M. Howland K. Rothbard J.B. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7763-7766Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 18.Cooper G.J. Day A.J. Willis A.C. Roberts A.N. Reid K.B. Leighton B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1014: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) suggest that amylin and toxicity may involve the formation of unregulated cation channels across the membrane of susceptible cells. Recent reports support the idea that amyloid peptides play a key role in cell death in pancreatic islet β-cell (10.Lorenzo A. Razzaboni B. Weir G.C. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 13.Mirzabekov T.A. Lin M. Kagan B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1988-1992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and in neuronal death (1.Kawahara M. Arispe N. Kuroda Y. Rojas E. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 67-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11.May P.C. Boggs L.N. Fuson K.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2330-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12.Tucker H.M. Rydel R.E. Estus S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because AβP peptides are released to the extracellular space of the brain of normal subjects (19.Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Esh F. Lee M. Dovey L. Davis D. Sinha S. Schlossmacher J. Whaley J. Swindlehurst C. McCormack R Selkoe D. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Nature. 1992; 259: 325-327Crossref Scopus (1611) Google Scholar), it remains to be established which factors are expressed in the senile brain that transform specific neurons and make them susceptible to amyloid β-protein. Furthermore, owing to the fact that amylin is co-secreted together with insulin in normal islets (9.Moore C.X. Cooper G.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we may also ask what makes the pancreatic β-cell susceptible to amylin. As the search for the cause(s) of AD progresses, it has become evident that more than one factor is responsible for each modality of AD. Gene mutations account for changes in the phenotype of specific proteins linked with a modality of AD. It has been suggested that β-amyloid peptides may induce oxidative stress altering catecholamine metabolism in the brain. Fraser et al. (20.Fraser S.P. Suh Y.-H. Djamgoz M.B.A. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 67-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and Matson et al. (21.Matson M.P. Cheng B. Davis D. Bryant K. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 376-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had already proposed that β-amyloid peptides destabilize Ca2+ homeostasis in neurons. Although the mechanism by which specific brain cells can become susceptible to free AβP peptides remains to be elucidated, we suggested that the ability of AβP[1–40] to form unregulated cation-selective channels across the plasma membrane of susceptible cells could explain amyloid toxicity (14.Arispe N. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 15.Arispe N. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10573-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 16.Arispe N. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In support of this model, we showed that AβP[1–40] also forms cation-selective channels across excised membrane patches from immortalized hypothalamic GnRH neurons (1.Kawahara M. Arispe N. Kuroda Y. Rojas E. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 67-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) in accord with other studies on a different neuronal tissue (20.Fraser S.P. Suh Y.-H. Djamgoz M.B.A. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 67-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21.Matson M.P. Cheng B. Davis D. Bryant K. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 376-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of AβP peptides in water solution is their ability to acquire β-pleated sheet architecture, a conformation that is crucial for the formation of cation-selective channels (22.Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Arispe N. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2137-2145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 23.Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In line with the cation channel hypothesis, we now show that not only brain β-amyloid and islet amylin but also prion peptides induce substantial [Ca2+]i elevations in GT1-7 neuronal cell line. Prion peptides originate from the conversion of cellular prion protein (PrPC) to the pathogenic form (PrPSC) and are associated with several diseases, including scrapie, Kuru disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (23.Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In a previous study, Forloni et al. (24.Forloni G. Chiesa R. Smiroldo S. Verga L. Salmona M. Tagliavini F. Angeretti N. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 506-516Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar) showed that PrP106–126 induces cell death in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, it has been recently shown that a 21-amino acid synthetic fragment of the prion protein PrP106–126, which has no homology in its sequence with those of AβP[1–40] and amylin, exhibits β-pleated sheet structure in water and also forms ion channels across planar lipid bilayer membranes (25.Lin M.C. Mirzabekov T. Kagan B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 44-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In this study, we compare the effects of different amyloid peptides on the intracellular free calcium concentration of GT1-7 hypothalamic neuronal cell line (26.Spergel D.J. Catt K.J. Rojas E. Neuroendocrinology. 1996; 63: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27.Ishiyama M. Tominaga H. Shiga M. Sasamoto K. Ohkura Y. Ueno K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1996; 11: 1518-1520Crossref Scopus (649) Google Scholar). For this task we used a high resolution, multi-site video imaging system with fura-2 as cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) reporter fluorescent probe (27.Ishiyama M. Tominaga H. Shiga M. Sasamoto K. Ohkura Y. Ueno K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1996; 11: 1518-1520Crossref Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 28.Kudo Y. Ogura A. Br. J.

We found and report here that GT1-7 neurons (30.Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P.C. Padula J.L. Weiner R.I. Neuron. 1990; 5: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) exposed to AβP[1–40], human islet amylin, or PrP106–126 exhibited marked elevations in [Ca2+]i levels. Furthermore, we noted that not all the cells exposed were affected by these peptides. These results provides persuasive evidence supporting the idea that the spontaneous interactions between amyloid peptides and the plasma membrane of susceptible cells lead to the formation of unregulated Ca2+ channels (13.Mirzabekov T.A. Lin M. Kagan B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1988-1992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 14.Arispe N. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In an effort to find the means of protecting target cells from the toxic effects of active peptides used in this study, we selected AβP[1–40] and compared its effects on [Ca2+]i in GT1-7 cells untreated (control) and cells pretreated with soluble cholesterol, known to interact with the sphingolipid-rich external leaflet of the cell plasma membrane (31.Hanada K.

We found and report here that soluble cholesterol is an effective inhibitor of AβP[1–40]-induced free calcium elevation in GT1-7 cells. GT1-7 immortalized hypothalamic neurons (provided by Dr. R. Weiner, University of California at San Francisco) were cultured as described previously (26.Spergel D.J. Catt K.J. Rojas E. Neuroendocrinology. 1996; 63: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,30.Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P.C. Padula J.L. Weiner R.I. Neuron. 1990; 5: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Briefly, GT1-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and 5% horse serum. After enzymatic dissociation, cells were resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were plated on glass coverslips coated with a mixture of 0.1% polyethylenimine and 0.01% laminin at a concentration of 1 × 105cells/cm2. After a few days in culture the medium was replaced by basal salt solution (130 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.4) containing 1.5 μm fura-2AM (acetoxymethylester cell-permeant form, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). Cells were incubated in the presence of fura-2AM at 37 °C. After a loading period (60 min), cells were observed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan) equipped with a high resolution video camera (Hamamatsu Photonics Co., C-2400, Japan). Fura-2 [Ca2+]i images were recorded at a rate of 30 images/s on VCR tapes. Stored images were analyzed using an ad hoc hardware and software system controlled by a computer (FC-300, Mitsubishi Kasei). Each image represents the fluorescence intensity from a rectangular optical field (360 × 420 μm2). The system allowed us to record the ratio of the intensity emitted at 510 nm from pixels of images obtained alternating the excitation wavelength between 340 and 360 nm by means of a rotating filter wheel. The optical field could monitor from 50 to 100 cells simultaneously. Each ratio was automatically converted into [Ca2+]i using a calibration curve (ratioversus [Ca2+]i) stored in the hard disc of the PC. As a rule, prior to the addition of a specific peptide to the solution bathing the cells, we recorded the resting levels of neuronal [Ca2+]i during a 5-min period. All records were made at 37 °C. Our system enabled us to accurately measure both the amplitude of early peak [Ca2+]irise and the latency of the response. To form histograms with these data, we grouped the cell responses in bins (bin width, 10 nm), and then we plotted the number of cells/bin as a function of peak [Ca2+]i values. To obtain the statistical distribution of the early peak [Ca2+]i rise, we fitted a normal probability curve to the data, i.e. number of events/bin as a function of the amplitude of the early peak [Ca2+]i rise. As to the statistical distribution of the latency, i.e. the time to the first discernable increase in [Ca2+]ilevel following the addition of a given peptide (termed “[Ca2+]i rise latency” in the figures), we opted for a Poisson distribution of the data, i.e. number of events per bin as a function of the latency of the peak [Ca2+]i rise. For this task we used a least squares regression algorithm provided by a software package Origin 5.0 (Microcal, Northampton, MA). The probability values (0–100%) were obtained from the fit (mean ± standard deviation). Latencies were measured on the same cell population. AβP[1–40], AβP[40–1], human amylin, rat amylin, and PrP106–126 were obtained from Bachem F.A.G. (Bubendorf, Switzerland) and dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 0.2 mm and stored at −80 °C. During the experiments we added aliquots from the peptide stock solution directly to the solution (∼0.5 ml) bathing the cells. GT1-7 cells were plated on 96-well culture dishes at a concentration of 2 × 104cells/cm2 and maintained in culture for 2 days. After one day of exposure to AβP[1–40], we examined the GT1-7 neurons using a viability kit (available from Dojindo chemicals, Japan). The assay measures the mitochondrial-dependent conversion of 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2, 4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium monosodium salt to water-soluble formazan (27.Ishiyama M. Tominaga H. Shiga M. Sasamoto K. Ohkura Y. Ueno K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1996; 11: 1518-1520Crossref Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Although fluorescent reporter dyes for intracellular free calcium and cell viability are available and, at least in principle, they could be used to monitor simultaneously both [Ca2+]i and cell viability, we found that the bleaching half-time for fura-2 was ∼30 min (excitation at 340 and 380 nm). By contrast, the half-time for the viability test was ∼180 min. These long lasting exposures to UV light are per se cytotoxic, making it impossible to distinguish between cell death caused by elevated [Ca2+]i and that caused by the UV light. Therefore, [Ca2+]i and cell viability were monitored on two different groups of cells from the same cell culture. Water-soluble cholesterol (polyoxyethanyl cholesteryl sabacate, Sigma) was dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Water-soluble cholesterol was added to the medium bathing the cells (final concentration, ∼0.52 mm) 60 min prior to the initiation of the [Ca2+]i imaging experiment. At the end of a 60-min period, the medium was removed from both the dish with GT1-7 cells exposed to cholesterol and the dish with control GT1-7 cells. Immediately after, both dishes were washed with fresh cholesterol-free medium. This procedure was repeated three consecutive times. Thereafter, we carried out the protocol designed to test the effects of AβP[1–40]. To study the interactions between endogenous peptides of the amyloid family and the plasma membrane of susceptible neuroendocrine cells, we monitored the levels of [Ca2+]i prior to and after the application of a given peptide. To this end, we carried out comparative studies of the [Ca2+]ichanges induced by amyloid peptides in GT1-7 neurons. For this purpose we used a Ca2+ imaging system based on fura-2 as an intracellular [Ca2+]i reporter and a high resolution video camera to capture the emission from fura-2 acid trapped inside the cells. Other laboratories have already used this technique to monitor synaptic activity in primary cultures of rat neurons (28.Kudo Y. Ogura A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 89: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29.Muramoto K. Ichikawa M. Kawahara M. Kobayashi K. Kuroda Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 599: 309-316Google Scholar). In addition to the high resolution, the video camera allows the simultaneous detection of the [Ca2+]ichanges in a population of GT1-7 cells (50–100 cells/optical field), facilitating the statistical analysis. Fig.1 shows the effects of AβP[1–40] (Fig. 1 A, line a), human amylin (Fig.1 A, line b), and prion peptide PrP106–126 (Fig.1 A, line e) on the time course of intracellular free calcium in GT1-7 cells (Fig. 1 A), maximum [Ca2+]i levels (Fig. 1 B), and the percentage of GT1-7 cells responding to the peptides (Fig.1 C). The records shown in Fig. 1 A were aligned to the time at which the peptides were applied (indicated by thearrow). Fig. 1 A shows the time course of [Ca2+]i, before and after the application of 10 μm of either AβP[1–40] (Fig. 1 A,line a), AβP (40-1) (Fig. 1 A, line b), human amylin (Fig. 1 A, line c), rat amylin (Fig. 1 A, line d), or PrP106–126 (Fig.1 A, line e). The peptides that did not elicit measurable changes in [Ca2+]i, namely, AβP (40-1) and rat amylin, were considered to be inactive and, for this reason, were taken as a control. The effects of different peptides (including active and inactive peptides) on intracellular free calcium were further evaluated comparing both the size of the peak [Ca2+]i rise over basal (Fig. 1 B) and the fraction of cells responding per optical field (Fig.1 C). The time course of the [Ca2+]i rise evoked by 10 μm of active amyloid peptides (Fig. 1A, linesa, c, and e) can be compared with that of inactive peptides (Fig. 1A, lines b and d). It is clear from Fig. 1 A (line a) that the [Ca2+]i rise consists of an early transitory and a delayed sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i. A significant fraction of the cells responded to each active peptide with an elevation of [Ca2+]i characterized by a biphasic rise, i.e. an early peak followed by a sustained level. The peptide with the reverse sequence of Alzheimer's AβP[1–40] was without effect (Fig. 1 A, line b). For this reason we selected AβP[40–1] as a control for possible nonspecific effects AβP[1–40] on [Ca2+]i. Fig. 1 B shows the average value for the amplitude of the rise in [Ca2+]iover basal (∼100 nm) induced by each peptide together with the corresponding controls. The mean value of each percentage of cells responding is shown in Fig. 1 C. From Fig.1 B it is apparent that the peak [Ca2+]i rise evoked by 10 μmAβP[1–40] (183 ± 7 nm over basal, mean ± S.E., n = 250 cells) is significantly greater than that induced by human amylin (138 ± 11 nm,n = 200), which is greater than that induced by the prion PrP106–126 (98 ± 11 nm, n = 250). Fig. 1 C illustrates that the percentage of GT1-7 cells responding follows a similar trend with AβP[1–40], affecting more cells than human amylin or prion peptides. We also compared the time lapsed between the addition of the peptide and the maximum level of [Ca2+]i for each active peptide. The mean value of the time to peak was 13 ± 1 s (mean ± S.E.,n = 250) for 10 μm AβP[1–40], 23 ± 3 s (n = 200) for 10 μmhuman amylin, and 82 ± 6 s (n = 250) for 10 μm PrP106–126 peptide. The AβP[1–40] dose response diagrams depicted in Fig.2 A represent the fraction of cells (in percentages) that responded with a characteristic [Ca2+]i elevation to increasing concentrations of AβP[1–40]. At 10 μm AβP[1–40], 77 ± 5% of the GT1-7 cells responded (filled circles; mean ± S.E., n = 6). Fig. 2 B shows peak [Ca2+]i elevation over basal. The average peak rise in [Ca2+]i induced by 10 μmAβP (1.Kawahara M. Arispe N. Kuroda Y. Rojas E. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 67-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 2.Kosik K.S.

https://openalex.org/W2050945967,"Mitochondrial aconitase (m-aconitase) contains a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in its active site that catalyzes the stereospecific dehydration-rehydration of citrate to isocitrate in the Krebs cycle.

Consequently, the inactivation of m-aconitase by superoxide may increase the formation of hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) through the Fenton reaction in mitochondria. In this work, evidence for the generation of ⋅OH from the reaction of m-aconitase with superoxide is provided using ESR spin trapping experiments with 5-diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide and α-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone. Formation of free ⋅OH was verified with the ⋅OH scavenger Me2SO, which forms methyl radical upon reacting with⋅OH. The addition of Me2SO to incubation mixtures containing m-aconitase and xanthine/xanthine oxidase yielded methyl radical, which was detected by ESR spin trapping. Methyl radical formation was further confirmed using [13C]Me2SO. Parallel low temperature ESR experiments demonstrated that the generation of the [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster increased with increasing additions of superoxide to m-aconitase. This reaction was reversible, as >90% of the initial aconitase activity was recovered upon treatment with glutathione and iron(II).

Fridovich I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 777-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Clarification of the mechanism centered on this subject is of considerable importance, especially in mitochondria, cellular organelles that are constantly exposed to low levels of superoxide anion (2.Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 156: 435-444Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 3.Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). Several neurodegenerative diseases (e.g.Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Lou Gehrig's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and aging have been linked to mitochondrial oxidative damage that results in decreased mitochondrial function (3.Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar, 4.Dykens J.A. Flint Beal M. Howell N. Bodis-Wollner I. Mitochondria and Free Radicals in Neurodegenerative Diseases. Wiley-Liss, New York1997: 29-55Google Scholar). However, in biological systems, it is nearly impossible to associate a specific damage to a single oxidant. For example, superoxide and nitric oxide (⋅NO) co-generated at very low levels (≈10−8m) in cells will form peroxynitrite (ONOO−) via a nearly diffusion-controlled reaction (5.Huie R.E. Padjama S. Free Rad. Res. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref Scopus (2009) Google Scholar, 6.Kissner R. Nauser T. Bugnon P. Lye P.G. Koppenol W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The toxicological significance of these species is clearly dependent on cell type, the biological targets, and their relationship to one another. One of the sensitive biological targets in oxidative damage to mitochondria is aconitase, an iron-sulfur protein that catalyzes the stereospecific dehydration-hydration of citrate to isocitrate in the Krebs cycle (7.Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Aconitase activity in mitochondria has been reported to be a sensitive redox sensor of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in cells (8.Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Eisenstein R.S. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Silver S. Walden W. Metal Ions in Gene Regulation.

Aconitase contains a cubane-type [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in its active site with three iron atoms bound to cysteinyl groups and inorganic sulfur atoms and a fourth labile iron atom (Fe-α). This Fe-α is unique in that it is not bound to a protein cysteine, but rather to a hydroxyl group of substrate and water (7.Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The labile Fe-α is released upon oxidation of the [4Fe-4S]2+cluster with the concomitant formation of inactive [3Fe-4S]1+ enzyme. Aconitase is inactivated rapidly by superoxide (k ≈ 107m−1 s−1) (12.Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of substrate and relatively slowly by peroxynitrite (k ≈ 105m−1s−1) and ⋅NO (13.Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, the reaction between aconitase and peroxynitrite is strongly inhibited by the addition of substrate that binds to the enzyme with high affinity (14.Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It was recently proposed that the reaction between mitochondrial aconitase (m-aconitase)1 and superoxide plays a major role in mitochondrial oxidative damage (15.Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 16.Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol.

During this reaction, it has been proposed that iron is released from m-aconitase as iron(II) with the concomitant generation of hydrogen peroxide. This facilitates the formation of “free” hydroxyl radical in mitochondria. In the presence of intracellular reducing agents (e.g. glutathione, ascorbate, and NADPH), iron(II) is reincorporated into the inactive form of m-aconitase to regenerate the active form. According to this proposal, hydroxyl radical should be continuously generated in mitochondria as a result of the reaction between superoxide and aconitase. However, the experimental verification of this intriguing mechanism has so far been lacking. The objective of this study is to provide evidence, using ESR, for the formation of hydroxyl radical and inactive [3Fe-4S]1+species from the reaction between superoxide and purified m-aconitase. Direct low temperature ESR was used to quantify [3Fe-4S]1+species. 2Note that [3Fe-4S]1+ is paramagnetic and hence ESR-active, whereas [4Fe-4S]2+ is diamagnetic and ESR-inactive. 2Note that [3Fe-4S]1+ is paramagnetic and hence ESR-active, whereas [4Fe-4S]2+ is diamagnetic and ESR-inactive. Hydroxyl radical was detected by ESR spin trapping using a novel phosphorylated spin trap, 5-diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methylpyrroline N-oxide (DEPMPO), and a loop-gap resonator, which makes it possible to obtain ESR spectra using exceedingly small amounts of enzyme (19.Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.-L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the reaction between m-aconitase and superoxide releases iron(II) from the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster, which can subsequently catalyze the formation of free hydroxyl radical. The biological implications of these reactions are discussed. Bovine heart mitochondrial aconitase was purified according to published procedures (20.Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2514-2517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein purity (≥95%) was determined by dye staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The cluster content was measured from iron, sulfide, and protein content analyses as described previously (21.Beinert H. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.-L. Scott R.A. Han J.E. Hodgson K.O. Thomson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22.Flint D.H. Allen R.M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2315-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Active enzyme was prepared immediately before use by anaerobically incubating the protein with iron and dithionite. To remove excess reagent, the preparation was desalted anaerobically on Sephadex G-50 columns equilibrated with buffer (50 mm phosphate, pH 7.4). The same protocol was followed for reactivation studies, except that dithiothreitol or glutathione replaced dithionite as the reductant. Enzyme activity was measured following the formation of cis-aconitate from isocitrate at 240 nm, and the concentration was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 3.6 mm−1cm−1. The assay was performed at 25 °C in 90 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 20 mmdl-isocitrate. Rates of superoxide generation by a xanthine (1–0.5 mm)/xanthine oxidase (0.1 unit/mg of solid) system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals catalog no. 1048180) were determined by following the reduction of ferricytochrome c (50 μm) at 550 nm, and the concentration was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1cm−1. Direct ESR spectra were obtained at 10–15 K using calibrated quartz ESR tubes. The spectra were analyzed on a Varian E109 Century Series spectrometer operating at 9.17-GHz and 100-kHz field modulation. A frequency counter (EIP Model 548) was used to determine frequency, and a gaussmeter (MH-110R Radiopan, NMR magnetometer) was used to determine field positions. Instrumental conditions for detecting the [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster were as follows: microwave power, 0.1 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 5 G; time constant, 0.128 s; and scan rate, 0.83 G/s. Quantification of spin concentration was carried out using a 1.0 mm copper perchlorate standard by comparing the double integral of the spectra and standard under similar conditions. ESR spin trapping experiments were recorded at room temperature on a Varian E109 spectrometer operating at 8.9-GHz and 100-kHz field modulation equipped with a loop-gap resonator (18.Vásquez-Vivar J. Hogg N. Martásek P. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. Free Rad. Res. 1999; 31: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The use of a loop-gap resonator enabled the utilization of very small quantities of purified enzyme. ESR spin trapping experiments were analyzed at room temperature, and the instrumental settings were as follows: microwave power, 2 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 1G; time constant, 0.128 s; and scan rate, 1.67 to 0.83 G/s. Fig.1 A shows the DEPMPO-superoxide adduct (DEPMPO-OOH) detected in 20-μl incubation mixtures of DEPMPO (0.1 m) with the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system (78 μm O⨪2 min−1). Incubations of DEPMPO with superoxide generated at higher rates (220 μmmin−1) produced a composite ESR spectrum consisting of DEPMPO-OOH (62% contribution) and a DEPMPO-hydroxyl adduct (DEPMPO-OH) (38% contribution) (Fig. 1 B). The addition of active aconitase to the above incubation mixtures abolished the formation of DEPMPO-OOH and increased the intensity of DEPMPO-OH (Fig.1 C). The formation of DEPMPO-OH was instantaneous, and the resulting ESR spectrum was stable for several minutes. However, DEPMPO-OH increased with increasing concentrations of superoxide. Mitochondrial aconitase (100 μm, 40–45 units mg protein−1) added to incubation mixtures in which superoxide was generated at a rate of 220 μmmin−1 (Fig. 1 B) enhanced the yield of DEPMPO-OH by ∼88% (Fig. 1 C; cf. Fig. 1 B). No superoxide adduct was detected under these conditions, indicating that m-aconitase out-competes DEPMPO for reaction with superoxide. Parallel low temperature direct ESR measurements of the sample (Fig.1 C, inset) revealed that the enzyme was converted to the inactive [3Fe-4S]1+ aconitase. The addition of the iron chelator Ferene®(3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis(2-[5-furylsulfonic acid])-1,2,4-triazine) to incubation mixtures used to obtain Fig. 2(trace A) abolished the formation of DEPMPO-OH (trace B). The addition of desferrioxamine also abolished the generation of DEPMPO-OH (data not shown). These results suggest that the catalytically active iron concentration was increased during the reaction of m-aconitase with superoxide. To determine that iron is indeed released from the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster as has been previously shown (12.Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of substrate on DEPMPO-OH yields was investigated. The addition of saturating concentrations ofd-isocitrate (1 mm) to incubation mixtures of m-aconitase with superoxide diminished the yield of DEPMPO-OH by ∼58% (Fig. 2, trace C; cf. trace A). Control experiments demonstrated that isocitrate had no effect on the formation of DEPMPO-OH from incubation mixtures containing iron and xanthine/xanthine oxidase (data not shown). It is known that binding of substrate stabilizes the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster of aconitase and thereby protects the enzyme against inactivation (7.Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 23.Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8194-8198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that the inhibitory effect of isocitrate on the formation of DEPMPO-OH is due to a decreased rate of iron release from the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. To investigate the contribution of hydrogen peroxide formed from superoxide on iron release from m-aconitase, spin trapping experiments were performed with a bolus addition of hydrogen peroxide. The reaction between hydrogen peroxide and m-aconitase generated DEPMPO-OH (Fig. 2,trace D), which represented ∼31% of the yield obtained during the reaction of m-aconitase with superoxide. This result is consistent with the relatively slower second-order rate constant for the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with aconitase (≈103m−1 s−1) (12.Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as compared with the rate constant for the reaction between aconitase and superoxide (≈107m−1 s−1). Taken together, these results indicate that the reaction between m-aconitase and superoxide is primarily responsible for the release of iron from the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster, which subsequently catalyzes the generation of hydroxyl radical. Because 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO)- and DEPMPO-hydroxyl adducts can be formed through several mechanisms, additional experiments were performed using a hydroxyl radical scavenger, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). It is well known that hydroxyl radical reacts with Me2SO to form methyl radical (⋅CH3); and therefore, the detection of the DMPO- or DEPMPO-methyl adduct is a diagnostic indicator of free hydroxyl radical formation (Reaction 1). ⋅OH+(CH3) 2SO →DEPMPODEPMPO CH3SO2H+⋅CH3 →DEPMPO DEPMPO­CH3 REACTION 1As shown in Fig. 3 B, the addition of Me2SO to incubation mixtures of m-aconitase and superoxide produced a DEPMPO-carbon-centered adduct whose ESR parameters are consistent with trapping of methyl radical. The identity of the trapped radical was confirmed using 13C-labeled Me2SO. Substitution of [12C]Me2SO for [13C]Me2SO generated the13C-labeled DEPMPO-methyl adduct, DEPMPO-13CH3 (Fig. 3 C). In additional experiments, the spin trap α-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN), which forms persistent spin adducts with carbon-centered radicals, was substituted for DEPMPO. As shown in Fig. 3 D, no ESR signal was detected from the reaction between m-aconitase and superoxide in the presence of PBN. This is consistent with the instability of PBN-oxygen-centered adducts at physiological pH. However, the addition of Me2SO to the incubation mixtures generated a spectrum corresponding to the PBN-methyl adduct (Fig. 3 E), and a 13C-labeled PBN-methyl adduct was detected with [13C]Me2SO (Fig. 3 F). These results demonstrate that the reaction between m-aconitase and superoxide generates free hydroxyl radical. The characterization and quantitative analysis of [3Fe-4S]1+ species generated from the reaction of m-aconitase with superoxide were based on the comparative analysis with standards obtained from the stoichiometric oxidation of m-aconitase with ferricyanide (24.Brazzolotto X. Gaillard J. Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Moulis J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21625-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Table I, part A). Aliquots from incubation mixtures of m-aconitase with superoxide were taken at different time points and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen to quench the reaction. As shown in Table I (part B), incubation of m-aconitase (100 μm) with superoxide generated at the rate of 95 μm min−1quantitatively oxidized the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster to the [3Fe-4S]1+ species and inactivated the enzyme. After 5 min of incubation, m-aconitase was fully converted to the [3Fe-4S]1+ form, and only a residual enzyme activity was detected (Table I, part B). This result suggests that superoxide stoichiometrically oxidizes the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster to form [3Fe-4S]1+. Note that the amount of [3Fe-4S]1+ obtained was close to the maximal amount expected from the fully oxidized enzyme. This indicates that oxidation of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster by superoxide generates iron(II) and [3Fe-4S]1+ and that a continued exposure of the enzyme to superoxide and hydrogen peroxide does not disassemble the cluster. As [3Fe-4S]1+ upon reduction can incorporate iron(II) to regenerate the active [4Fe-4S]2+ form, the reversibility of the oxidation of m-aconitase by superoxide was investigated by examining the recovery of enzyme activity. The samples used in low temperature experiments were thawed and reactivated by anaerobic reduction with either glutathione (5 mm) or dithiothreitol (10 mm) in the presence of iron(II). As shown in Table I (part B), reactivation of samples from a 5-min incubation of m-aconitase with superoxide led to the recovery of 90% of the initial enzyme activity. This result demonstrates that inactivation of m-aconitase generates [3Fe-4S]1+ and is therefore a reversible reaction. The addition of isocitrate (1 mm) to incubation mixtures of m-aconitase did not prevent superoxide-mediated oxidation of the cluster and loss of activity. This result indicates that although isocitrate causes a decrease in the formation of hydroxyl radical (Fig. 2), the extent of the inhibition is not high enough to prevent the inactivation of the enzyme. Under these conditions, therefore, the recovery of enzyme activity was maximal (Table I, part B). As shown in Fig. 1, oxidation of m-aconitase by superoxide generated hydroxyl radical, a strong oxidant that can further oxidize amino acids critical for m-aconitase function. To investigate whether or not hydroxyl radical generated from m-aconitase contributes to the inactivation of m-aconitase by superoxide, the effect of hydroxyl radical scavengers on inactivation and reactivation of the enzyme was investigated. The addition of Me2SO (10%, v/v) or DEPMPO (0.1 m) did not diminish superoxide-mediated formation of inactive [3Fe-4S]1+m-aconitase, and neither DEPMPO or Me2SO prevented enzyme inactivation. A slight increase in m-aconitase activity was detected in the presence of Me2SO, an effect that seems related to the effect of Me2SO on enzyme stability. Taken together, these results indicate that hydroxyl radical generated during the reaction of m-aconitase with superoxide does not irreversibly inactivate the enzyme (22.Flint D.H. Allen R.M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2315-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 25.Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of cellular reductants, it is likely that m-aconitase will recycle iron(II) and enhance the generation of hydroxyl radical.Table IEffect of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide on [3Fe-4S] 1+ formation, activity, and reactivation of aconitaseExperimentaSuperoxide was generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system.

Open table in a new tab The effect of superoxide on [3Fe-4S]1+ formation and the recovery of enzyme activity was further investigated in incubation mixtures containing m-aconitase at 10-fold lower concentrations than described above (Table I, part C). Under this condition, m-aconitase was oxidized to the [3Fe-4S]1+ species, but the recovery of enzyme activity was lower than that previously detected (Table I, part C; cf. part B). Hydrogen peroxide (1 mm) also oxidized [4Fe-4S]2+ aconitase to form the [3Fe-4S]1+ species. However, the recovery of enzyme activity was much lower than that measured for superoxide under similar incubation conditions (Table I, part D). These results indicate that inactivation of m-aconitase by hydrogen peroxide generated from superoxide dismutation or added as a bolus is due to oxidation of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster, leading to protein destabilization. The intriguing hypothesis on the reaction between superoxide and [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters of dehydratases leading to hydroxyl radical formation has been previously proposed (12.Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26.Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 47: 515-521Google Scholar). However, to date, the experimental verification of this hypothesis has not been provided. In this study, we present, for the first time, ESR spin trapping evidence for the generation of hydroxyl radical during superoxide-induced oxidation of m-aconitase (Figs. 1 and 3). This work was made possible because of recent breakthroughs in ESR technology and spin trap synthesis. First, the use of a loop-gap resonator in spin trapping has made it feasible to obtain ESR spectra from exceedingly small sample volumes (≈10 μl) (27.Fréjaville C. Karoui H. Tuccio B. LeMoigne F. Culcasi M. Pietri S. Lauricella R. Tordo P. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). As a result, we were able to perform a large number of experiments using highly purified m-aconitase. Clearly, this would not be possible with conventional ESR using cavity resonators since they use large sample volumes. Second, the newly synthesized DEPMPO spin trap reacts with superoxide to form a persistent DEPMPO-OOH adduct (28.Konorev E.A. Kennedy M.C. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Unlike DMPO-OOH, the DEPMPO-OOH adduct does not spontaneously decay to form the DEPMPO-OH adduct (18.Vásquez-Vivar J. Hogg N. Martásek P. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. Free Rad. Res. 1999; 31: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27.Fréjaville C. Karoui H. Tuccio B. LeMoigne F. Culcasi M. Pietri S. Lauricella R. Tordo P. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In this study, in which a mixture of superoxide and hydroxyl radical was generated, the use of DEPMPO has made spin trapping interpretations less confounding. In addition to hydroxyl radical trapping, we demonstrated that the [4Fe-4S]2+ aconitase is quantitatively oxidized to the [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster by superoxide (Fig. 1 and Table I). From monitoring the ESR-active [3Fe-4S]1+ aconitase, we showed that superoxide releases only one iron atom from the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster (Table I), suggesting that the reaction between superoxide and m-aconitase is stoichiometric. As shown in Table I, this was also confirmed by measuring the activity recovery. It is known that in the presence of cellular reductants such as thiols, m-aconitase recycles iron by incorporating iron(II) (Scheme I and Table I) (7.Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 16.Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Therefore, underin vivo conditions, it is likely that aconitase undergoes redox cycling between the [4Fe-4S]2+ and [3Fe-4S]1+ forms. Another aspect of this reaction is that inactivation of m-aconitase by superoxide is a reversible process and that hydroxyl radical generated during the reaction does not destroy the iron-sulfur cluster at the active site of the enzyme. This result lends further support for using m-aconitase activity as a measure of intracellular superoxide steady-state levels (8.Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Oxidation of m-aconitase by hydrogen peroxide also generates hydroxyl radical, albeit at lower yields compared with superoxide-mediated oxidation of aconitase. The reactivation of the enzyme was partial, however, indicating that hydrogen peroxide may irreversibly inactivate the enzyme by destabilizing the protein structure. Recently, it was reported that cytosolic aconitase inactivation by hydrogen peroxide is reversible, although no data were provided (24.Brazzolotto X. Gaillard J. Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Moulis J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21625-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Emerging data strongly suggest that an increase in superoxide in mitochondria causes severe dysfunction (3.Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar,4.Dykens J.A. Flint Beal M. Howell N. Bodis-Wollner I. Mitochondria and Free Radicals in Neurodegenerative Diseases. Wiley-Liss, New York1997: 29-55Google Scholar). Superoxide-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction may be explained by enhanced formation of hydroxyl radical and aconitase inactivation. It was reported that the anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin causes a rapid inactivation of m-aconitase in cardiomyocytes (29.Minotti G. Aust S.D. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In this system, the superoxide dismutase mimetic manganese(III) tetrakis-(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin inhibited aconitase inactivation, whereas the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitorNw -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester exacerbated aconitase inactivation (28.Konorev E.A. Kennedy M.C. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These data reveal that conditions that lower intracellular nitric oxide enhance m-aconitase activation, suggesting that superoxide is more potent than peroxynitrite in the inactivation of m-aconitase (28.Konorev E.A. Kennedy M.C. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The source of free iron in oxidative cellular pathology has not been determined. It is likely that the reaction of m-aconitase with superoxide releases iron, which, in turn, may increase the concentration of low molecular mass iron complexes with citrate (29.Minotti G. Aust S.D. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) or ATP or ADP (30.Vile G.F. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2893-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These iron complexes and iron bound to DNA (31.Mello-Filho A.C. Meneghini R. Mutat. Res. 1991; 251: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) represent a redox-active pool of iron capable of catalyzing free radical reactions including the site-specific generation of hydroxyl radical. In this study, we have shown that m-aconitase is a plausible physiological source of free iron during oxidative stress resulting from increased superoxide formation. We have demonstrated that the reaction between m-aconitase and superoxide generates free hydroxyl radical. Superoxide releases iron(II) from the [4Fe-4S]2+ aconitase, forming the inactive [3Fe-4S]1+ aconitase and hydrogen peroxide, thus facilitating hydroxyl radical formation by the Fenton reaction. It is likely that the reaction between superoxide and m-aconitase may enhance mitochondrial oxidative damage associated with the pathophysiology of several chronic neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.

Psychophysical performance with artificial stimulus frequencies was almost identical to that measured with the natural stimulus frequencies. Our results indicate that microstimulation can be used to elicit a memorizable and discriminable analog range of percepts, and shows that activation of the QA circuit of S1 is sufficient to initiate all subsequent neural processes associated with flutter discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2056722870,"Coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity generates long-term potentiation (LTP), a possible cellular model of learning and memory. LTP has two components: (1) an increase in the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), and (2) an increase in the ability of the EPSP to generate a spike (E-S coupling of LTP). We have used pharmacological and genetic approaches to address the molecular nature of E-S coupling in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Blockade of the Ca2+-sensitive phosphatase, calcineurin, prevents induction of E-S coupling without interfering with LTP of the EPSP. Calcineurin produces its effect on E-S coupling by inducing a long-lasting depression (LTD) of the GABA(A)-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). This LTD of the IPSP was prevented by blockade of NMDA receptors. Thus, the tetanus that elicits NMDA-dependent LTP mediates a coordinately regulated double function. It produces LTP of the EPSP and, concomitantly, LTD of the IPSP that leads to enhancement of E-S coupling."

Like other MMPs, the activity of MT-MMPs can be modulated by the tissue inhibitors of MMPs or TIMPs; however, TIMP1 was found to be a poor inhibitor of MT1-, -2-, and -5-MMP (9.Will H. Atkinson S.J.

This allows efficient activation of pro-MMP2 by adjacent TIMP2-free MT1-MMP and may be a common mechanism for pro-MMP2 activation by MT-MMPs (17.Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H.

The fourth member of the MT-MMP family, MT4-MMP, has the least degree of sequence identity to the other family members (7.Pei D. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar). The human cDNA (hMT4-MMP) originally isolated from a human breast carcinoma cell line was found to lack the signal sequence and part of the pro-domain. Northern blot analysis of the tissue mRNA distribution showed hMT4-MMP to be localized in brain, colon, ovary, and testis. More interesting was the high level of mRNA found in leukocytes, which suggested a possible novel function for MT4-MMP (18.Puente X.S. Pendás A.M. Llano E. Velasco G. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar). More recent investigations of the distribution of MT4-MMP mRNA in a variety of cell lines has shown MT4-MMP to be expressed in many transformed and non-transformed cell types (19.Grant G.M. Giambernardi T.A. Grant A.M. Klebe R.J. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here we describe the isolation of a mouse cDNA homologue to MT4-MMP (mMT4-MMP) which includes the complete signal sequence and pro-peptide. This has allowed us to express transiently mMT4-MMP in mammalian cells and express the pro-catalytic domain as insoluble inclusions inEscherichia coli, from which active enzyme was recovered after refolding. Characterization of the catalytic activity of either the isolated catalytic domain alone or the entire enzyme transiently expressed in mammalian cells has shown it to be quite distinct in specificity from MT1-, -2-, -3-, and -5-MMP. All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma or BDH (Poole, UK) and were of the highest quality available unless otherwise specified. Fibrinogen was obtained from Calbiochem. Fibronectin, tenascin long and short forms, and type I gelatin were prepared and purified as described by d'Ortho et al. (20.D'Ortho M.-P. Will H. Atkinson S. Butler G.S. Messant A. Gavrilovic J. Smith B. Timpl R. Zardi L. Murphy G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Thrombin and α2-macroglobulin were obtained from Sigma. Type IV collagen and type I laminin were purchased from Collaborative Research (UK). Recombinant MT1-MMP catalytic domain, pro-MMP2, pro-MMP9, pro-MMP13, and mouse TACE catalytic domain were purified from conditioned medium from transfected cell lines as published previously (9.Will H.

Atkinson S. Butler G.S. Messant A. Gavrilovic J. Smith B. Timpl R. Zardi L. Murphy G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody to human TNFα were obtained from Chemicon (Harrow, UK). ELISA for human TNFα was purchased from Cambridge Biosciences (Cambridge, UK). The catalytic domain of human MT4-MMP was subcloned by PCR from the human cDNA originally isolated by Puenteet al. (18.Puente X.S. Pendás A.M. Llano E. Velasco G. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar) using primers 5′-AAAAGAATTCAACCGTACAGCTG-3′ and 5′-AAAACCATGGCCCAGGCTCCAGCC-3′. The PCR product was ligated into pET23d (Novagen) using NcoI/EcoRI sites and sequenced. Human MT4-MMP catalytic domain was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS at 30 °C on the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A 600 nm of 0.2–0.3 for 3 h. The insoluble inclusions were prepared as described previously (23.Knäuper V. López-Otin C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) and were solubilized in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, prior to addition to a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with 6m urea, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Partially pure MT4-MMP catalytic domain (estimated >65%) was then eluted with the equilibration buffer containing 1 m NaCl using a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE, and those containing MT4-MMP catalytic domain were then combined and dialyzed against PBS. The antigen was injected into sheep and IgG purified from sera. Specific antibody was purified against the antigen originally used by dot blotting as described by Stanton et al. (24.Stanton H. Gavrilovic J. Atkinson S.J. D'ortho M.P. Yamada K.M. Zardi L. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2789-2798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified antibody was checked for cross-reactivity against other MT-MMPs by Western blot by loading 5 μg of protein per well. The antibody was not found to cross-react with the catalytic domain MT1-, -2-, or -3-MMP. A mouse brain cDNA library constructed in λgt11 was from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). Restriction endonucleases and other reagents used for molecular cloning were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Synthetic oligonucleotides were prepared in an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 392A DNA synthesizer. Double-stranded DNA probes were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech using a commercial random-priming kit from the same company. A cDNA fragment (1.6 kilobase pairs) encoding human MT4-MMP was radiolabeled and used to screen a mouse brain cDNA library according to standard procedures. Hybridization to the radiolabeled probe was carried out for 18 h in 6× SSC (1× = 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's (1× = 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% Ficoll), 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA at 55 °C. The membranes were washed twice for 1 h at 55 °C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to autoradiography. After plaque purification, cloned inserts were excised by EcoRI digestion, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pUC18. DNA fragments selected for nucleotide sequencing were inserted in the polylinker region of phage vector M13mp19 and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using either M13 universal primer or cDNA-specific primers and the Sequenase version 2.0 kit (United States Biochemical Corp.). All nucleotides were identified in both strands. Sequence ambiguities were solved by substituting dITP for dGTP in the sequencing reactions. Computer analysis of DNA and protein sequences was performed with the software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group. A cDNA fragment encoding the first 527 residues of mouse MT4-MMP was PCR-amplified and cloned between theHindIII (blunt-ended) and BamHI sites of pcDNA3-KZ-HA (a gift from Dr. Piero Crespo, Instituto Investigaciones Biomédicas, Madrid, Spain). Then, a second cDNA fragment encoding residues 528–578 was PCR-amplified and cloned between the BglII and EcoRI sites of this plasmid. The final construct contained the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope of human influenza virus in frame to the MT4-MMP, located between residues 527 and 528 of the murine polypeptide, at the end of the hemopexin domain and immediately before the C-terminal hydrophobic extension of MT4-MMP. Thus, the resulting MT4-MMP protein was HA-tagged in an inner part of the molecule, avoiding problems derived from putative proteolytic processing of the protein either at N- or C-terminal ends. COS-7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA, using Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed for 10 min in cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed in PBS, and incubated for 10 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Fluorescent detection was performed by incubating the slides with monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) against HA (diluted 1:100) followed by another incubation with goat anti-mouse fluoresceinated antibody (diluted 1:50). After washing in PBS, slides were mounted with vectashield (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and observed in a Bio-Rad confocal laser microscope. COS-7 extracts were also obtained for Western blot analysis of the MT4-MMP-HA protein. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the pcDNA3-MT4-MMP-HA plasmid as described under under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were rinsed in PBS and scraped from the plates. Membrane fractions were prepared essentially following the procedure described by Strongin et al. (25.Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grants G.A. Goldberg G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody and detected with an ECL chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CHO and COS cells were transiently transfected for 48 h with MT4-MMP or MT1-MMP using Ca(PO4) or LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 24-well plate using the appropriate vector controls. Total cell lysates of transiently transfected cells were prepared by washing the cells with PBS prior to the addition of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3 (v/v), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), pH 8.0, with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg ml−1E64, and 5 μg ml−1 pepstatin) and scraping. Total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using the anti-hMT4-MMP sheep polyclonal antibody. Activation of pro-MMP2 or pro-MMP13 by CHO or COS-7 cells transiently expressing MT4-MMP was followed by the addition of pro-MMP2 or pro-MMP13 to the culture media 24 h after transfection and then analyzed by gelatin zymography (26.Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Slocombe P.M. Docherty A.J.P. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and Western blotting, respectively. For the processing of pro-TNFα by transiently expressed MT4-MMP, human pro-TNFα in psfCAV (a kind gift from J. Arribas, Laboratori de Recerca Oncologica, Barcelona, Spain) was co-transfected with mMT4-MMP in pcDNA3.0 into COS-7 cells in 6-well plates with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 1 μg of each DNA. Where expression of TNFα alone was monitored, the cells were co-transfected with empty pcDNA3.0 vector. Shedding was inhibited by the addition of either 10 μm CT-1746 or 200 nm TIMP-1. The conditioned medium and cell lysates were then harvested 24 h post-transfection. Human TNFα was detected in cell lysates using a monoclonal antibody, and MT4-MMP was detected using the affinity purified sheep anti-human polyclonal by Western blotting. Shedding of soluble human TNFα was quantitated using ELISA (Cambridge Biosciences, UK). Rat alveolar macrophages were isolated by bronchial lavage of the lungs of freshly sacrificed rats using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Macrophages were then cultured as described previously (27.Murphy G. Ward R. Hembry R.M. Reynolds J.J. Kuhn K. Tryggvason K. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The cells were stimulated for 24 h in the presence of 2 μg ml−1 LPS or 20 ng ml−1 PMA before total cell lysates were prepared using cell lysis buffer. Macrophages were also cultured for 24 h before stimulation with 20 ng ml−1 PMA and then cultured for a further 24 h before harvesting. MT4-MMP in total cell lysates was detected by Western blot using the anti-hMT4-MMP sheep polyclonal antibody. Jurkat cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 ng ml−1 PMA for up to 8 h. U937 and THP-1 cells were stimulated with 5 ng ml−1 PMA for up to 72 h. Total cell lysates of Jurkat, U937, and THP-1 cells were prepared and probed for the presence of MT4-MMP in the same manner as for the rat alveolar macrophages. The pro-catalytic domain of mMT4-MMP was subcloned by PCR from the pCDNA3 MT4-MMP-HA construct using primers 5′-GCGCCTCGAGGGGAGGACCTCAGCCTCGGGGTGGAGTGGC-3′ and 5′-AAAAGATCTTTACTCCTCGGGCTCTGGGGTATCCAGCTGGGC-3′. The PCR product was then ligated into pRSETB using XhoI/BglII sites, which introduces a N-terminal His6 tag, and sequenced. The pro-mMT4-MMP catalytic domain was expressed from pRSETB (Invitrogen) in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS at 37 °C. mMT4-MMP pro-catalytic domain was purified as described under under “Experimental Procedures,” except that the DEAE-Sepharose equilibration and elution buffers included 5 mmdithiothreitol. mMT4-MMP pro-catalytic domain was then refolded by dropwise addition to 50 mm Tris-SO4, 250 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10 mm CaSO4, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 0.05% Brij (v/v), pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 0.1 mg ml−1 and left overnight at 4 °C. The mMT4-MMP pro-catalytic domain was then further purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose pre-equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, pH 7.5, and eluted in the equilibration buffer containing 150 mm imidazole. Fractions containing mMT4-MMP pro-catalytic domain were immediately dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5, and stored at −80 °C. mMT4-MMP pro-catalytic domain was normally activated withl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin for 15 min in assay buffer at a concentration of 10 μg ml−1 at 20 °C followed by the inhibition of the trypsin with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Alternatively, mMT4-MMP was activated for 30 min at 20 °C in the presence of 1 mm APMA. Activated protein was routinely stored at −20 °C. Samples were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Coomassie Blue before N-terminal sequence analysis was performed on a PE Biosystems 494 Procise protein sequencer, using standard gas phase cycles for sequencing polyvinylidene difluoride-blotted protein. Hydrolysis of the following quenched fluorescent peptides were examined: Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR-NH2, Mca-GTEGEARGS-Dpa-NH2, Mca-PLA-Nva-Dpa-AR-NH2, Mca-APKPVE-Nva-Dpa-R-NH2, Mca-PEGLR-Dpa-NH2, Mca-PEGL-Dpa-R-NH2, Mca-P-Cha-G-Nva-HA-Dpa-NH2, Mca-TEGEARGS-Dpa-NH2, Mca-SPLAQAVRSSSRK(Dnp)-NH2, Mca-SSMAQTLTLRSSSK(Dnp)-NH2, Mca-KLDKSFS-Nle-K(Dnp)-NH2 (where Nva is Norvalyl and Nle is 3-cyclohexlalanyl) (kindly provided by C. G. Knight, University of Cambridge, UK). All fluorimetric measurements were made with an LS50B Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorimeter (λex = 328 nm, λem = 393 nm) equipped with thermostable cuvette holders (25 °C) in assay buffer (2.5 ml of 50 mmTris-SO4, 250 mm(NH4)2SO4, 10 mmCaCl2, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.05% Brij v/v, pH 7.5) keeping the concentration of Me2SO constant (2% v/v). Kinetic analyses were achieved with the software package GraFit 3.0 (Erithacus Software Ltd, Staines, UK). Initial velocities were monitored with substrate concentrations between 0.25 and 2 μm, which were estimated to be well below the Michaelis constant (S << K m).k cat/K m was calculated as described by Amour et al. (22.Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentrationE 0 was determined as described below. Analysis of the cleavage products of Mca-SPLAQAVRSSSRK(Dnp)-NH2 and Mca-SSMAQTLTLRSSSK(Dnp)-NH2 and comparison with those of TACE were performed as described by Amour et al. (22.Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures between mMT4-MMP (3 nm) and inhibitors were preincubated for 30 min at 25 °C with BB-94 (British Biotech Pharmaceuticals (Oxford, UK)), Ro31-9790 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), CT-1746, CT-572, and CT-1869 (Celltech, Slough, UK) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 nm and TIMPs from 0 to 30 nm. TIMPs were prepared as described previously (21.Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 28.Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M.

Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14313-14318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The steady-state velocities V S were measured with Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR-NH2 (1 μm). Apparent inhibition constants KIapp (equal to K I(1 + S/K m)) andE 0 were estimated by least squares fit to Equation 1 for competitive tight-binding inhibition (30.Morrison J.F. Walsh F.S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 201-301Google Scholar), VS=(V0/2E0)×{E0−I0−KIapp+((E0−I0−KIapp) 2+4E0KIapp) 1/2}Equation 1 where I 0 and V 0are the total concentration of inhibitor and velocity in absence of inhibitor, respectively. Enzyme concentration was approximated using this equation by averaging the calculated value obtained from fits to the inhibition curves of at least three hydroxamate inhibitors whose KIapp values were calculated to be in the low nm range. Enzyme concentrations determined in this manner were typically in close agreement between hydroxamate inhibitors and TIMP2 and -3. The association rate constants (k on) at 25 °C of mMT4-MMP with TIMP1, -2, and -3 were estimated as described previously (28.Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Cleavage of type I collagen, type I gelatin, fibronectin, laminin-I, tenascin, COMP, fibrinogen, fibrin, and α2-macroglobulin by mMT4-MMP catalytic domains were followed by reducing SDS-PAGE. All assays were performed in assay buffer overnight (16 h) in the presence of 1% Sigma mixture of inhibitors (containing AEBSF, pepstatin A, E64, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) at 20 °C. Where activity was seen, the time dependence of cleavage was followed by stopping the reaction by boiling in reducing SDS-PAGE buffer. Time-dependent cleavage of GST-pro-TNFα by mMT4-MMP, MT1-MMP catalytic domain or TACE catalytic domain was followed by reducing SDS-PAGE. Cleavage of GST-pro-TNFα was also examined by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody to TNFα. Processing of pro-MMP2 and pro-MMP9 was followed by incubation with various molar ratios of mMT4-MMP or MT1-MMP catalytic domain:pro-MMP2 or 9 for 24 h and visualized by gelatin zymography. To isolate cDNA clones encoding the murine homologue of human MT4-MMP, a mouse brain cDNA library was screened with the cDNA coding for the human enzyme (18.Puente X.S. Pendás A.M. Llano E. Velasco G. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar). Upon screening of approximately 1 × 106 plaque-forming units, six positive clones, named 1.1–1.6, were identified and characterized. DNA was isolated from these positive clones, and their nucleotide sequence was determined by standard procedures. A comparative analysis of the sequence obtained for the largest clone (1.4) with those corresponding to other MMPs, including human MT4-MMP, suggested that it could encode a full-length cDNA for mouse MT4-MMP. Computer analysis of the sequence obtained (Fig.1 and GenBankTM accession number AJ010731) revealed an open reading frame coding for a protein of 578 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 64.3 kDa. This sequence contains two potential sites of N-glycosylation (Asn-Leu-Ser and Asn-Arg-Ser at positions 136 and 322, respectively). Further analysis of the identified amino acid sequence revealed a significant similarity with other MMPs, the maximum percentage of identities (89%) being with human MT4-MMP (Fig.2). While this manuscript was under review an identical mouse sequence was reported by Kajita et al. (38.Kajita M. Kinoh H. Ito N. Takamura A. Itoh Y. Okada A. Sato H. Seki M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as well as an equivalent form of a human sequence.Figure 2Sequence comparison of murine and human MT4-MMPs. Sequences were extracted from the Swiss-Prot data base, and the alignment was performed with the program PILEUP of the GCG package.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The deduced amino acid sequence showed in Fig. 1 displays a number of features characteristic of MMPs. Thus, it contains a signal sequence, a prodomain with a Cys residue essential for maintaining the latency of these enzymes, a catalytic domain of about 170 residues including the consensus sequence HEXGHXXGXXH involved in zinc binding, and a fragment of approximately 200 amino acids with sequence similarity to hemopexin. In addition, the deduced amino acid sequence contains a 9-residue insertion between the propeptide and the catalytic domain, which is a common feature of MT-MMPs. This amino acid sequence ends with the consensus motif RXKR, which appears to be essential in the activation of these proteinases by furin. Finally, the identified sequence contains a C-terminal extension rich in hydrophobic residues and similar in size to that found in human MT4-MMP. Interestingly, this C-terminal region of both mouse and human MT4-MMP is shorter than the equivalent domains present in all the remaining MT-MMPs characterized to date and lacks the putative cytoplasmic tail also present in members of the MT-MMP subfamily. Based on all these structural characteristics, it is very likely that the murine protein encoded by the isolated mouse brain cDNA is the homologue of the human MT4-MMP (MMP-17). To provide further support on the subcellular distribution of MT4-MMP, COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-MT4-MMP-HA, a cons"
https://openalex.org/W2048887608,"Recent analysis of Rho subfamily GTPases in Drosophila revealed roles for Rac and Cdc42 during axonogenesis. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of the Drosophila counterpart of Trio, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that associates with the receptor phosphatase LAR and regulates GTPase activation in vertebrate cells. Mutants deficient in trio activity display defects in both central and peripheral axon pathways reminiscent of phenotypes observed in embryos deficient in small GTPase function. Double mutant analysis shows that trio interacts with Rac in a dose-sensitive manner but not with Rho. Moreover, reduction of trio activity potentiates the phenotype of mutations in the LAR homolog Dlar, suggesting that these proteins collaborate in orchestrating the cytoskeletal events that underlie normal axonogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1973535514,"We identified the Drosophila trio gene, which encodes a Dbl family protein carrying two Dbl homology (DH) domains, each of which potentially activates Rho family GTPases. Trio was distributed along axons in the central nervous system (CNS) of embryos and was strongly expressed in subsets of brain regions, including the mushroom body (MB). Loss-of-function trio mutations resulted in the misdirection or stall of axons in embryos and also caused malformation of the MB. The MB phenotypes were attributed to alteration in the intrinsic nature of neurites, as revealed by clonal analyses. Thus, Trio is essential in order for neurites to faithfully extend on the correct pathways. In addition, the localization of Trio in the adult brain suggests its postdevelopmental role in neurite terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2013307433,"Olfactory neurons expressing the same odorant receptor converge to a small number of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. In turn, mitral and tufted cells receive and relay this information to higher cortical regions. In other sensory systems, correlated neuronal activity is thought to refine synaptic connections during development. We asked whether the pattern of connections between olfactory sensory axons and mitral cell dendrites is affected when odor-evoked signaling is eliminated in mice lacking functional olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels. We demonstrate that olfactory sensory axons converge normally in the CNG channel mutant background. We further show that the pruning of mitral cell dendrites, although slowed during development, is ultimately unperturbed in mutant animals. Thus, the olfactory CNG channel-and by inference correlated neural activity--is not required for generating synaptic specificity in the olfactory bulb."
https://openalex.org/W2021374902,"The Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) is integrated into signal transduction networks regulating axon outgrowth. We have identified the Drosophila trio gene through a mutation that exacerbates the Abl mutant phenotype. Drosophila Trio is an ortholog of mammalian Trio, a protein that contains multiple spectrin-like repeats and two Dbl homology (DH) domains that affect actin cytoskeletal dynamics via the small GTPases Rho and Rac. Phenotypic analysis demonstrates that trio and Abl cooperate in regulating axon outgrowth in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS). Dosage-sensitive interactions between trio and Abl, failed axon connections (fax), and enabled (ena) indicate that Trio is integrated into common signaling networks with these gene products. These observations suggest a mechanism by which Abl-mediated signaling networks influence the actin cytoskeleton in neuronal growth cones."

To further define the role intestinal epithelial cells play in initiating and modulating the host response to infection with invasive bacteria, hybrid selection on high density cDNA arrays was used to characterize the mRNA expression profile of ∼4,300 genes in human intestinal epithelial cells after infection with the prototypic invasive bacteria,Salmonella. Selected findings were further evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Northern blot analysis, and protein assays. Epithelial infection withSalmonella significantly up-regulated mRNA expression of a relatively small fraction of all genes tested. Of these, several cytokines (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, inhibin A, Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3, interleukin-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-2α), kinases (TKT, Eck, HEK), transcription factors (interferon regulatory factor-1), and HLA class I were the most prominent. Furthermore, the transcription factor NF-κB is shown to be important for inducible mRNA expression for a broad group of genes tested. These findings expand the repertoire of known epithelial cell responses to infection with an invasive enteric pathogen. The results also show that evaluation of mRNA expression profiles by cDNA array analysis is a powerful approach to characterizing and understanding host-pathogen interactions.

To overcome this barrier, many enteric pathogens have evolved the ability to invade and pass through the intestinal epithelium as a key initial step to establish mucosal and, subsequently, systemic infection of the host. Microbial entry into the epithelium is an active process that requires signaling from the invading pathogen to the host cell, although the specific signaling pathways involved differ for different microorganisms (1.Finlay B.B. Cossart P. Science. 1997; 276: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). For example, invasive Salmonella appear to inject specific proteins into epithelial cells that activate signaling pathways involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements and cellular uptake processes (2.Galan J.E. Collmer A. Science. 1999; 284: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Besides facilitating the invasion process, the interaction between invading pathogen and host epithelium also leads to activation of a program of epithelial gene expression (3.Kagnoff M.F. Eckmann L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This program encompasses mostly genes whose products have proinflammatory functions. For example, several chemokines (e.g. IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and GROα)1 are up-regulated in intestinal epithelial cells after infection with different invasive bacteria, including Salmonella,Shigella, Yersinia enterocolitica, and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (4.Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. Fierer J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4569-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Jung H.C. Eckmann L. Yang S.K. Panja A. Fierer J. Morzycka- Wroblewska E. Kagnoff M.F. J. Clin.

Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1214-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These chemokines can attract and activate neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, which are important components of the acute inflammatory response initiated after enteric infection with invasive bacteria. Other epithelial genes induced after infection with invasive bacteria include cyclooxygenase-2, one of the crucial rate-limiting enzymes for prostaglandin production, and inducible NO synthase, which controls NO production (7.Eckmann L. Stenson W.F. Savidge T.C. Lowe D.C. Barrett K.E. Fierer J. Smith J.R. Kagnoff M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 296-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8.Salzman A.L. Eaves-Pyles T.

Physiol. 1998; 275: G564-G571PubMed Google Scholar). These genes are induced after infection with very different invasive bacteria, which have unique invasion strategies and reside in different intracellular compartments (1.Finlay B.B. Cossart P. Science. 1997; 276: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 10.Kaufmann S.H. Hess J. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 65: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This suggests a conserved epithelial response to diverse host-microbe interactions, whose common consequence and threat for the host is the impending mucosal colonization with an enteric pathogen. Although 15–20 genes have been characterized whose expression increases after infection of intestinal epithelial cells with invasive bacteria, these genes probably represent only a small fraction of all the genes that are induced under these circumstances. Thus, based on the conservative assumptions that intestinal epithelial cells express 10,000–20,000 genes (i.e. 10–20% of the estimated 100,000 genes in the human genome) and that expression of only a small fraction (e.g. 1–5%) of these genes is regulated under a specific set of stimulation conditions, it appears likely that the number of genes up-regulated after infection with invasive pathogens exceeds several hundred. Identification of these genes, and ultimately characterization of their functions, will be important for understanding the pathogenesis of infections with invasive enteric pathogens such as Salmonella. Recently, techniques have become available that allow characterization of the mRNA expression status of a large number of genes (11.Pease A.C. Solas D. Sullivan E.J. Cronin M.T. Holmes C.P.

In an effort toward characterizing the repertoire of cellular responses of the human intestinal epithelium to infection with invasive bacteria, in the present studies we have applied high density cDNA arrays to the mRNA expression analysis of ∼4,300 genes in intestinal epithelial cells after infection with the clinically important invasive enteric pathogen, Salmonella. These studies used HT-29 human colorectal epithelial cells (ATCC HTB-38) and T84 human colon epithelial cells (16.Eckmann L. Jung H.C. Schurer-Maly C. Panja A. Morzycka-Wroblewska E. Kagnoff M.F. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1689-1697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). HT-29 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. T84 cells were grown in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Ham's F12 medium, supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. Epithelial cells were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates and grown to confluence. Monolayers were infected for 1 h with 108 bacteria/well of the invasive wild-typeSalmonella strain, Salmonella dublin lane, using previously described protocols (4.Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. Fierer J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4569-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular bacteria were removed, and cultures were further incubated for various periods in the presence of 50 μg/ml of the non-cell-permeant antibiotic gentamicin to kill remaining extracellular bacteria. Recombinant adenovirus containing an IκBα superrepressor (Ad5IκB-A32/36) or the E. coli β-galactosidase gene (Ad5LacZ) were constructed as described before (17.Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. DiDonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar). Ad5IκB-A32/36 expresses a mutant form of IκBα in which serine residues 32 and 36 are replaced by alanine residues. The mutant IκBα cannot be phosphorylated at positions 32 and 36 and thereby acts as a superrepressor of NF-κB activation. Infections of confluent HT-29 monolayers with recombinant adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 were performed as described before (18.Elewaut D. DiDonato J.A. Kim J.M. Truong F. Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1457-1466PubMed Google Scholar). Adenovirus-infected cells were infected withS. dublin 24 h after viral infection. Total cellular RNA was extracted using an acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method according to the manufacturer's instructions (TRIzol Reagent; Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase to remove contaminating genomic DNA, and RNA integrity was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Analysis of mRNA expression was performed by hybrid selection of radioactively labeled cDNA on high density arrays of membrane-bound cDNA probes. The studies used two different cDNA arrays: the GF211 Human “Named Genes” GeneFilter Release I from Research Genetics Inc. (Huntsville, AL) and the Atlas Cytokine/Receptor cDNA Expression Array from CLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). Preparation of radioactively labeled cDNA and subsequent hybridizations to the cDNA arrays were conducted as recommended by the manufacturers of the arrays, using reagents provided by the manufacturers. In brief, for the GF211 arrays, 5 μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-33P]dCTP, and cDNA was purified by passage through a Sephadex G50 column (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) and hybridized overnight at 42 °C to the GeneFilter membrane. The membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min and once in 0.5× SSC, 1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min. Specifically bound radioactivity was analyzed with a phosphor imaging system (Storm System, Molecular Dynamics) after overnight exposure of the membrane to a light-sensitive screen. Analysis of differential mRNA expression was performed through sequential stripping and rehybridization of the membrane to four different radioactively labeled cDNAs from controls and Salmonella-infected samples. Results were analyzed with a proprietary computer program (Pathways) from the manufacturer (Research Genetics), and data are expressed as relative changes in mRNA levels betweenSalmonella-infected samples and uninfected controls. For the Atlas arrays, 5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in the presence of 35 μCi of [α-32P]dATP, and cDNA was purified by passage through a CHROMA SPIN-200 column (CLONTECH). Final probe concentration was adjusted to 106 cpm/ml, and hybridization to the Atlas membrane was carried out overnight at 68 °C. The membrane was washed three times in 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 68 °C for 30 min and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 68 °C for 30 min. Membranes were exposed to x-ray film using an intensifying screen for optimal periods of time (1–5 days), and mRNA expression levels were analyzed by scanning the films with a densitometer (GS-670 Imaging Densitometer, Bio-Rad). Analysis of differential mRNA expression was performed by preparing cDNA from control and Salmonella-infected samples in parallel and by hybridizing the samples in parallel to pairs of identical cDNA arrays. As for the GF211 arrays, data obtained from the Atlas cDNA arrays are expressed as relative changes in mRNA levels betweenSalmonella-infected samples and uninfected controls. Total RNA was extracted as described above and reverse transcribed using our previously published protocols (5.Jung H.C. Eckmann L. Yang S.K. Panja A. Fierer J. Morzycka- Wroblewska E. Kagnoff M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 55-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed under the conditions described before (5.Jung H.C. Eckmann L. Yang S.K. Panja A. Fierer J. Morzycka- Wroblewska E. Kagnoff M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 55-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the primer pairs, annealing temperatures, number of PCR cycles, and RNA amounts shown in Table I, which also shows the predicted sizes of the resulting PCR products. PCR products were analyzed by running reactions on 1.2% agarose/ethidium bromide gels. As positive controls for RT-PCR detection, we used human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated overnight with 10 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin-P and 2 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide fromE. coli O111:B4, with the exception of LI-cadherin and neurotrophin-3, for which RNA from unstimulated human intestinal xenografts in mice with severe-combined immunodeficiency was used (7.Eckmann L.

RNA (5 μg/lane) was size-fractionated on a 1% agarose/17% formalin gel in a MOPS buffer, and blotted onto a reinforced nitrocellulose membrane (pore size, 0.45 μm). The probes for IL-8 and 18S rRNA were described before (16.Eckmann L. Jung H.C. Schurer-Maly C. Panja A. Morzycka-Wroblewska E. Kagnoff M.F.

The probe for HLA class I, C heavy chain was generated by RT-PCR using the primers and conditions described above and in Table I. All probes were gel purified using low melting agarose and a phenol/LiCl extraction protocol. 50 ng of purified inserts or PCR products were labeled with 50 μCi of [32P]dCTP using a random-primer method (Prime It II, Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). For hybridizations, 2 × 106 cpm/ml of labeled probe were used. Prehybridization and hybridizations were performed in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH), supplemented with 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA and 5 μg/ml poly(U), at 68 °C for 1 h and overnight, respectively. Membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min. Washed membranes were exposed at −80 °C to x-ray film using an intensifying screen. For cytokine assays, supernatants were removed at different times after infection, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and stored at −80 °C. Cytokine levels in the supernatants were determined by ELISA. The IL-8 ELISA was described before and was sensitive to 20 pg/ml (16.Eckmann L. Jung H.C. Schurer-Maly C. Panja A. Morzycka-Wroblewska E. Kagnoff M.F. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1689-1697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The G-CSF ELISA (Quantikine HS; R & D Systems) was sensitive to 0.5 pg/ml recombinant cytokine. To assay activin A production, culture supernatants were first concentrated 10–20-fold by centrifugation using a 3,000 molecular weight cut-off spin filter (Centriprep-3 Concentrator, Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). Activin A levels were then determined by ELISA (Serotec, Kidlington, UK) using protocols recommended by the manufacturer. The protocol involves pretreatment of samples by boiling for 3 min in the presence of SDS (3% final concentration) and subsequent treatment with H2O2 (final concentration, 2.2%) at room temperature for 30 min to dissociate activin A from its physiologically occurring complexes with follistatin. The activin A assay was sensitive to ∼20 pg/ml in the original culture supernatants. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and detached with 20 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing, cells were stained with optimal concentrations of monoclonal mouse anti-human HLA class I (clone W6/32, ATCC HB-95), mouse anti-human c-Met (clone DO-24, Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA), or appropriate mouse isotype control antibodies, followed by R-phycoerythrin labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Staining intensities were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). To characterize changes in epithelial mRNA expression in response to infection with invasiveSalmonella, confluent cultures of the human intestinal epithelial cell line HT-29 were infected with S. dublin, and total RNA was extracted at different times after infection. HT-29 cells were selected for these experiments because previous studies had demonstrated strong and highly reproducible responses of these cells toSalmonella infection (4.Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. Fierer J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4569-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Jung H.C. Eckmann L. Yang S.K. Panja A. Fierer J. Morzycka- Wroblewska E. Kagnoff M.F. J. Clin.

Radioactively labeled cDNA was prepared from RNA by reverse transcription and hybridized to two sets of commercially available filter membranes that carry largely nonoverlapping arrays of cDNA probes for a range of known human genes. After several high stringency washes, the amounts of radioactive cDNA specifically bound to the various probes was analyzed by phosphor imaging or densitometry, and relative increases in mRNA levels in Salmonella-infected cellsversus uninfected controls were calculated.

Site-directed single substitution of each of these amino acids except glycines in the yeast MsrA resulted in total loss of enzyme activity. Nevertheless, all the recombinant MsrA mutants and native proteins had a very similar circular dichroism spectrum. The demonstration that either treatment with iodoacetamide or replacement of the motif cysteine with serine leads to inactivation of the enzyme underscores the singular importance of cysteine residues in the activity of MsrA.

Also, it was shown that the enzymatic activity increased dramatically with increasing ionic strength. The recombinant yeast MsrA activity and the reduction activity of free methionine sulfoxide(s) were stereoselective toward the l-methionineS-sulfoxide and S-methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide.

However, unlike most other forms of oxidative damage, the oxidation of methionine residues to methionine sulfoxide (MetO)1 derivatives is readily repaired by the action of methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA), which catalyzes the thioredoxin-dependent reduction of MetO back to methionine (Reaction 1). MetO+Th(SH) 2→Met+Th(S­S) REACTION 1Significantly, selective oxidation of methionine residues of some enzymes leads to complete loss or alteration of their catalytic activity, whereas oxidation of methionine residues of other proteins is restricted to surface-exposed residues whose oxidation has little or no effect on biological function. This has led to the propositions (a) that interconversion of methionine residues between oxidized and reduced forms may serve as an important mechanism for the regulation of some enzyme activities, analogous to that obtained by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles (1.Stadtman E.R. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) or (b) that the cyclic oxidation and reduction of surface-exposed methionine residues of other proteins may serve as a first line of antioxidant defense against reactive oxygen-mediated damage (2.Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The ability of MsrA to reduce free MetO as well as protein-bound MetO leads to the possibility that the enzyme may be involved in salvation of free methionine from free MetO. This role of MsrA could have other partners since it has been shown that both Escherichia coli andSaccharomyces cervisiae possess an activity that can specifically reduce free MetO and cannot reduce protein-bound MetO or any methyl sulfoxide group (3.Moskovitz J. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2095-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 4.Moskovitz J. Berlett B.S. Poston J.M. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Null mutants of msrA in bacteria and yeast exhibited lower survival rates under oxidative stress conditions than their parent strains. Moreover, overexpression of the msrA cDNA from bovine in human T lymphocytes (Molt-4) and S. cervisiae resulted in a much higher survival rate under oxidative stress condition in comparison to their control cells (5.Moskovitz J. Rahman A.M. Strassman J. Yancey S.O. Kushner S.R. Brot N. Weissbach H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 6.Moskovitz J. Flescher E. Berlett B.S. Azare J. Poston J.M. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14071-14075Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition, the null msrA mutant in yeast was shown to accumulate free and protein-bound MetO when the cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide or 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (4.Moskovitz J. Berlett B.S. Poston J.M. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated for the first time that MsrA can reduce free and protein-bound methionine sulfoxide to methionine in vivo and that accumulation of oxidized form of methionine could lead to physiological malfunctions and to enhanced cell death. It therefore seems reasonable that tissues containing high levels of MsrA are sensitive targets to oxidative stress (for example, in macrophages (7.Moskovitz J. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jursky F. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3205-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), neutrophils (8.Brot N. Fliss H. Coleman T. Weissbach H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 352-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), kidney, and pigment epithelial cells of the retina (7.Moskovitz J. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jursky F. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3205-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)). We show here that amino acid substitutions in a highly conserved region of the MsrA leads to inactivation of MsrA activity, suggesting that this region embodies the active catalytic site. We show further that the enzyme possesses a β-strand, revealed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, and that the β-strand content is unaffected by mutations in the conserved motif, consistent with the conclusion that these mutations do not lead to major alterations in the secondary structure. In addition, we have examined the kinetics and stereospecificity of peptide MsrA and free methionine sulfoxide reductase (FMsr) from several sources (bacteria, yeast) and have examined the possibility that there is competition between MsrA-catalyzed reduction of free forms of MetO stereoisomer. All constructs for the expression and isolation of mutated yeast MsrA proteins were made using the pQE30 vector (Qiagen), harboring the yeast MsrA gene, as a template (4.Moskovitz J. Berlett B.S. Poston J.M. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To create an amino acid substitution in the recombinant MsrA, we used the Stratagene kit for mutagenesis (QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis).The following sets of primers were used, separately, for the amplification of the expression vector pQE30 harboring each mutation for a single amino acid (the changes from the native sequence are given in bold letters). Set 1: A 5′ sense primer where Cys25 was mutated to give Ser (5′-CACATTAGCATGTGGAAGCTTTTGGGGTACAGAAC) and its compatible reverse complement primer. Set 2: A 5′ sense primer where Phe26 was mutated to give His (5′-CACATTAGCATGTGGATGTCATTGGGGTACAGAAC) and its compatible reverse complement primer. Set 3: A 5′ sense primer where Phe26 was mutated to give Ala (5′-CACATTAGCATGTGGATGTGCTTGGGGTACAGAAC) and its compatible reverse complement primer. Set 4: A 5′ sense primer where Trp27 was mutated to give Ala (5′-CACATTAGCATGTGGATGTTTTGCGGGTACAGAAC) and its compatible reverse complement primer. Set 5: A 5′ sense primer where Gly24 was mutated to give Ala (5′-CACATTAGCATGTGCATGTTTTTGGGGTACAGAAC) and its compatible reverse complement primer. Set 6: A 5′ sense primer where Gly28 was mutated to give Ala (5′-CACATTAGCATGTGGATGTTTTTGGGCAACAGAAC) and its compatible reverse complement primer. Every set of primers was added separately for the polymerase chain reaction using the pQE30 harboring the msrA gene as a template. Polymerase chain reaction was performed for one cycle of 30 s at 94 °C, followed by 18 cycles of 30 s 94 °C, 60 s at 55 °C, and 12 min at 68 °C. The polymerase chain reaction products were treated with DpnI. TheDpnI was used to digest the parental DNA template and select for the synthesized DNA containing mutations. DpnI can digest only methylated DNA, and therefore, the polymerase chain reaction products are not affected by its activity. The nicked DNA vector harboring the desired mutation was then transformed intoE. coli, and ampicillin resistance colonies were isolated for each mutation. Sequencing analysis was performed for each plasmid construct, and existence of the desired mutation in each case was verified. The 6-His-tagged recombinants of the various MsrA mutants were made by overexpressing them in E. coli and purified to homogeneity by adsorption on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid resin, as described previously (4.Moskovitz J. Berlett B.S. Poston J.M. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). CD spectra were performed with a J-710 spectrometer using 0.2-mm water-jacketed cylindrical cells. The temperature of cells was controlled by an external programmable water bath (Neslab RTE-110). Spectra were corrected for the solvent CD signal. CD spectra were normalized for protein concentration using the value of 116.2 for the enzyme mean residue molecular weight. For determining secondary structure, far UV spectra of four measurements taken at 10 nm/min were averaged. Secondary structural components were calculated by the method of Yang et al. (9.Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar) using software supplied by Jasco Inc. The ability of methionine sulfoxide reductase to reduce free methionine sulfoxide was assayed by using l-[3H]MetO as substrate, as described by Brot et al. (10.Brot N. Werth J. Koster K. Weissbach H. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 122: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or by usingl-[35S]MetO, prepared as described below. The reaction mixture (30 μl) contained 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), various concentrations ofl-[3H]MetO, l-(S)- [35S]MetO, orl-(R)-[35S]MetO, and pure yeast MsrA protein or cell extract. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 or 60 min, the reaction mixtures containing radiolabeled substrates were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The reaction mixture was stopped by adding 0.33 mm MetO and methionine, and conversions of l-[3H]MetO,l-(d) [35S]MetO orl-(l)-[35S]MetO tol-[3H]Met orl-[35S]Met were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on a silica gel plate using the solvent consisting ofn-butanol:acetic acid:water (60:12:25). After ninhydrin treatment of the plate, the spot that corresponded to the migration of Met was extracted by water, and the radioactivity was measured. Reaction mixtures containing nonradioactive substrates we analyzed by HPLC chromatography. The reaction mixtures were passed through microconcentrators (Microcon 3, Amicon), and the flow-through was were collected and derivatized by OPA and then injected onto a 15-cm C18 column (Apex, Jones Chromatography, Denver, CO) for free amino acid analysis, as described previously (11.Reddy V.Y. Desrochers P.E. Pizzo S.V. Gonias S.L. Sahakian J.A. Levine R.L. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4683-4691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of protein-bound methionine sulfoxide by MsrA was assayed using dabsyl-Met(O) as described previously (4.Moskovitz J. Berlett B.S. Poston J.M. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 12.Moskovitz J. Berlett B.S. Poston J.M. Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 20 mm DTT, dabsyl-Met(O) (200 μm), and an aliquot of MsrA protein were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 μl of acetonitrile. After centrifugation, 10 μl of the clear supernatant solution was injected onto a 10-cm C18 column (Apex, Jones Chromatography, Denver, CO) equilibrated at 50 °C with buffer (0.14 m sodium acetate, 0.5 ml/liter triethylamine (pH 6.1)) containing 30% acetonitrile. Using a linear gradient from 30 to 70% acetonitrile, the dabsyl methionine was eluted at 5.0 min, as monitored by peak integration at 436 nm (one pmol of dabsyl methionine gives 340 area units). Me2SO or methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide reduction by MsrA proteins was assayed by incubating the enzyme (2.4 μg) in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 50 nmol of NADPH, 1.5 μg of E. coli thioredoxin reductase, 2.5 nmols of E. coli thioredoxin, 3 μmMe2SO (purchased from Fisher), and (S)-methylp-tolyl sulfoxide or (R)-methylp-tolyl sulfoxide (purchased from Aldrich). A unit of activity was defined as the nmols of NADPH oxidized/min, as determined by the change in absorbency at 340 nm at room temperature (3.Moskovitz J. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2095-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). l-Met-(S)-sulfoxide andl-Met-(R)-sulfoxide were prepared according to the procedure described by Lavine (13.Lavine T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 169: 477-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.25 g ofl-methionine-(S,R)-sulfoxide was dissolved in 2 ml of water in a boiling water bath. After slight cooling, a solution of picric acid prepared in methanol (0.5 g/4 ml of methanol) was added slowly to the dissolved sulfoxide, and the solution was allowed to cool to room temperature and then filtered. The yellow precipitate obtained from filtration was rinsed with ice-cold methanol and then dissolved in 35 ml of water. Amylamine (80 μl) was added to obtain a pH ∼ 8.0. Acetone (200 ml) was then added to precipitate the sulfoxide. The precipitate was dried and redissolved in water. The final product l-Met-(S)-sulfoxide was found to be dextrorotatory by optical rotation ([α]D = +99° in H2 O) measured on a Perkin-Elmer model 241 polarimeter (589 nm). The original filtrate (the non-precipitate picric acid-MetO solution) was evaporated to dryness, and amylamine (80 μl) was added with 25 ml of water to reach a pH of around 8.0. Acetone (200 ml) was added to reprecipitate the free sulfoxide. The resulted material was dried and redissolved in water. The final productl-Met-(R)-sulfoxide was found to be levorotatory rorotatory by optical rotation ([α]D = −54° in H2O). The preparations of radiolabeled free (S)-[35S]MetO and free (R)-[35S]MetO were obtained by adding 5 mCi of free dl-[35S]MetO to 1 g of non-labeled starting material (free MetO), and the samples were purified as described above. In the literature,l-Met-(S)-sulfoxide andl-Met-(R)-sulfoxide are also termed asl-Met-(d)-sulfoxide andl-Met-(l)-sulfoxide, respectively. The screening for the FMsr was performed by using the TLC assay for the conversion of free methionine (l-[3H]MetO) to methionine, as described above. Activity measurements using either DTT or theE. coli thioredoxin system gave similar results. E. coli cells lacking the msrA gene (SK8779) were aerobically grown in LB medium containing kanamycine (50 μg/ml) and disrupted by French pressure cell in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (buffer A). After ammonium sulfate precipitation (70%), the precipitated proteins were dialyzed against buffer A at 4 °C. The protein solution was then subjected to a HPLC column DEAE-5-PW (Bio-Rad) that was pre-equilibrated with buffer A. After elution with a NaCl gradient (0–500 mm) in buffer A, fractions containing the peak activity of FMsr were combined. The pooled protein fraction was then applied to a sizing column Ultrogel AcA 54 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and fractionated using buffer A. Fractions containing the activity peak were combined, and the pooled fraction was subjected to a Phenyl Sepharose Cl-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a gradient starting at buffer A containing 1 m ammonium sulfate and ending at buffer A. Fractions containing the peak activity were combined, and the pooled fraction was dialyzed against buffer A at 4 °C and then stored at −70 °C. A null mutant of themsrA gene (H9 msrA::URA3), its parent strain (H9), and methionine auxotroph yeast strain (X963–18C MATαmet2 his8 ade8) were grown in a synthetic complete media either in culture or on plates with and without methionine or withl-Met-(S)-sulfoxide orl-Met-(R)-sulfoxide. The conserved motif of the amino acids GCFWG in the N terminus of all known MsrAs (except for the Neisseria gonorrhoeae MsrA) prompted us to check if a single substitution of each of these amino acid would lead to inactivation of enzyme activity without causing a major change in protein structure. The MsrA fromN. gonorrhoeae (denoted as Pilb) is different from the rest of the other MsrAs by its molecular mass (58 kDa versus20–26 kDa) and the fact that it has a thioredoxin motif in its N terminus (14.Wizemann T.M. Moskovitz J. Pearce B.J. Cundell D. Arvidson C.G. So M. Weissbach H. Brot N. Masure R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7985-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We chose the yeast MsrA (4.Moskovitz J. Berlett B.S. Poston J.M. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) to serve as the model for our mutagenesis study and checked the ability of each of its different mutants to reduce free and protein-bound MetO and Me2SO. As shown in Table I, mutations of motifs Cys25,Phe26, or Trp27 led to complete loss of the ability of MsrA to catalyze reduction of either MetO, dabsyl-MetO, or Me2SO. However, mutation of either Gly24 or Gly28 resulted in only partial (60–80%) loss of MsrA activity. Although mutations in these amino acids caused alteration of MsrA activities, the corresponding recombinant proteins behaved as the native MsrA recombinant protein in regard to their level of expression in E. coli and their solubility in the E. coli extracts.Table IMsrA activities following site-directed mutagenesis in an MsrA-conserved region (GCFWG)Amino acid substitution substrates% activityDabsyl-MetOMe2SOL-[3H]MetONative MsrA100100100Gly24 → Ala374039Cys25 → Ser000Phe26 → Ala000Phe26 → His000Trp27 → Ala000Gly28 → Ala171918The activities of yeast MsrAs, mutants, and native recombinant proteins were assayed with various substrates. Each of the MsrA proteins (2.5 μg) was incubated either with dabsyl-MetO, L-[3H]MetO, or Me2SO, as previously described (“Experimental Procedures”). 100% activity represents 43,000 pmol/min/mg Met formed when dabsyl-MetO was used as a substrate, 4,200 pmol/min/mg Met formed when L-[3H]MetO was used as a substrate, and 4 nmol of NADPH oxidized/min when Me2SO was used as a substrate under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab The activities of yeast MsrAs, mutants, and native recombinant proteins were assayed with various substrates. Each of the MsrA proteins (2.5 μg) was incubated either with dabsyl-MetO, L-[3H]MetO, or Me2SO, as previously described (“Experimental Procedures”). 100% activity represents 43,000 pmol/min/mg Met formed when dabsyl-MetO was used as a substrate, 4,200 pmol/min/mg Met formed when L-[3H]MetO was used as a substrate, and 4 nmol of NADPH oxidized/min when Me2SO was used as a substrate under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The CD spectrum of the native and mutant forms of yeast MsrA exhibited similar patterns that were slightly altered in the case of the Trp27 and Phe26 mutants in comparison to the Cys25 mutant or the native protein (Fig.1). These small differences could not account for the total loss of MsrA activity in these mutants, since Under denaturating conditions (50 °C) the CD spectra of the proteins was the same and totally different than under non-denaturating conditions (20 °C) (see “Discussion”). Far-UV CD spectra of the MsrA protein at pH 7.5 indicated that the native protein has ∼11% α-helix, ∼65% β-strand, and ∼22% random structures, and ∼2% turns at 20 °C (Fig. 1). Since Cys25 was found to be essential for MsrA activity (Table I), we examined the ability of iodoacetamide to inactivate the enzyme. It is known that iodoacetamide is able to alkylate thiol groups of Cys residues in proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, the MsrA activity was inhibited by iodoacetamide, which implies that Cys residues have been modified.Figure 2Inhibition of MsrA activity by iodoacetamide. The yeast MsrA enzyme was assayed for its ability to reduce l-[3H]MetO to methionine in the absence and the presence of various concentrations of iodoacetamide. 5 μm of pure yeast MsrA was incubated in 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) and various concentrations of iodoacetamide for 30 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, 2 mm DTT was added to each reaction, and then the samples were assayed for the reduction of free l-[3H]MetO to methionine, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The solid curve was calculated using a normal binding isotherm with aK d of 2.7 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize the MsrA protein, the K m values for the MsrA from different species were determined using dabsyl-MetO as substrate. It was found that the recombinant enzymes from S. cervisiae and Bos tauros had a similarK m value (44 and 33 μm, respectively), whereas the E. coli MsrA had a higher K mvalue (120 μm). Among the various conditions under which the enzymatic activity of MsrA was tested, it was found that a high ionic strength increased the specific activity of the MsrA enzyme in a linear manner (Fig. 3). NaCl, KCl, NaF, and Na2SO4 had a similar effect on the enzyme activity, whereas LiCl and NaBr were less effective. None of the salts promoted reduction of the Dabsyl-MetO in the absence of MsrA. The MsrA protein has been shown to equally reduce bothd and l forms of free MetO (3.Moskovitz J. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2095-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the enzyme exhibits high specificity in its ability to reduce theR and S forms of MetO. As shown in Table III, MsrA reduces l-Met-(S)-sulfoxide but notl-Met-(R)-sulfoxide. This was verified also by comparing the ability of MsrA to reduce the R andS forms of methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide. When yeast MsrA (2.5 μg) was incubated with 3 μm of eitherS-methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide or R-methylp-tolyl sulfoxide as described under “Experimental Procedures”, the S form was reduced at a rate of 4.0 nmol/min, but the R form was not reduced at all. Furthermore, it was found that the ability of MsrA to reduce 35S-labeled free Met-(S)-sulfoxide was unaffected by the presence of an 18-fold excess of nonradiolabeled free Met-(R)-sulfoxide. It is therefore evident that Met-(R)-sulfoxide is not a substrate for MsrA nor can it compete with Met-(S)-sulfoxide for binding to the catalytic site.Table IIIStereospecific reduction of L-Met-(S)-sulfoxide by FMsr from E. coli and S. cervisiaeSpecific activity+L-Met-(S)-O+L-Met-(R)-Opmols Met/mg protein/minE. coli protein extracts Wild-type parent strain (MC1061)12.00.0 msrA null mutant strain (SK8779)3.30.0 Partly purified FMsr495.00.0S. cervisiae protein extracts Wild-type parent strain (H9)15.30.0 msrA null mutant strain (H9ΔmsrA::URA3)4.00.0E. coli and S. cervisiae protein extracts along with a partly purified FMsr from E. coli were tested for their ability to reduce L-Met-(S)-sulfoxide and L-Met-(R)-sulfoxide. The assay was carried out according to the procedure described for the reduction of free MetO under “Experimental Procedures.” Both substrates were radiolabeled with35S. Open table in a new tab E. coli and S. cervisiae protein extracts along with a partly purified FMsr from E. coli were tested for their ability to reduce L-Met-(S)-sulfoxide and L-Met-(R)-sulfoxide. The assay was carried out according to the procedure described for the reduction of free MetO under “Experimental Procedures.” Both substrates were radiolabeled with35S. To investigate the possibility that another in vivobiological system might be able to utilizel-Met-(R)-sulfoxide for methionine biosynthesis, we compared the abilities of l-Met,l-Met-(S)-sulfoxide, andl-Met-(R)-sulfoxide to support growth of a methionine auxotroph strain of yeast. As summarized in TableII, all three substrates were able to support growth of the methionine auxotroph. Thus, although Met-(R)-sulfoxide cannot be reduced to methionine by MsrA, yeast must possess an alternative route by which the Risomer can be converted to methionine. Yeast and other organisms contain two MetO reductases, one (MsrA) that can reduce both free and protein-bound MetO, and another (FMsr) that is specific for free MetO. Therefore the ability of the methionine auxotroph to grow on Met-(R)-sulfoxide might reflect a lack of stereospecificity of the FMsr enzyme. To test this possibility we examined the ability of crude extracts of msrA null mutants of E. coliand yeast (i.e. extracts of strains that contains FMsr but no MsrA) to reduce the R and S isomers of35S-labeled MetO. As shown in TableIII, extracts of both null mutants exhibited the same stereospecificity as did MsrA. They both reduced theS isomer but not the R isomer. It was further shown that partially purified FMsr preparations of the E. coli enzyme exhibited the same stereospecificity. It is noteworthy that this preparation of FMsr was unable to reduce dabsyl-MetO peptide and did not cross-react with antibodies raised against pure E. coli MsrA (data not shown). In summary, our results imply that both E. coli and yeast have the ability to convertl-Met-(R)-sulfoxide to methionine in vivo by a mechanism that does not involve direct reduction catalyzed by either MsrA or FMsr.Table IISurvival rates of methionine auxotroph yeast cells growing on either L-Met-(S)-sulfoxide or L-Met-(R)-sulfoxideMediumNumber of colony-forming units (40 μl of cells after 1:104 dilution)Synthetic medium − Met:0Synthetic medium + Met:164Synthetic medium + Met-(S)-sulfoxide:116Synthetic medium + Met-(R)-sulfoxide:177Methionine auxotroph yeast cells (X963–18C MATα met2 his8 ade8) were grown in synthetic medium containing 0.17 mm either Met or the R or S form of MetO, as indicated.

After the appropriate dilution, the cells were grown on plates containing the same medium + 2% agar. The number of colony-forming units were counted. In this study we describe the identification of a region in the MsrA protein (GCFWG) that is shared with 100% conservation by all known MsrA proteins, except for the one from N. gonorrhoeae(Pilb), which is about double the size of other MsrAs and retains a thioredoxin like motif in its N-terminal region (14.Wizemann T.M. Moskovitz J. Pearce B.J. Cundell D. Arvidson C.G. So M. Weissbach H. Brot N. Masure R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7985-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of each of the amino acids in this region resulted in either total loss of MsrA activity (when residues Cys, Phe, and Trp were mutated) or caused the enzyme to be less active (when either of the two Gly residues were mutated) (Table I). None of the mutations had a significant effect on the secondary structure of the MsrA, as judged by CD and far UV spectroscopy, which could account for the total loss of their MsrA activity. It was noted that in each of the Trp27 and Phe26 mutants, an aromatic amino acid residue was replaced with a non-aromatic residue. This may cause a conformational strain on the polypeptide backbone, as reflected by the slightly altered CD spectra of these mutant proteins. For comparison, the Cys25 substitution showed exactly the same CD spectra as the native protein, since in this case there was no aromatic amino acid involved. This possible explanation was suggested by Fasman (15.Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 124-125Google Scholar). Overall, it seems to us that the shift that was observed with regard to the Trp27 and Phe26 mutants in comparison with the native or Cys25 mutant CD spectra is not due to denaturation of the proteins nor to small conformational differences, which would lead to a total loss of activity (Fig. 1). The crystal structure of the MsrA protein is not yet known. but results of preliminary studies with crystals of the yeast MsrA confirms the presence of a high level of β-strand configuration, 2C. S. Raman and J. Moskovitz, unpublished information. consistent with our CD results. The core of the consensus motif (CFW) appears to be the most important from the standpoint of MsrA activity. The observation that MsrA activity is inhibited by iodoacetamide is consistent with the proposition that cysteine sulfhydryl groups are important for catalytic activity. This together with the consideration that Cys25 is the only Cys residue conserved in MsrA protein from several sources and the fact that substitution of serine for Cys25 leads to inactivation of the enzyme suggests that alkylation of Cys25 is mainly responsible for the inactivation of MsrA activity by iodoacetamide and invites speculation that Cys25 may participate in the transfer of electrons from thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system to MetO. Among other possibilities, it seem plausible that the reduction of MetO occurs by way of Reactions 2–R6 as follows. MetO+ESH→Met+ESOHEquation 2 ESOH+Th(SH) 2→ES­SThSH+H2OEquation 3 ES­SThSH→ESH+Th(S­S)Equation 4 NADPH+H++Th(S­S)→NADP++Th(SH) 2Equation 5 Sum:NADPH+H++MetO→NADP++MetEquation 6 REACTIONS 2–6in which ESH and ESOH refer to the reduced and sulfenic acid derivatives of Cys25 in MsrA, and Th(SH)2 and Th(S-S) refer to the fully reduced and oxidized forms of thioredoxin, respectively. DTT could replace thioredoxin in the in vitro system. However, this mechanism does not account for the fact that Phe26 and Trp27 are important players in the catalytic action of MsrA. Perhaps their proximity to the active cysteine moiety confers upon it unusual catalytic properties (viz. a favorable redox potential), but a direct role of these residues in the transfer of electrons is not excluded. The demonstration that the K m value for peptide-linked MetO for MsrA from bacteria is 3-fold higher than in eukaroytes is interesting, but its physiological relevance, if any, is not obvious. It is well known that the cellular regulation of critical enzymes in metabolism often involves alterations in theK m values for substrates in response to interactions of the enzymes with allosteric effectors. The possibility that cellular regulation of MsrA is subject to regulation of K mvalues for MetO should be considered. The finding that activity of MsrA is greatly increased by high ionic strength (Fig. 3) may have physiological implications. The level of MsrA is highest in the kidney medulla (3.Moskovitz J. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2095-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7.Moskovitz J. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jursky F. Weissbach H.

Renal Physiol. 1995; 5: 101-115Google Scholar). Thus the enhanced MsrA activity in high ionic strength may reflect the need to operate maximally in the kidney where reduction of MetO might serve an important salvage function for the recovery of methionine from oxidatively damaged proteins following their degradation by proteolytic enzymes that discriminate between native and oxidized proteins (2.Levine R.L.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 27-31Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The demonstration that yeast MsrA is stereospecific for Met-(S)-sulfoxide (Table IVand Ref. 20.Moskovitz J. Poston J.M. Berlett B.S. Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Abstract in FASEB J. 1999; 13 (abstr.): 1354Google Scholar) is true also for the bovine enzyme (21.Sharov V.S. Ferrington D.A. Squier T.C. Schoneich C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To the contrary it was reported that the dabsyl-Met-(R)-sulfoxide is a better substrate for MsrA in extracts of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (22.Minetti G. Baldini C. Brovelli A. Ital. J. Biochem. (Engl. Ed.). 1994; 43: 273-283PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for this difference in stereospecificity is not evident. It is significant that FMsr, the enzyme that is specific for free MetO (cannot reduce protein-bound MetO), is also stereospecific. Like MsrA from bacteria, yeast, and bovine, FMsr is able to reduce theS isomer but not the R isomer of free MetO (TableIII). This discounts the possibility that regeneration of methionine from protein-bound R-MetO could involve proteolytic degradation of the protein to release free R-MetO, followed by its reduction by FMsr. Nevertheless, the further observation that a methionine auxotroph of yeast is able to grow on both R and S forms of MetO (Table II) shows that in vivo, yeast are endowed with the ability to convert both R and S isomers of MetO to methionine. These results highlight the need for further studies to determine the mechanism by which Met-(R)-sulfoxide is converted to methionine (i.e. does it reflect the presence of a racemase able to interconvert the R and Sforms, or does it involve a more complicated mechanism?)Table IVStereospecific reduction of free L-Met-(S)-sulfoxide by the MsrASubstrate, 18 nmolMsrAProductsRMetOSMetOMetRmetO−180.00.0RMetO+180.00.0SMetO−018.00.0SMetO+02.515.5The ability to reduce either L-Met-(S)-sulfoxide (SMetO) or L-Met-(R)-sulfoxide (RMetO) to methionine (Met) by the yeast MsrA was analyzed by incubating each L-MetO form (18 nmol) with and without yeast MsrA (2 μg) in phosphate-buffered saline buffer for 60 min at 37 °C (final volume 30 μl).

The formation of the final product of glycolysis, pyruvate, from glucose is achieved by nine enzymatic steps, most of which function in the reverse direction during gluconeogenesis. The phosphorylating NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)1 occupies a pivotal role in the Embden-Meyerhoff pathway not only in glycolysis but also in gluconeogenesis because of the reversibility of the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) into 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (1,3dPG). In plants, two distinct types of phosphorylating GAPDH co-exist: (i) a strictly NAD-dependent cytoplasmic GAPDH involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis; and (ii) a chloroplastic GAPDH, which is involved in photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and exhibits a dual coenzyme specificity with a preference for NADP (1.Cerff R. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.-H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier/North Holland, Amsterdam1982: 683-694Google Scholar, 2.Martin W. Cerff R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 159: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recently, two gap genes, named gap1 andgap2, have been characterized in the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis sp. PPC 6803. The NAD-dependent enzyme Gap1 was reported to be essential for glycolytic glucose breakdown, whereas the enzyme Gap2, which exhibits dual coenzyme specificity, was shown to be operative in the photosynthetic Calvin cycle and in nonphotosynthetic gluconeogenesis (3.Koksharova O. Schubert M. Shestakov S. Cerff R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, at least in some photo-autotrophic bacterial species (in which the photosynthetic Calvin cycle and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis function in the same cellular compartment, in contrast to what happens in land plants and algae) two distinct GAPDHs, a strictly NAD-dependent one and the photosynthetic one, catalyze the two opposing directions of the reaction. The primary structure of GAPDH is highly conserved in bacteria and eukarya. Their active form is tetrameric. Different GAPDH functions can be correlated to differences in GAPDH structure, which favor either NAD or NADP binding and then a catabolic rather than an anabolic carbon flow, and vice versa. Indeed, it has been shown from studies combining structural, enzymatic, and protein engineering approaches that both the presence of Asp at position 32 and Leu-Pro at positions 187–188, the latter being located at the subunit interfaces of the tetramer, excluded any activity with NADP+, whereas the presence of Gly or Ala at position 32 and Ala-Ser at position 187–188 favored an NADP-dependent activity (4.Corbier C. Clermont S. Billard P. Skarsynski T. Branlant C. Wonacott A. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7101-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5.Clermont S. Corbier C. Mely Y. Gerard D. Wonacott A. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10178-10184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Removing steric hindrance and/or electrostatic interactions from position 32 or introducing side chains of amino acids at positions 187–188 that stabilize the 2′-ribose phosphate binding can confer specificity for NADP+ and thus discriminate against NAD+. Thus, the presence of such signatures is a good indicator of efficient NADP+ binding and therefore of the involvement of the GAPDH in anabolic carbon flux. The analysis of the genome sequence of Bacillus subtilis (6.Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of two putative gap genes, the previously described gap (renamed gapA) andgapB. The deduced amino acid sequences indicate different signatures at positions 32 and 187 (see Fig. 2), which suggested different physiological roles of both GAPDHs. To verify this hypothesis, both genes have been inactivated and the resulting mutant strains were tested for the utilization of various carbon sources. The enzymatic properties of GapB were also studied and compared with those of a mutant GapA from Bacillus stearothermophilus in which the amino acids present in GapB from B. subtilis at positions 32 and 187 were introduced. Taken together, our data reveal that the reversible oxidative phosphorylation of G3P into 1,3dPG is catalyzed by two different proteins in B. subtilis.

Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). One unit of β-galactosidase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 nmol of O-nitrophenol/min at 20 °C/mg of protein. Initial rate measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a Kontron Uvikon 933 spectrophotometer by following the absorbance of NAD(P)H at 340 nm. The experimental conditions for the enzymatic assays were 40 mmtriethanolamine, pH 9.2, and 10 mm PIPES, pH 7, for the forward and the reverse reactions, respectively. The turnover number (k cat) was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 1.53 × 105m−1·cm−1 and 1.17.105m−1 cm for the apoenzymes of B. subtilis and B. stearothermophilus, respectively. The k cat is expressed per site (N). The initial rate data of the forward reaction were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten relationship using least squares analysis to determinek cat and K m. All cofactorK m values were determined at saturating concentration of G3P and Pi. Site-directed mutageneses (12.Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) were performed on a pBluescriptII-derived plasmid containing the gapA gene of B. stearothermophilus. Purification of mutant GAPDHs was performed as described previously for other B. stearothermophilus mutants (13.Talfournier F. Colloc'h N. Mornon J.P. Branlant G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All the mutants were isolated as apo form, as judged by the ratioA280 /A260 of 2. The enzyme was produced in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS transformed with plasmid pT7GapB1. The overexpression of GapB was performed by the addition of 0.4 mm IPTG in the culture medium at 0.8 A 600. After 3 h of induction, cultures were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm phosphate, pH 8.2) containing 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. After sonication, B. subtilis GapB was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation (50–70%) and exclusion size chromatography on ACA 34 resin at pH 8.2 (buffer A). Purified fractions were then pooled and applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A followed by a linear gradient of KCl (0–1m) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The B. subtilis GapB was eluted at 300 mm KCl. At this stage, the protein was pure as revealed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The subunit molecular weight of GapB was verified by mass spectrometry. The protein was isolated as apo form, as judged by the ratio A280 /A260 of 1.8. GapB concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 1.53 × 103m−1 cm−1, as deduced from the Scopes method (14.Scopes R.K. Anal. BIochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Purified enzyme was stored at 4 °C in the presence of 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and of 70% ammonium sulfate. To investigate the physiological roles of the two B. subtilisGAPDH-encoding genes, we constructed the corresponding gapAand gapB mutant strains, GM1501 and GM1500, respectively. The pMUTIN2mcs-derived plasmids (9.Vagner V. Dervyn E. Ehrlich S.D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3097-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) used for these constructions allowed, simultaneously with the disruption or the deletion of the target gene, (i) the creation of a transcriptional fusion of the 5′-part of the target gene to the lacZ gene; and (ii) the control of the expression of downstream gene(s) putatively belonging to the same operon via the IPTG-inducible Pspacpromoter, to reduce possible polar effects (Fig.1, A and C). The GM1501 gapA insertional mutant grew as well as the parental strain on LB only when IPTG was added. This suggested that the downstream glycolytic genes, pgk, tpi,pgm, and eno, are significantly transcribed from a promoter located upstream of gapA. Conversely, the growth rate of the GM1500 gapB mutant strain on LB was not affected by the presence of IPTG. Growth tests of both mutant strains, GM1500 and GM1501, revealed opposite phenotypes as shown in Fig. 1, B and D. GM1500 could not grow in MM medium containing asparagine as a sole carbon source but presented the same growth rate as the 168CA parent in glucose-containing MM medium. The phenotype of GM1500 was identical when IPTG was added to the growth medium (data not shown), indicating that only the gapB inactivation was responsible for the growth defect. The opposite phenotype was observed for thegapA mutant strain, GM1501 (strongly reduced growth in glucose medium and normal growth in asparagine medium (both evaluated in the presence of IPTG)). Similar results were obtained when glycerol or glucitol were used instead of glucose, and when proline or succinate plus glutamate was used instead of asparagine (data not shown). ThusgapA is required for glycolysis, whereas gapB is required for gluconeogenesis. Both mutant and wild-type strains were cultivated in LB medium supplemented with glucose, representing glycolytic physiological conditions, and LB medium supplemented with proline, representing gluconeogenic conditions, to ensure significant growth of the three strains in both media. GAPDH activity was measured by the oxydation of G3P to 1,3dPG using either NAD+ or NADP+ as coenzyme. Extracts from the 168CA strain showed roughly 5 times higher NAD-dependent activity under glycolytic conditions than under gluconeogenic conditions (TableIII). NADP-dependent activity could be detected only under gluconeogenic growth conditions. This latter activity completely disappeared in the GM1500 (gapB −) strain, and no NAD-dependent GAPDH-activity could be detected in the GM1501 (gapA−) strain. These results suggest that GapA and GapB proteins have different cofactor specificities, NAD+for GapA and NADP+ for GapB. In glucose-containing medium the gapA encoded NAD-dependent activity is higher than in proline medium, whereas NADP-dependent GAPDH activity probably encoded by gapB can only be detected under gluconeogenic growth conditions.Table IIINAD + - and NADP + -dependent GAPDH activity in B. subtilis wild-type (168CA), gapA (GM1501), and gapB (GM1500) strainsStrainCulture mediumaLB supplemented by glucose (Glc) or proline (Pro).168CA (wild-type)GM1501 (gapA′)GM1500 (ΔgapB)GlcProGlcProGlcProNAD+-dependent GAPDH activitybOne unit corresponds to 1 nmol of NADH (or NADPH) produced/min and per A 280.

Open table in a new tab Amino acid sequences of bacterial GAPDHs were aligned (Fig. 2). Based on the known cofactor and substrate signatures, three types of phosphorylating GAPDHs can be distinguished. The first two types, named GapA and erythrose-4-phosphate dehydrogenase, possess a typical NAD+signature with Asp or Glu at position 32 and amino acids at position 187–188, which are known to prevent an efficient binding of NADP+ (4.Corbier C. Clermont S. Billard P. Skarsynski T. Branlant C. Wonacott A. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7101-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5.Clermont S. Corbier C. Mely Y. Gerard D. Wonacott A. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10178-10184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). But they differ in substrate specificity, with typical signatures at position 179 and around position 208, which favor the binding of either G3P for GapA or erythrose 4-phosphate for erythrose-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (15.Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Pollastro D. Corbier C. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15106-15112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The third type, named GapB, which is G3P-specific (3.Koksharova O. Schubert M. Shestakov S. Cerff R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), contains a cofactor signature that supports a dual coenzyme specificity with a preference for NADP+(5.Clermont S. Corbier C. Mely Y. Gerard D. Wonacott A. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10178-10184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Indeed, this signature either resembles that of chloroplastic GAPDH, with Asp at position 32 but with amino acids at position 187–188 that stabilize NADP+ binding, or presents no Asp at position 32 but amino acids at positions 32 and/or 187–188, which could stabilize NADP+ binding. In this context, GapA from B. subtilis has the typical signature of an NAD-dependent GAPDH with Asp-32, Leu-187, and Pro-188. This signature and its overall 85% sequence identity with the B. stearothermophilus GapA suggest that GapA fromB. subtilis has enzymatic characteristics very similar to those of the well studied GapA from B. stearothermophilus(5.Clermont S. Corbier C. Mely Y. Gerard D. Wonacott A. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10178-10184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16.Didierjean C. Rahuel-Clermon S. Vitoux B. Dideberg O. Branlant G. Aubry A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 739-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, the B. subtilis GapB, with Ala and Asn at position 32 and 187, respectively, probably presents a dual cofactor signature. TheB. subtilis GapB protein was overproduced in E. coli, purified, and separated from the E. coli GapA protein by taking advantage of its higher hydrophobicity and its lower isoelectric point. GapB showed activity with G3P in the forward direction but only in the presence of Pi, whereas 1,3dPG was the substrate in the reverse direction (data not shown). This demonstrated that the GAPDH activity was of the phosphorylating type. The kinetic parameters determined for GapB, in the forward direction (k cat and K m for cofactors), are summarized in Table IV. The apparent affinity is about 7-fold higher for NADP+ than for NAD+ with a 50-fold higher catalytic efficiency. These results demonstrated that B. subtilis GapB has a strong preference for NADP+ as a cofactor. Mutations at the two signature positions, 32 and 187, in the B. stearothermophilus GapA protein were shown to increase NADP-dependent GAPDH activity and to decrease NAD-dependent GAPDH activity (Table IV). Whereas the wild-type B. stearothermophilus GapA protein had no detectable activity with NADP+ as cofactor, the D32A/L187N double mutant GapA protein clearly showed a catalytic efficiency with NADP+ similar to that observed with the B. subtilis GapB protein and higher than that measured with NAD+.Table IVKinetic parameters of purified GapB GAPDH from B. subtilis and of purified wild-type and mutant GapA GAPDH from B. stearothermophilusCoenzyme kinetic parametersaGAPDH activity was determined at saturating concentrations of G3P and Pi; each value is the average of at least three independent determinations.NADNADPK Mk catk cat/K MK Mk catk cat/K Mmms −1s −1 · mm −1mms −1s −1 · mm −1B. subtilis GapB5.71.00.180.868.09.3B. stearothermophilus GapAbFrom Ref. 5.0.170700NDcNot detectable (k cat < 10−3s−1).NDcNot detectable (k cat < 10−3s−1).NDcNot detectable (k cat < 10−3s−1).

Open table in a new tab As the levels of GAPDH activities encoded by gapA andgapB are modulated in response to the growth conditions, we looked for a transcriptional regulation of the expression of these genes. A series of transcriptional fusions to the lacZ gene were constructed. As gapA is predicted to be the second gene of an operon, three different reporter constructs have been designed (Fig. 3 A) to analyze its transcription pattern and to test whether its expression is driven from the region located immediately upstream of the gapA ORF or from the region located between the araE terminator and the initiation codon of the yvbQ ORF, the first gene of the putative gapA operon. These fusions, carried by plasmids pSF111 to pSF113, as well as the fusion of the gapB promoter region with lacZ carried by the plasmid pSF114 (Fig. 3), were integrated as single copy at the amyE locus of B. subtilis 168CA strain, and the β-galactosidase activities of the resulting strains, GM1511 to GM1514, respectively, were measured during growth in glucose or succinate plus glutamate minimal medium. In GM1511, lacZ expression was found to be roughly constant during the exponential and the beginning of the stationary phases of growth, but 4-fold higher in glucose than in succinate plus glutamate medium (Fig. 3 B). Similar patterns of lacZexpression were found in GM1512 with a 4–5-fold stimulation of the expression in glucose medium (data not shown). On the other hand, no expression was detected in GM1513 (data not shown). These results indicated that yvbQ and gapA form an operon and that gapA transcription is driven from a promoter located between araE and yvbQ. The β-galactosidase synthesis in GM1514, reflecting gapB expression, remained also roughly constant through the exponential and the beginning of the stationary phase of growth but was at least 50-fold higher in succinate plus glutamate than in glucose medium. Very similar patterns of expression were found when glycerol and proline were used instead of glucose and succinate plus glutamate, respectively (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that gapA and gapB expressions are transcriptionally regulated in an opposite manner; under glycolytic conditions, gapA expression is stimulated, whereas that ofgapB is nearly completely repressed. Conversely, during gluconeogenesis, gapB transcription is strongly activated, whereas gapA is expressed at a basal level. Searches for similarities revealed that the deduced product of yvbQ, located upstream ofgapA, belongs to the SorC/DeoR family of transcriptional regulators (data not shown). Its similarity is particularly strong with three ORFs, Urf1 (17.Schläepfer B.S. Zuber P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), YgaP (18.Branny P. de la Torre F. Garel J.R. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and ORF1′ (19.Schreiber W. Dürre P. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), linked togap genes in Bacillus megaterium,Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Clostridium acetobutylicum, respectively. The functions of these ORFs have not yet been identified. To test a possible role of yvbQ in the regulation of gapA transcription, we constructed the strain BFS1080, which carries a transcriptional fusion between the promoter region of the yvbQ-gapA operon and the lacZ gene, and is disrupted for yvbQ. Then, either the pSF120 plasmid, a pDG1662-derived vector expressing the wild-type yvbQ gene, or the parental pDG1662 plasmid was integrated into BFS1080 at theamyE locus creating the GM1520 or the GM1521 strains, respectively. Although lacZ was expressed constitutively at a high level in GM1521 (yvbQ −), it was expressed at a low level in the presence of succinate plus glutamate and 6-fold stimulated in the presence of glucose in GM1520 (yvbQ+) (Table V). A similar stimulation oflacZ expression was observed when the strain GM1520 was grown in minimal medium containing both glucose and succinate plus glutamate. The lacZ expression pattern in GM1520 and GM1521 remained the same when glycerol was used in place of glucose or proline in place of succinate plus glutamate (Table V). These results demonstrated that the yvbQ gene product is a repressor of the yvbQ-gapA operon and that its activity is inhibited by the presence of glycolytic carbon sources.Table VEffect of yvbQ and ccpA mutations on transcription of th"

Double recordings from synaptically coupled neurons maintained in heterogenotypic cocultures showed that synaptic strength of excitatory but not inhibitory synapses depended on expression of NCAM post- but not presynaptically. This correlated with higher levels of potentiation and synaptic coverage of NCAM-expressing neurons compared to NCAM-deficient neurons in heterogenotypic cocultures. Synaptic density was the same in homogenotypic cultures of NCAM-deficient and wild-type neurons as well as in heterogenotypic cocultures in which glutamate receptors were blocked. These observations indicate that the relative levels of postsynaptic NCAM expression control synaptic strength in an activity-dependent manner by regulating the number of synapses."

To explore the molecular mechanism of activation, we screened genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated by hypoxia. Fibroblasts isolated from fetal rat lung were cultured under hypoxia. Differential display technique showed that the mRNA level of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (PH) α(I), an active subunit that catalyzes the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of proline residue in procollagen, increased 2–3-fold after an 8-h exposure to hypoxia. This elevated level was maintained over 40 h and returned to the basal level after reoxygenation. The transcription rate, protein level, and hydroxyproline content (an indicator of the prolyl hydroxylation) were all elevated by hypoxic culture. Analysis of the promotor region of PHα(I) gene indicated that a motif similar to hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) of hypoxia-inducible genes such as erythropoietin, was identified within a 120-base pair sequence upstream of the transcription start site. Luciferase reporter assay and mutational analysis showed that a site similar to the HRE in this motif is functionally essential to hypoxic response.

Recent studies have revealed that in vivoexposure of rats to hypoxia increases prolyl hydroxylase activity in skeletal muscle (13.Perhonen M. Han X. Wang W. Karpakka J. Takala T.E. J. Appl.

These observations indicate that systemic and cellular hypoxia modulates collagen synthesis in several types of cells. Synthesis of collagen molecules can be regulated at several steps (17.Hay E.D. Collagen. Plenum Press, New York, NY1991Google Scholar). After translation, procollagens are hydroxylated on proline residues at the endoplasmic reticulum and form stable triple-helical trimers. The secreted procollagen trimer is proteolytically cleaved at both N-and C-propeptides in the extracellular space, where collagen trimers polymerize and are deposited nonenzymatically. These sequential steps of collagen synthesis and hypoxic effects on several stages in the expression of multiple types of collagen genes imply that hypoxic regulatory factors may be involved in common reactions during the collagen synthesis process. To explore the molecular mechanism, we screened hypoxia-responsive genes in isolated fetal rat lung fibroblasts using the differential display method. We subsequently found that prolyl 4-hydroxylase (PH) α(I), an active subunit that catalyzes oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of proline residue in procollagen, is up-regulated by hypoxia via HIF-1 transcription factor complex. Fibroblasts were isolated from the fetal rat lung at 19 days of gestation (18.Batenburg J.J. Otto-Verberne C.J. Ten-Have-Opbroek A.A. Klazinga W. Biochim. Biophys.

These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm minimum essential medium nonessential amino acid, 1× minimum essential medium vitamin, and 15 mmHEPES (pH 7.4). Fetal rat lung fibroblasts between the 20th and 25th passages were used for the experiments. The mouse hepatoma cell lines Hepa-1c1c7 (Hepa-1) and its ARNT-defective derivative, Hepa-c4, were generously supplied by O. Hankinson. Hepa-c4 cells lack ARNT function and also fail to express the ARNT protein (19.Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in the minimal essential medium-α without nucleosides (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). At subconfluence, cells were exposed to hypoxia or treated with chemicals. Exposures of cells to hypoxia were performed as described previously (9.Takahashi Y. Takahashi S. Yoshimi T. Miura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 200 μm ascorbic acid was added to the medium. We followed the fluorescent differential display method developed by Itoet al. (20.Ito T. Kito K. Adati N. Mitsui Y. Hagiwara H. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) with several modifications, as described in a previous paper (9.Takahashi Y. Takahashi S. Yoshimi T. Miura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transcriptional run-on assay was performed as described previously (9.Takahashi Y. Takahashi S. Yoshimi T. Miura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The amount of PHα(I) transcript was standardized by comparison with the β-actin signal. Probes for RNA blot analysis were prepared by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with rat total RNA extracted from the lung as mentioned previously (21.Takahashi Y. Oakes S.M. Williams M.C. Takahashi S. Miura T. Joyce-Brady M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 143: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The following sense and antisense primers were used: rat PHα(I), DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM accession no. X78949, nucleotides 103–122, and nucleotides 1085–1066. RNA blotting was performed as described previously (22.Takahashi Y. Takahashi S. Yoshimi T. Miura T. Mochitate K. Kobayashi T. Biochemical Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1061-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After analysis of the PHα(I) mRNA level, the probe was stripped with a low salt wash at 90 °C. The membrane was reprobed for 28 S rRNA. The intensity of the mRNA was normalized to the 28 S rRNA signal (23.Barbu V. Dautry F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The fibroblast monolayer was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then scraped and pelleted by centrifugation at 100 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were washed once with PBS. The cell pellets were suspended in a 10× volume of 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mglycine, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 4 °C) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and kept on ice for 10 min, followed by homogenization in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer at 1200 rpm with 10 up-and-down strokes. The homogenate was analyzed for PHα by protein blotting. Protein blotting was performed as mentioned previously (9.Takahashi Y. Takahashi S. Yoshimi T. Miura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with some modifications. For PHα detection, equivalent amounts of protein from each sample were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electrically transferred overnight at 25 °C from the gel to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were incubated with mouse anti-rat PHα monoclonal antibody (Fuji Chemical, Toyama, Japan) at 0.3 μg IgG per ml of 0.1% Tween 20-Tris-buffered saline (TTBS) for 1 h at 25 °C, and then rinsed three times in TTBS for 15 min. The blotted membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:3000 for 1 h. After four washes with TTBS, antibody-antigen complexes were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To analyze hydroxy proline in the culture medium, fibroblasts at subconfluency were cultured in 10% FCS-DMEM with or without 200 μm ascorbic acid under either 20 or 0% O2for 24 h. For the next 24 h, cells were maintained in 0.1% FCS-DMEM with or without 200 μm ascorbic acid under either 20 or 0% O2. The culture medium was collected and hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 16 h at 116 °C. To analyze the hydroxy proline in the cells and cell-associated matrix, subconfluent fibroblasts were cultured for 8 days. The culture medium was changed every other day. After three washes with PBS, the cell layer was harvested by scraping and hydrolyzed. The 4-hydroxy proline in the hydrolyzate was determined by the colorimetric method (24.Berg RA. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 372-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 25.Inayama S. Shibata T. Ohtsuki J. Saito S. Keio J. Med. 1978; 27: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The DNA content of the cell homogenate was assayed by the fluorochrometric method using DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 (26.Cesarone C.F. Bolognesi C. Santi L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The protein content was measured by the colorimetric method using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit, according to the manufacturer's manual. BSA was used as the standard. The rat genomic library was screened against rat PHα(I) cDNA probe containing a 5′-untranslated region. One clone covering from 1.9 kb 5′-upstream of the transcription starting site to the first exon was selected to analyze responses of PHα(I) gene to hypoxia. 2S. Takahashi, Y. Takahashi, and T. Miura, manuscript in preparation. A region from –1.9 kb to +68 bases (transcription start site was transiently determined by the 5′-RACE method, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was ligated to Photinus pyralis luciferase reporter vector (pGL3-basic, Promega, Madison, WI) and designated prPHLUC19. Deletion mutants of prPHLUC19 containing regions from –117 to +68 and from –68 to +68, were constructed and designated prPHLUC(–117) and prPHLUC(–68), respectively. Mutation of the putative HRE sequence 5′-CGCACGTA-3′ (27.Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) at position –86 to –79 in the sense DNA strand of the prPHLUC(–117) plasmid by replacement of the bases ACG with TTT to construct prPHLUC(–117)m was introduced by using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Subconfluent cultures of rat lung fibroblasts, Hepa-1 cells, and Hepa-c4 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes. When the cultures reached subconfluence, cells were transfected by PHα(I)-luciferase chimeric plasmids, the promotor-less luciferase plasmid (a negative control vector, pGL3-basic, Promega, Madison, WI) or the SV40-promoter/enhancer containing luciferase plasmid (a positive control vector, pGL3-control) concomitantly with 0.1 μg of pRL-SV40, an internal control plasmid containing Renilla reniformis luciferase gene. Test plasmid (0.45 pmol), 5 μl of FuGENE6 trasfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 95 μl of serum-free medium complex were added to the cultured cells. After 24 h incubation, cells were exposed to hypoxic gas for 16 h, and then lysed. Cell lysates were used to determine luciferase activity using Lumat LB 9501 (EG & G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The cell monolayer was washed once with PBS and then scraped. After centrifugation at 100 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, cell pellets were washed once with PBS, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen for more than 5 min, and thawed on ice for 5–10 min with a 5-fold cell-packed volume of cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 420 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1× CompleteTM (protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 20% glycerol). Cells were lysed at 4 °C by multiple (20.Ito T. Kito K. Adati N. Mitsui Y. Hagiwara H. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) passages through a 26 gauge needle, followed by centrifugation at 12000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –85 °C until use. Mouse Epo 3′-enhancer oligonucleotide (5′-GCC CTA CGT GCT GCC TCG CAT GGC-3′) (27.Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), PHα(I) 5′-enhancer oligonucleotide (from –91 to –74, numbered with the transcription start site as +1; 5′-CTG AGC GCA CGT AGC GAG-3′), and PHα(I)-M oligonucleotide (5′-CTG AGC GC T TT T AGC GAG-3′) were used as probes or competitors. Both strands of oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (111 TBq/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then annealed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl by heating at 80 °C for 5 min followed by gradual cooling to 25 °C over 60 min. The annealed probes were purified by passing them through an NAP-column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A typical DNA binding reaction was carried out by mixing 15 μg of cell extract with 20 μl of DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 280 ng of sonicated poly(dI-dC), 1× CompleteTM) for 5 min at 25 °C. Probes (20 fmol) and competitors (2 pmol) were added and incubated for a further 10 min at 25 °C. Reaction products were electrophoresed at 4 °C on 5% polyacrylamide in 30 mm Tris/30 mm boric acid, 0.3 mm EDTA (pH 7.3 at 20 °C). For supershift assay, 1 μg of monoclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (H1α67, Novus Biochemical, Littleton, CO) or anti-Flag-epitope tag antibody as control (M5, Sigma), were incubated with 15 μg of whole cell extract at 4 °C for 90 min. Analyses of significant differences between data sets were performed by the use of Student's t test or Welch's t test after analysis of variance. Values ofp < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Gene products up-regulated or down-regulated by a 16-h exposure of fetal rat lung fibroblasts to 0% O2 were screened by the differential display technique using 104 combinations of arbitrary primers and anchor primers. Polymerase chain reaction with arbitrary primer 5′-TTTTGGCTCC-3′ and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anchor primer 5′-GT15VA amplified a fragment at base pair 350, where the intensity from hypoxic cells is higher than that from normoxic cells (Fig.1, left). This difference was confirmed by amplification with the same pair of primers using [35S]dCTP (Fig. 1, right). Cloning of this band combined with a computer search of sequence similarity revealed that this amplified DNA was the 3′-fragment of PHα(I) cDNA. To examine the response of PHα(I) gene expression to low oxygen culture, the steady state level of PHα(I) mRNA was determined by RNA blot analysis. Fibroblasts at subconfluency were cultured for 16 h at various concentrations of O2 from 20 to 0%. The PHα(I) mRNA level increased in a hypoxic stress-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). The PHα(I) mRNA signal, normalized to 28 S rRNA, increased to 1.3-fold the control after 3% O2 culture. This response was enhanced by hypoxic conditions of 2 to 0% O2. Increases in the PHα(I) mRNA level after hypoxia reached their peak at 0% O2, a value 3.0-fold that of the 20% O2 control. Time dependence was determined in the cells cultured under 0% O2 (Fig. 2 B). An increase in the PHα(I) mRNA level became evident after 8 h hypoxia and reached its maximum after 16 h. This increased level was maintained for 40 h of hypoxic exposure. After fibroblasts were returned from 16 h of hypoxic culture to normoxic atmosphere (reoxygenation), the elevated level of PHα(I) mRNA decreased slightly after 4 h reoxygenation and returned to the prehypoxic value after 24 h of reoxygenation. IMR-90 and WI-38, human fetal lung fibroblast cell lines, also showed increases in the PHα(I) mRNA level by 2.5–3.0-fold the normoxic control in response to 16 h of hypoxic exposure (data not shown). The increase of PHα(I) mRNA levels by hypoxic cultures pointed to a transcriptional effect on PHα(I) expression. To assess this aspect, we measured PHα(I) gene transcription in isolated nuclei. The transcriptional rate of PHα(I), normalized to the β-actin signal, significantly increased to 2.2-fold (p < 0.05) and 3.3-fold (p< 0.05) of the normoxic control after 4 and 8 h of exposure to 0% O2, respectively (Fig.3). Transcription of β-actin appeared to be unchanged under the same conditions. LDH-A, a positive control gene (6.Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21021-21027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), showed 1.4- and 1.8-fold (p < 0.05) increases in the relative transcription rate after 4 and 8 h of 0% O2 exposure, respectively. Vector DNA did not show any signal. To determine the protein level of PHα in fibroblasts, we probed the whole cell homogenate by protein blotting for the presence of PHα protein. Anti-rat PHα monoclonal antibody detected a band at 63,000 daltons in the fibroblasts, which co-migrated with authentic PHα(I) (Fig. 4 A). After 4 h of exposure to 0% O2, the protein level of PHα significantly increased to 1.3-fold (p < 0.05) the control level (Fig. 4 B). The protein level reached its peak after 24 h of 0% O2 exposure, which was 1.9-fold (p < 0.05) the control. The elevated level was maintained after 32 h exposure to hypoxia. This protein response to hypoxic culture was similar to that observed for mRNA levels. Hydroxylation of proline residue in procollagen occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is important for stabilizing the procollagen trimer. Hydroxylated procollagen is assembled for secretion from the cell to the culture medium, in which the C- and N-propeptides of procollagen are cleaved enzymatically, resulting in deposition of collagen polymers on the cell surface. To assess the in vivohydroxylation activity, fibroblasts were cultured under either normoxia or hypoxia in the presence or absence of ascorbic acid. We determined the levels of hydroxy- proline residue secreted from fibroblasts into the medium over 24 h. With the addition of ascorbic acid, hypoxic culture had no significant effect on the hydroxyproline content of the conditioned medium (Fig. 5 A). Under normoxic culture, ascorbic acid depletion decreased the hydroxyproline content of the medium to 7% of the ascorbic acid-sufficient culture. Interestingly, without ascorbic acid, hypoxic culture restored the hydroxyproline level from 7 to 58% of ascorbic acid-supplemented and normoxic cultures. We analyzed the hydroxyproline residue that had accumulated in the cell or cell-associated matrix during the 8-day confluent culture period. Ascorbic acid and hypoxic culture affected the hydroxyproline level in the cell and cell associated matrix, in the same pattern as was observed in the culture medium (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that hypoxia-induced accumulation of PHα(I) mRNA leads to elevated protein levels, which then contribute to the maintenance of hydroxylation in ascorbic acid-supplemented cultures as well as to elevation of hydroxylation in ascorbic acid-deficient cultures. Glucose transporter 1 is up-regulated by depletion of either ATP or oxygen (28.Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a transcription factor that regulates hypoxic induction of a variety of genes. CoCl2 and desferroxamine (Des), an iron chelator, can mimic the HIF-1 response to hypoxia (29.Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). To determine whether the HIF-1 related pathway or ATP depletion in mitochondria is involved in the up-regulation of PHα(I) by hypoxia, HIF-1 inducers (CoCl2and Des) and mitochondrial inhibitors (rotenone, azide, and cyanide) were added to the fibroblast cultures. Total RNA was extracted from cells that were treated with chemicals for 16 h and then the PHα(I) mRNA level was determined by RNA blotting analysis. CoCl2 (50–200 μm) and Des (50–200 μm) increased the PHα(I) mRNA level by 1.8–4.7-fold in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6). Rotenone (0.25 and 2.5 μm), NaN3 (1 and 10 μm), and cyanide (3–300 μm) increased the PHα(I) mRNA up to 1.3-fold. This increase was far less than that of hypoxic induction. Hepa-c4, the ARNT-defective cell, and Hepa-1, its wild type cell, were exposed to 1, 2, and 20% O2 for 16 h, and analyzed for PHα(I) response. The level of PHα(I) mRNA in Hepa-1 cells was apparently enhanced (Fig.7). However, PHα(I) mRNA levels in Hepa-c4 cells did not change under hypoxic stress. This result indicates that ARNT may be an essential transcription factor subunit for hypoxic induction of PHα(I) mRNA in Hepa-1 cells. To assess regulatory elements that delineate hypoxic up-regulation of the PHα(I) gene, we screened the rat genomic library against a rat PHα(I) cDNA probe containing a 5′-untranslated region. A clone covering from 1.9 kb 5′ upstream of the transcription starting site to the first exon2 was selected to analyze responses of the P4Hα(I) gene to hypoxia (these DNA sequences are not shown, but they have been deposited in the GenBankTM under accession numberAF197928). A 1.9-kb fragment (–1.9 kb to +68 bases) of rat PHα(I) promotor region was cloned in front of luciferase, and the resulting construct (prPHLUC19, Fig. 8 A) was transiently transfected in fibroblasts. Under normoxia, the transfected fibroblasts exhibited 88 times higher luciferase activity than cells transfected by promoterless Luc vector (pGL3-Basic), but 9 times lower activity than the SV40 promoter/enhancer vector (pGL3-Cont.) (Fig. 8 B). This suggests that the 1.9-kb promoter region has sufficient promoter activity to invest the hypoxic effects on the gene. Exposure of the transfected fibroblasts to hypoxia for 16 h stimulated luciferase expression by 5.5-fold (Fig.8 B). No significant effect was observed after hypoxic culture of cells transfected with promoter-less or SV40 vectors. Hepa-1 and its ARNT-defective mutant cell, Hepa-c4, were transfected with prPHLUC19. Hepa-1 showed a 3.7-fold induction of luciferase after 16 h of hypoxic culture (Fig. 8 B). In contrast, exposure of Hepa-c4 to hypoxia did not affect luciferase expression (Fig. 8 B). These results strongly suggest that the PHα(I) promoter may contain the hypoxia-responsive consensus sequence, which the HIF-1α·ARNT complex targets. Search for potential binding sites in the promoter region revealed one binding site (–79 to –86) matching the consensus for HIF-1α·ARNT (C/G/T)ACGTGC(G/T) (30.Semenza G.L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 131: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) on the antisense strand. A CACAG sequence (31.Lok C.N. Ponka P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24147-24152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), which seems to be necessary for hypoxic inducibility, was also identified from position –67 to –71 on the antisense strand. To define the promoter region that confers hypoxia responsiveness to PHα(I), we determined the luciferase activity of 5′-deletion constructs (Fig.9 A). The prPHLUC(–117), which included the HRE consensus sequence, showed a response to hypoxic exposure: 5.9-fold induction after 16 h of transfection to fetal lung fibroblasts (Fig. 9 B). However, the shorter construct, prPHLUC(–68), which lacked the HRE consensus, did not change luciferase activity after hypoxic culture. This HRE involvement in the PHα(I) response to hypoxia was further supported by a complete loss of hypoxic induction in a mutated chimera luciferase reporter, prPHLUC(–117)m (Fig. 9 B). After 16 h of hypoxia, prPHLUC(–117) showed a 6.0-fold induction in Hepa-1 cells but no change in Hepa-c4 cells (Fig. 9 B).Figure 9Analyses of PH α(I) promoter by deletion and mutation.

We have determined the crystal structure of the Homer EVH1 domain complexed with a peptide from mGluR (TPPSPF). In contrast to other EVH1 domains, the bound mGluR ligand assumes an unusual conformation in which the side chains of the Ser–Pro tandem are oriented away from the Homer surface, and the Phe forms a unique contact. This unusual binding mode rationalizes conserved features of both Homer and Homer ligands that are not shared by other EVH1 domains. Site-directed mutagenesis confirms the importance of specific Homer residues for ligand binding. These results establish a molecular basis for understanding the biological properties of Homer-ligand complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2040688084,"K(ATP) channels are large heteromultimeric complexes containing four subunits from the inwardly rectifying K+ channel family (Kir6.2) and four regulatory sulphonylurea receptor subunits from the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family (SUR1 and SUR2A/B). The molecular basis for interactions between these two unrelated protein families is poorly understood. Using novel trafficking-based interaction assays, coimmunoprecipitation, and current measurements, we show that the first transmembrane segment (M1) and the N terminus of Kir6.2 are involved in K(ATP) assembly and gating. Additionally, the transmembrane domains, but not the nucleotide-binding domains, of SUR1 are required for interaction with Kir6.2. The identification of specific transmembrane interactions involved in K(ATP) assembly may provide a clue as to how ABC proteins that transport hydrophobic substrates evolved to regulate other membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2025387130,"The present study examined a role for GDNF in adaptations to drugs of abuse. Infusion of GDNF into the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a dopaminergic brain region important for addiction, blocks certain biochemical adaptations to chronic cocaine or morphine as well as the rewarding effects of cocaine. Conversely, responses to cocaine are enhanced in rats by intra-VTA infusion of an anti-GDNF antibody and in mice heterozygous for a null mutation in the GDNF gene. Chronic morphine or cocaine exposure decreases levels of phosphoRet, the protein kinase that mediates GDNF signaling, in the VTA. Together, these results suggest a feedback loop, whereby drugs of abuse decrease signaling through endogenous GDNF pathways in the VTA, which then increases the behavioral sensitivity to subsequent drug exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2020699084,"Mutations in the Drosophila retinal degeneration A (rdgA) gene, which encodes diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), result in early onset retinal degeneration and blindness. Whole-cell recordings revealed that light-sensitive Ca2+ channels encoded by the trp gene were constitutively active in rdgA photoreceptors. Early degeneration was rescued in rdgA;trp double mutants, lacking TRP channels; however, the less Ca2+-permeable light-sensitive channels (TRPL) were constitutively active instead. No constitutive activity was seen in rdgA;trpI;trp mutants lacking both classes of channel, although, like rdgA;trp, these still showed a residual slow degeneration. Responses to light were restored in rdgA;trp but deactivated abnormally slowly, indicating that DGK is required for response termination. The findings suggest that early degeneration in rdgA is caused by uncontrolled Ca2+ influx and support the proposal that diacylglycerol or its metabolites are messengers of excitation in Drosophila photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1978143588,"The telomerase ribonucleoprotein has a phylogenetically divergent RNA subunit, which contains a short template for telomeric DNA synthesis. To understand how telomerase RNA participates in mechanistic aspects of telomere synthesis, we studied a conserved secondary structure adjacent to the template. Disruption of this structure caused DNA synthesis to proceed beyond the normal template boundary, resulting in altered telomere sequences, telomere shortening, and cellular growth defects. Compensatory mutations restored normal telomerase function. Thus, the RNA structure, rather than its sequence, specifies the template boundary. This study reveals a specific function for an RNA structure in the enzymatic action of telomerase."
https://openalex.org/W2042389934,"A full-length cDNA encoding a SUMO-1-specific protease, named SUSP1, was identified and cloned for the first time from the human brain. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA containing an open reading frame of 3336 base pairs revealed that the protease consists of 1112 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 126,116 Da. Like yeast Ulp1, SUSP1 is a cysteine protease containing the well conserved His/Asp/Cys catalytic triad. SUSP1 expressed inEscherichia coli cells efficiently released SUMO-1 from SUMO-1·β-galactosidase fusion but not from other ubiquitin-like protein fusions, including Smt3·β-galactosidase, suggesting its role in the generation of matured SUMO-1 specifically from its precursors. Interestingly, reproductive organs, such as testis, ovary, and prostate, contained much higher amounts of SUSP1 mRNA than colon and peripheral blood leukocyte, whereas other tissues, such as heart and spleen, had little or none. In addition, confocal microscopy using green fluorescent protein·SUSP1 fusion showed that SUSP1 is exclusively localized to the cytoplasm of NIH3T3 and HeLa cells.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 2.Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 3.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 67: 425-479Crossref Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). This small protein is covalently ligated to a variety of target proteins through the action of a multi-enzyme system consisting of E1 (Ub-activating), E2 (Ub-conjugating), and E3 (Ub-ligating) enzymes (3.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 67: 425-479Crossref Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 4.Jentsch S. Schlenker S. Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The proteins ligated to multiple units of Ub are then degraded by the 26 S proteasome (5.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of other small molecules, so called Ub-like molecules (Ubls), have been identified (6.Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7.Johnson P.R. Hochstrasser M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These proteins are structurally related to Ub and can be ligated to target proteins in a similar manner with Ub (8.Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Chiba T. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 503-512PubMed Google Scholar). However, covalent attachment of Ubls does not result in degradation of the modified proteins (6.Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7.Johnson P.R. Hochstrasser M.

To date, several Ubls, such as SUMO-1/Smt3, NEDD8/Rub1, UCRP, and Fub, have been identified (6.Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7.Johnson P.R. Hochstrasser M.

Of these, the best characterized Ubl is the mammalian SUMO-1 (also called UBL1, sentrin, PIC1, GMP1, or SMT3c), which can be conjugated to a variety of cellular proteins, such as promyelocytic leukemia protein, Ran-GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP1), and inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (IκBα) (9.Muller S. Matunis M. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 10.Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F.

Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 10.Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1998; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) as well as in stabilization of IκBα from degradation by the 26 S proteasome (11.Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Like Ub, all of the Ubls are synthesized as precursor proteins with one or more amino acids following the C-terminal Gly-Gly residues of the mature Ubl proteins (6.Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7.Johnson P.R. Hochstrasser M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, the tail sequences of the Ubl precursors need to be removed by Ubl-specific proteases (Ulps) prior to their conjugation to target proteins. Li and Hochstrasser (12.Li S. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) have recently identified and cloned an Ubl-specific protease, called Ulp1 in yeast, which can generate the mature form of Smt3 and SUMO-1. Ulp1 shows no sequence similarity to any known deubiquitinating enzymes. Interestingly, this protease is required for G2/M phase progression of the cell cycle. Recently, we have identified a new 30-kDa SUMO-1 hydrolase from extracts of bovine brain, which is different from the 72-kDa yeast Ulp1 (13.Suzuki T. Ichiyama A. Saitoh H. Kawakami T. Omata M. Chung C.H. Kimura M. Shimbara N. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31131-31134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This enzyme can generate free SUMO-1 molecules not only from a SUMO-1·peptide fusion but also from RanGAP1·SUMO-1 conjugates, suggesting that the removal of SUMO-1 from its protein conjugates, like deubiquitination, may play an important role in regulation of SUMO-1-mediated cellular processes. In addition, a computer-assisted homology search in the cDNA data base reveals the existence of many different putative proteins having a conserved presumptive catalytic domain homologous to yeast Ulp1. Thus, it appears that a family of SUMO-1-specific proteases that are structurally related is universally distributed in a wide variety of eukaryotic cells. Here we report cloning and characterization of a newSUMO-1-specific protease, named as SUSP1, which is highly expressed in human reproductive organs. The KIAA0797 cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession number AB018340), which contains a conserved putative catalytic domain homologous to yeast Ulp1 (12.Li S. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Takahiro Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan). The 4128-base pair SalI-NotI fragment of KIAA0797 was cut off and ligated into the pBluescript II KS(+) vector. Because the clone lacks the 5′-sequence for the N-terminal 28 amino acids of SUSP1, the 5′-anchored PCR method using the 5′-RACE PCR kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) was employed to clone the ultimate 5′-end. The reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and a 600-base pair product was obtained. The resulting plasmid containing the full-length cDNA was referred to as pBS/SUSP1. Several independent clones were sequenced on both DNA strands using an automated DNA sequencer to exclude any PCR error, and all restriction sites used for subcloning were verified as well. To generate the plasmids expressing Ubl·β-galactosidase fusions, the SpeI restriction site was introduced immediately upstream of the ATG start codon for Ub in pACUb·β-galactosidase (14.Baek S.H. Choi K.S. Yoo Y.J. Cho J.M. Baker R.T. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25560-25565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. The restriction sites forSpeI and BamHI were also introduced by PCR to the 5′- and 3′-regions of cDNAs for Ubls, respectively. The PCR products were cut out by SpeI and BamHI and ligated into pACUb·β-galactosidase that had been treated with the same restriction enzymes. The plasmids expressing Fub·β-galactosidase, Smt3·β-galactosidase, and SUMO-1·β-galactosidase were gifts from by Drs. Rohan T. Baker (Australian National University), Erica S. Johnson (Rockefeller University), and Rohit Mahajan (Scripps Research Institute), respectively. To obtain SUMO-1 and Smt3 having a C-terminal peptide extension of MHISPPEPESEEEEEHYC (referred to as PESTc) (17.Woo S.K. Lee J.I. Park I.K. Yoo Y.J. Cho J.M. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18766-18773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the DNA fragments encoding SUMO-1·PESTc and Smt3·PESTc were synthesized using PCR and ligated into the expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Extracts were prepared from Escherichia coli cells that had been transformed with the recombinant plasmids and loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. After washing with the same buffer, the column was treated with thrombin to cleave off glutathione S-transferase (GST) that is fused to the N termini of SUMO-1·PESTc and Smt3·PESTc. The proteins were then eluted with the same buffer and subjected to gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column to remove thrombin. The E. coli JM109 cells were transformed with pBS/SUSP1 and grown to a late exponential phase at 37 °C in Luria broth containing ampicillin. The cultures were then treated with isopropyl-thio-β-D-galactoside to 2 mm and further incubated for the next 3 h. After incubation, the cells were collected and resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmEDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. They were then disrupted by the French press at 14,000 p.s.i. and centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 2 h. The resulting supernatants were chromatographed on a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column, the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl. Aliquots of the fractions were assayed for the SUSP1 activity on SUMO-1·β-galactosidase fusion (see below), and the fractions with high activity, which eluted at about 0.2m NaCl, were pooled and used for further studies. To assay the activity of SUSP1 in vitro, extracts were prepared as described above from the E. coli MC1000 cells transformed with the plasmids expressing Ubl·β-galactosidase fusions. The partially purified SUSP1 (20 μg) from the DEAE-Sepharose chromatography was then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the absence and presence of the extracts containing Ubl·β-galactosidase fusions (50 μg), purified SUMO-1·PESTc (5 μg), or Smt3·PESTc (5 μg). Reaction mixtures in total volumes of 50 μl also contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. After incubation, the reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (15.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). To determine the cleavage of Ubl·β-galactosidase, immunoblot analysis was performed using an anti-β-galactosidase antibody. For assaying the cleavage of SUMO-1·PESTc and Smt3·PESTc, the gels were directly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. To assay the activity of SUSP1 on RanGAP1·SUMO-1 conjugates, GST·SUMO-1-modified 35S-RanGAP1 was synthesized using rabbit reticulocyte as reported previously (12.Li S. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The activity of SUSP1 as well as of yeast Ulp1 was then determined essentially the same as described previously (13.Suzuki T. Ichiyama A. Saitoh H. Kawakami T. Omata M. Chung C.H. Kimura M. Shimbara N. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31131-31134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The extracts containing SUSP1 and Ulp1 were prepared from E. coli JM109 cells transformed with pBS/SUSP1 and pBS/Ulp1 by following exactly the protocol of Li and Hochstrasser (12.Li S. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) to assay them under the same conditions. After the reaction, the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–20% gels followed by autoradiography. A DNA construct for GFP·SUSP1 fusion was made by inserting the SUSP1 cDNA to the 3′-end of the open reading frame for GFP using the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH). The recombinant vector was transiently transfected into NIH3T3 and HeLa cells by LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with 0.1% gelatin and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. After fixation, they were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted in a vectashield (VECTOR), and examined using a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 410). The open reading frame specifying a human SUMO-1-specific protease was identified and designated as SUSP1. Baker et al. (16.Baker R.T. Wang X.W. Woollatt E. White J.A. Sutherland G.R. Genomics. 1999; 59: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have recently suggested the nomenclature for humanUb-specific protease as USP. By adopting the nomenclature system, we named this putativeSUMO-1-specific protease as SUSP1. The 5′-end of the cDNA for SUSP1 was obtained through the 5′-anchored PCR technique using the KIAA0797 cDNA clone, which lacks the 5′-sequence for the N-terminal 28 amino acids of SUSP1. The position of the ATG start codon was inferred to yield the 3336-base pair open reading frame, which suggest that the full-length cDNA clone encodes a protein of 1112 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 126,116 Da and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.30 (Fig.1). Like yeast Ulp1 and the related putative enzyme Ulp2 (equivalent to Smt4) (12.Li S. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), SUSP1 as well as the other putative human SUSPs, SUSP2 and SUSP3 (GenBankTMaccession numbers AF199458 and AF199459, respectively), 2S.-J. Choi, Y.-J. Jeon, K. I. Kim, S. Nishimori, T. Suzuki, S. Uchida, N. Shimbara, K. Tanaka, and C. H. Chung, unpublished data. had well conserved residues of the catalytic triad (His, Asp, and Cys) and an invariant Gln residue predicted to help to form the oxyanion hole in the active site (Fig. 2). However, the sequence similarity was largely restricted to the conserved active site domains. In addition, SUSP1 showed no evident amino acid sequence similarity to any known deubiquitinating enzymes. On the other hand, it has recently been reported that the partial peptide sequence of an enzyme processing UCRP, a member of Ulps, from human lung carcinoma cells shows a significant similarity to yeast Ub-specific protease, Ubp1 (18.Potter J.L. Narasimhan J. Mende-Mueller L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25061-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that SUSPs described in the present study form a novel family distinct from USPs and UCRP-processing enzymes.Figure 2Sequence alignment of conserved putative active site residues in SUSPs. The arrowheads indicate the amino acid residues of the catalytic triad (His, Asp, and Cys) in human SUSP1 (hSUSP1, this work), putative human SUSPs (hSUSP2 and hSUSP3, GenBankTMaccession numbers AF199458 and AF199459, respectively),2and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ulps (ScUlp1 and ScUlp2) (12.Li S. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Of these, hSUSP1 corresponds to “HsUlp1,” whose partial sequence was reported by Li and Hochstrasser (12.Li S. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Identical amino acid residues are denoted byshading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether SUSP1 is capable of cleaving the carboxyl side of the C-terminal Gly-Gly residues of SUMO-1, the partially purified enzyme was incubated with SUMO-1·β-galactosidase fusion as a model substrate. We also examined whether the enzyme preparation could cleave other Ubl·β-galactosidase fusions. As shown in Fig.3 A, SUSP1 efficiently released SUMO-1 from SUMO-1·β-galactosidase. However, it showed little or no activity on any other Ubl·β-galactosidase fusions, including Smt3·β-galactosidase. It also could not release free Ub from Ub·β-galactosidase. To confirm the ability of SUSP1 in cleaving SUMO-1·β-galactosidase, the enzyme was incubated with the substrate as above but for varying periods. As shown in Fig. 3 B(top panel), SUSP1 cleaved SUMO-1·β-galactosidase in a time-dependent fashion. Smt3 is a yeast homolog of mammalian SUMO-1 (6.Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7.Johnson P.R. Hochstrasser M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 408-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that yeast Ulp1 is capable of cleaving Smt3·hemagglutinin fusion as well as SUMO-1·hemagglutinin (12.Li S. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Because the Smt3 precursor has a much smaller C-terminal extension than Smt3·β-galactosidase, we examined whether SUSP1 might be able to release Smt3 from its fusion with a small peptide, such as Smt3·PESTc. As a control, we also used SUMO-1·PESTc as a substrate. Fig. 3 B shows that SUSP1 cleaves SUMO-1·PESTc in a time-dependent fashion (middle panel) but not Smt3·PESTc at all (bottom panel). These results suggest that SUSP1 shows a tight substrate specificity for interaction only with SUMO-1. We then examined whether SUSP1 might be capable of releasing SUMO-1 from RanGAP1·SUMO-1, using GST·SUMO-1-modified35S-RanGAP1 as a substrate, in which GST·SUMO-1 is conjugated to RanGAP1 through an isopeptide linkage. Whereas yeast Ulp1 efficiently cleaved GST·SUMO-1-modified RanGAP1 in accord with the earlier report (12.Li S. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), little or no hydrolysis of the substrate was observed with SUSP1 (Fig. 3 C). Thus, SUSP1 appeared unlikely to process RanGAP1·SUMO-1. However, the lack of the isopeptidase activity of SUSP1 could not be rigorously concluded from the negativein vitro result. The enzyme might not be properly folded under the conditions it was expressed or may require modification or interaction with other factors in human cells to act on the RanGAP1p·SUMO-1 conjugate. Like Ulp1 and Ulp2 in yeast (12.Li S. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), SUSP1 contains one conserved cysteine residue in the putative active site domain (see Fig. 2). Therefore, we examined whether sulfhydryl-blocking reagents could prevent the enzyme activity. Cleavage of SUMO-1·β-galactosidase was completely blocked by incubation of the partially purified SUSP1 with 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide (Fig. 3 D). On the other hand, little or no inhibition was observed upon treatment with 5 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, an inhibitor of serine proteases, or o-phenanthroline, a metal chelating reagent. Ub-aldehyde, a specific inhibitor of deubiquitinating enzymes, could not inhibit the SUSP1 activity on SUMO-1·β-galactosidase (data not shown). These results are consistent with SUSP1 being a cysteine protease. This conclusion is supported by the earlier report on yeast Ulp1 (12.Li S. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), which showed by mutagenesis that the suspected Cys residue is crucial and that the enzyme bears significant sequence homology to the adenovirus cysteine protease. Northern blot analysis using a human SUSP1 cDNA as a probe detected a single transcript of about 4.4 kilobases in various human tissues. The size of the human SUSP1 cDNA, consisting of 3336 base pairs and a poly(A) tail, corresponded well with the estimated size of the transcript (Fig.4). Interestingly, expression of the SUSP1 mRNA was the highest in reproductive organs with the order of testis, ovary, and prostate. Peripheral blood leukocyte and colon also expressed SUSP1 mRNA but to relatively less extents. On the other hand, little or no signals were detected from other human tissues, including brain, liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, heart, and skeletal muscle under the same experimental conditions (data not shown), despite the fact that the original cDNA clone for SUSP1 was obtained from human brain. However, we could detect faint signals in brain and small intestine but not in others upon prolonged exposure of the same mRNA blots. Thus, it appears that expression of the SUSP1 mRNA is tissue-specific, particularly in reproductive organs. These results suggest that SUSP1 may play an important role in reproductive processes. To explore the distribution of SUSP1 in cells, the plasmids expressing GFP alone or GFP·SUSP1 fusion were transfected to NIH3T3 and HeLa cells. Upon observation of the cells under a confocal microscope, control GFP was found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of NIH3T3 cells, as typical small proteins, like GFP, diffuse into nearly all of subcellular organelles (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, the GFP·SUSP1 fusion protein was almost exclusively found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 B). Similar data were obtained with HeLa cells (data not shown). Thus, it appears likely that SUSP1 functions primarily in the cytoplasm. RanGAP1 is targeted from the cytoplasm to the nuclear membrane upon modification by SUMO-1, thus playing an essential role in nuclear transport of proteins (10.Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1998; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). SUMO-1 is also involved in negative regulation of the nuclear factor-κB pathway by being conjugated to IκBα, thus preventing ubiquitination of IκBα and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB from the cytoplasm (11.Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (919) Google Scholar). In addition, it has recently been demonstrated that SUMO-1 modification is involved in a variety of other cellular processes, including activation of the transcriptional response of p53 tumor suppressor (19.Rodriguez M.S.

Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) have been shown to release SUMO-1 from RanGAP1·SUMO-1 conjugates. Although in the present study we could not demonstrate the isopeptidase activity of SUSP1 on RanGAP1·SUMO-1, it is possible that SUSP1, located almost exclusively in the cytoplasm, may act on SUMO-1-modified IκBα as well as on other SUMO-1-modified proteins that have not yet been identified.

https://openalex.org/W2086608732,"Three distinct temporal phases of synaptic facilitation (short-, intermediate-, and long-term) are induced by serotonin (5-HT) at sensory (SN) to motor (MN) synapses in Aplysia. Here, we characterize two mechanistically distinct forms of intermediate-term facilitation (ITF) at tail SN-MN synapses. One form, activity-independent ITF, is produced by five spaced pulses of 5-HT in the absence of SN activity. Its induction requires protein synthesis, and its expression requires persistent activation of PKA but not PKC. The other form, activity-dependent ITF, is produced by a single pulse of 5-HT coincident with SN activation. Its induction does not require protein synthesis, and its expression requires persistent activation of PKC but not PKA. These results demonstrate that SN-MN synapses can exhibit two distinct forms of ITF that are mediated by parallel molecular pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1994970646,"Spontaneous fluctuations in the electrical signals of the retina's photoreceptors impose a fundamental limit on visual sensitivity. While noise in the rods has been studied extensively, relatively little is known about the noise of cones. We show that the origin of the dark noise in salamander cones varies with cone type. Most of the noise in long wavelength-sensitive (L) cones arose from spontaneous activation of the photopigment, which is a million-fold less stable than the rod photopigment rhodopsin. Most of the noise in short wavelength-sensitive (S) cones arose in a later stage of the transduction cascade, as the photopigment was relatively stable. Spontaneous pigment activation effectively light adapted L cones in darkness, causing them to have a smaller and briefer dim flash response than S cones."

Results indicate that HCO3− enhanced SOD/H2O2-dependent (i) hydroxylation of DMPO to DMPO-OH as measured by electron spin resonance, (ii) oxidation and nitration of tyrosine to dityrosine, nitrotyrosine, and nitrodityrosine as measured by high pressure liquid chromatography, and (iii) oxidation of ABTS to the ABTS cation radical as measured by UV-visible spectroscopy. Using oxygen-17-labeled water, it was determined that the oxygen atom present in the DMPO-OH adduct originated from H2O and not from H2O2. This result proves that neither free hydroxyl radical nor enzyme-bound hydroxyl radical was involved in the hydroxylation of DMPO . We postulate that HCO3− enhances SOD1 peroxidase activity via formation of a putative carbonate radical anion. This new and different perspective on HCO3−-mediated oxidative reactions of SOD1 may help us understand the free radical mechanism of SOD1 and related mutants linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The effect of bicarbonate anion (HCO3−) on the peroxidase activity of copper, zinc superoxide dismutase ( SOD1 ) was investigated using three structurally different probes: 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrrolineN-oxide (DMPO), tyrosine, and 2,2′-azino-bis-[3-ethylbenzothiazoline]-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS). Results indicate that HCO3− enhanced SOD/H2O2-dependent (i) hydroxylation of DMPO to DMPO-OH as measured by electron spin resonance, (ii) oxidation and nitration of tyrosine to dityrosine, nitrotyrosine, and nitrodityrosine as measured by high pressure liquid chromatography, and (iii) oxidation of ABTS to the ABTS cation radical as measured by UV-visible spectroscopy.

In vitrostudies have shown that HCO3− can dramatically alter the nitrating and oxidizing ability of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (2.Lymar S.V. Jiang Q. Hurst J.K.

Recently, HCO3− was shown to exacerbate the peroxidase activity of the enzyme, copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) (5.Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

HCO3− was reported to increase the peroxidase activity of SOD1 by facilitating the redox cleavage of H2O2 (5.Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

Subsequently, it was suggested that familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated SOD1 mutants increased formation of hydroxyl radical upon reaction with H2O2 (7.Yim H.-S. Kang J.-H Chock P.B.

HCO3− stimulated the peroxidase activity of the extracellular SOD activity, which was attributed to an increased formation of hydroxyl radicals (9.Hink U. Fukai T. Wendt M. Parthasarathy S. Harrison D. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1999; 27 (Suppl. I): S20Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radicals formed from the reaction between SOD1 and H2O2 were suggested to be responsible for the increased cytotoxicity of SOD1 (10.Gergel D. Mišik V. Ondrias K. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20922-20929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present work, we show that HCO3−enhances (i) the hydroxylation of nitrone spin trap, DMPO, (ii) oxidation and nitration of tyrosine, and (iii) oxidation of the peroxidase probe ABTS to the ABTS radical cation in the presence of SOD1 and H2O2. We propose that the carbonate anion radical (CO⨪3) formed from oxidation of HCO3− at the active site of SOD1 by the copper, zinc SOD-bound hydroxyl radical (SOD1-Cu2+-⋅OH) is responsible for hydroxylation of DMPO, oxidation and nitration of tyrosine, and oxidation of ABTS. The proposed mechanism offers a new and different perspective on the peroxidative reactions catalyzed by the enzyme SOD1. SOD1 (bovine) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Tyrosine, hydrogen peroxide, sodium bicarbonate, sodium nitrite, and 3-nitrotyrosine were purchased from Sigma. Bio-gel P-2 was obtained from Bio-Rad. DMPO was obtained from Sigma and double distilled to remove the paramagnetic impurity. 17O-Labeled water (45%) was obtained from ICON Isotopes (Summit, NJ). Dityrosine was synthesized according to the published literature (11.Malencik D.A. Sprouse J.F. Swanson C.A. Anderson S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 ml of tyrosine (5 mm) in borate buffer (0.1 m, pH 9.1) was mixed with 10 ml of horseradish peroxidase (1 mg/ml) and 1.42 ml of H2O2 (3%) at 37 °C for 3 h. The reaction mixture was then mixed with 175 μl of β-mercaptoethanol and lyophilized to dryness. The lyophilized powder was dissolved in distilled water, and dityrosine was separated from other by-products through a series of chromatography; DEAE-cellulose, Bio-Gel P-2 at neutral pH, and Bio-Gel P-2 at low pH (<3). Fractions containing dityrosine were pooled, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. Dityrosine was identified by comparing its spectral properties with those reported in the literature (11.Malencik D.A. Sprouse J.F. Swanson C.A. Anderson S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The purity of dityrosine was verified by both UV and fluorescence HPLC. Tyrosine (1 mm) was incubated at 37 °C with SOD1 (1 mg/ml), H2O2 (1 mm), and NaHCO3 (25 mm) in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 μm). After incubating for 30 min, samples were centrifuged (10,000 rpm) in an ultrafilter (molecular weight cut-off, 10,000) at 1 °C for 5 min to remove SOD1 and subsequently used for HPLC analysis. All reagents were prepared in double-distilled and deionized water. The pH of the incubation mixture remained at 7.40 ± 0.02 before and after the addition of NaHCO3. SOD1 activity was measured using the ferricytochrome c reduction assay as described previously (12.McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrotyrosine, nitrodityrosine, and dityrosine were separated on an HPLC system equipped with fluorescence and UV detectors. The mobile phase was methanol:phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 3.0) (4:96) for 30 min. The stationary phase was a C18 reverse phase column (Partisil ODS-3 250 × 4.6 mm, Alltech). UV detection at 280 nm was used to monitor nitrotyrosine, and fluorescence detection at 284 nm (excitation) and 410 nm (emission) was used to monitor dityrosine and higher oxidation products of tyrosine (13.Van der Vliet A.

The authentic standards, tyrosine, dityrosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, and nitrodityrosine were eluted at 7.5, 9.5, 17.5, and 20 min, respectively. ESR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Varian E-109 spectrometer operating at 9.5 GHz and with a 100 KHz field modulation equipped with a TE102cavity or a loop-gap resonator (15.Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 47: 515-521Google Scholar, 16.Singh R.J. Karoui H. Gunther M.R. Beckman J.S. Mason R.P. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6675-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of H2O2 to the incubation mixtures containing SOD1 (1 mg/ml), DMPO (50 mm), and DTPA (100 μm). A typical reaction mixture for ESR analysis in a TE102 cavity consisted of 20 μl of SOD1 (5 mg/ml), 10 μl of DMPO (500 mm), 5 μl of NaHCO3 (500 mm), 5 μl H2O2 (20 mm), and 50 μl of phosphate buffer (0.2 m, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (200 μm) in a total volume of 100 μl. A typical reaction mixture for ESR analysis in a loop-gap resonator consisted of 2 μl of SOD1 (5 mg/ml), 1 μl of DMPO (500 mm), 1 μl of NaHCO3 (250 mm), 1 μl of H2O2 (10 mm), and 5 μl of phosphate buffer (0.2 m, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (200 μm) in a total volume of 10 μl. For experiments with [17O]H2O, all reagents were dissolved in [17O]H2O such that the percent of [17O]H2O in the total volume remained the same (i.e. 45% [17O]H2O). The sample was transferred to a capillary tube (0.64-mm inner diameter × 0.84 mm outer diameter and 100 mm long) that was sealed with miniseal (Baxter Scientific Products, McGraw Park, IL) and placed into the loop-gap resonator. Spectrometer conditions were as follows: modulation amplitude, 1 G; time constant, 64 s; scan time, 2 min; microwave power, 1 mW. In the absence of added HCO3− anion, incubation mixtures containing SOD1, DMPO, H2O2, and DTPA in phosphate buffer yielded very little DMPO-OH (Fig.1 E). However, the signal intensity of the DMPO-OH adduct (αN = αH = 14.9 G) increased with the addition of HCO3− in these incubation mixtures (Fig. 1, A–D). The pH level was measured immediately before and after the addition of 25 mmHCO3− to ensure that the HCO3−-mediated enhancement was not due to a change in the pH of the reaction mixture. The addition of Me2SO, a commonly used hydroxyl radical scavenger, had no effect on the ESR signal intensity of DMPO-OH (data not shown). In contrast, when Me2SO was added to a mixture containing H2O2 (1%) and DMPO followed by irradiation with UV light, the spectrum caused by the DMPO-OH adduct was replaced by that of the DMPO-methyl radical adduct (αN = 16.4 G, αH = 23.4 G) (data not shown). From these results, we conclude that free hydroxyl radicals are not responsible for the hydroxylation of DMPO by SOD1/H2O2/HCO3−. However, unequivocal proof that H2O2 (the precursor of hydroxyl radical) was not responsible for DMPO-OH formation came from studies using 17O-labeled water experiments. To investigate the origin of the oxygen atom in the DMPO-OH adduct, spin trapping experiments were performed in buffers prepared with17O-labeled water. The commercially available [17O]H2O consists of 45% [17O]H2O and 55% [16O]H2O. The experiments were performed in a loop-gap resonator, which enabled the use of exceedingly small volumes of 17O-labeled materials. Fig.2 B shows the ESR spectrum of the DMPO-OH adduct obtained by adding SOD1 (1 mg/ml), H2O2 (1 mm), DMPO (50 mm), and DTPA (100 μm) to phosphate buffers (prepared in 17O-labeled water) and bicarbonate (25 mm). Computer simulation of the ESR spectrum corresponding to DMPO-OH (dashed line spectrum in Fig. 2 B) indicated a 43% contribution from DMPO-17OH (αN = αH = 14.9 G, α17O = 4.6 G) and 57% from DMPO-16OH (αN = αH = 14.9 G). The relative ratios of DMPO-17OH to DMPO-16OH formed in this system reflect the ratios of H217O to H216O present in the buffer. This result proves that SOD1/H2O2/HCO3−-induced hydroxylation of DMPO (Fig. 2 A) involves the incorporation of the oxygen atom from H2O and not from H2O2. Spin trapping data suggest that an oxidant formed from the oxidation of HCO3− by SOD1 and H2O2 is responsible for the hydroxylation of DMPO. We hypothesized that this oxidant is the carbonate radical anion (CO⨪3) (17.Goss S.P.A. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28233-28239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is well known that CO⨪3 reacts rapidly with phenolic substrates such as tyrosine (18.Chen S.N. Hoffman M.Z. Radiat. Res. 1973; 56: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, we wished to determine whether tyrosine can compete with DMPO in its ability to react with this putative oxidant. The effect of tyrosine on DMPO-OH formation is shown in Fig. 3(B–E). A dose-dependent inhibition in DMPO-OH formation was observed with increasing addition of tyrosine to incubations containing SOD1, H2O2, DMPO, and HCO3− in phosphate buffer. The DMPO-OH signal intensity was almost completely inhibited in the presence of tyrosine (5 mm) (Fig. 3 E). This result suggests that tyrosine is able to effectively compete with DMPO for the reaction with HCO3−-derived oxidant. Fig. 4shows the HPLC profile for dityrosine formation in incubations containing SOD1, tyrosine, H2O2, and DTPA in the presence and absence of HCO3−. In the absence of HCO3−, no dityrosine was detected (Fig. 4 C). In the presence of added HCO3−, dityrosine was detected (Fig.4 B), the level of which increased with increasing HCO3− (Fig. 4, inset). In addition to dityrosine, two minor products (peaks I and II) (Fig.4 B) were identified. Based on the literature report (14.Jacob J.S. Cistola D.P. Hsu F.F. Muzaffar S. Mueller D.M. Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19950-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), peaks I and II were tentatively attributed to higher oxidation products of tyrosine (e.g. tri- and tetratyrosine). Next we investigated the effect of HCO3− on SOD1/H2O2/nitrite-mediated nitration of tyrosine. In the absence of HCO3−, addition of SOD1 to the incubation mixture containing nitrite, H2O2, and DTPA in phosphate buffer yielded nitrotyrosine, which was measured 2 min after starting the reaction (Fig. 5, bottom trace) (19.Singh R.J. Goss S.P.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12912-12917Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the presence of HCO3− (25 mm), there was a significant increase in nitrotyrosine formation (Fig. 5, middle trace). Fig. 5 (inset) shows the formation of nitrotyrosine as a function of HCO3− concentration. Fig.6 shows that nitrotyrosine is further oxidized with time in this incubation mixture (Fig. 6 A). Nitrotyrosine levels decreased with time, along with a concomitant increase in nitrodityrosine formation (the satellite peak detected at 20 min). After 60 min, a significant fraction of nitrotyrosine was converted to nitrodityrosine.Figure 6Nitrodityrosine formation during oxidation of tyrosine by SOD1 , H2O2, and nitrite. A, tyrosine (0.25 mm) was incubated with SOD1 (1 mg/ml), H2O2 (1 mm),nitrite (1 mm), and NaHCO3 (25 mm) in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 μm) at 37 °C. HPLC traces were obtained after 2.5, 15, 30, and 60 min after starting the incubation. B, all reactions were done in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C.Top trace, dityrosine (10 μm), SOD1 (1 mg/ml), H2O2 (1 mm), and NaHCO3(25 mm) were incubated with nitrite (1 mm);middle trace, same as for top trace but without nitrite; bottom trace, dityrosine (25 μm) was incubated with peroxynitrite (0.5 mm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We assigned the peak appearing at 20 min to nitrodityrosine (Fig. 6) based on the following results. Authentic nitrodityrosine prepared by the addition of peroxynitrite to dityrosine (Fig. 6 B,bottom trace) gave a peak that eluted at 20 min, as did incubations containing SOD1, H2O2, nitrite, and dityrosine (Fig. 6 B, top trace). Nitrodityrosine can therefore be used as a unique diagnostic marker product of both oxidation and nitration of tyrosine. The addition of DMPO (5 mm) markedly inhibited HCO3−-dependent dityrosine and nitrotyrosine formation (data not shown). This result further confirms that both DMPO and tyrosine react with the same oxidant derived from HCO3−. The oxidation of ABTS to ABTS⨥ is conveniently monitored at 415 nm, and this optical change has been used to assay the peroxidase activity of heme proteins (20.Nagano S. Tanaka M. Ishimori K. Watanabe Y. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14251-14258Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As reported previously (5.Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we confirmed that bicarbonate is needed for peroxidation of ABTS to ABTS⨥ in the presence of SOD1. Fig. 7 Ashows the optical changes occurring during SOD1/H2O2/HCO3−-mediated oxidation of ABTS. The increase in the absorbance of ABTS⨥ is detected at 415 nm (Fig. 7 A, inset). A time-dependent increase in the absorbance at 415 nm was monitored as a function of HCO3−concentration (Fig. 7 B). In the absence of HCO3−, no increase in the absorbance because of ABTS⨥ was noticed. Fig. 7 C shows the effect of H2O2 on the rate of formation of ABTS⨥. This indicates that HCO3−-induced SOD1 peroxidase activity could be detected over a range of H2O2concentrations (50–500 μm). Most studies on SOD1 and SOD1 familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutant-induced hydroxylation of DMPO were carried out in bicarbonate buffers (6.Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25371-25377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were the first to report the finding that SOD1/H2O2/HCO3−caused a dramatic increase in the hydroxylation of DMPO. The role of bicarbonate anion in these studies was largely ignored. It was suggested that DMPO was oxidized at the active site of SOD1 by a copper-bound hydroxyl radical (i.e.SOD1-Cu2+-⋅OH) to DMPO-OH (21.Sato K. Akaike J. Kohno M. Ando M. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25371-25377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in this and other investigations (5.Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), HCO3−is absolutely necessary for SOD1/H2O2-induced hydroxylation of DMPO. It was proposed that CO⨪3 formed from a one-electron oxidation of HCO3− at the active site of SOD1 could diffuse out of the active site and cause oxidation of substrates in solution (17.Goss S.P.A. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28233-28239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22.Liochev I. Fridovich I Free Rad. Biol.

Med. 1999; 26: 905-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we put forth the following mechanisms for hydroxylation of DMPO (Scheme FS1). The proposed mechanisms are consistent with those proposed previously for the hydroxylation of a related nitrone trap by the sulfate radical anion (24.Clément J.-L. Gilbert B.C. Ho Win F. Jackson N.D. Newton M.S. Silvester S. Timmins G.S. Tordo P. Whitewood A.C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1998; 2: 1715-1717Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present study, experiments using 17O-labeled H2O unambiguously demonstrated that nearly all of the DMPO-OH originated from the addition of water to the DMPO radical intermediate. Although this estimate is significantly higher than that reported previously (16.Singh R.J. Karoui H. Gunther M.R. Beckman J.S. Mason R.P. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6675-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the reasons for the observed differences, however, are not understood. As shown in Fig. 2, the incorporation of the 17O atom into the DMPO-OH adduct gives rise to the additional lines. The incorporation of an 17O atom into DMPO-OH increases the number of ESR lines from 4 to 15 because of 17O coupling. Fig. 8 shows a typical ESR spectrum resulting from a 100% contribution from DMPO-17OH. However, the commercially available [17O]H2O consists of 45% [17O]H2O and 55% [16O]H2O. Thus, according to the proposed mechanism (Scheme FS1), one would expect spectral contributions from both DMPO-16OH and DMPO-17OH adducts. Because there is no 16O and 17O atom exchange between DMPO-17OH and H216O, the theoretical ratio of DMPO-17OH and DMPO-16OH is obtained from the computer simulation (Fig. 2). To verify the electron transfer mechanism, the nitrone-derived cation radical must be directly detected. However, the DMPO cation radical is too unstable to be detected by direct ESR (25.Bhattacharjee S. Khan D.N. Chandra H. Symons M.C.R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1996; 2: 2631-2634Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is important to note that only the azulenyl nitrone possesses the necessary redox and structural characteristics to form a persistent cation radical (26.Becker D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 905-906Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27.Becker D.A. Natero R. Echogoyen L. Lawson R.C. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1998; 2: 1289-1292Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, HCO3− is required for the peroxidatic oxidation of tyrosine by SOD1. Previously, we reported that CO⨪3 formed at the active site of SOD1 was able to oxidize α-tocopherol to α-tocopheryl quinone (17.Goss S.P.A. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28233-28239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). CO⨪3 reacts rapidly with tyrosine (k = 107 to 108m−1 s−1) to form the tyrosyl radical that subsequently dimerizes to form dityrosine (SchemeFS2). Dityrosine can be oxidized by CO⨪3 to form the dityrosyl radical, which will react with the tyrosyl radical to form trityrosine. Similarly, one can visualize the formation of other higher oxidative marker products. Based on the literature report (14.Jacob J.S. Cistola D.P. Hsu F.F. Muzaffar S. Mueller D.M. Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19950-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we attribute the minor HPLC peaks eluted at longer retention times (Fig. 4) to the tri- and tetratyrosines. Bicarbonate stimulated nitrotyrosine formation in incubations containing nitrite anion (NO2−), SOD1, and H2O2. We attribute this to a fast electron transfer reaction between CO⨪3 and NO2− (k = 4 × 106m−1 s−1) that results in the formation of the nitrogen dioxide radical (NO2⋅), a potent nitrating agent (28.Lilie J. Hanrahan R.J. Henglein A. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1978; 11: 225-227Google Scholar, 29.Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jone A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. Van der Vliet A. Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). NO2⋅ can abstract the phenolic hydrogen atom from tyrosine to form the corresponding tyrosyl radical, which then recombines with NO2⋅ to form the nitrotyrosine. Our results indicated that nitrotyrosine decayed and a new peak appeared with time (Fig. 6 A). This new peak was assigned to nitrodityrosine, the formation of which can be explained as follows: CO⨪3+NO2−Tyr→HCO3−+NO2−Tyr· CO⨪3+Tyr→HCO3−+Tyr· NO2−Tyr·+Tyr·→NO2−DiTyr REACTIONS 1–3Thus, nitrodityrosine may be used a diagnostic marker product of both oxidation and nitration reaction in biological systems. Several oxidants are able to oxidize ABTS to ABTS⨥ radical cation (20.Nagano S. Tanaka M. Ishimori K. Watanabe Y. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14251-14258Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The present data indicate that SOD1 and H2O2 in the absence of HCO3− do not oxidize ABTS to ABTS⨥. However, the addition of HCO3− to this system induced the oxidation of ABTS to ABTS⨥ (Fig. 7). Similar results have previously been reported (5.Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The addition of Me2SO (200 mm) did not have any effect on the formation of ABTS⨥ (data not shown). Thus, free hydroxyl radicals are not responsible for oxidation of ABTS to ABTS⨥ in this system. We propose that ABTS+⋅ is formed from the oxidation of ABTS by CO⨪3. CO⨪3 is a selective yet potent oxidant that can diffuse out from the active site of SOD1 and oxidizes ABTS to ABTS⨥ by an electron transfer mechanism (22.Liochev I. Fridovich I Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This proposal also explains how a large molecule like ABTS, which is unlikely to reach the active site of SOD1, could still be oxidized by the peroxidase activity of SOD1 in the presence of added HCO3−. The x-ray crystal structure of SOD1 indicates that access to the active site of copper via a narrow channel is restricted for large molecules (30.Parge H.E. Halliwell R.A. Tainer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6109-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) (Scheme FS3). However, a relatively small anion such as HCO3− could reach the active site of SOD1 where it can be oxidized to CO⨪3 by the enzyme-bound hydroxyl radical (22.Liochev I. Fridovich I Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). CO⨪3 is a diffusible oxidant that could leave the active site and cause the oxidation of various compounds outside the active site. The one-electron oxidation potential for the HCO3−/CO⨪3couple is +1.59 V (31.Koppenol W.H. Rush J.D. J. Phys. Chem. 1987; 91: 4429-4430Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which makes oxidation of HCO3− by SOD1-Cu2+-⋅OH to CO⨪3 thermodynamically feasible. HCO3− can thus effectively export oxidation from the sterically hindered active site to large molecules in bulk solution (22.Liochev I. Fridovich I Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This model was originally proposed by Hodgson and Fridovich (32.Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5298Crossref Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 33.Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). They proposed that the “copper-bound hydroxyl radical,” which is generated in the reaction between SOD1 and H2O2, oxidizes several small molecular weight anion ligands such as azide, formate, and nitrite anions (32.Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5298Crossref Scopus (682) Google Scholar,33.Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The oxidizing potential of the putative SOD1-Cu2+-⋅OH species was suggested to be similar to that of “free” hydroxyl radical, which is considerably higher than the potentials associated with conventional peroxidases (17.Goss S.P.A. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28233-28239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19.Singh R.J. Goss S.P.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12912-12917Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The earlier studies were performed in bicarbonate buffers, but the possibility of oxidation of HCO3− to CO⨪3 radical was not realized at that time. The present data and the published reports (17.Goss S.P.A. Singh R.J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28233-28239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22.Liochev I. Fridovich I Free Rad. Biol.

Med. 1999; 26: 905-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) strongly implicate a role for CO⨪3 in the HCO3−-dependent peroxidative mechanism of SOD1. This new perspective clearly rules out a mechanism involving direct oxidation/hydroxylation of DMPO, ABTS, or tyrosine by either free or bound hydroxyl radical (7.Yim H.-S. Kang J.-H Chock P.B.

HCO3−, however, facilitates oxidation/hydroxylation of substrates through formation of the CO⨪3 intermediate. Thus, irrespective of the structure of peroxidase substrates, SOD1/H2O2/HCO3−induces their oxidation, hydroxylation, or nitration via a common oxidizing intermediate (Scheme FS3)."
https://openalex.org/W2031710534,"The TATA-binding protein (TBP)-related factor 1 (TRF1) is expressed in a tissue-restricted fashion during Drosophila embryogenesis and may serve as a promoter-specific recognition factor that can replace TBP in regulating transcription. However, bona fide target promoters that would preferentially respond to TRF1 have remained elusive. Polytene chromosome staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation, direct messenger RNA analysis, and transient cotransfection assays identified the Drosophila gene tudor as containing a TRF1-responsive promoter. Reconstituted in vitro transcription reactions and deoxyribonuclease I footprinting assays confirmed the ability of TRF1 to bind preferentially and direct transcription of the tudor gene from an alternate promoter. Thus, metazoans appear to have evolved gene-selective and tissue-specific components of the core transcription machinery to regulate gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2087242804,"The recent completion of the Drosophila genome sequence opens new avenues for neurobiology research. We screened the fly genome sequence for homologs of mammalian genes implicated directly or indirectly in exocytosis and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. We identified fly homologs for 93% of the vertebrate genes that were screened. These are on average 60% identical and 74% similar to their vertebrate counterparts. This high degree of conservation suggests that little protein diversification has been tolerated in the evolution of synaptic transmission. Finally, and perhaps most exciting for Drosophila neurobiologists, the genomic sequence allows us to identify P element transposon insertions in or near genes, thereby allowing rapid isolation of mutations in genes of interest. Analysis of the phenotypes of these mutants should accelerate our understanding of the role of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic transmission."

In leaves and other vegetative tissues, the first and committing step isN-methylation of phosphoethanolamine (P-EA) to give phosphomonomethylethanolamine (P-MME), and the subsequentN-methylations occur at the phosphobase level, the phosphatidyl base level, or both, depending on the species (1.Datko A.H.

Biol. 1993; 44: 357-384Crossref Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A). For example, in spinach and sugar beet leaves essentially all flux through the last two methylations is at the phosphobase level (3.Hanson A.D. Rhodes D. Plant Physiol. 1983; 71: 692-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A.

Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 854-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Cho synthesis in the bacteriumRhodobacter sphaeroides, in fungi, and in mammalian liver proceeds solely via the sequential methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (Ptd-EA) (6.Vance D.E. Walkey C.J. Cui Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 7.Kanipes M.I. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Nerve tissues have a phosphobase methylation route as well as a phosphatidylbase route, but the first methylation appears not to be restricted to the phosphobase level (9.Mukherjee S. Freysz L. Kanfer J.N. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 1233-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 10.Andriamampanry C. Freysz L. Kanfer J.N. Dreyfus H. Massarelli R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1845-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The initial methylation of P-EA in plants is catalyzed byS-adenosyl-l-methionine:phosphoethanolamineN-methyltransferase (PEAMT), which has been detected in all species tested (1.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11.Nuccio M.L. Russell B.L. Nolte K.D. Rathinasabapathi B. Gage D.A. Hanson A.D. Plant J. 1998; 16: 487-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PEAMT was recently purified 5,400-fold from spinach leaves, giving a preparation containing several polypeptides (12.Smith D.D. Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 108: 286-294Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This preparation catalyzed methylation of P-MME and phosphodimethylethanolamine (P-DME) as well as P-EA, and these activities co-purified in a constant ratio through the three last steps in the procedure (12.Smith D.D. Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 108: 286-294Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PEAMT could be trifunctional but do not rule out a duo or trio of similarN-methyltransferases that act on different phosphobases. Pathways involving one, two, or three N-methyltransferases all have precedents. In R. sphaeroides and liver a single Ptd-EA N-methyltransferase mediates all three methylations (6.Vance D.E. Walkey C.J. Cui Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 8.Arondel V. Benning C. Somerville C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16002-16008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in Saccharomyces cerevisiae andSchizosaccharomyces pombe there are two enzymes, one mediating the first methylation of Ptd-EA and another mediating primarily the last two (7.Kanipes M.I. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The phosphobase pathway in nerve tissues has three separate N-methyltransferases (9.Mukherjee S. Freysz L. Kanfer J.N. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 1233-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Certain plants (e.g. spinach, sugar beet) use large amounts of Cho to produce the osmoprotectant glycine betaine (GlyBet) via the pathway Cho → betaine aldehyde → GlyBet (2.Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 357-384Crossref Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Because GlyBet accumulation contributes to resistance to salinity and drought stress, there has been much interest in engineering GlyBet synthesis in plants that do not naturally produce it (13.Nuccio M.L. Rhodes D. McNeil S.D. Hanson A.D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, when enzymes for Cho oxidation to GlyBet are expressed in such plants (e.g.tobacco, canola) they accumulate little GlyBet, apparently in part because their endogenous Cho supply is inadequate (11.Nuccio M.L. Russell B.L. Nolte K.D. Rathinasabapathi B. Gage D.A. Hanson A.D. Plant J. 1998; 16: 487-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Huang J. Hirji R. Adam L. Rozwadowski K. Hammerlindl J. Keller W. Selvaraj G. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This has focused attention on the pathway of Cho biosynthesis and its regulation (13.Nuccio M.L. Rhodes D. McNeil S.D. Hanson A.D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Biochemical and physiological evidence shows that the PEAMT-mediated step is a control point in the biosynthesis of Cho moieties and that at least two mechanisms are involved. One is feedback inhibition; PEAMT activity in crude Lemna extracts (15.Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 296-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified spinach preparations (12.Smith D.D. Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 108: 286-294Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) is inhibited by P-Cho, and 14C tracer data for sugar beet leaf tissue indicate that this occurs in vivo (3.Hanson A.D. Rhodes D. Plant Physiol. 1983; 71: 692-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another mechanism may be regulation of PEAMT gene expression. The de novo synthesis of Cho inLemna, soybean, and carrot cells is suppressed by exogenous Cho, and this suppression is accompanied by a decrease in extractable PEAMT activity (15.Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 296-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 306-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, salinization in spinach, which increases the consumption of Cho in GlyBet synthesis, causes an increase in PEAMT activity (17.Weretilnyk E.A. Smith D.D. Wilch G.A. Summers P.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Direct evidence that flux through the PEAMT step limits the synthesis of Cho moieties in vivocomes from tobacco engineered to convert Cho to GlyBet; supplying MME or DME increases the flux to Cho and GlyBet but supplying EA does not (11.Nuccio M.L. Russell B.L. Nolte K.D. Rathinasabapathi B. Gage D.A. Hanson A.D. Plant J. 1998; 16: 487-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the importance of PEAMT as the committing step in the biogenesis of Cho moieties, it has not been cloned or unambiguously characterized with respect to the reaction(s) it catalyzes. Nor has any other plant N-methyltransferase participating in Cho biogenesis been cloned. In this study, we identified a spinach PEAMT by complementing a S. pombe cho2 − mutant, which lacks the first methyltransferase required for the synthesis of Cho moieties (see Fig. 1B). We found that PEAMT contains two methyltransferase domains and can convert P-EA to P-Cho. [32P]dCTP (3000 mCi mmol−1) and [methyl-14C]AdoMet (59 mCi mmol−1; in 10 mmH2SO4:ethanol, 9:1) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products; the specific activity of AdoMet was adjusted to the desired value with unlabeled compound (Sigma). Chiral HPLC (18.Beaudouin C. Haurat G. Lafitte J.A. Renaud B. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 928-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) showed that [methyl-14C]AdoMet was 99% in theS,S (biologically active) form. Unlabeled AdoMet was 85% in the S,S form and 15% in the R, S (inactive) form; specific activities were calculated using theS,S-AdoMet content. [33P]P-MME and [14C]P-Cho were made as described (19.McNeil, S. D, Nuccio, M. L., Rhodes, D., Shachar-Hill, Y., and Hanson, A. D. (2000) Plant Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Restriction and modification enzymes and oligonucleotides were from Life Technologies, Inc., New England Biolabs, or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. P-Cho (Na2 salt) was from TCI America (Portland, OR). P-EA and all other biochemicals were from Sigma. AG-50 (H+) ion exchange resin was from Bio-Rad. Silica gel G (0.25-mm) TLC plates were from Merck. Spinacia oleracea L. plants (cv. Savoy hybrid 612, Harris Moran seeds) were grown in coarse vermiculite with an 8-h day at 24 °C (photosynthetic photon flux density 300 μmol m−2 s−1) and 16-h night at 19 °C. Plants were irrigated daily with 0.5× Hoagland's solution. Prior to harvest, plants were held in nighttime conditions for 40 h and then placed under day conditions for 8 h; salinized plants were irrigated with 200 mm NaCl at the onset of the 8-h day period (12.Smith D.D. Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 108: 286-294Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Harvested leaves were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The S. pombestrains used were 972 (h −s) and Bx22 (h −s cho2-20 ade6-M210 leu1-32) (20.Kanipes M.I. Analysis of the Phospholipid Methyltransferases in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Ph. D. thesis. Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA1997Google Scholar). Both were maintained on YEA medium (21.Kanipes M.I. Hill J.E. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1998; 150: 553-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 40 μm myo-inositol. SD medium was as described (21.Kanipes M.I. Hill J.E. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1998; 150: 553-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that it contained 110 μm myo-inositol, 1 g liter−1 of CSM-leu (Bio101), 5 mg liter−1 of thiamine, and 1 mmCho. SSD medium contained EMM (Bio101) plus 250 mg liter−1each of lysine, adenine, uracil, and histidine, 1 mm EA and, for plates only, 20 mg liter−1 phloxine B. All liquid media also contained 0.5 g liter−1 asparagine. A salinized spinach cDNA expression library was constructed in the S. pombe vector pREP3, which contains a thiamine-repressible expression cassette driven by the nmt promoter (22.Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). To prepare pREP3 for library construction, it was digested with MscI and SalI, dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase, ligated to an adapter made by hybridizing the oligonucleotides 5′-PCTCGAGATCTG-3′ and 5′-PTCGACAGATCTCGAG-3′, digested with XhoI, gel purified, and religated. This replaced the MscI site withXhoI and BglII sites in the polylinker, creating pREP3A. A 2.2-kb BglII/SalI fragment from pJD301 (23.Luehrsen K.R. De Wit J.R. Walbot V. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 397-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was ligated to pREP3A, creating pREP3B. The cDNA library was directionally cloned into pREP3B. Total RNA was isolated from salinized spinach leaves as described (24.Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P.-O. Nye G.J. Scott P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated on poly(U) Sephadex (25.Hondred D. Wadle D.-M. Titus D.E. Becker W.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 9: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and used to construct cDNA with the Stratagene ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit, replacing the kit'sEcoRI adapter with a BglII adapter made by hybridizing the oligonucleotides 5′-PCTCGTGCCA-3′ and 5′-GATCTGGCACGAG-3. Size-selected cDNAs (average length, 1.2 kb) were ligated to pREP3B BglII/SalI under optimized conditions and transformed into XL1-Blue MRF′ cells by electroporation. The expression library (3.2 × 106 colony forming units) was amplified as described (26.Alexander D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 41-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA from the spinach expression library was prepared and transformed into Bx22 cells by standard procedures (21.Kanipes M.I. Hill J.E. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1998; 150: 553-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on SD medium and then replica plated onto SSD medium. Complementing plasmids were rescued and transformed into Escherichia coliDH10B cells for analysis. Sequencing, homology searches and alignments were performed as described previously (27.Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D. Raymond R.K. Appling D.R. Shachar-Hill Y. Bohnert H.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36089-36096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding PEAMT, designated pREP3-PEAMT, was digested with BamHI and end-polished with T4 DNA polymerase. The 3′ sequence of PEAMT was removed by digestion with MscI; the remaining sequence plus vector was gel purified and religated to give ΔPEAMT. In ΔPEAMT the native coding sequence terminates at Gly-286, and the pREP3 polylinker adds the sequence Ile-Pro-Gly to the C terminus. Total RNA was prepared from unstressed and salinized spinach leaves using the RNAeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). 10-μg samples of RNA were separated in formaldehyde/1.5% agarose gels and transferred to supported nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations, Inc.), hybridized, and washed according to the manufacturer's protocols. The PEAMT probe template was a 1.2-kb BamHI/BglII fragment of pREP3-PEAMT. The rRNA probe template was a 0.9-kb SmaI fragment of a Zamia pumila rRNA clone (28.Nairn C.J. Ferl R.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1988; 27: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP by the random primer method. Hybridization was detected by autoradiography. Cells were grown to an A 600 of ≈1 in 50 ml of medium at 30 °C, shaking at 250 rpm. The medium was SD containing 250 mg liter−1 leucine for Bx22 cells and SSD for wild type cells and Bx22 cells harboring pREP3-PEAMT or pREP3-ΔPEAMT. Subsequent operations were at 0–4 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min), washed twice with water and once with 100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 2 mmNa2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), and transferred to 2-ml microfuge tubes containing ≈1.5 g of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm). Cells were broken by vortexing at maximum speed for 2 min. The homogenate was centrifuged (16,000 × g, 2 min), the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The combined supernatants were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 ×g, 15 min) and desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with storage buffer (10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol). The extract was frozen in aliquots in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Spinach leaf extracts were prepared as described (4.Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Protein was determined using the Bio-Rad dye reagent. Native molecular mass was estimated using a Waters 626 HPLC system equipped with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (27.Roje S. Wang H. McNeil S.D. Raymond R.K. Appling D.R. Shachar-Hill Y. Bohnert H.J. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36089-36096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PEAMT activity was measured by a modification of published methods (1.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), under conditions in which product formation was proportional to enzyme concentration and time. To compensate for H2SO4 present in the [methyl-14C]AdoMet solution, the assay buffer was titrated to a pH such that, after adding [methyl-14C]AdoMet and other assay components, the mixture had the desired pH. Unless otherwise indicated, assays (final volume, 100 μl) contained 10 μl of 10× assay buffer (1m Hepes-KOH, 20 mm Na2EDTA, pH 8.6), 10% glycerol, 100 nCi of [methyl-14C]AdoMet, P-EA, and enzyme extract as specified in the text and were incubated at 30 °C for 7.5 or 15 min. The final pH in the assays was 8.1. Reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold water; each was applied to a 1-ml AG-50 (H+) column held at 4 °C, and the assay tube was rinsed with 1 ml of water, which was also applied to the column. Products were eluted with 10 ml of 0.1 n HCl, and 2 ml of the eluate was mixed with 3 ml of scintillation fluid (Beckman Ready Gel) and counted. For assay blanks, enzyme was omitted during incubation and added at the ion exchange step. Product recovery was determined to be 82% by spiking unlabeled reaction mixtures with [14C]P-Cho, and experimental data were corrected accordingly. Reaction products were separated by TLC on silica gel G developed in methanol:acetone:concentrated HCl (90:10:4, v/v/v) (TLC system 1) and detected by autoradiography. To confirm that product hydrolysis did not interfere significantly with PEAMT assays, phosphobase phosphatase activity was measured in the conditions used for PEAMT assays, with [14C]P-Cho (10 nmol, 50 nCi) as substrate; the labeled Cho product was isolated as described (19.McNeil, S. D, Nuccio, M. L., Rhodes, D., Shachar-Hill, Y., and Hanson, A. D. (2000) Plant Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The activity in extracts of complemented S. pombe was ≤0.16 pkat mg−1protein or ≤ 0.02% of their PEAMT activity. AdoMet:EA N-methyltransferase activity was assayed as above except that reactions contained 200 nmol of EA and 170 nmol (40 nCi) of [methyl-14C]AdoMet. The [methyl-14C]AdoMet was removed by treating with activated charcoal and centrifuging (29.Cook R.J. Wagner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3631-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and 14C incorporation into free base products was measured by counting a sample of the supernatant. TLC tests confirmed that the charcoal did not bind free bases. For assay blanks, EA was omitted. AdoMet:Ptd-EAN-methyltransferase activity was measured essentially as described (1.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assays (final volume, 100 μl) contained 9 μl of 10× assay buffer, 0.8 nmol (47 nCi) of [methyl-14C]AdoMet, 10 μl of Ptd-EA emulsion in 1× assay buffer (10 mg ml−1, sonicated three times for 30 s each time), and enzyme extract; incubation was for 30 min at 30 °C. The phospholipid fraction was isolated for 14C quantification as described (1.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that the methanol:chloroform:water proportions were 12:5:1 (v/v/v). Data were corrected for the 14C incorporation in control assays containing extract from Bx22 cells. Cho moieties are synthesized de novo inS. pombe via three sequential methylations of Ptd-EA. Thecho2 gene product mediates the first of these, Ptd-EA → Ptd-MME (Fig. 1 B) andcho2 − mutants require MME, DME, or Cho for growth (7.Kanipes M.I. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). S. pombe incorporates preformed Cho or other free bases into phospholipids via the CDP base or Kennedy pathway,i.e. base → P-base → CDP-base → Ptd-base (Fig.1 B) (7.Kanipes M.I. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These features of Cho metabolism in S. pombe suggested that PEAMT could be cloned by complementation of acho2 − mutant, because expression of PEAMT would restore Cho prototrophy by installing a bypass to the blocked Ptd-EA methylation step (Fig. 1 B). A cDNA expression library was therefore constructed in the S. pombe expression vector pREP3 using mRNA from salinized spinach leaves, salinization being known to increase PEAMT activity (17.Weretilnyk E.A. Smith D.D. Wilch G.A. Summers P.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The pREP3 plasmid contains the leu2 gene for selection and a thiamine-repressible expression cassette (22.Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). The amplified library was transformed into S. pombe strain Bx22, aleu1 − cho2 − mutant (20.Kanipes M.I. Analysis of the Phospholipid Methyltransferases in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Ph. D. thesis. Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA1997Google Scholar). Transformants were selected first for leucine prototrophy on medium containing thiamine and Cho and then replica plated onto medium without thiamine and with EA in place of Cho. Screening ≈30,000 transformants in this way identified 24 complemented colonies (Fig.2 A) that harbored plasmids with the same 2.2-kb insert, as judged by restriction analysis and sequencing. No complementation was obtained with the vector alone (Fig.2 A), and retransformation of Bx22 with plasmid rescued from complemented colonies conferred Cho prototrophy (not shown), establishing that the complementation is due to the encoded plant protein. The complemented strains lacked detectable activity with Ptd-EA or EA as substrates (<1 pkat mg−1 protein) but had high PEAMT activity (Fig. 2 B). TLC analysis of the PEAMT reaction mixtures confirmed that P-MME was formed (Fig. 2 B,inset). The specific activity of PEAMT in extracts of complemented cells was 80-fold greater than that of a spinach leaf extract assayed under the same conditions (Fig. 2 B). We identified only one other complemented colony harboring a plasmid that, upon retransformation, conferred Cho prototrophy. The 1.6-kb insert in this plasmid specified a polypeptide with homology to ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases and was not investigated further in this study. Because sequence analysis showed that PEAMT has two methyltransferase domains (see below), we used a convenient MscI site to remove almost all of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 2 C). The truncated construct (ΔPEAMT) remained able to complement thecho2 mutation and specified a protein with PEAMT activity (Fig. 2, A and B). The PEAMT cDNA comprises a 494-residue open reading frame (Fig.3 A) flanked by long 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (253 and 496 base pairs, respectively). The deduced polypeptide (56.4 kDa) can be divided in the center (Fig.3 A, arrowhead) into two sequences that share significant homology (21% identity, 53% similarity), each of which contains the consensus sequences (30.Kagan R. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 31.Gary J.D. Lin W.-J. Yang M.C. Herschman H.R. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12585-12594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) for methyltransferase motifs I, post-I, II, and III (Figs. 2 C and 3 A). PEAMT thus appears to contain two distinct but related methyltransferase domains. This is consistent with its size, which is roughly double that typical of small molecule methyltransferases (32.Fujioka M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The deduced PEAMT sequence has no recognizable N-terminal signal sequence, consistent with biochemical evidence that the spinach enzyme is cytosolic (17.Weretilnyk E.A. Smith D.D. Wilch G.A. Summers P.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The novel, bipartite structure of PEAMT prompted us to search for homologous sequences in GenBankTM, to determine whether similar proteins occur in other plants. PEAMT homologs were found in species representing three other families: Malvaceae (cotton), Brassicaceae (Arabidopsis, canola), and Gramineae (barley, rice). The Arabidopsis protein was predicted from genomic DNA sequence and was complete (Fig. 3 A); those for other species were fragments deduced from expressed sequence tags spanning the junction between the domains (Fig. 3 B). The native molecular mass was estimated by size exclusion chromatography to be 57 kDa, indicating that the enzyme exists as a monomer. PEAMT activity showed a broad pH optimum in the region 7.8–8.5; the K m values for P-EA and AdoMet were 96 and 132 μm, respectively. In view of the bipartite structure of PEAMT and the finding that highly purified (but not homogeneous) PEAMT preparations from spinach catalyze the methylation of P-MME and P-DME as well as of P-EA (12.Smith D.D. Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 108: 286-294Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether the recombinant enzyme mediates more than the first methylation of P-EA. We therefore analyzed the products formed when PEAMT is incubated for long periods with a small amount of P-EA and a ≥3.5-fold excess of [methyl-14C]AdoMet. In these conditions,14C appears successively in P-MME, P-DME, and P-Cho, as shown qualitatively in Fig.4 A. In a separate experiment, these products were quantified to demonstrate that, as incubation proceeds, the molar amounts of P-MME and P-DME peak and then decline, whereas P-Cho continues to accumulate (Fig. 4 B). These results establish that PEAMT catalyzes all three methylations required to convert P-EA to P-Cho and also show that the intermediates P-MME and P-DME do not invariably remain bound to the enzyme because both accumulate transiently during the reaction. Deleting the C-terminal domain of PEAMT did not abolish complementation or enzyme activity (Fig. 2, A andB). The N-terminal domain thus catalyzes the first methylation of P-EA, but not necessarily the others. The reaction products of the truncated (ΔPEAMT) and wild type enzymes were therefore compared. After a 3-h incubation with a small quantity of P-EA and a 5-fold excess of [methyl-14C]AdoMet, ΔPEAMT yields only [14C]P-MME, whereas the wild type enzyme yields, as expected, almost solely [14C]P-Cho (Fig.5 A). This result demonstrates that the N-terminal methyltransferase domain mediates only the firstN-methylation of P-EA and strongly implies that the C-terminal domain mediates the other two. In this connection it is noteworthy that the kinetics of product formation for the wild type enzyme (Fig. 4 B) show that P-MME accumulates to a higher level than P-DME. This is consistent with the second and third methylations occurring at the same catalytic site, from which the intermediate P-DME does not exit very freely. Recombinant wild type PEAMT was strongly inhibited by its product P-Cho (Fig.5 B), as reported for the activity extracted from spinach orLemna plants (12.Smith D.D. Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 108: 286-294Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15.Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 296-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IC50 value was 0.49 mm; activity was reduced by 95% at 10 mmP-Cho, which is approximately the P-Cho concentration in the cytosol of spinach leaves (33.Bligny R. Gardestrom P. Roby C. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1319-1326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Winter H. Robinson D.G. Heldt H.W. Planta. 1994; 193: 530-535Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The inhibition was mixed competitive with respect to P-EA and appeared to be specific inasmuch as Cho, GlyBet, MME, and DME were not inhibitory at 2 mm (not shown). The truncated ΔPEAMT enzyme was also sensitive to P-Cho, although significantly less than the wild type enzyme. The IC50value for ΔPEAMT was 1 mm, and at a P-Cho concentration of 10 mm it retained twice as much of its initial activity as did wild type PEAMT (Fig. 5 B). RNA gel blot analyses revealed a ≈2.5-kb PEAMT mRNA in spinach leaves (Fig.6 A), which is consistent with the size of the cDNAs that were isolated. Upon salinization, there was an approximately 10-fold increase in PEAMT mRNA abundance (Fig.6 A), and this was accompanied by an 8-fold rise in enzyme activity (Fig. 6 B). This indicates that the salt induction of PEAMT activity reported previously (4.Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17.Weretilnyk E.A. Smith D.D. Wilch G.A. Summers P.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) results principally if not solely from increased gene expression. The complementation strategy used to clone PEAMT was not narrowly specific because in principle the cho2 mutation (in Ptd-EAN-methyltransferase) could have been complemented by plant genes encoding N-methyltransferases acting on Ptd-EA or free EA as well as on P-EA. It is therefore significant that of the 25 complemented S. pombe strains recovered, 24 harbored a plasmid encoding PEAMT, for this implies thatN-methyltransferases acting on Ptd-EA or EA are either absent or expressed at far lower levels. This evidence reinforces the conclusion from in vivo radiolabeling studies (2.Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 357-384Crossref Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 3.Hanson A.D. Rhodes D. Plant Physiol. 1983; 71: 692-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 854-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and enzyme assays (1.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17.Weretilnyk E.A. Smith D.D. Wilch G.A. Summers P.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that in plant leaves the first methylation in the synthesis of Cho moieties takes place exclusively at the phosphobase level. The large size and tandem domain structure of PEAMT indicate that it is the product of a fusion between two related methyltransferase genes. That this fusion is an ancient one that predates the radiation of the Angiosperms is shown by the occurrence of PEAMT homologs in species from four diverse families (Chenopodiaceae, Malvaceae, Brassicaceae, and Gramineae) whose progenitors diverged >125 million years ago (35.Crane P.R. Friis E.M. Pedersen K.R. Nature. 1995; 374: 27-33Crossref Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In view of the probable evolutionary age of the fused enzyme, it is particularly interesting that at least one of its domains retains what is presumably its ancestral activity (conversion of P-EA to P-MME) when expressed separately. Spinach PEAMT is a novel protein, there being no precedent for the synthesis of Cho moieties at the phosphobase level via an enzyme composed of two fused N-methyltransferases. Three separate enzymes are required to convert P-EA to P-Cho in nerve tissues (9.Mukherjee S. Freysz L. Kanfer J.N. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 1233-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and two separate enzymes carry out the Ptd-EA → Ptd-MME and Ptd-MME →→ Ptd-Cho steps in fungi (7.Kanipes M.I. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fungal Ptd-EA methyltransferases contain regions (≈100 residues) of internal duplication, but the functional significance of this is not known, and these enzymes mediate only one methylation (7.Kanipes M.I. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). R. sphaeroides and liver have enzymes that mediate all three methylations in Ptd-Cho synthesis, but these are small (22–23 kDa) proteins that appear to have only one methyltransferase domain (6.Vance D.E. Walkey C.J. Cui Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 8.Arondel V. Benning C. Somerville C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16002-16008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is, however, noteworthy that the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans includes a hypothetical protein (GenBankTM AAB04824, 437 residues) that shares homology throughout its length with PEAMT and has two methyltransferase domains. Other organisms may therefore have two-domain phosphobase N-methyltransferases that remain to be discovered. It is also noteworthy that soybean cells and cell extracts carry out only the first methylation of P-EA (1.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 854-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that spinach leaves have P-MME and P-DME N-methyltransferase activities that appear to be independent of PEAMT activity (12.Smith D.D. Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 108: 286-294Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17.Weretilnyk E.A. Smith D.D. Wilch G.A. Summers P.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Plants may therefore have other phosphobaseN-methyltransferases besides PEAMT. Our data show for the first time that PEAMT is regulated at the gene level, because the mRNA is strongly induced in leaves by salinization. They also confirm that PEAMT is regulated at the enzyme level, because the activity is sensitive to the reaction product P-Cho. The activity was 95% inhibited at a P-Cho concentration of 10 mm, the physiological level in spinach leaf cytosol (33.Bligny R. Gardestrom P. Roby C. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1319-1326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because this inhibition was measured in the presence of a saturating P-EA concentration, the degree of inhibition in vivo is probably greater. Together, these findings support the view that PEAMT is the committing step in the synthesis of Cho moieties in plants and exerts major control over the flux to P-Cho and its metabolites (5.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 854-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 296-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,16.Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 306-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically in spinach, the salt induction of PEAMT fits with the increased demand for Cho to support GlyBet accumulation, for which the two biosynthetic enzymes are also induced at the gene level by salinity (2.Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 357-384Crossref Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 24.Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P.-O. Nye G.J. Scott P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3454-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Our cloning and characterization of PEAMT was driven by the need to understand the pathway and regulation of Cho synthesis in plants in order to engineer an enhanced Cho supply to support GlyBet synthesis (11.Nuccio M.L. Russell B.L. Nolte K.D. Rathinasabapathi B. Gage D.A. Hanson A.D. Plant J. 1998; 16: 487-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Nuccio M.L. Rhodes D. McNeil S.D. Hanson A.D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In this context, it is convenient that a single gene encodes all three N-methyltransferase activities needed to produce P-Cho. However, the strong feedback inhibition of native PEAMT by P-Cho could render raising the level of PEAMT relatively ineffective in increasing the flux to P-Cho. The fact that the N-terminal domain expressed separately is less sensitive to feedback control may therefore be valuable in engineering. Because most plants have the capacity to carry out the second and third methylations of Cho synthesis at the phosphatidylbase level (1.Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 357-384Crossref Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) and because there may also be phosphobase N-methyltransferases specific for these steps (12.Smith D.D. Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 108: 286-294Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17.Weretilnyk E.A. Smith D.D. Wilch G.A. Summers P.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a partially desensitized enzyme able to catalyze just the first methylation could prove more effective than native PEAMT in enhancing Cho biogenesis.

CYP119, as the first thermophilic member of the P450 superfamily to be identified and cloned (3.Wright R.L. Harris K. Solow B. White R.H. Kennelly P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), is of great interest as a starting point for the construction of useful thermostable P450 catalysts through protein engineering methods. The CYP119 gene was cloned out of Sulfolobus solfataricus, a hyperthermophilic, acidophilic archaebacteria found in sulfurous volcanic hot springs (3.Wright R.L. Harris K. Solow B. White R.H. Kennelly P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Sulfolobus are sulfur autotrophs that can be found attached to sulfur crystals at Pisciarelli Springs in Italy and in mud pools at Yellowstone National Park. Optimal growth conditions for Sulfolobus occur at temperatures between 78 and 86 °C and pH values between 3 and 4 (4.DeRosa M. Gambacorta A. Bu'lock J.D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1975; 86: 156-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The growing interest in thermophilic proteins has led to an ongoing effort to sequence the complete Sulfolobus genome (5.Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Chow C. Clausen I.G. Curtis B. Doolittle W.F. Duguet M. Erauso G. Gaasterland R. Garrett R.A. Gordon P. Heikamp de Jong I. Jeffries A.C. Kozera C. Medina N. De Moors A. van der Oost J. Phan H. Ragan M.A. Schenk M.E. She Q. Singh R.K. Tolstrup N.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Several recognizable structural features are evident from the CYP119 primary sequence. First, CYP119 lacks a hydrophobic tail and is therefore expected, as found, to be a soluble protein. Second, CYP119 has a high identity in the heme binding region with mammalian, fungal, and bacterial P450 enzymes and exhibits a particularly high overall identity of 33% with P450eryF. Last, CYP119 possesses both the conserved cysteine involved in heme coordination and a highly conserved threonine within the I helix thought to facilitate the coordination of a water ligand to the ferric heme, the binding of oxygen to the ferrous prosthetic group, and cleavage of the bound dioxygen molecule to give the final activated oxidizing species (8.Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibaya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 9.Truan G. Peterson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In P450cam, the conserved threonine is Thr-252. This residue is crucial for catalysis, and its mutation to an alanine or valine impairs substrate binding and greatly enhances the uncoupled reduction of oxygen to H2O2 and H2O (8.Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibaya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In addition, mutation of the conserved threonine to a large hydrophobic residue can increase the fraction of the protein in the high spin state due to displacement of the water ligand by the amino acid side chain (8.Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibaya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 9.Truan G.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8839-8847Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Conversion of P450 enzymes from the low to the high spin state, which correlates with loss of the distal water ligand, can be indirectly measured by monitoring the shift in the Soret absorbance maximum from 415 to 390 nm. The P450 spin state is temperature-, pH-, and ionic strength-dependent (11.Marden M.C. Hui Bon Hoa G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12.Lange R. Debey P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13.Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5399-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that the conserved threonine (Thr-213) in CYP119 is followed by two additional threonine residues (Thr-214 and Thr-215). Such a sequence of three consecutive threonines is not unique within the P450 family, but is unique among the well studied bacterial P450 enzymes (14.Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 575-585Google Scholar). We report here expression and characterization of CYP119, including the first determination of its catalytic properties. We also describe the construction, expression, and characterization of its Thr-213 and Thr-214 mutants. These studies show that the threonine residues in CYP119 play an important role in controlling the active site structure, spin state, and catalytic activity of the enzyme. They are not, however, critical for its thermal stability. An abstract describing some of our work on the basic properties of CYP119 has been published (15.Koo L.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. FASEB J. 1997; 9: A813Google Scholar), as has a communication on the same enzyme by another laboratory (16.McLean M.A. Maves S.A. Weiss K.E. Krepich S. Sligar S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Styrene, cis-stilbene, R- and S-styrene oxide, thiophenol, 4-ethylthiophenol, and other chemicals were purchased from Aldrich.cis-β-Methylstyrene was from K & K Laboratories (Cleveland, OH), and methylphenyldiazene carboxylate azo ester was from Research Organics (Cleveland, OH). Methyl or ethyl aryldiazene carboxylate azo esters were prepared from the corresponding nitro, amino, and hydrazino precursors according to the method of Huang and Kosower (17.Huang P.C. Kosower E.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1968; 90: 2354-2362Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Cary 1E double beam spectrophotometer. Gas chromatography was performed on an HP5890 Series II chromatograph with a flame ionization detector. CD measurements were performed on a Jasco J-710 instrument fitted with a Peltier water bath. 1H spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity Inova AS400 NMR spectrometer. The CYP119 cDNA was a kind gift from Peter Kennelly (Virginia Tech). For overexpression, CYP119 was subcloned into pCWori using theNdeI and XbaI sites. An overnight culture (3 ml) of a clone picked from a single colony in 2YT medium with ampicillin was used to inoculate 1.5 liters of 2YT medium. Protein expression inEscherichia coli DH5α cells was induced using 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside after the cell density reached an OD of 0.8. The incubation temperature was then lowered to 30 °C, and the cells were grown for 40 h. Cells were harvested and lysed using lysozyme in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. After sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant was heated to 60 °C for 1 h. Precipitated proteins were pelleted (20 min at 15,000 rpm), and the supernatant was loaded onto a Q Sepharose column; washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, buffer; and eluted using a gradient of 0–250 mm NaCl. All of the reddish fractions were combined and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.0. The protein was then loaded onto a PBE94 column equilibrated in 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.0, buffer and eluted using Polybuffer 74 at pH 5.0. CYP119 eluted at pH 6.6 and was judged to be pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The polybuffer was removed by ammonium sulfate precipitation (80%), and the protein was stored at −20 °C in 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.0, buffer containing 5% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined by reduced CO difference spectra using excess dithionite and ε450 = 100 mm–1cm−1. The CYP119 Thr-213 and Thr-214 mutants were constructed using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit. Briefly, the forward and reverse oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation were used to amplify CYP119-pCWori using the polymerase chain reaction. DpnI was then used to digest the parental DNA. Transformation of the remaining DNA resulted in colonies that were screened by unique restriction sites and DNA sequencing. By this method, Thr-213 was mutated to Ala, Val, Ser, Trp, and Phe, and Thr-214 was mutated to Ala and Val. One additional double T213A/T214A mutant was also constructed. All mutants were expressed and purified in the same manner as wild-type CYP119 in the pCWori vector. The mutagenic oligonucleotides were from the University of California, San Francisco Biomolecular Resource Center and Life Technologies, Inc. For the T213S mutant, a SalI site was introduced (bold face indicates the positions of the mutations, and underlines indicate new restriction sites), 5′-CTT CTC ATA GCG GGT AAT GAG TCGACA ACT AAC TTA ATA TCA AAC-3′. An EcoRI site was introduced into 5′-CTT CTC ATA GCG GGT AAT GAA TTC ACA ACT AAC TTA ATA TCA AAC-3′ for the T213F mutant.

Peroxide-dependent epoxidation assays were carried out with styrene, cis-β-methylstyrene, andcis-stilbene in 50 mm bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.0. Reaction mixtures (total volume 200 μl) contained CYP119 (12.5 μm), styrene (saturated), and H2O2 (5 mm). Styrene,cis-β-methylstyrene, or cis-stilbene was added (3 μl) as a 0.5 m solution in acetonitrile to give a final acetonitrile concentration of 1.5%. Control incubations were done without CYP119 or without H2O2. Each reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were then extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 150 μl). The combined CH2Cl2 layers were concentrated under a stream of argon and then analyzed by isothermal gas chromatography at 80 °C on a fused silica DB-1 column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter). Under these conditions, the retention times for styrene and styrene oxide were 5.3 and 11.8 min, respectively. Authentic standards of the other epoxides were obtained by addingmeta-chloroperbenzoic acid to the olefins in CHCl3, allowing the mixture to react for 30 min at room temperature, and then injecting the products directly onto the gas chromatographic column. The retention times forcis-β-methylstyrene and cis-β-methylstyrene oxide were 8.4 and 14.6 min, respectively. The gas chromatographic conditions were modified to 130 °C for 2 min, followed by 7 °C/min rise to 180 °C, and finally 180 °C for 5 min, for the separation of cis-stilbene and cis-stilbene oxide (retention times of 10.5 and 12.2 min, respectively). The styrene epoxide formation was quantitated using relative peak areas with excess styrene as the internal standard. The initial CYP119 concentration was used for all calculations. The enantiomeric selectivity of styrene epoxidation was analyzed by isothermal gas chromatography at 100 °C on a Chiraldex G-TA column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter). Pd- and PdR-dependent styrene epoxidation assays were also carried out using wild-type, T213S, T214A, T214V, and T213A/T214A CYP119. Reaction mixtures (total volume 200 μl) contained CYP119 (12.5 μm), Pd (125 μm), PdR (25 μm), styrene (saturated), catalase (1 mg/ml), and NADH (1.5 mm). Catalysis was allowed to proceed for 5 h at 30 °C. Products were analyzed and quantitated as described above. Reactions with wild-type CYP119 were used as the control incubation. For thermal stability studies, 75 μm CYP119 in 50 mm bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.0, was incubated in a water bath at temperatures ranging from 20 to 90 °C for 1.5 h. An aliquot of each sample was taken and immediately reduced and analyzed at room temperature for CO complex formation. Each CYP119 sample was then used in the styrene epoxidation assay carried out at room temperature. For comparison, P450cam was incubated in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, at 40 and 60 °C and assessed for reduced-CO complex formation after 1.5 h. Styrene binding studies were performed in 50 mm bis-Tris buffer at pH 6.0 saturated with styrene (5 μl undiluted in 5 ml of buffer) using 1.3 or 2.5 μm CYP119. Under these conditions, the styrene concentration exceeded that of the enzyme by at least 1000-fold. CYP119 was added to the styrene-saturated buffer in a capped cuvette at the temperature of interest, and the mixture was incubated for 3 min before the UV-visible spectrum was recorded. The percentage conversion of CYP119 to the high spin state was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 6.4 mm−1cm−1 at λmax = 646 nm. The binding of thiophenol and 4-ethylthiophenol to 4 μm CYP119 in 50 mm bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.0, saturated with each of the two compounds (3 μl undiluted in 1 ml of buffer) was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. The initial rates of CYP119 bleaching by H2O2were calculated for the reaction from 2 to 6.5 min. A 12.5 μm solution of CYP119 in 50 mm bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.0, was incubated for 3 min at 30 °C before the H2O2 (final concentration 10 mm) was added, and the decrease in the Soret absorbance was recorded. RR spectra were obtained using a custom McPherson 2061/207 spectrograph (0.67 m) with a Princeton Instruments (LN-1100PB) liquid N2-cooled CCD detector. Rayleigh scattering was attenuated with Kaiser Optical supernotch filters. Excitation sources consisted of a Coherent Innova 302 krypton laser (413 nm) and an Innova 90-6 argon laser (514.5 nm). Spectra were collected in a 90° scattering geometry with collection time of a few min. Frequencies were calibrated relative to indene and CCl4 standards and are accurate to 1 cm−1. CCl4 was also used to check the polarization conditions. The samples contained in glass capillaries were either inserted in a copper finger immersed in a water bath or directly exposed to a thermostated air flow that maintained the sample at ∼22 and 70 °C (18.Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 431-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Typical enzyme concentrations were ∼90 μm in 50 mm bis-Tris (pH 6.0) and ∼1 mm in styrene when present. The integrity of the Raman samples, before and after laser illumination, was confirmed by direct monitoring of their UV-visible spectra in the Raman capillaries with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 9 spectrometer. Relaxation rates in three independent titrations of styrene with CYP119 were measured using the standard inversion recovery method at 400 MHz with a spectral width of 4500 Hz and 0.1-Hz digital resolution at 298 K using a 5 mm probe. The 700 μl D2O samples contained a saturated amount of styrene (2.4 mm) (19.Solubility Data Series, v. 38: Hydrocarbons with Water and Seawater, Part II-Hydrocarbons C8 to C36.(1989) (Kertes, A. S.

T., and Maczynski, A., eds) pp. 1–8, Pergamon Press Ltd., London.Google Scholar), 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5–10 μm CYP119 at a pH (uncorrected for isotope effects) of 5.5. All solutions were pretreated with Chelex to remove free metal ions. The typical pulse sequence contained a long delay (5–7 × T1) between scans, 30 s of low power irradiation on the residual water peak, a 180° pulse, a variable time delay, a 90° read pulse, and acquisition. When enzyme concentrations exceeded 1 μm, the integrity of the protein was verified by formation of the ferrous carbon monoxide complex. All T1 data sets contained 15 time delay points over a 10–15-fold range centered around the null point. The amplitudes of the peak heights were fit to standard relaxation equations using a nonlinear method (20.Hahn E.L. Phys. Rev. 1950; 77: 297-324Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21.Sass M.

Under the limits of fast exchange, the observed rate (R 1obs) is a weighted average of the rate in free solution (R 1,f) and the rate bound to the paramagnetic enzyme (R 1,p) (23.Swift T.J. Connick R.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1962; 37: 307-320Crossref Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 24.Luz Z. Meiboom S. J. Chem. Phys. 1964; 40: 2686-2692Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar). R1obs=pfR1,f+ppR1,pEquation 1 When S o ≫K d, the fraction of enzyme bound at 1.5 mm styrene may be approximated as unity. Withp p ∼ 1, Equation 1 may be expressed in terms of total enzyme concentration, total substrate concentration, and the dissociation constant (25.Modi S. Primrose W.U. Boyle J.M.B. Gibson C.F.

The K d value may also be approached by measuring the spectroscopic binding constant and evaluatingR 1,p as the sole unknown. The Solomon-Bloembergen equation relates the paramagnetic effect to a function of the square of the interaction energy, the frequency of the nuclear and electronic transitions, and a correlation time for the motion that modulates the interaction (26.Solomon I. Bloembergen N. J. Chem. Phys. 1956; 25: 261-266Crossref Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 27.Dwek R.A. NMR in Biochemistry. Oxford University Press, London1973: 11-142Google Scholar). The assumptions and restrictions of this equation have been discussed in detail elsewhere (28.Jardetzky O. Roberts G.C.K. NMR in Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1981: 69-112Crossref Google Scholar, 29.Bertini I. Luchinat C. NMR of Paramagnetic Molecules in Biological Systems.

Luchinat C. NMR of Paramagnetic Molecules in Biological Systems. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., Menlo Park, CA1986: 47-63Google Scholar). Due to the uncertainty in the precise ratio of high to low spin protein in the solution, limiting values were calculated by assuming that the protein was all high spin or all low spin. The electronic relaxation rate for heme proteins is usually 1010 to 1011 s−1 (29.Bertini I. Luchinat C. NMR of Paramagnetic Molecules in Biological Systems. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., Menlo Park, CA1986: 47-63Google Scholar). Chemical exchange rates rarely exceed 106 s−1, and rotational rates rarely exceed 108 s−1 based on the Stokes-Einstein equation. τc−1 is therefore usually dominated by τs−1 and has been estimated by the frequency dependence ofR 1,p for several proteins. In most cases, τc−1 lies between 10−10 and 10−11 (25.Modi S. Primrose W.U. Boyle J.M.B. Gibson C.F. Lian L. Roberts G.C.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8982-8988Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30.Poli-Scaife S. Attias R. Dansette P.M. Mansuy D.

Aryldiazenes were prepared immediately prior to use by adding 1 μl of 2 n NaOH to 5 μl of a 100 mm stock solution of the desired alkyl aryldiazene carboxylate azo ester in methanol, followed by dilution of the resulting mixture with 44 μl of potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7). Typically, 5–20 μl of the final aryldiazene was added to the protein solution, and the formation of the complex was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. The protein solution was either air-saturated or made anaerobic by purging with argon for 10–20 min. The rate of complex formation or decomposition was obtained by following the absorbance change at 468–478 nm as a function of time. The precise wavelength monitored depended on the aryldiazene and the absorbance maximum of the resulting aryl-iron complex. The data were fitted to single or double exponential equations. The heme products were isolated by pouring the protein mixtures into 8 ml of 5% H2SO4 and extracting with 3 × 1 ml of CHCl3. After evaporation of the solvent from the combined organic fractions, the residue was redissolved in 50 μl of solvent A (see below) and injected onto the HPLC. HPLC was carried out on an HP1090 system equipped with a diode array detector and a Partisil ODS-3 column (5 μm × 4.6 mm × 250 mm) (Alltech, San Jose, CA) eluted with an isocratic mixture of solvent B (methanol/acetic acid, 10:1) into solvent A (methanol/water/acetic acid, 6:4:1). The effluent was monitored at 416 nm. All measurements were performed on a Jasco J-715 instrument fitted with a Peltier water bath. A 5 μm enzyme concentration in 50 mm bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.0, containing 100 mm KCl was used. The melting point for wild-type CYP119 and each of its mutants was determined by monitoring the change in molar ellipticity at 221 nm over the temperature range from 40 to 100 °C. CYP119 was heterologously expressed in E. colibehind two tac promoters using the pCWori vector. The overexpressed protein was purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig.1) using anion exchange and chromatofocusing chromatography. As determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) and by quantitation of the reduced-CO difference spectrum, each liter of culture yielded ∼20 mg of purified CYP119. Analysis by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography showed that CYP119 is a 43-kDa protein, as predicted by the cDNA-encoded primary sequence. Purified CYP119 at a 75 μm concentration is stable for over 90 min at 80 °C in 50 mm bis-Tris buffer at pH 6.0 and can be stored at 4 °C for at least 1 year. As purified, CYP119 was completely low spin with a Soret absorbance maximum at 415 nm (Fig.2). Both the reduced CO difference (Fig.2) and RR spectra (see below) of CYP119 are indicative of a typical P450 low spin six-coordinate iron. Replacing the water ligand of CYP119 by imidazole shifts the Soret maximum from 415 to 424 nm (not shown). The addition of thioanisole, 4-ethylthiophenol, and ethyl methyl sulfide produces a split Soret band with maxima at 380 and 465 nm similar to that previously observed by Ullrich and co-workers (32.Nastainzcyk W. Ruf H.H. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 60: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Dawson and co-workers (33.Sono M. Andersson L.A. Dawson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8308-8320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with other P450 enzymes (Fig. 2,inset). CYP119, which was first identified as a possible P450 enzyme from the S. solfataricus genome sequence, indeed has the general properties characteristic of a cytochrome P450 enzyme.Figure 2CYP119 UV-visible spectra.

Incubation of CYP119 with Pd/PdR, spinach ferredoxin/ferredoxin reductase, and human cytochrome P450 reductase under a CO atmosphere, conditions that should lead to formation of the ferrous-CO complex with a λmax at ∼450 nm, showed that none of these proteins functioned effectively as an electron donor partner for CYP119. This conclusion was confirmed by unsuccessful efforts to use these electron donor proteins to support the CYP119-catalyzed oxidation of styrene (see below). However, the catalytic activity of CYP119 could be assayed in the absence of electron donor proteins using H2O2 as the source of oxidizing equivalents. No information is available on the endogenous substrates for CYP119, although the growth of S. solfataricus in sulfur-r"

However, ∼30 min after release of a 20 °C intracellular transport block in pancreatic β-cells (to synchronize protein egress from the TGN), addition of brefeldin A (BFA) (which inhibits AP-1 recruitment) was reported not to block subsequent constitutive-like secretion. To further explore post-TGN trafficking in pancreatic β-cell lines, we have followed the fate of pulse-labeled procathepsin B (ProB, a lysosomal proenyzme) after postpulse wortmannin treatment or the BFA treatment described above. We find that continuous wortmannin treatment allows ProB to reach immature secretory granules but inhibits its egress from maturing granules. Remarkably, BFA treatment causes augmented unstimulated secretion of newly synthesized ProB that is not paralleled by insulin. This effect requires a delay of 25–35 min after release from the 20 °C block. Further, when ProB delivery to endosomes is inhibited, its BFA-augmented secretion is eliminated. We hypothesize that the constitutive-like pathway involves an endosomal intermediate.

These same AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles (AP-1/CCVs) are thought to convey lysosomal proenzymes with high efficiency from ISGs to endosomes (32.Kuliawat R. Klumperman J. Ludwig T. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that with low efficiency, AP-1/CCVs also convey the “first limb” of the constitutive-like pathway, using the fluid phase to capture soluble proteins such as proinsulin, as well as C-peptide and possible conversion intermediates (23.Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), whereas a “second limb” might involve subsequent trafficking from endosomes to the cell surface (18.Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). By exploiting release from the 20 °C TGN exit block, we previously investigated the effects of brefeldin A (BFA) on proinsulin trafficking through the distal secretory pathway in pancreatic islet β-cells; with this protocol, we found, aside from the well recognized BFA blockade of export from the TGN (33.Miller S.G.

Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20838-20844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result has been a long-standing puzzle to us, not only because of the known ARF-mediated, BFA-sensitive block of AP-1/clathrin recruitment to membranes (38.Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), but because results from other groups (using protein sulfation with 35SO4 to synchronize pulse labeling in the TGN) have suggested that BFA significantly impairs constitutive-like coated vesicle budding in two independent secretory cell types (42.De Lisle R.C. Bansal R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 62-71PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Fernandez C.J. Haugwitz M. Eaton B. Moore H.-P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2171-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, in conjunction with our experimental protocol, our previous results in β-cells might reflect operation of a BFA-insensitive class of AP-1/CCVs, such as those utilizing γ2-adaptin (25.Takatsu H. Sakurai M. Shin H.-W. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24693-24700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26.Lewin D.A. Sheff D. Ooi C.E. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E. Chicione L.M. Webster P. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), or alternatively, other unsuspected effects of BFA (e.g. on the second limb of the constitutive-like pathway) might offset or obscure detection of effects on AP-1/CCV budding. Recently we have developed assays indicating that newly synthesized procathepsin B (ProB) is a favorable (i.e. sensitive and specific) marker of AP-1/CCV traffic from the secretory pathway to endosomes in pancreatic β-cells (32.Kuliawat R. Klumperman J. Ludwig T. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Using this marker, we now present results that show that once newly synthesized luminal proteins have reached the endosomal system, BFA enhances their trafficking to the cell surface, effectively stimulating the second limb of the constitutive-like pathway. Immunoprecipitating antisera against rat ProB (44.Rowan A.D. Mach L. Mort J.S. Biol. Chem.

Guinea pig anti-insulin and anti C-peptide were from Linco (St. Louis, MO). Tunicamycin was from Sigma, calf serum and antibiotic-antimycotic solution were from Life Technologies, Inc., [35S]methionine/cysteine (Expre35S35S) was from NEN Life Science Products, and zysorbin-protein A was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). The INS-1 (rat β) cell line was cultured exactly as described (45.Neerman-Arbez M. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16248-16252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that in some experiments, plasticware was precoated with poly-d-lysine. The β-TC3 (mouse) cell line was cultured as described previously (46.Efrat S. Surana M. Fleischer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11141-11143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,47.Han P.

Both cell lines were washed twice with Met-free, Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, prior to pulse-labeling for 30 min at 37 °C in the same medium containing ∼100 μCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine per 2 million cells. At the conclusion of the pulse labeling, the cells were washed and chased in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.67 mm glucose. For studies of nonglycosylated lysosomal enzyme, INS cells were treated with 10 μg/ml tunicamycin. Granule exocytosis was stimulated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus a combination secretagogue including 10 mmglucose, 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 1 mm isobutyl-methylxanthine, 1 mm tolbutamide, 10 mm leucine, and 10 mm glutamine. Cells were lysed in boiling 0.3% SDS. Samples were then diluted 1:3 in immunoprecipitation buffer yielding final concentrations of 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4. An anti-protease mixture of aprotinin (1 milliunits/ml), leupeptin (0.1 mm), pepstatin (10 μm), E64 (10 μm), EDTA (5 mm), and diisopropylfluorophosphate (1 mm) was added to the cell lysates and collected media. Both cells and media were precleared by a brief incubation with Zysorbin prior to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated cathepsin B was resolved by SDS 12%-PAGE, and immunoprecipitated insulin was analyzed by SDS 15%-PAGE plus urea using the Tricine buffer system (48.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10469) Google Scholar). The products of the two insulin genes expressed in rodents were not distinguished electrophoretically. The insulin gels were fixed initially in 20% trichloroacetic acid (20 min), then in 12.5% trichloroacetic acid plus 50% methanol (15 min), then bathed in water (10 min), and finally incubated with 1 m sodium salicylate for 15 min. Dried gels were exposed to XAR film at −70 °C. Scanned x-ray films were finally analyzed using the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). The assay performed was a modification of that described in Ref. 49.Kielian M. Jungerwirth S. Sayad K.U. DeCandido S. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4614-4624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, purified [35S]methionine-labeled Semliki Forest virus particles (50.Kielian M.C. Helenius A. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 281-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were applied to subconfluent INS-1 cells for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed extensively to remove unbound virus and then warmed to 37 °C to permit endocytosis to take place. In preliminary experiments, we estimated the kinetics of endocytic uptake as measured by resistance of virus digestion to extracellularly added subtilisin at 4 °C (51.Fedde K.N. Sly W.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 37: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It is generally agreed that the AP-1/CCV-mediated trafficking of lysosomal proenzymes to endosomes is sensitive to inhibition by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (52.Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar,53.Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (although the underlying mechanism for this sensitivity is debated (54.Martys J.L. Wjasow C. Gangi D.M. Kielian M.C.

In pancreatic β-cells, a significant portion of lysosomal proenzymes fail to exit the secretory pathway at the level of the TGN and proceed to enter ISGs. We therefore examined the effects of 100 nm wortmannin, a dose that does not inhibit secretory granule exocytosis from β-cells (57.Gao Z. Konrad R.J. Collins H. Matschinsky F.M. Rothenberg P.L. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In pulse-chase experiments, 100 nm wortmannin had no effect on the amount of newly synthesized secreted protein immunoprecipitable with anti-insulin antibodies in the first 3 h of chase or in the subsequent 4 h of chase under unstimulated or stimulated conditions (although there was a very modest inhibitory effect on intragranular proinsulin to insulin conversion; Fig. 1). In addition, recovery of intracellular insulin at the end of the chase was indistinguishable between wortmannin treated and untreated INS cells (Fig. 1). However, wortmannin-treated INS cells, even after a prolonged (7 h) chase, showed an obvious defect in the delivery of ProB to lysosomes, as measured by deficient maturation of the enzyme (Fig.2, right panel). As expected (52.Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 53.Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), wortmannin caused an increase in the apparent constitutive secretion of newly synthesized ProB (Fig. 2, left panel). Importantly, however, after 3 h of chase (sufficient to allow for secretory granule maturation), wortmannin-treated INS cells showed abnormally persistent stimulus-dependent secretion of newly synthesized ProB (Fig. 2). These results are consistent with the idea that in addition to the TGN-derived route, newly synthesized lysosomal proenzymes in INS cells utilize an AP-1/CCV exit pathway from ISGs to endosomes.Figure 2Effect of 100 nm wortmannin (WM) on lysosomal enzyme trafficking. From the experiment described in Fig. 1, samples of media and cell lysates were examined for the presence of newly synthesized lysosomal cathepsin B by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography. The mobilities of the cathepsin B precursor (ProB) and mature cathepsin B (B) are shown. Note that the presence of wortmannin during the chase causes a defect in intracellular cathepsin B maturation along with an increase in the secretion of ProB, primarily during the first 3 h of unstimulated chase, as well as during a subsequent period of stimulation with secretagogue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because ProB appears to be a suitable marker for the ISG → endosome → lysosome pathway in β-cells, we next explored the effects of BFA on this process. As others have done, to avoid confounding inhibitory effects of BFA on transport through the ER/Golgi system, pulse-labeled cells were chased first for 2 h at 19.5 °C to accumulate ProB and proinsulin in the TGN, and BFA was then added at different times after release of the temperature block. If INS cells were allowed to warm for 2 h at 37 °C before the addition of BFA, maturation of cathepsin B approached completion (Fig.3, right lanes). By contrast, if the TGN exit block was not released before BFA was added, intracellular ProB maturation failed to occur even after 6 h more at 37 °C (Fig. 3, left lanes), and there was no stimulus-dependent secretion of ProB, consistent with the known BFA blockade of export from the TGN (43.Fernandez C.J. Haugwitz M. Eaton B. Moore H.-P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2171-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Based on published measurements of the half-time of TGN exit upon release from the 19.5 °C block in β-cells (23.Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), warm-up for ≥25 min allows anterograde advance of ≥75% of labeled proinsulin from this compartment. However, even after a 30-min warm-up at 37 °C, BFA addition still prevented at least half of the intracellular ProB molecules from ever reaching lysosomes (Fig. 3, left panel, middle lane), suggesting the existence of one or more BFA-sensitive trafficking steps beyond the TGN in these cells. Reproducibly in our experiments, when the TGN block was first released for 25–35 min at 37 °C, subsequent addition of BFA caused a clear increase in the quantity of unstimulated ProB secreted from INS cells during a 4-h interval (from 40 min to 4 h 40 min of chase; Fig.4, middle panels), a time period expected to fully encompass constitutive-like secretion (as well as unstimulated granule exocytosis). From four independent experiments, this increased ProB secretion by BFA quantitatively appeared in the range of 15–20% of total immunoreactive cathepsin B. In the absence of BFA (32.Kuliawat R. Klumperman J. Ludwig T. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), secretagogue addition during this chase period stimulated the release of newly synthesized ProB (Fig. 4, right panels). Remarkably, in the presence of BFA, secretagogue addition caused an even greater release of newly synthesized ProB than from control INS cells, and the increment suggested that it was composed of the sum of the BFA-enhanced unstimulated secretion and regulated granule exocytosis (Fig. 4, right panels). Interestingly, in the presence of BFA, when measured at the identical chase times in the identical samples, there was no augmentation of labeled insulin secretion whatsoever, and there were only very subtle increases in the small amounts of unstimulated secretion of newly synthesized proinsulin and proinsulin conversion intermediates (Fig.5, middle panels). These data suggest that newly synthesized ProB released between 40 min and 4 h 40 min after exit from the TGN derives from two pools, the first representing the exocytosis of ISGs (in parallel with insulin and exhibiting stimulus-dependent secretion) and the second from outside of the regulated secretory pathway (nonparallel with insulin and exhibiting augmented secretion by BFA even in the absence of secretagogue). The origin of this other compartment cannot be the TGN (because BFA blocks rather than stimulates protein export from the TGN (33.Miller S.G. Carnell L. Moore H.-P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 34.Rosa P. Barr F.A. Stinchcombe J.C. Binacchi C. Huttner W.B. Eur. J.

Moore H.-P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2171-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)), and it cannot be from lysosomes (because whereas lysosomes contain only mature cathepsin B, secretion is restricted to the proenzyme form (see Fig. 4)).Figure 5Negligible effects of BFA on the maturation and secretion of proinsulin-derived peptides. From the experiment described in Fig. 4, samples of media and cell lysates were examined for the presence of newly synthesized insulin-containing peptides by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These data would appear to represent the first report of BFA-mediated enhancement (rather than blockade) of traffic of any protein through the anterograde secretory pathway. However, the effects of BFA may vary between cell types and species (58.Wood S.A. Brown W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To see whether the enhancement of unstimulated ProB secretion was unique to INS-1 (rat β) cells, we performed similar experiments in the β-TC3 (mouse-derived) cell line. Initial experiments in β-TC3 cells confirmed that BFA treatment after release of the TGN exit block inhibited the intracellular maturation of cathepsin B (not shown). More importantly, when pulse-labeled β-TC3 cells arrested at 19.5 °C were shifted to 37 °C for 35 min before BFA addition, subsequent unstimulated ProB secretion was augmented, whereas proinsulin secretion was not (Fig.6, right panels). However, when the initial warm-up period was only 20 min, the BFA-mediated increase of unstimulated ProB secretion could not be detected (Fig. 6,left panels). Similar negative results were obtained with a 15-min warm-up period in INS-1 cells (data not shown). These data suggest not only that our results in INS-1 cells (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) represent a general finding in pancreatic β-cells but also that the BFA-mediated augmentation of unstimulated ProB release is a strictly time-dependent phenomenon, corresponding to a specific kinetic window after ProB exit from the TGN. Based on the foregoing considerations, we reasoned that BFA is likely to enhance the endosome-to-surface trafficking route that has been postulated to represent the second limb of the constitutive-like pathway (18.Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). If true, then manipulations that block ProB delivery to endosomes should eliminate the ability of BFA to enhance unstimulated ProB secretion. Indeed, it is well established that arrival of newly synthesized hydrolases in endosomes requires specific mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) receptor recognition (59.Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). With this in mind, INS cells were pretreated with tunicamycin to inhibitN-glycosylation, thereby preventing newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from acquiring the M6P targeting signal. As shown in Fig. 7, ProB synthesized in INS cells treated with 10 μg/ml tunicamycin exhibited a faster mobility and an insensitivity to digestion with PNGase F, consistent with the loss ofN-linked glycans. Importantly, under pulse-chase conditions in tunicamycin-treated cells, BFA was no longer able to increase the unstimulated secretion of ProB (Fig. 8). Thus, using ProB as a sensitive marker whose trafficking into endosomes can be specifically blocked, the data establish that newly synthesized proteins originating in ISGs and the TGN can be secreted via an endosomal intermediate, at least in the presence of BFA.Figure 8BFA-mediated enhancement of unstimulated secretion of newly synthesized ProB does not occur for unglycosylated ProB. INS cells were treated side-by-side in the presence or absence of tunicamycin to eliminate formation of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition signal on ProB. After pulse-labeling and 19.5 °C block protocols as in Fig. 4, the cells were warmed to 37 °C for 25 min; this medium is shown in the lanes marked with anasterisk. At this time, BFA was added or not added as indicated, and the cells were chased for a further 4 h in the presence or absence of secretagogue (Stim). At the end of the experiment, cathepsin B was analyzed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography. For clarity, only the media are shown. The mobilities of normally glycosylated and unglycosylated ProB are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further examine the effects of BFA on endosomal function in INS cells, we examined endosome-to-lysosome delivery as reflected by degradation of 35S-labeled Semliki Forest virus, an endocytic marker. The appearance of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity, a measure of lysosomal degradation of viral proteins (54.Martys J.L. Wjasow C. Gangi D.M. Kielian M.C. McGraw T.E. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10953-10962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), first occurred within 30 min after endocytosis began and achieved a plateau by ∼90 min after the endocytic pulse (Fig. 9, left panel). With these kinetics in mind, we tested the effects of BFA added 20 min after internalization of the labeled virus at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 8, right panel, BFA caused a 50% decrease in degradation of viral proteins, consistent with a defect in endosome-to-lysosome delivery. Although constitutive-like trafficking has gained increasing acceptance as a vesicular transport route (9.Arvan P. Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Zavacki A.M. Elahi D. Wang S. Pilkey D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14171-14174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Milgram S.L. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J.

Moore H.P. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1998; 16: 188-197Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), this pathway remains relatively poorly understood. We are working on the hypothesis that the constitutive-like pathway proceeds through an endosomal intermediate (see Fig. 10). Currently, we postulate that a single class of AP-1/CCVs conveys both lysosomal proenzymes bearing the M6P targeting signal (60.Ludwig T. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and proteins removed nonselectively from the lumen of the secretory pathway by fluid-phase capture (18.Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The AP-1/CCVs that bud from the ISGs of regulated secretory cells (30.Klumperman J. Kuliawat R. Griffith J.M. Geuze H.J. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) are thought to be quite similar if not identical to those that bud from the TGN (59.Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Given that a subset of secretory cargo normally transits through the endosomal system even in cells that lack secretory granules (61.Dautry-Varsat A. Biochimie. 1986; 68: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 62.Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. Griffith J.M. Strous G.J. J.

Cell. 1998; 9: 208aGoogle Scholar), it follows that constitutive-like secretion probably does not require the co-existence of a regulated secretory pathway but is likely to be operative in all cells that direct AP-1/CCVs from the protein biosynthetic pathway to endosomes. Obviously, our model of AP-1/CCVs as the sole carrier initiating the constitutive-like pathway could change as more is learned about new members of the family of adaptor protein complexes (24.Hirst J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), one might expect that BFA would block constitutive-like vesicle budding if any of these particular adaptors were involved. We set out to clarify our previous finding that BFA did not significantly inhibit constitutive-like secretion from pancreatic β-cells (37.Huang X.F. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20838-20844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), especially given the known susceptibility of AP-1/CCV budding to BFA (28.Dittie A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 42.De Lisle R.C. Bansal R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 62-71PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Fernandez C.J. Haugwitz M. Eaton B. Moore H.-P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2171-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although there are many possible explanations, an important technical issue is the fact that proinsulin cannot be metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate, the method employed in demonstrating BFA inhibition of constitutive-like trafficking in other cell types (42.De Lisle R.C. Bansal R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 62-71PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Fernandez C.J. Haugwitz M. Eaton B. Moore H.-P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2171-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Instead, we have attempted to synchronize ProB and proinsulin-derived protein exit from the TGN by warming to 37 °C for 25–35 min after a 19.5 °C temperature block. However, by this time of warm-up (which is required for efficient delivery of proinsulin to ISGs (23.Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)), ProB was already divided into different pools (Fig. 3), one of which was an ISG pool from which ProB exhibited stimulus-dependent exocytosis (Fig. 4) in parallel with insulin (Fig. 5). A second pool was almost certainly endosomal, because BFA-mediated enhancement of unstimulated ProB secretion from this pool (Figs. 3 and 6) was blocked if ProB lacked the M6P recognition signal for delivery to endosomes (Fig. 8). In the presence of a proper M6P recognition signal, the efficiency of capture and conveyance of ProB to endosomes is vastly more efficient than that for proinsulin, conversion intermediates, or C-peptide (23.Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, these latter peptides are expected to show a far less dramatic BFA-mediated augmentation of unstimulated secretion from this compartment, consistent with the results of Fig. 5. Nevertheless, in addition to other possibilities, the present data are consistent with the idea that using our BFA protocol, significant inhibition of constitutive-like C-peptide secretion was not detected (37.Huang X.F. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20838-20844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because it was in part offset by increased BFA-mediated endosome-to-surface trafficking (see Fig. 10). Our results are consistent with reports in other cell types that endocytosis and recycling to the cell surface are not blocked by BFA (33.Miller S.G. Carnell L. Moore H.-P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and yet enhanced endosome to surface trafficking (67.Prydz K. Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) may exist in conjunction with impaired traffic between endosomes and lysosomes (68.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Indeed, a lysosomal delivery defect was clearly observed in INS cells treated with BFA (Fig. 9), and presumably, this inhibition is correlated with the enhancement of endosome to surface trafficking. We tried to explore different warm-up periods after the 19.5 °C block to attempt to maximize kinetic resolution between the ISG and endosomal pools of ProB. Whereas warm-up times ≤15 and ≥45 min failed to result in subsequent BFA-mediated augmentation of newly synthesized ProB secretion in INS cells, significant kinetic overlap between labeled ISG and endosomal ProB pools cannot be avoided in our protocol because some endosomal ProB is probably derived directly from the TGN even in pancreatic β-cells (32.Kuliawat R. Klumperman J. Ludwig T. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, we cannot state with confidence exactly how much of the endosomal ProB secretion enhanced by BFA in our experiments has actually traversed the ISG compartment. Nevertheless, in INS-1 cells, a considerable fraction of the constitutive-like pathway is likely to be initiated from the ISG compartment (32.Kuliawat R. Klumperman J. Ludwig T. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); this is further supported by the observations in Fig.2 that after wortmannin treatment (which inhibits prohydrolase delivery via the AP-1/CCV route), there is abnormal intracellular accumulation of newly synthesized ProB at chase times ≥7 h, accompanied by persistent stimulus-dependent ProB secretion (Fig.10). In conclusion, the present data suggest that in pancreatic β-cells, in conjunction with an inhibition of protein delivery to lysosomes (Figs. 3 and 9), BFA enhances luminal protein secretion from endosomes (Figs. 4, 6, and 8). This evidence may help to resolve existing discrepancies between groups about BFA effects in regulated secretory cells and is consistent with a hypothesis of two limbs of the constitutive-like pathway: one from the biosynthetic pathway to the endosomal system, and a second from there to the cell surface (Fig.10).

The major forms of folates in vivo are polyglutamylated derivatives.

We report here the characterization and molecular analysis of the two glutamate-adding enzymes ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that dihydrofolate synthetase catalyzing the binding of the first glutamyl side chain to dihydropteroate yielding dihydrofolate is encoded by theYMR113w gene that we propose to rename FOL3. Mutant cells bearing a fol3 mutation require folinic acid for growth and have no dihydrofolate synthetase activity.

Because of the arrangement of the metabolic pathway for sulfur amino acids biosynthesis (1.Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), a mutant strain unable to assimilate sulfate is capable of growing in the presence of either homocysteine, methionine, cysteine, or S-adenosylmethionine. In contrast, mutations impairing the conversion of homocysteine into methionine are the only ones that are expected to lead to strains that cannot grow on homocysteine or cysteine and require strictly methionine orS-adenosylmethionine for growth. In this reaction, catalyzed by homocysteine 5-methyltetrahydrofolate methyltransferase (methionine synthetase), the methyl group is supplied by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, one of the products of the one-carbon metabolism (1.Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). One-carbon metabolism, in which one-carbon units are carried and donated by tetrahydrofolate derivatives, is essential for providing activated one-carbon groups to the biosynthesis of methionine, but also to those of purines and thymidylate (Fig. 1). There is no simple nomenclature system for naming tetrahydrofolate (H4folate)1 derivatives but it is usually admitted to use H4 folate as an equivalent of tetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate (i.e. bearing one glutamate) (for nomenclature see Ref. 2.Schirch V. Strong W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, as well as in other eukaryotes, both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments possess a set of enzymes that catalyzes the interconversion of folate coenzymes, which differ by the oxidation state of their one-carbon unit (3.Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, the reactions involving folate coenzymes and folate-dependent enzymes differ from one subcellular compartment to the other (Fig. 1). In the cytoplasm, the folate coenzymes participate in the synthesis of methionine, purines, and thymidylate. In mitochondria, folate coenzymes are required for the formylation of the initiator tRNA for mitochondrial protein synthesis. The interaction of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism is not yet completely understood (3.Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), but it has been shown in yeast that one-carbon donors such as serine, glycine, and formate are able to cross the mitochondrial membrane (4.McNeil J.B. Bognar A.L. Pearlman R.E. Genetics. 1996; 142: 371-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (5.Kastanos E.K. Woldman Y.Y. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14956-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The major cellular forms of folate coenzymes contain polyglutamate tails attached to the para-aminobenzoate moiety. Polyglutamylation of folates is catalyzed by the folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS), which appears to exist in virtually all organisms. Accordingly, polyglutamylated folates are the preferred substrates of folate-dependent enzymes (for review, see Ref. 2.Schirch V. Strong W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The importance of polyglutamylation in one-carbon metabolism is supported by the study of cell lines bearing a mutation-impairing FPGS activity, which exhibit auxotrophies for the products of one-carbon metabolism (2.Schirch V. Strong W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In yeast, according to the one-carbon metabolism currently accepted, two reactions are specifically dedicated to methionine biosynthesis catalyzed respectively by methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase and by methionine synthetase. A strict requirement for methionine or S-adenosylmethionine is thus expected to arise from mutations inactivating one of the two genes encoding these enzymes (Fig. 1). However mutant strains ofS. cerevisiae unable to grow on homocysteine had been classified into five complementation groups defining genesMET6, MET7, MET13, MET23,and MET24 (6.Masselot M. De Robichon-Szulmajster H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 139: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). More recent genetic analysis has shown thatmet6 and met24 mutations on the one hand andmet7 and met23 on the other hand were allelic. 2H. Cherest, unpublished results. 2H. Cherest, unpublished results. TheMET13 gene, which corresponds to the ORF YGL125w, has been shown to encode methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (7.Tizon B. Rodriguez-Torres A.M. Cerdan M.E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8.Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The MET6 gene has already been shown to encode methionine synthetase (9.Mountain H.A. Bystrom A.S. Larsen J.T. Korch C. Yeast. 1991; 7: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is moreover noteworthy that S. cerevisiaecells possess only one methionine synthetase, which functions without vitamin B12 as a cofactor. The work presented here shows that the MET7 gene encodes FPGS. In addition, it shows that FPGS activity is absolutely required for methionine biosynthesis and for the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA. We show also that the gene YMR113w, displaying the capacity to specify a protein closely related to Met7p, encodes dihydrofolate synthetase. Escherichia coli strain JM103 was used as the host for plasmid maintenance. Yeast strains used in this work are listed in Table I.

The resulting plasmid was deleted of theBglII-EcoRV fragment containing most of the ORF of gene MET7 that was replaced by gene TRP1 from plasmid pFL35 (Fig. 2). In plasmid pFL35, the HindIII site of the TRP1 gene has been removed allowing the met7::TRP1 construct to be excised using the digestion by HindIII and SalI. The fragment was used to transform the diploid strain CC831 to tryptophan prototrophy yielding strain CD180. Correct integration was verified by Southern blot (data not shown). Disruption of ORFs YMR113w and YKL132c were obtained as described in Ref. 16.Lorenz M.C. Muir R.S. Lim E. McElver J. Weber S.C. Heitman J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar. In both cases, the HIS3gene from Saccharomyces kluyverii was used to replace the ORF. Cells from diploid CC831 were transformed with the amount of DNA generated by one PCR, and histidine prototrophs were selected. Correct replacement of the targeted gene was verified by analytical PCR using DNA extracted from one transformant for each gene. First, theHindIII-XhoI fragment of pM7–1 was inserted in the EcoRV site of plasmid pRS313, yielding plasmid pM7–2. This eliminates the unique EcoRV site of pRS313. Five modified met7 alleles encoding Met7 derivatives with different translation initiation starts, beginning at methionine residue numbers 1, 17, 63, 86, and 98, respectively, were constructed. In these modified genes, the DNA fragments spanning the nucleotides −190 to −1 (for a beginning at Met residue 1), −190 to +48 (for a beginning at Met residue 17), −190 to +186 (for a beginning at met residue 63) or −190 to 255 (for a beginning at met residue 86), and −190 to 291 (for a beginning at methionine residue 98) of theMET7 region were replaced by the promoter region of geneMET25 following a procedure similar to the one described by Muhlrad et al. (17.Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Briefly, bifunctional primers were designed that comprised 44 nucleotides homologous to the target sequence on the MET7 gene followed by 25 nucleotides homologous to the flanking region of the MET25 promoter region. These primers were used to amplify the MET25promoter region from plasmid pRS-proMET25 (plasmid pRS314 bearing the −600 to −6 promoter region of gene MET25). For each construction, the resulting PCR product was co-transformed with plasmid pM7–2 linearized by EcoRV into strain CD180–3B (met7Δ). Transformants were selected on a medium lacking histidine but containing methionine. For each MET7construct, plasmid DNA was recovered from six His+transformants. Restriction analysis allowed the selection of the plasmid bearing the correct MET7 construction. Cells were grown in minimal medium complemented to meet their auxotrophic requirements and harvested by centrifugation when the cell concentration reached 107cells/ml (exponential phase). They were washed with 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, suspended in the same buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and broken by passage through an Eaton Press at 9000 p.s.i. (18.Thomas D. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3292-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min and were used for enzymatic assays. The assay for folylpolyglutamate synthetase was essentially as described in Ref. 19.Bognar A.L. Shane B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar. Assay mixtures contained 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 100 mm 2- mercaptoethanol (2-ME), 0.5 mmaminopterine, l-[14C]glutamate (5 mm, 2 × 106 cpm), and extract (about 2 mg of protein) in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The assays were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 2-ME, the mixture was centrifuged to discard the precipitated proteins, and 400 μl of the supernatant were applied to DE52 columns (20 × 8 mm) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 containing 30 mm 2-ME and 80 mm NaCl. Unreacted glutamate was eluted with the equilibrium buffer (3 × 5 ml), and the labeled folate product was eluted with 0.1 N HCl (2 × 500 μl). Dihydrofolate synthetase was measured essentially as described in Ref. 20.McDonald D. Atkinson I.J. Cossins E.A. Shane B. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar. Assay mixtures contained 200 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 50 mm 2-ME, 0.2 mm dihydropteroate,l-[14C]glutamate (5 mm, 2 × 106 cpm), and crude extract containing about 2 mg of protein in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The incubation was for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 2-ME, and the mixture was centrifuged to discard the precipitated proteins. 400 μl of the supernatant were applied to DE52 columns, and radioactive dihydrofolate was eluted as described for the FPGS assay. Protein concentrations were estimated by the method described by Lowryet al. (21.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough J.H. Farr A.L. Randall J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dihydropteroate was synthesized by dithionite reduction of pteroic acid as described in Ref. 22.Stover P. Schirch V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Strains bearing a met7 mutation had been described as methionine auxotrophs (6.Masselot M. De Robichon-Szulmajster H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 139: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23.Jones E.W. Fink G.R. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 181-299Google Scholar). To clone theMET7 gene, strain CC704–18D (met7) was transformed by the gene library described under “Materials and Methods.” Among 150,000 transformants 15 were able to grow in the absence of methionine. They all beared the same plasmid with a 5-kilobase pair insert (Fig. 2 A). To confirm that we have indeed cloned the MET7 gene, we verified that the cloned insert is capable of targeting integration at the MET7locus. The insert was recloned in a plasmid lacking an autonomous replicating sequence bearing the URA3 gene. The resulting plasmid was linearized by XhoI used to transform strain W303–1B (MET7, ura3), and stable uracile prototroph transformants were selected. One of these transformants was then crossed to CC704–18D (met7, ura3); the resulting diploid (CC827) was sporulated, and 39 tetrads were analyzed. In all cases a 2+/2− segregation of the methionine auxotrophy was observed, and the Met+ spores were also Ura+, indicating that the insert had directed the integration to the MET7 locus. The position of theMET7 gene within the cloned DNA of pM7–1 was determined by subcloning. The subclones were tested for their ability to restore growth of strain CC704–18D (met7) on a medium lacking methionine (Fig. 2 A). The comparison of the restriction map of the insert of pM7–1 (Fig.2 A) with that of the region of chromosome XV where geneMET7 had been mapped (24.Mortimer R.K. Contopoulou C.R. King J.S. Yeast. 1992; 8: 817-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) showed that the original cloned insert beared four ORFs, YOR239w–YOR242w and that pM7–3, which restores the growth of a met7 mutant on a medium lacking methionine, bears only one ORF, YOR241w. The polypeptide deduced from YOR241w shows extensive similarities with folylpolyglutamate synthetases that catalyze the extention of the glutamate chains of folylmonoglutamates in an ATP-dependent reaction. YOR241w was disrupted (Fig. 2 B) in a diploid strain yielding strain CD180, and disruption was verified by Southern blotting (not shown). Diploid CD180 was sporulated, and tetrads were dissected. In the 18 tetrads tested, a 2+/2− segregation of a methionine auxotrophy was observed, and the Met− spores were also Trp+, indicating that the yor241wΔ bearing strains were methionine auxotrophs, as are the met7 mutants. Strain CD180–3B (yor241Δ) was crossed to strain CC704–18D (met7), and analysis of the progeny showed, as expected, that YOR241w and MET7 are the same gene. To confirm that the MET7 gene does encode the yeast FPGS, the activity was assayed in both wild type and met7Δ bearing strains. As shown in Table II, the disruption of the MET7 gene results in an undetectable level of FPGS activity.Table IISpecific activities of the glutamate adding enzymes in different mutant strainsStrainRelevant genotypeSpecific activityDHFSFPGSnmol/min/mg of proteinW303–1A0.180.29CD180–3Amet7∷TRP10.09<0.01CD208–2Bymr113w∷HIS3<0.010.22CD210–1Bykl132∷HIS30.110.29CH2–16Bymr113w∷HIS3<0.010.22ykl132c∷HIS3 Open table in a new tab Taken together, all these results show that the MET7 gene corresponds to ORF YOR241w and encodes the yeast FPGS. The Met7 protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence of MET7has a molecular mass of 62,157 and a calculated isoelectric point of 9.04. In mammalian cells, polyglutamylated folates have been reported to serve as one-carbon unit donors in the synthesis of methionine as well as in that of purines and of thymidylate (dTMP). Moreover, it has been reported that met7 mutant cells require both methionine and adenine for growth (23.Jones E.W. Fink G.R. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 181-299Google Scholar). We found that themet7 mutants from our collection did not display the adenine requirement. To address more precisely the role of polyglutamylation of the folate coenzymes, we wanted to characterize more precisely the growth requirements of strains bearing a met7 null allele. As the MET7 gene was disrupted in a homozygousADE2 diploid, which does not require adenine, growth of strain CD180–3B (met7, ADE2) was studied, and results show that its mean generation time was reduced from 5.5 to 3.25 h when adenine was added to the minimal synthetic medium containing methionine, indicating that the absence of polyglutamylation impairs modestly the biosynthesis of adenine (Fig.3 A). Yeast cells can transport extracellular dTMP provided that they bear a mutation in the TUP1 gene, for instance. To test if the disruption of the MET7 gene resulted in an impairment of dTMP synthesis, we inactivated the TUP1 gene in a strain bearing a met7Δ mutation and analyzed the growth of a double tup1Δ, met7Δ disrupted strain (CD181–10D) in the presence and absence of dTMP. On the contrary to what was observed for adenine, the addition of dTMP up to 100 μg/ml was without significant effect on the growth of tup1Δ,met7Δ cells (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, we concluded that dTMP synthesis can be made with monoglutamylated folate coenzymes. met7 mutant cells had been described as respiration-deficient (23.Jones E.W. Fink G.R. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 181-299Google Scholar), and we have verified that all the strains bearing met7 mutations from our collection were indeed “petites,” i.e. were unable to use ethanol as a carbon source. When the diploid strain CC827 (met7/MET7::URA3-MET7) was sporulated (see above), we noted that a high number of methionine auxotroph spores were unable to use ethanol. Among the 78 methionine auxotrophs examined, only 32 spores were capable of using ethanol. In contrast, all the methionine prototroph spores could use ethanol as a carbon source. However, when diploid CD180 (MET7/met7 Δ) was sporulated and tetrads were tested, we observed that two spores grew quickly and two gave small colonies (Fig. 4). The quickly growing spores were methionine prototrophs. The small colonies were methionine auxotrophs and could not use ethanol as a carbon source. These experiments suggested that met7 mutant cells lose progressively their capacity to use ethanol and that met7disrupted cells are respiration-deficient. Plasmid pM7–1 was then used to transform both a haploid met7Δ strain and a heterozygous met7Δ/MET7 diploid strain. In the haploid strain, plasmid pM7–1 corrected the methionine requirement but not the respiration-deficient phenotype. Sporulation of diploid cells bearing the pM7–1 plasmid and analysis of the progeny showed that all the Trp+, Ura+ spores (met7::TRP1, harboring the pM7–1 plasmid) were able to use ethanol as a carbon source, indicating that the presence of the wild type MET7 gene on a plasmid allowed the maintenance of mitochondrial functions when mitochondria are present, provided by the respiration-competent parental strain. In addition, onemet7 null mutant was mated to a ρ0 tester strain. The resulting diploid was unable to grow on ethanol, showing that the respiration-deficient met7 mutant is not complemented by a ρ0 tester and thus indicating a loss of wild type mitochondrial DNA. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the loss of Met7p function results in an increased rate of loss of mitochondrial DNA. Then, in addition to methionine biosynthesis, FPGS activity in yeast is required for an essential mitochondrial function. Different hypotheses can be made to explain why FPGS activity is required for both methionine biosynthesis and for maintaining the mitochondrial integrity. For example, the dual phenotype of met7Δ strains could be because of the need for mitochondria of a metabolite synthesized in the cytosol and whose formation requires polyglutamylation of folate coenzymes. Alternatively, the MET7 gene could encode both a cytoplasmic and a mitochondrial form of FPGS. A nuclear encoded protein destined to be imported into the mitochondrial matrix is generally synthesized with a amino-terminal extention of 20–30 residues that functions as a targeting signal (25.Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar,26.Schatz G. Nature. 1997; 388: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). There are a number of enzymes from S. cerevisiae that are shared by the cytosol and mitochondria and that are encoded by the same gene. In some cases the mechanism ensuring the different intracellular targeting has been clarified, and it was shown that the gene gives rise to two different proteins with the longer one containing the amino-terminal targeting signal for mitochondria. The second protein, lacking the sequence, is shorter and located in the cytoplasm (27.Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J.-P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Ellis S.R. Hopper A.K. Martin N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 9: 1611-1620Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29.Wu M. Tzagoloff A.

In the amino-terminal sequence of MET7 five in frame ATG codons are found at positions 49, 164, 187, 256, and 292 corresponding to the methionine residues 17, 55, 63, 86, and 98 (Fig.5). To test if MET7 could encode both a mitochondrial and a cytoplasmic enzyme, we constructed five different Met7p derivatives beginning at methionine residues 1, 17, 63, 86, and 98, hoping that one derivative would lack the targeting signal and would thus encode only a cytoplasmic form of FPGS. We expected that a strain bearing a Met7p derivative without the targeting signal would not require methionine for growth and would not grow on ethanol as a carbon source. The constructions were made as described under “Materials and Methods.” The modified genes were placed under the control of the MET25 promoter region using the GAP repair technique and the centromeric plamid pM7–2. Plasmids bearing modified Met7p were used to transform strain CD180–4C (met7Δ) to histidine prototrophy in a medium containing methionine. At least 30 transformants for each met7 allele were then tested for their methionine requirement. Results showed that the modified met7 alleles encoding proteins beginning at Met-1, -17, and -63 complement the methionine requirement of strain CD180–4C (met7Δ) but that the alleles coding for the proteins beginning at Met-86 or -98 do not complement the methionine auxotrophy of the same strain. The transformants bearing all the Met7p derivatives were respiration-deficient, as expected. To test the ability of the mutants bearing each Met7p derivative to maintain the mitochondrial genome, one transformant for each met7 allele was crossed to strain CC788–2D (MET7, respiration-competent), the resulting diploid was sporulated, and in the progeny, the Trp+, His+ strains (i.e. bearing the met7disruption and carrying the modified Met7p) were examined. In the crosses involving the met7 alleles encoding the Met7p beginning at the Met residues 1, 17, and 63, all the Trp+, His+ spores were methionine prototrophs and could use ethanol as a carbon source. In the crosses involving themet7 allele encoding the Met7 protein beginning at Met-86 and Met-98 all the Trp+, His+ spores were methionine auxotrophs and could not use ethanol on YPEA medium. It is noteworthy that YPEA medium meets the methionine requirement of methionine auxotrophs. These results show that all the Met7p derivatives that led to a Met+ phenotype resulted also in the ability to use ethanol as a carbon source and that the derivatives resulting in a Met− phenotype led also to a respiration deficiency. Taken together, these results argue for the existence of only one cytosolic form of FPGS. As a consequence, these results favor the hypothesis that mitochondrial integrity depends on the presence of a metabolite whose synthesis takes place in the cytosol and is strictly dependent on polyglutamylation of folate coenzymes. In organisms that generate folatesde novo, the addition of glutamyl side chains to cellular folates is achieved by two reactions catalyzed by dihydrofolate synthetase (DHFS) and FPGS, respectively.

Furthermore, Rb can be cleaved at the COOH terminus during apoptotic cell death by caspases, and the cleavage of Rb attenuates the anti-apoptotic function of Rb (26.Tan X. Martin S.J. Green D.R.

In the present study, we demonstrate a novel function of Rb that suppresses the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway through inhibiting JNK/SAPK activity. The inhibition of JNK/SAPK activity may be an important mechanism by which Rb negatively regulates the stress-activated cellular events including cell death. HEK293 cells and Saos-2 cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with appropriate expression vectors by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). When indicated, cells were exposed to ultraviolet light (60 J/m2) after 40–48 h of transfection. Nuclear extracts were obtained from cultured HEK293 cells as described previously (29.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitated with either rabbit anti-Rb polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) or pre-immune rabbit IgG for a negative control. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, immunoblotted with mouse anti-JNK1/SAPKγ monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen), and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cultured cells were harvested, and lysed with a lysis buffer (10.Park J. Kim I. Oh Y.J. Lee K. Han P.-L. Choi E.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16725-16728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Solubilized fractions were immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies, and the resultant immunopellets were assayed for indicated protein kinases, as described previously (10.Park J. Kim I.

Nature. 1996; 381: 804-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and quantified by autoradiography and densitometry. Either GST-c-Jun(1–135) or GST-ATF2(1–109) was used as a substrate for JNK, GST-ATF2(1–109) for p38, and myosin basic protein for ERK. GST-SEK1(K129R) was used as a substrate for MEKK1 assay. Mouse monoclonal anti-Flag M2 (Kodak), anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or anti-JNK1 antibody was used as indicated. HEK293 cells were transfected with pEBG vector expressing GST-SEK1 (3.Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were lysed, and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100. Solubilized fraction was applied to glutathione-agarose, and GST-SEK1 was eluted from the resin and assayed for SEK1 activity using hexahistidine-tagged p38 as a substrate protein, as described previously (31.Kim H. Shim J. Han P.L. Choi E.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13677-13681Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). SAPKβ and ERK1 were in vitro translated with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) using [35S]methionine. In vitrotranslation product was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the indicated GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in the binding buffer, and the beads were rinsed extensively with the washing buffer, as described (30.Shim J. Lee H. Park J. Kim H. Choi E.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 804-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled proteins were eluted from the beads, separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. Saos-2 cells were transfected with pEGFP (CLONTECH) and various cDNA constructs by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). When indicated, transfected cells were exposed to UV (60 J/m2) after a 40-h incubation. Then, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeablized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nuclei were observed with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. GFP-expressing cells were scored for apoptotic nuclei. The percentage of GFP-producing cells that were apoptotic was determined from four independent dishes. To investigate whether Rb protein might modulate a function of the JNK/SAPK pathway, we examined the action of Rb on JNK activity in cultured cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a vector expressing SAPKβ-flag or JNK1-HA with or without a vector expressing the full-length Rb protein. SAPKβ and JNK1 are identical to JNK3 and SAPKγ, respectively. JNK activity was stimulated by UV irradiation of transfected cells (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, this stimulation was markedly reduced in Rb-transfected cells. Immunoblot data indicate that the inhibition of the JNK activity by Rb did not result from a decrease in the level of expressed SAPKβ-flag or JNK1-HA. We, then, examined whether Rb could also regulate ERK and p38, other groups of MAP kinases. Rb had no effect on either ERK1 or p38 activity (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the inhibitory function of Rb was specific to the JNK/SAPK pathway among the mammalian MAP kinase cascades. The ability of Rb to repress JNK/SAPK activity was also tested in a Rb-defective osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2 (Fig.1 C). Exposure of Saos-2 cells to UV light resulted in SAPK stimulation. Ectopic expression of Rb, however, blocked the UV-induced stimulation of SAPK activity in transfected Saos-2 cells. These findings indicate that Rb functions as a negative regulator in the JNK/SAPK signaling cascade. The JNK/SAPK pathway is composed of JNK/SAPK and its upstream kinases that include MEKK1 and SEK1/JNKK1 (3.Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Thus, when MEKK1 is stimulated by an extracellular stimulus, MEKK1 phosphorylates and activates SEK1, which, in turn, activates JNK/SAPK (4.Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-104PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to examine whether the repression of JNK activity by Rb would result from an action of Rb on either SEK1 or MEKK1. In HEK293 cells which were transfected with either pEBG-SEK1 or pEBG-SEK1 plus pCMV-Rb, SEK1 activity was stimulated after UV irradiation (Fig.2 A). Ectopic expression of Rb did not affect the UV-induced SEK1 activation in transfected cells. Rb also had little effect on an enzymatic activity of MEKK1 for phosphorylating GST-SEK1 protein (Fig. 2 B). These findings suggest that Rb may block the JNK/SAPK signaling cascade by acting on JNK/SAPK.Figure 2Rb cannot inhibit JNK/SAPK upstream kinases. A, Rb does not affect SEK1 activity. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing GST-SEK1 and Rb, as indicated. After a 48-h incubation, transfected cells were exposed to UV light (60 J/m2), incubated further for 1 h, and lysed. GST-SEK1 was purified from cell lysates by using glutathione-agarose resin, and assayed for phosphorylation of hexahistidine-tagged p38 (His-p38). B, Rb does not affect MEKK1 activity. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing MEKK1-flag and Rb, as indicated. After transfected cells were exposed to UV light (60 J/m2), enzymatic activity of MEKK1-flag expressed in transfected cells was determined by immunocomplex kinase assay. In panels A-B, fold increase in phosphorylation of each substrate protein is indicated. IB, immunoblotting of transfected cells with anti-Flag or anti-GST antibody, as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to test whether Rb directly interacts with JNK/SAPK, we carried out in vivointeraction analysis (Fig.3 A). We prepared nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells, and performed immunoprecipitation with anti-Rb antibody. Immunoblot analysis of protein complexes immunoprecipitated with anti-Rb antibody demonstrated that Rb was coimmunoprecipitated with JNK. We further tested if Rb directly binds to JNK/SAPK in in vitro binding assay using recombinant GST-Rb proteins that were immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 3 B). Either GST-Rb(379–928) or GST-Rb(768–928) physically associated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled SAPKβ, whereas GST-Rb(379–767), GST-Rb(776–830), or GST alone did not interact with35S-labeled SAPKβ. These data indicate that a carboxyl-terminal domain of Rb containing amino acids 768–928 may be important for binding to JNK/SAPK. GST-Rb(379–928) did not interact with 35S-labeled ERK1 (Fig. 3 B). There are at least two possible mechanisms by which Rb inhibits JNK/SAPK activity through interacting with the enzyme. One possible mechanism is that Rb may directly suppress a catalytic activity of JNK/SAPK. Another possibility is that Rb may interfere to the JNK/SAPK phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by a JNK/SAPK kinase such as SEK1. We, therefore, tested these possibilities in the following experiments. In order to test a possibility that Rb may directly inhibit JNK/SAPK activity, we examined the in vitro effects of GST-Rb fusion proteins on JNK/SAPK activity (Fig.4 A). Enzymatic activity of JNK1 was markedly inhibited in vitro by both Rb(379–928) and Rb(768–928), whereas the effect of either Rb(379–767) or Rb(776–830) on the enzymatic activity was minimal. Thus, these data were in excellent agreement with the in vitro binding data shown in Fig. 2. We also confirmed the inhibitory function of Rb(761–928) in transfected cells (Fig. 4 B). Enzymatic activity of ectopically expressed SAPKβ-flag was stimulated after cells were exposed to UV irradiation, and SAPK stimulation was blocked by Rb(761–928). Taken together, our findings suggest that Rb can directly inhibit an enzymatic activity of JNK/SAPK, and that the COOH-terminal domain of Rb is critical in the regulation of JNK by Rb. We then investigated another possibility that Rb may inhibit the JNK/SAPK phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by SEK1. In order to test this possibility, we examined the effect of GST-Rb(768–928) on thein vitro phosphorylation of SAPKβ by SEK1 (Fig.5). We used SAPKβ(K55R), a kinase-inactive SAPKβ mutant that has no autophosphorylation activity, as a substrate for SEK1 in the in vitro kinase assay. We found that the SAPK phosphorylation by SEK1 was inhibited by GST-Rb(768–928). Interestingly, GST-Rb(768–928) did not affect the phosphorylation of myosin basic protein by SEK1, suggesting that Rb(768–928) does not affect a catalytic activity of SEK1. On the basis of our data that Rb(768–928) blocks the SAPK phosphorylation in vitro, therefore, it may be proposed that Rb, through interacting with JNK/SAPK, may interfere to the phosphorylation of JNK/SAPK by SEK1. There are increasing lines of evidence that JNK/SAPK can mediate intracellular signals for cell death initiated by cellular stresses such as UV radiation (6.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J.

We, therefore, tested whether ectopically expressed Rb protein could suppress the JNK-involved cell death in Saos-2 cells. UV light, a strong activator of the JNK pathway, caused apoptotic cell death in Saos-2 cells (Fig. 6 A). UV-induced cell death was decreased in cells overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of SEK1, SEK1(K129R), indicating the involvement of JNK pathway in UV-induced apoptosis. Ectopic expression of the full-length Rb or Rb(761–928) in Saos-2 cells converted transfected cells to a UV-resistant phenotype (Fig.6 A). In comparison, UV-induced apoptosis was not affected by Rb(1–886). Rb(1–886) contains the intact Rb A- and B-pocket domains, but has a disrupted C-pocket domain. We also examined an effect of Rb on ΔMEKK1-induced cell death. ΔMEKK1, a constitutively active form of MEKK1, has been shown to induce apoptosis (8.Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Diener K.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Gleavy J. Jarpe M.B. Minden A. Karin M. Zon L.I. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3229-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and JNK activity was markedly stimulated in ΔMEKK1-transfected Saos-2 cells (data not shown). Overexpression of ΔMEKK1 in Saos-2 cells induced cell death, and ΔMEKK1-induced cell death was abrogated by SEK1(K129R) (Fig.6 B). These data suggest that ΔMEKK1 induces cell death through the MEKK1-SEK1-JNK/SAPK signaling cascade. ΔMEKK1-induced cell death was prevented by the full-length Rb or Rb(761–928), but not by Rb(1–886) (Fig. 6 B). Rb does not affect the catalytic activities of the JNK/SAPK upstream kinases, MEKK1 and SEK1 (Fig. 2). Taken together, these findings suggest that Rb repress JNK activation and this inhibitory function of Rb may be an important mechanism by which it prevents JNK-mediated cell death. Our results in this study suggest a novel function of Rb: Rb silences the function of JNK/SAPK. In this way, Rb may repress the stress-activated signals that are mediated by the JNK pathway. Interestingly, Rb suppresses apoptosis by a mechanism that is poorly understood (21.Clarke A.R. Maandag E.R. van Roon M. van der Lugt N.M. van der Valk M. Hooper M.L. Berns A. te Riele H.

Furthermore, Rb can be cleaved by a caspase during apoptosis, and the cleavage of Rb appears to lose its anti-cell death function (26.Tan X. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol.

The cleavage occurs at the COOH-terminal region between Asp886 and Gly887, generating a Rb protein that lacks 42 amino acids (26.Tan X. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The caspase-cleaved Rb can still interact with the Rb-binding proteins such as E2F or cyclin D as efficiently as a full-length Rb (13.Tan X. Wang J.Y.

This may imply that JNK might be a critical target of Rb in order for Rb to suppress stress-induced cell death. Thus, the JNK/SAPK inhibition may be a new function of Rb that negatively regulates stress-activated signaling cascades. We thank R. J. Davis, J. Woodgett, M. Karin, L. I. Zon, J. Pouyssegur, R. J.

The myristates are added in the final stages of GPI biosynthesis in a remodeling reaction. Remodeling occurs first at the sn-2 position of glycerol, involving removal of a longer fatty acid and subsequent attachment of myristate. The second myristate is then incorporated into thesn-1 position, but the mechanism has been unclear due to the unavailability of a reliable cell-free system supporting complete remodeling. Here, we first refined the cell-free system (by removing Mn2+ ions), thereby allowing efficient production of the dimyristoylated GPI precursor. Using this improved system, we made three new discoveries concerning the pathway for fatty acid remodeling. First, we discovered a monomyristoylated GPI (known as glycolipid θ′) as an intermediate involved in remodeling at the sn-1 position. Second, we found an alternative pathway for production of glycolipid θ, the first lyso intermediate in remodeling. The alternative pathway involves an inositol-acylated GPI known as glycolipid lyso-C′. Finally, we found that there is significant breakdown of GPIs during remodeling in the cell-free system, and we speculate that this breakdown has a regulatory role in GPI biosynthesis.

Neither the inhibition by Cu2+ nor that by Zn2+ is dependent on calmodulin. nitric oxide nitric-oxide synthase (6R)-5,6,7,8,-tetrahydro-l-biopterin cytochrome P450 reductase neuronal nitric-oxide synthase calmodulin dithiothreitol Nitric oxide (NO)1 has been shown to be a participant in many physiological processes ranging from intercellular signal transduction to the immune response.

Nitric-oxide synthase (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39) catalyzes the biosynthesis of NO through an oxidative reaction on the amino acidl-arginine that ultimately results in carbon-nitrogen bond cleavage to yield citrulline and NO. The only known intermediate in this reaction isN G-hydroxy-l-arginine (6.Pufahl R.A. Nanjappan P.G. Woodard R.W.

The NOS oxygenase domain stoichiometrically binds protoporphyrin IX type heme and (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (H4B). The heme iron is ligated to the NOS polypeptide chain through a cysteine thiolate; thus, the heme is a member of the cytochrome P450 class of enzymes and displays optical and magnetic properties typical of other known cytochrome P450s (8.Richards M.K.

Three sets of crystal structures of the dimeric form of the oxygenase domain have been reported recently (14.Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A.

Although no structures are currently available for either the reductase domain or the full-length NOS, it is known that each reductase domain binds one equivalent of FMN and one equivalent of FAD (17.Hevel J.M.

The reductase domain shuttles NADPH-derived electrons to the active site heme to support catalysis in the oxygenase domain. Presumably, electron transfer proceeds in a manner analogous to that in cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), another two-flavin reductase. Like CPR, the nNOS reductase domain contains an air-stable neutral semiquinone radical on its high potential flavin (known in CPR, and presumed in NOS, to be FMN) (8.Richards M.K. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14723-14732Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12.Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol.

Another similarity between CPR and the neuronal NOS (nNOS) reductase domain is the ability of each to reduce artificial electron acceptors such as ferricytochrome c, ferricyanide, and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (20.Vermilion J.L. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 266-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol.

The oxygenase and reductase domains of NOS are linked by a region of the polypeptide that recognizes Ca2+-bound calmodulin (CaM). CaM binding accelerates both intradomain electron transfer (from NADPH through the reductase domain) and interdomain electron transfer (from the reductase to the oxygenase domain) (25.Abu-Soud H.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20594-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because NOS has been heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, a variety of genetic manipulations (including site-directed mutagenesis and the independent expression of each domain) are possible (28.Gerber N.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17791-17796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Alternatively, CaM-responsive reductase domain can be obtained as a proteolytic byproduct of the full-length nNOS E. coliexpression and purification procedure (21.Perry J.M. Moon N. Zhao Y. Dunham W.R. Marletta M.A. Chem. & Biol. 1998; 5: 355-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this report, we have used the CaM-responsive nNOS reductase domain (generated by the latter method) in conjunction with the full-length nNOS to demonstrate that two known NOS inhibitors (Cu2+ and Zn2+) exert their effects on the reductase domain of NOS (29.Persechini A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15091-15095Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30.Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These results are significant because they reconcile existing biochemical data (that certain transition metals, including Zn2+, inhibit NOS catalysis) with structural arguments, which suggest that Zn2+ bound to the oxygenase domain may actually be pivotal (i.e. essential and noninhibitory) for proper H4B orientation and/or l-arginine binding (15.Raman C.S.

In addition, complementary results from this study have enabled us to propose a mechanism of ferricytochrome creduction by the nNOS reductase domain that resolves the differences between previously reported sets of data (22.Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Klatt P. Heinzel B. John M. Kastner M. Bohme E. Mayer B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20594-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism invokes the in situ production of superoxide to bridge the high potential flavin of the reductase domain and the heme of ferricytochrome c. These results are also significant because they highlight a potential structural difference between the nNOS reductase domain and CPR, namely, that the high potential flavin of the nNOS reductase domain is not as surface-accessible as that of CPR. 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose, calmodulin-Sepharose 4B, and the HiLoad 26/60 Superdex-200 gel filtration column were purchased from Pharmacia. H4B was purchased from B. Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). l-[14C]Arginine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and ampicillin were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The original cDNA clone for rat neuronal NOS, in the vector Bluescript (SK−), was a generous gift from Dr. Solomon H. Snyder (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). We subcloned the nNOS cDNA into a commonly used cytochrome P450 expression vector, pCWori, which was generously provided by Dr. Michael R. Waterman (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Horse heart cytochrome c, HEPES buffer, NADPH, xanthine, xanthine oxidase, manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), dithiothreitol (DTT), glycerol, CaM, and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Full-length nNOS and the nNOS reductase domain were overproduced and purified as described previously (21.Perry J.M. Moon N. Zhao Y. Dunham W.R. Marletta M.A. Chem. & Biol. 1998; 5: 355-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, four 1-liter cultures of DH5α E. coli cells containing the pCWori-nNOS expression plasmid were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.8 and subsequently cooled to 25 °C prior to the induction of nNOS expression by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 18–21 h postinduction. The nNOS purification involves three steps: CaM affinity chromatography followed by ADP-affinity chromatography, and ultimately, gel filtration on Superdex-200 media. CaM-responsive reductase domain copurifies with the full-length nNOS up to the gel filtration step where they are resolved from one another, each to homogeneity. Both the full-length nNOS and the reductase domain can reduce ferricytochrome c. The rate of this reaction was measured by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 550 nm (Δε = 21,000 m−1cm−1) over time. Each assay contained 2.5 mmCaCl2, 20 μg of CaM, and 50 μm cytochromec in 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) unless otherwise specified. Various concentrations of full-length nNOS or reductase domain were used depending on the nature of the experiment. Full-length nNOS assays also contained 5 μmH4B and 50 μm DTT, neither of which reduced ferricytochrome c at the specified concentrations. In addition, the indicated assays contained varying concentrations of transition metals, all added as their chloride salts. All ferricytochrome c reduction assays were performed at 25 °C in a total volume of 500 μL and were initiated by the addition of 500 μm NADPH. The NADPH oxidase activity of full-length nNOS was determined by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (Δε = 6, 200 m−1 cm−1) over time. Assays contained 2.5 mm CaCl2, 20 μg CaM, 80 nm nNOS, 5 μm H4B, 50 μm DTT, and varying concentrations of either CuCl2 or ZnCl2 and were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Reactions (total volume of 500 μL) were initiated by the addition of 150 μm NADPH. Assays measuring citrulline formation by nNOS in the presence of various concentrations of Cu2+or Zn2+ were also performed. These assays (total volume of 300 μL) contained 100 μml-[14C]arginine (1.5 mCi/mmol), 20 μg of CaM, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 130 nm nNOS, 50 μm H4B, 500 μm DTT, and varying concentrations of either CuCl2 or ZnCl2. All citrulline assays were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and were initiated by the addition of 1 mmNADPH. SOD was assayed following a method similar to that published by Beyer and Fridovich (31.Beyer W.F. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). In this assay, the activity of SOD is measured as the inhibition of superoxide-dependent reduction of ferricytochromec. The xanthine/xanthine oxidase system is used to generate superoxide, and the reaction is monitored at 550 nm. The assay contained 200 μm xanthine, 10 nm xanthine oxidase, 50 μm cytochrome c, and 100 units of Mn-SOD. SOD assays (total volume of 500 μL) were run at 25 °C in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Xanthine oxidase activity was confirmed prior to the SOD assays by following the increase in absorbance at 293 nm resulting from the conversion of xanthine to urate. Xanthine oxidase assays (total volume of 1 mL) contained 200 μm xanthine and 10 nm xanthine oxidase and were run at 25 °C in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). All spectra and kinetic traces were recorded on a Varian Cary 3E spectrophotometer at a constant temperature of 25 °C maintained by a Neslab circulating water bath. nNOS reductase domain (100 μL, 16 μm in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 3 mmCaCl2, 60 μm CaM) was mixed with 100 μL of various concentrations of either ZnCl2 or CuCl2in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm NADPH in a Hi-Tech stopped flow instrument at 25 °C. The reaction was monitored by the change in absorbance at 454 nm. Inhibition of ferricytochrome c reductase activity is shown in Fig.1. Cu2+ and Zn2+each inhibit this activity in both the reductase domain and the full-length enzyme in a concentration dependent manner; however, the inhibition brought about by Cu2+ is more pronounced in the presence of the oxygenase domain (with the full-length nNOS). That is, while Zn2+ inhibited ferricytochrome c reduction by the full-length nNOS and the independent reductase domain to similar extents, the inhibition observed with Cu2+ was two orders of magnitude more potent with the full-length nNOS than it was with the reductase domain (the IC50 values were 0.12 and 12 μm, respectively). Ferricytochrome c reduction activities in both full-length nNOS and the reductase domain are greatly enhanced by association with Ca2+-bound CaM. We therefore had to rule out the possibility that the observed inhibition was simply a consequence of the transition metals either (i) competing for the required Ca2+ or (ii) binding to one or more of the six auxiliary cation binding sites on CaM, which could distort its structure, thereby rendering it inactive. In the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, it had previously been shown that each of these auxiliary sites can bind Zn2+ with aK d of approximately 833 μm (32.Milos M. Comte M. Schaer J.J. Cox J.A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1989; 36: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This concentration of Zn2+ greatly exceeds the levels used here; however, it is conceivable that, upon association with nNOS (or its reductase domain), CaM attains a conformation more amenable to Zn2+ binding, which in turn results in the observed inhibition. Fig. 2 examines the possibility of CaM inhibition by using the reductase domain. The figure demonstrates that the inhibition of reductase domain mediated ferricytochrome c reduction by Cu2+ and Zn2+ does not, in fact, even require CaM. This result is consistent with the metals interacting with the reductase domain itself. It was also possible that the observed inhibition of ferricytochrome c reduction was related to Cu2+ and Zn2+ modulating the ability of ferricytochrome c to accept electrons from the reductase domain. This could happen either by (i) metal binding to and altering the conformation of ferricytochrome c, somehow making it less susceptible to reduction or (ii) by a metal-induced disruption of the presumed interaction between nNOS and cytochrome c (24.Klatt P. Heinzel B. John M. Kastner M. Bohme E. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11374-11378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address this possibility, we performed NADPH oxidation assays on the full-length nNOS. In this case, the electron acceptor is the NOS heme, and ultimately, molecular oxygen. Therefore, it is an internal (interdomain) electron transfer that does not rely on any interaction with, or structural integrity of, an artificial acceptor molecule. Furthermore, inhibition of NADPH oxidation by Cu2+ and Zn2+ would suggest that inhibition of ferricytochromec reduction was not caused by an effect by the metals on either cytochrome c itself, or cytochrome c-NOS docking. Fig. 3 shows that NADPH oxidation by the full-length nNOS is in fact inhibited by both Cu2+ and Zn2+ in a concentration-dependent manner. The estimated IC50 values for the observed inhibition are 6 and 9 μm, respectively. Having demonstrated that the function of the reductase domain is impaired by Cu2+ and Zn2+, we sought to correlate the inhibition of NADPH oxidation and ferricytochrome c reduction with the previously reported inhibition of NOS-catalyzed citrulline formation by these metals (29.Persechini A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15091-15095Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30.Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Such a correlation for each metal is shown in Fig. 4, and the IC50 values for the inhibition of each activity are summarized in TableI. With Zn2+ (Fig.4 A), the inhibition data for all three full-length nNOS activities are similar, which suggests that the ability of Zn2+ to inhibit citrulline formation can be traced to an interaction that involves the reductase domain, exclusively. The situation with Cu2+ (Fig. 4 B) is not quite as simple, indicating that Cu2+ may not interact with nNOS in precisely the same manner as Zn2+. Nevertheless, the results with Cu2+ remain consistent with the conclusion that the observed inhibition of citrulline formation is also a consequence of an interaction between the added metal and the reductase domain.Table ISummary of Cu 2+ and Zn 2+ inhibitionEnzymeAssayIC50 valueCu2+Zn2+aCu2+ and Zn2+ were both added as the dichloride salt.μmFull-length nNOScitrulline formation1931cyt-c reductionbcyt-c reduction, ferricytochrome creduction.0.1215NADPH oxidation69Reductase domain (+CaM)cyt-creduction1222Reductase domain (−CaM)cyt-creduction3312a Cu2+ and Zn2+ were both added as the dichloride salt.b cyt-c reduction, ferricytochrome creduction. Open table in a new tab A stopped-flow kinetic analysis of flavin reduction shows that NADPH can efficiently reduce the low potential flavin of the reductase domain in the presence of an inhibitory concentration of either Cu2+ (50 μm) or Zn2+ (100 μm). Fig.5 A compares the rates of flavin reduction (as measured by the change in absorbance at 454 nm) observed under these conditions with that observed in the absence of exogenous transition metals. Data collected from reactions that contained no exogenous transition metals as well as those collected from reactions that included 100 μm Zn2+ were best fit to single exponential equations to generate pseudo first-order rate constants (k obs) of 60 and 46 s−1, respectively (at 25 °C). Data collected from the reactions that contained Cu2+ were not well fit by a similar equation; however, full spectra collected by diode array 2.5 s postmixing confirmed the reduction of the low potential flavin (Fig. 5 B). Electronic absorption spectra of the visible region of cytochrome c in the presence of CaM-bound reductase domain (Fig.6 A) demonstrate the dramatic effect of air (presumably mediated by oxygen) on the rate of ferricytochrome c reduction. Fig. 6 B shows the anaerobic chemical reduction of ferricytochrome c, demonstrating that the emerging species in the upper panel is indeed the reduced form of cytochrome c and that the formation of this species does not require oxygen. In addition, we show in Fig.7 that the effect of air on the rate of ferricytochrome c reduction is not exclusive to the CaM-bound reductase domain. Although this effect is more pronounced in the presence of CaM (over a 20-fold difference in rate, TableII), anaerobic reactions performed in the absence of CaM still show a decrease in the rate relative to comparable aerobic reactions, from 0.54 to 0.20 μmol min−1mg−1.Figure 7The air-induced rate enhancement of ferricytochrome c reduction by the nNOS reductase domain: the effect of CaM.

Whether or not ferricytochrome c reduction by nNOS can be inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD) has been a source of considerable debate in the literature (22.Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Klatt P. Heinzel B. John M. Kastner M. Bohme E. Mayer B. J. Biol.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7772-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because we observed an air-dependent rate with the reductase domain, experiments addressing the effect of SOD were carried out. When assaying the nNOS reductase domain, the inclusion of up to 1000 units of SOD had virtually no effect on the rate of ferricytochrome creduction (data not shown). In contrast to this result, 100 units of the same preparation of SOD completely inhibited the superoxide-mediated reduction of ferricytochrome c in the presence of 10 nm xanthine oxidase and 200 μmxanthine (0.3 nmol min−1 inhibited to 0.0 nmol min−1, data not shown). To test whether the inhibition by Cu2+ and Zn2+ was air-dependent, assays measuring the anaerobic rate of ferricytochrome creduction in the presence of various amounts of Zn2+ were carried out. The results are compared with similar assays performed under aerobic conditions in Table II. For these experiments, the use of Cu2+ was avoided to circumvent the potential complication that under anaerobic conditions Cu2+ could serve as a stable electron trap (Cu+), and in so doing, give an overestimation of the inhibition of ferricytochrome creduction. Table II shows that Zn2+ does in fact inhibit anaerobic ferricytochrome c reduction to an extent similar to that observed in aerobic assays. In fact, the potency of Zn2+ seems, if anything, slightly greater in the anaerobic assays. The observed inhibition in the presence of 20 μmZn2+ is approximately 50% in aerobic assays and approximately 75% in anaerobic assays. At 80 μmZn2+, the observed inhibition is 95% and 99%, respectively. The data presented in this report all support the conclusion that Cu2+ and Zn2+ inhibit nNOS catalysis as a result of a direct interaction with the reductase domain of the enzyme. All three commonly assayed full-length NOS activities (citrulline formation, ferricytochrome c reduction, and NADPH oxidation) were inhibited by both Cu2+ and Zn2+. Likewise, Cu2+ and Zn2+ each inhibited ferricytochromec reduction by the independent reductase domain. The estimated IC50 values for all of these reactions (with the exception of the inhibition of full-length nNOS ferricytochromec reduction by Cu2+) were in the low μm (6–33 μm) range. Interestingly, Cu2+ inhibited full-length NOS ferricytochrome creduction more potently (by two orders of magnitude) than it inhibited the same activity of the reductase domain (IC50 values of 0.12 and 12 μm, respectively). The reason for this difference is not clear; however, because the components of the assay are otherwise equivalent, it suggests that the oxygenase domain of NOS influences Cu2+ binding to the reductase domain. There are many ways in which the oxygenase domain could exert such an effect. For example, it could contribute to Cu2+ binding directly, by (for example) donating a metal ligand. Alternatively, the oxygenase domain could influence the structure of reductase domain by domain-domain contacts, perhaps thereby altering its conformation to a state more amenable to Cu2+ binding. A third possibility is that the conformation of the full-length nNOS is modified by the docking of cytochrome c"

As [Young][1] explains in a Perspective, although the intervening 12 years has revealed that the product of the tau gene is a crucial player in the intricate workings of the mammalian clock, its identity has remained a mystery. Now new findings ([ Lowrey et al .][2]) definitively show that tau encodes a casein kinase Ie and is a homolog of the clock gene double-time in the fruit fly. In wild-type hamsters, the casein kinase Ie phosphorylates the crucial circadian clock protein, PER, which is retained in the cytoplasm and degraded. In tau hamsters, phosphorylation of PER is defective and so PER may be able to move to the nucleus and repress transcription of per genes prematurely, speeding up the circadian clock.

https://openalex.org/W1996178975,"Glucose repression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can now be seen to operate at two levels: regulation of transcription of certain genes and control of the half-life of the corresponding mRNAs (Scheffler, I. E., de la Cruz, B. J., and Prieto, S. (1998) Int. J. Biochem Cell Biol. 30, 1175–1193). For example, the steady state levels of SDH2mRNA and SUC2 mRNA are significantly determined by their differential rates of turnover. A current model for the mechanism of mRNA turnover includes three distinct steps: a rate-limiting deadenylation, removal of the 5′-7-methyl-G (decapping), and 5′-3′ exonuclease digestion. We have investigated the same three reactions during glucose-induced degradation of these transcripts. Our results indicate that while decapping (by Dcp1p) and 5′-3′ exonuclease digestion (by Xrn1p) are obligatory steps for the rapid degradation of these mRNAs, the dependence on deadenylation is more complicated. At steady state in glycerol these transcripts have very short poly(A) tails but are nevertheless very stable; the addition of glucose causes immediate decapping and degradation without further deadenylation; in contrast, newly made SUC2 mRNA (after a shift from glucose to glycerol) has significantly longer poly(A) tails, and such transcripts are not rapidly degraded upon addition of glucose. A constitutive deadenylation reaction that is independent of the carbon source eventually makes the stability of these transcripts very sensitive to glucose. These results are interpreted in terms of a working hypothesis proposing a competition between translational initiation and decapping influenced by the carbon source. The presence of a long poly(A) tail may also affect this competition in favor of translational initiation and mRNA stabilization. Glucose repression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can now be seen to operate at two levels: regulation of transcription of certain genes and control of the half-life of the corresponding mRNAs (Scheffler, I.

The phenomenon is therefore often referred to as “glucose repression.” Among the gene products repressed are those required for the uptake and metabolism of other sugars such as sucrose and galactose, as well as a large number of gene products required for respiration and oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Until recently, almost all of the attention was focused on the control of gene expression at the transcriptional level (2.Johnston M. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Trumbly R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 4.Johnston M. Carlson M. Broach J. Jones E.W.

Our laboratory has investigated how glucose regulates the expression of the SDH2 gene encoding the iron-protein subunit of succinate:quinone oxidoreductase (complex II) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7.Lombardo A. Carine K. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10419-10423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Lombardo A. Cereghino G.P. Scheffler I.E. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1995; 6: 1125-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). When a culture in YPG with de-repressed levels of SDH2mRNA is rapidly exposed to glucose by the addition of this fermentable substrate to the medium, SDH2 mRNA levels drop precipitously with an estimated half-life of 5–7 min (8.Lombardo A. Cereghino G.P. Scheffler I.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9.Cereghino G.P. Atencio D.P. Saghbini M. Beiner J. Scheffler I.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1125-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Experiments performed with a mutant with a temperature-sensitive RNA polymerase II (10.Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) revealed that these differences in mRNA levels depending on the carbon source are due to differential stability ofSDH2 mRNA. Studies to identify what distinguishes mRNAs with a short half-life from mRNAs with a long half-life (i.e. what are the required cis-acting elements within the SDH2 mRNA?) concluded that the 5′-UTR1 was the dominantcis-acting determinant controlling the behavior of this mRNA in different media (9.Cereghino G.P. Atencio D.P. Saghbini M. Beiner J. Scheffler I.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1125-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Exhaustive investigations have not yet been performed, but the same kind of behavior is clearly observed with the functionally related SDH1 transcript, encoding the flavoprotein subunit (Fp) of mitochondrial complex II, and with theSUC2 mRNA, encoding invertase, and previously believed to be controlled exclusively at the level of transcription (11.Cereghino G.P. Scheffler I.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The phenomenon of glucose repression, therefore, appears to involve at least two independent mechanisms, one acting at the level of transcription, and another controlling mRNA stability. Considerable progress has been made in recent years in understanding the mechanism of mRNA turnover in yeast, especially with reference to the subset of constitutively short-lived mRNAs. The subject has been extensively reviewed (12.Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 13.Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 14.Anderson J.S.J. Parker R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 780-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15.Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). A favored current model has the following three steps: 1) shortening of the poly(A) tail, 2) decapping, and 3) 5′-3′ exonucleotlytic degradation. Poly(A) tail shortening is thought to be a key rate-limiting and obligate step in the decay of constitutively short-lived mRNAs. Factors including Pab1p, the poly(A)-binding protein, and a nuclease associated with Pab1p as well as cis-elements within the mRNA (primarily at the 3′ end) are thought to regulate the rate of deadenylation. However, Pab1p also interacts with the 5′ end of the mRNA via translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), giving Pab1p a potential role in regulating translation efficiency (17.Tarun Jr., S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). After the tail is sufficiently shortened, removal of the cap by the decapping enzyme follows. However, deadenylation can also be uncoupled from decapping (18.Morrissey J.P. Deardorff J.A. Hebron C. Sachs A.B. Yeast. 1999; 15: 687-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Finally, the rapid 5′-3′ exonucleolytic degradation is due primarily to the constitutive Xrn1 nuclease, accounting for a large fraction (∼30%) of such an activity in yeast. The 5′-exonuclease encoded by the XRN1 gene was found to be required for the glucose-induced degradation of the SDH2 andSDH1 mRNAs (9.Cereghino G.P. Atencio D.P. Saghbini M. Beiner J. Scheffler I.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1125-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The required role of Dcp1p is documented in the present studies, and it seems clear that the 5′ cap protects these mRNAs from the exonuclease. It was also unresolved whether the glucose signal was targeted at the potentially rate-limiting deadenylation reaction. In other words, does glucose trigger a rapid shortening of the poly(A) tails, resulting in rapid degradation? To address these questions the present study examined the length and size distribution of the poly(A) tails on two different mRNAs,SDH2 and SUC2 mRNA, during derepression, at high steady state levels during growth in YPG, and immediately after the addition of glucose. The glucose signal did not induce any further changes that could have accounted for the rapid initiation of turnover. Our working hypothesis therefore proposes that the glucose signal is directed at events at the 5′ ends of the specific mRNAs.

Yeast cells were grown on YPD (1% Bacto Yeast Extract, 2% Bacto Peptone, 2% dextrose), or YPG (1% Bacto Yeast Extract, 2% Bacto Peptone, 3% glycerol) (19.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B.

Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Media, PA1988Google Scholar), followed by two additional 2 m lithium chloride precipitations (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to increase the purity of the RNA. The total RNA concentration of each sample were determined spectrophotometrically. Northern analyses were carried out by standard protocols (20.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Media, PA1988Google Scholar). Filters were UV cross-linked for 75 s in a Fotodyne DNA transfer lamp. Prehybridization and hybridization solutions consisted of 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 200 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, for random primer hybridization. For oligonucleotide hybridizations 15% formamide was used instead of 50%. The signal on Northern blots was quantitated with a Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) Molecular Imager System GS-525. The amount of specific mRNA in each lane was normalized using 25 S rRNA as a constitutive control. In order to obtain an rRNA signal that is precisely proportional to total RNA loading, different hybridization conditions (time of incubation with the probe, amounts of probe) were optimized for the oligomeric 25 S rRNA probe. The probe was an oligonucleotide of the following sequence: 5′-ATCCGCTAAGGAGTGTGTAACAACTCACC-3′ (22.Hillis D.M. Dixon M.T. Q. Rev. Biol. 1991; 66: 411-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by polynucleotide kinase. A 1-h incubation with 100,000 cpm of rRNA radioactive probe for each blot was chosen as the condition yielding a linear response and a signal comparable to the signal from a SDH2 random primed probe. To measure the length of the poly(A) tails of the SDH2 mRNA and SUC2mRNAs, these mRNAs were first cleaved by RNase H in the presence of oligonucleotides complementary to a selected region of the 3′-UTR of the respective mRNA (as described in the figure legends). Ten micrograms of total RNA were hybridized with 300 ng of mRNA-specific oligonucleotide (OL1, INVER-1) in the presence or absence of 2 μg of oligo(dT) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated with 0.025 units/μl of RNase H in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.27 units/μl RNAsin for 20 min at 37 °C (23.Porter D. Curthoys N.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). RNA fragments were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide, 7.7m urea gels, transferred by an electroblotter to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized with specific32P-labeled oligonucleotides (OL2, INVER-2). Size standards in flanking lanes were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and used to estimate the length of the undigested transcripts, and of the single and double-digested 3′ fragments. Details for the quantitative analysis are given in the figure legends. The probe for the 5′ region of the SDH2transcript was derived from a 568-base pairPstI-XbaI fragment of the coding sequence (7.Lombardo A. Carine K. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10419-10423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled by random priming. The oligonucleotides used for probing the 3′ fragments are described in Table II and were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the T4 polynucleotide kinase reaction as described (20.Ausubel F.M.

Aliquots of the glucose-grown cells (20 ml) were placed into 50-ml tubes and centrifuged for 4 min at 2000 rpm. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellets were resuspended in YPG, or again in YPD for some controls, and grown with vigorous shaking at 30 °C. After some time (see figures), one of the YPG tubes, as well as the one with YPD, were processed. One ml of 50% glucose was added to the remaining tubes containing YPG (to obtain 2.5% glucose, YPG + D), and these cultures were harvested after the desired incubation times and immediately processed for RNA extraction. Polyribosomes were prepared and fractionated basically as described by Mangus and Jacobson (24.Mangus D.A. Jacobson A. Methods: A Companion to Methods Enzymol. 1998; 17: 28-37Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Extracts (DL1 strain) were obtained from 400-ml cultures (A 600 = 0.5–0.8) after growth under three different conditions: (i) glucose-repression conditions in YPD; (ii) 30 min after derepression in YPG; (iii) 3 h after derepression in YPG. Cultures were centrifuged and quickly resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer. Lysis buffer contained: 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.4 μg/ml pepstatin. After a brief centrifugation (until the rotor has reached 3,000 × g), the supernatant was discarded. The cell suspension was transferred to a new tube and the cells were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer. The suspension was divided into two Eppendorf tubes containing 400 μl of glass beads and “retched” for 3 times for 90 on a Glens Mills Retch bead-beater, cooling down in ice for 2 min between agitations. After lysis, the mixture of beads and broken cells was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at top speed for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and gently laid on top of an 11-ml 7–47% (w/w) sucrose gradient. The gradient buffer contained: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mm NH4Cl, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol and appropriate amount of sucrose. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 2 h and 45 min and then pumped through an UV monitor (A 254 filter) with a peristaltic pump. The profile of the gradients was monitored on a chart recorder and 0.6-ml samples were collected using a fraction collector. The samples were frozen at −70 °C until used for RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated from each fraction by addition of SDS and Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to 1.2% and 120 mm, respectively, and then by three phenol/chloroform extractions followed by one chloroform extraction. The samples were then ethanol precipitated (in the presence of 0.2 m sodium acetate) and resuspended into 20 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water with RNasin. Electrophoresis of RNA, blotting, and hybridization with oligonucleotides were performed as described above. [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]dATP were purchased from ICN (Cleveland, OH). All other chemicals used were of the highest grade available. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs and used according to the manufacturer's specifications. Bacterial transformations were performed using the heat shock protocol (25.Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method (26.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Invertase was assayed following a protocol from the laboratory of Dr. S. Emr (University of California, San Diego) adapted from Goldstein and Lampen (27.Goldstein A. Lampen J.O. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 42: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It has previously been described how the glucose-induced turnover ofSDH2 mRNA in yeast is slowed down in an xrn1mutant strain (t 12 > 20 min versus t 12 = 5 min for the wild type) after glucose addition to a glycerol-grown culture (9.Cereghino G.P. Atencio D.P. Saghbini M. Beiner J. Scheffler I.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1125-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Others have described that in the absence of the decapping function (Dcp1p) the degradation of several yeast mRNAs, including transcripts with rapid, intermediate, and slow decay rates, is slowed down considerably (28.Beelman C.A. Stevens A. Caponigro G. LaGrandeur T.E. Hatfield L. Fortner D.M. Parker R. Nature. 1996; 382: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,29.LaGrandeur T.E. Parker R. The EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). When the gene (DCP1) for the decapping enzyme was identified, we examined the kinetics of glucose-induced turnover ofSDH2 mRNA in a knock-out compared with its wild type (Fig. 1 B). The xrn1strain and its wild type parent (Fig. 1 A) were also included in this quantitative analysis. The half-life of the message was calculated (Fig. 1, bottom plots) using an improved method for quantitation (see “Experimental Procedures”) where the signal is normalized to the amount of 25 S rRNA loaded per lane. The rate ofSDH2 mRNA turnover in both mutants is strongly affected, especially in the dcp1 strain, where the SDH2mRNA levels persist for more than 15 min after addition of glucose to the YPG medium. Although it is the major 5′-3′ exonuclease, Xrn1p accounts only for approximately 30–40% of the total RNase activity of crude yeast extracts (30.Stevens A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3080-3085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Larimer F.W. Hsu C.L. Maupin M.K. Stevens A. Gene (Amst .). 1992; 120: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); therefore it is not surprising that we can still observe some degradation of the SDH2 mRNA in the xrn1 mutant. These results prove that the degradation of the SDH2mRNA induced by glucose shares at least the last two steps of a general mechanism of mRNA turnover in yeast. It seems quite plausible that the 7-methyl-G cap at the 5′ of the transcript protects the mRNA from the exonuclease in the absence of glucose. The first step, frequently considered as a rate-limiting step of the mRNA degradation process, is the shortening of the poly(A) tail (32.Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 33.Caponigro G. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, at least one exception has been described: nonsense-mediated mRNA decay also involves decapping and the 5′-exonuclease, but it is independent of deadenylation (16.Jacobson A. Peltz S.W.

First, the poly(A) tail distribution of SDH2 mRNA from a wild type strain, DL1, was studied (Fig.2). Poly(A) tail length was measured using RNA from de-repressed cells in YPG, and following the addition of glucose to these cultures. To enhance the resolution, the body of the transcript was shortened by cleavage with RNase H at a downstream site defined by an oligonucleotide complementary to sequences near its 3′ end. The distribution of the lengths of the poly(A) tails at each time point, before and after glucose addition to the YPG culture, was obtained from a comparison of the 3′ fragments obtained after RNase H digestion with a single oligonucleotide, and a sample where the poly(A) tail had also been removed in the presence of oligo(dT). The details are described under “Experimental Procedures” and in the figure legends. The results were the following. 1) The uncut RNA and the digested samples migrated to the expected positions (uncut mRNA, 1.2 kilobases, and the double-digested fragment, 170 bases, results not shown), in agreement with the position of the poly(A) site determined independently (9.Cereghino G.P. Atencio D.P. Saghbini M. Beiner J. Scheffler I.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1125-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 2) There is always a difference between the samples subjected to single (3′ specific oligonucleotide) and double digestion (3′ specific oligo + oligo(dT)), proof that the achieved resolution is sufficient to distinguish between RNA fragments containing even a relatively short poly(A) tail, and those without one. The signal in the C boxes corresponding to double-digested, deadenylated 3′ fragments (Fig. 2) reflects the derepression of SDH2 mRNA from YPD to YPG, and the turnover after addition of glucose to the YPG culture (dotted line in the inset graph), as expected. From a visual inspection of the blot, the signal corresponding toSDH2 poly(A) tails also appears to diminish with time after glucose addition to the YPG culture, but a plot of the A/(A+B) ratios (solid lane in the inset graph) suggests that there is no significant change with time for SDH2 mRNAs extracted from YPG or from YPG + D cultures. This ratio estimates the fraction of molecules with a poly(A) tail. Most of the mRNAs have poly(A) tails less than 30 nt long. A more detailed quantitative analysis of the data is shown at the bottom of Fig. 2. By subdividing the entire range (A + B) into smaller boxes and quantitating their content, a complete distribution of poly(A) tail lengths can be obtained. The distributions at various times after addition of glucose exhibit a change in peak height, reflecting the decay, but no significant change in the position of the peak or the overall shape of the curve, reflecting length distributions. The tail is already quite short at steady state in YPG. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of the signal distribution on the gel reveals that there is globalSDH2 mRNA turnover but no glucose-induced deadenylation. A repeat experiment with wild type cells focused on a higher time resolution of the behavior during the first 10 min (results not shown). Again, the distribution of poly(A) tail lengths did not change appreciably in this time frame, in contrast to what would be expected if glucose-induced deadenylation was obligatory to allow the rapid degradation. The analysis of poly(A) tail lengths in the wild type strain is complicated by the rapid turnover of the SDH2 mRNA. The use of the dcp1 and xrn1 mutants permitted the study of the SDH2 poly(A) tail in a time frame when most of the SDH2 mRNA population would be degraded in a wild type strain. The experiment performed with the dcp1 mutant is shown in Fig. 3 A. After 10 min, more than 50% of the SDH2 mRNA present in glycerol would have been degraded in the wild type strain (see Fig. 1), and an obligatory, rate-limiting deadenylation triggered by glucose would have been expected to be detectable at that time. The distribution of the signal in the samples from a single digestion reveals a high proportion of the fragments concentrated at a position not much different from that of the double-digested samples. This observation suggests that most of the SDH2 mRNA population appears to have extremely short poly(A) tails in YPG medium even prior to the addition of glucose. This observation is not entirely unexpected. Because in thedcp1 mutant RNA turnover is slow, the average age of all RNA molecules is greater than in wild type cells under similar conditions, and a constitutive poly(A) shortening is expected to occur (see “Discussion”). Nevertheless, in YPG even molecules with very short or apparently no tails are completely stable. The signals corresponding to double digested samples show how the mRNA is de-repressed in glycerol (due to transcriptional activation) but is relatively stable following glucose addition due to"
https://openalex.org/W1514729297,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the commonest neurodegenerative diseases of old age but its causes remain unclear. It is known that a cardinal feature of the disease is loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain with concomitant loss of motor control. Several genes that are mutated in the rare inherited form of the disease have been discovered. Now, as [Dawson][1] outlines, two recent papers report the first animal models of PD in flies and mice, fueling optimism that there will be rapid further progress in working out the pathogenesis of this disease and in designing more effective treatments.

MPR 300 can bind mannose 6-phosphate (Man6P)-containing ligands at the cell surface and endocytose extracellular Man6P-containing ligands. In addition, MPR 300 binds and internalizes the insulin-like growth factor II, which does not contain Man6P residues. This property appears to be important for controlling the serum level of insulin-like growth factor II (12.Filson A.J. Louvi A. Efstratiadis A. Robertson E.J. Development. 1993; 118: 731-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The insulin-like growth factor II binding region has been localized to the N-terminal portion of the repeating unit 11 (13.Schmidt B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In both MPRs the ligand binding domain resides in the lumenal, extracellular portion of the receptor (24.Wendland M. Hille A. Nagel G. Waheed A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signals in the MPRs needed for endocytosis from the cell surface and efficient incorporation into clathrin-coated pits in the TGN reside in the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors. The signal for the rapid internalization of MPR 300 at the plasma membrane has been localized to the pentapeptide KYSKV (residues 24–29 in its 163-residue cytoplasmic tail) (29.Lobel P. Fujimoto K.

MPR 46 appears to contain in its cytoplasmic tail of 67 residues several distinct signals for rapid internalization (32.Denzer K. Weber B. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33.Johnson F.K. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both receptors have a leucine-based sorting signal close to their C terminus, which is critical for their ability to sort lysosomal enzymes (32, 35 -37). The question of why two MPRs are present in mammalian cells remains unanswered. Analysis of cell lines deficient in MPR were obtained from mice with a targeted disruption of the respective MPR gene (23.Pohlmann R. Wendland M. Boeker C. von Figura K. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 80: 775-779Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Analysis of these cell lines has shown that each of the two MPRs contributes to the targeting of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes and that the complement of lysosomal enzymes that are transported by either receptor are distinct but largely overlapping. However, neither type of MPR appears to be sufficient for targeting of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes. This has been demonstrated by expression of either MPR 46 or MPR 300 in cells that lack endogenous MPRs (42.Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the receptor-deficient cells the bulk of lysosomal enzymes (>85%) are missorted into the secretions. Overexpression of MPR 46 to levels up to five times higher than the wild type level corrects missorting of only two-thirds of the newly synthesized lysosomal proteins. A 2-fold overexpression of MPR 300 is sufficient to fully correct the missorting of lysosomal enzymes. However, a substantial fraction of the lysosomal enzymes are targetted to lysosomes along a secretion recapture pathway, which depends on MPR 300-mediated endocytosis and is of minor importance in cells that express both types of MPR. To analyze whether the transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic domain of one MPR can substitute for the respective domains in the other MPR, chimeric receptors were constructed in which the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the two receptors were exchanged systematically. After expression in cells that are deficient in both MPRs, the ability of chimeric receptors to bind ligands, their subcellular distribution, and their sorting efficiency for lysosomal ligands was compared with that of wild type MPRs. All chimeras were functional and displayed a subcellular distribution pattern similar to the wild type MPRs. The ability to endocytose ligands depended on the presence of the lumenal domain of MPR 300. Furthermore, the sorting efficiency of receptors carrying the lumenal domain and/or the cytoplasmic domain of MPR 300 was markedly better than that of other receptors. The chimeras were named corresponding to the origin of the lumenal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domain of either MPR 300 (L) or MPR 46 (S) (see Fig. 1). Chimeras were constructed from the human cDNAs by PCR using the overlap extension method (43.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar, 44.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). Fragments of the genes that are to be recombined are generated in separate PCR reactions (primers 1 and 2 and primers 3 and 4). The primers are designed so that the ends of the products contain complementary sequences. When the PCR products are mixed, denatured, and reannealed, the strands having the matching sequences at their 3′ ends overlap and act as primers for each other. Extension of this overlap by DNA polymerase produces a molecule in which the original sequences are fused together. The recombinant product is PCR-amplified in the presence of primers for its 5′ and 3′ ends (primers 1 and 4). For expression all cDNAs were subcloned to the pMPSVHE or pMPSVEH vector (45.Artelt P. Morelle C. Ausmeier M. Fitzek M. Hauser H. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 68: 213-219Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For subcloning into MPR 300, an MluI restriction site was introduced behind the stop codon at position 7626. Chimeras containing the lumenal MPR 300 portion were subcloned into a pMPSV-derived vector containing MPR 300 cDNA by an internalNdeI site at position 6724 and the recombinantMluI site. Chimeras containing the lumenal MPR 46 portion were subcloned into a pMPSV-derived vector containing MPR 46 cDNA using an internal BglII site at position 545 and a multicloning EcoRI site at the 3′ end. All constructs were sequenced in the regions encompassing mutations using the ABI 373A system. The sequences of the primers used in this study are available on request. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and 10% fetal calf serum. Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21) were grown in the same medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Transfection of BHK21 was performed as reported (24.Wendland M. Hille A. Nagel G. Waheed A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and transfection of MEF deficient in MPR 46 and MPR 300 (mpr− MEF) was as described (42.Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For determination of relative amounts of human MPR 46 or MPR 300 wild type and chimeras, the iodinated monoclonal antibodies 21D3 and 2C2 recognizing the lumenal epitopes, MPR 46 or MPR 300, respectively, were used in the presence of saponin (46.Chao H.H.J. Waheed A. Pohlmann R. Hille A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For the determination of surface-associated MPRs, the incubation with the monoclonal antibodies was performed in the absence of saponin. Expression levels of MPR chimeras were determined as described (42.Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The amount of MPR 46 in control MEF and mpr−/MPR 46 clone II and IV was determined by Western blot analysis using a tail-specific antiserum against MPR 46. Correlation of the binding of the tail-specific antiserum with that of [125I]21D3 showed that binding of 13400 cpm[125I]21D3/mg of cell protein is equivalent to the endogenous level of MPR 46 in control MEF. For clones II–IV a high correlation between the binding of the polyclonal antiserum and the monoclonal 21D3 antibody was observed (r = 0.99). The amount of MPR 300 was calculated from the radioactivity incorporated into MPR 300 during a 16-h metabolic labeling in the presence of [35S]methionine referred to that incorporated into MPR 300 by control MEF. r = 0.98 for the binding of monoclonal 2C2 antibody and the incorporation of [35S]methionine for clones A–C. Lysosomal acid phosphatase was measured as described using p-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate (47.Gieselmann V. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1984; 365: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Other lysosomal enzymes were detected using fluorometric assays as described (48.Köster A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Confluent dishes (35 mm) of MEF or BHK cells were incubated in methionine-free medium for 1 h and then labeled for the indicated times with 1.85 MBq [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in minimum essential medium containing 4% dialyzed fetal calf serum. For the chase the media were supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml methionine. Immunoprecipitation was performed from cells and media as described (49.Waheed A. Gottschalk S. Hille A. Krentler C. Pohlmann R. Hauser H. Geuze H. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2351-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). β-Glucuronidase was immunoprecipitated with antiserum specific for mouse β-glucuronidase that was kindly provided by R. Swank (Roswell Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY). The human MPR 300 was immunoprecipitated with antiserum specific for the human MPR 300 (50.von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Hasilik A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For MPR 46 immunoprecipitation antiserum specific for the human MPR 46 (51.Wenk J. Hille A. von Figura K. Biochem. Int. 1991; 23: 723-732PubMed Google Scholar) was used. All immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Radioactivity incorporated into the polypeptides was quantified by densitometry using Hewlett-Packard Scann Jet 4c/T (Palo Alto, CA) and the program WinCam 2.2 or the phosphoimager (FuJix Bas 1000) and programs macMAS and image reader. For the analysis of the stability of the receptor polypeptides, cells expressing the respective MPRs were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. For wt MPR 300 and chimeras a pulse of 1 or 2 h was followed by a chase of 8 h, and for MPR 46 and chimeras a pulse of 6 h was followed by a chase of 16 h. The chase was in the presence or absence of the protease inhibitors leupeptin and pepstatin, 0.1 mm each. Immunoprecipitation was done as described above. Samples were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis as described (51.Wenk J. Hille A. von Figura K. Biochem. Int. 1991; 23: 723-732PubMed Google Scholar). For cathepsin D 50 μg of total cellular protein were subjected to Western blot analysis, and the blot was probed with antiserum specific for cathepsin D. The blots were probed using an ECL light-based immunodetection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Phosphomannan-Sepharose affinity chromatography was performed as described (24.Wendland M. Hille A. Nagel G. Waheed A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts (mpr− MEF) that were transfected with human ASA (52.Dittmer F. von Figura K. Biochem.

The medium was precipitated with 50% (w/v) ammoniumsulfate, dissolved in Tris-buffered saline and dialyzed overnight against Tris-buffered saline. The [35S]ASA was purified using a column to which an ASA-specific antibody (20B1) had been coupled (53.Sommerlade H.J. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 123-13094Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An aliqout of each fraction was counted for radioactivity, and the ASA activity was measured (54.Porter M.T. Fluharty A.L. Kihara H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 62: 887-891Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fractions containing active ASA were pooled. [35S]Arylsulfatase A was used as a tracer of MPR-dependent endocytosis as described (55.Bresciani R. Peters C. von Figura K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 57-61PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent dishes (35 mm) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with 1 ml of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 20000 cpm of [35S]arylsulfatase A plus 40 milliunits of unlabeled ASA, 10% fetal calf serum in the presence and absence of 5 mmmannose 6-phosphate. The cells were washed five times with ice-cold Hanks' buffer, trypsinized, and centrifuged. The pellet was dissolved in Tris-buffered saline/0.05% Triton X-100 and sonicated. Media and cells were counted for radioactivity, and the [35S]arylsulfatase A was immunoprecipitated (56.Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) from cells for control. Immunofluorescence was performed as described (42.Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM2, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). MPR 300 and MPR 46 are type I transmembrane proteins. For the construction of the receptor chimeras the lumenal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of the two receptors were systematically exchanged yielding a total of six chimeras (Fig. 1). The domains were designated with L (large) or S (small) according to their origin from MPR 300 or MPR 46, respectively. In the three-letter code for the chimeras the first letter designates the lumenal, the second the transmembrane, and the third the cytoplasmic domain. The chimeric receptors were expressed in embryonic mouse fibroblasts that lack endogenous MPR 46 and MPR 300 (mpr− MEF) (23.Pohlmann R. Wendland M. Boeker C. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Stably expressing clones were selected, and the level of the chimeras was quantified by measuring the binding of 125I-labeled antibodies directed against the lumenal domain of MPR 46 (monoclonal antibody 21D3) or of MPR 300 (monoclonal antibody 2C2) to permeabilized cells. The level of the chimeric receptors containing the lumenal domain of MPR 46 (MPR 46 chimeras SSL, SLL, and SLS) was 0.8–2.2-fold that of endogenous MPR 46 in mouse fibroblasts (TableI). For chimeras containing the lumenal domain of MPR 300 (MPR 300 chimeras LLS, LSS, and LSL) the expression level was 1–4-fold that of endogenous MPR 300 (TableII). Clones expressing similar levels of wt MPR 46 (SSS) or wt MPR 300 (LLL) were used for comparison (Tables Iand II).Table IExpression level and surface expression of wt MPR 46 and MPR 46 chimeras in mpr − MEFCell line[126I]21D3 BindingaAll values are corrected for the binding of [125I]21D3 to mpr− MEF and represent the means of 3–4 independent experiments.

Open table in a new tab The fraction of receptors accessible to the antibodies at the cell surface varied between 8 and 19% for wt MPR 46 and MPR 46 chimeras (Table I) and 10 and 22% for MPR 300 and MPR 300 chimeras (Table II). Thus the fraction of receptor present at the cell surface is not or only little affected by the domain composition of the chimeric receptors. Based on indirect immunofluorescence the intracellular distribution of MPR 46, MPR 300, and receptor chimeras was comparable. The bulk of receptors was concentrated in structures surrounding the nucleus. Vesicular structures containing receptors were scattered throughout the cytoplasm with a decreasing frequency toward the periphery of the cells. Morphological signs of an accumulation within the endoplasmic reticulum or within lysosomal structures (as defined by the lysosomal membranes glycoprotein LAMP 1) were not noted in any of the receptor chimeras. After metabolic labeling of cells with [35S]methionine, a membrane fraction was prepared and solubilized with Triton X-100. The detergent extract was passed over a mannose 6-phosphate-substituted affinity matrix. The receptor polypeptides were immunoprecipitated from the fractions of unbound material and material that was eluted from the affinity matrix with 5 mm mannose 6-phosphate. The apparent size of the receptor chimeras differed from that of the wild type receptors according to different sizes of the cytoplasmic domains of MPR 300 (163 amino acids) and MPR 46 (67 amino acids). Exchange of the transmembrane domains did not affect the apparent size. The fraction of bound receptor was similar for wild type MPRs (98%) and chimeric receptors (95–100%), indicating that the folding of the lumenal domain that mediates the binding of mannose 6-phosphate was not affected by the type of the transmembrane and/or the cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 2). For some of the chimeras carrying the lumenal domain of MPR 300, notable differences in the expression level as determined by binding of [125I]2C2 and the amount of [35S]methionine incorporated into the receptor polypeptides during a short term metabolic labeling were noted (not shown). This pointed to differences in the stability of the chimeric and wild type receptors. For the determination of the stability, wild type and chimeric receptors were expressed in BHK cells. This was necessary, because of the unequal ability of the wild type and chimeric receptors to mediate targetting of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes (see below). As a consequence the steady state levels of lysosomal enzymes including that of lysosomal proteinases depends on the receptor construct expressed in the mpr− MEF. Hence the stability of the receptors in mpr− MEF is affected by the transfer of the receptors to lysosomes and by the sorting efficiency of the receptors for lysosomal proteinases. In BHK cells, which sort lysosomal proteinases efficiently because of their endogenous MPR 46 and MPR 300, the stability of the transfected receptors depends less if at all on the sorting function of the transfected receptor. The different cell lines were pulse-labeled for 1 or 6 h with [35S]methionine and then chased for up to 16 h. The [35S]receptor polypeptides were immunoisolated with antibodies recognizing only the recombinant human receptors and quantified after SDS-PAGE. The half-life of MPR 46 in BHK cells was greater than 50 h, and that of MPR 300"
https://openalex.org/W111215395,"T he mammalian heart is an odd-looking organ, with four different-sized muscular chambers (two atria on top and two ventricles beneath) and a spectacular array of curving blood vessels that loop around each other in a contorted plumbing system. In a recent report, Kilner et al. ([1][1]) reveal that blood does not flow in a smooth, continuous stream but rather adopts asymmetric swirling patterns as it moves through the chambers of the heart. These whirlpools of blood may seem to be the antithesis of a well-heeled plumbing system, but the investigators argue that they are in fact beneficial, aiding the heart as its contractions increase during exercise.

The heartbeat has two principal phases: systole (contraction) and diastole (relaxation). In systole, the muscular walls of the ventricles contract, squeezing blood from the left ventricle into the aorta and from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. Meanwhile, the atrial walls relax and blood flows from the pulmonary veins into the left atrium and from the superior and inferior caval veins into the right atrium. In diastole, the walls of the ventricles relax (those of the atria contract), the tricuspid and mitral valves open, and blood flows from the right atrium into the right ventricle and from the left atrium into the left ventricle.

With the help of a noninvasive imaging technique, magnetic resonance phase-velocity mapping, Kilner et al. investigated changes in blood flow during the diastole and systole of successive heartbeats in healthy human volunteers at rest. They found that blood flow was asymmetric and that the streaming patterns that developed during diastole and systole were characteristic for each chamber. For example, as the ventricles contract, blood streaming into the expanding right atrium (RA) from the superior and inferior caval veins (SVC; IVC) does not collide but rather adopts a forward rotating, swirling motion that redirects flow toward the tricuspid valve (TV) (see figure, top left). The ventricles then relax and the blood moves leftward out of its clockwise rotation (away from the viewer) and through the tricuspid valve (top right). As the left ventricle (LV) contracts, blood is ejected into the aorta (bottom left) through the aortic valve (AV); then, as the left ventricle relaxes, blood streams into it from the left atrium through the mitral valve (MV), setting up a whirlpool below the valves' flexible leaflets (bottom right).

![Figure][2] 

But why has the mammalian heart evolved such a sophisticated pattern of blood flow? Earlier work by Kilner's group using echocardiography to look at heart blood flow in exercising volunteers yields a possible answer. As the heart rate speeds up to at least double its normal rate during vigorous exercise, the contractions of the ventricles and atria alternate rapidly. The authors propose that asymmetries in blood flow conserve energy (by minimizing energy-consuming collisions between opposing streams of blood) and help to redirect blood movement, enabling its smooth passage to the next destination. They propose that, with exertion, the whirlpools of ventricular blood are hurtled in a slingshot motion along the sinuous curves of the blood vessels, minimizing disruption to the flow. Indirect evidence that the contorted curves of the vertebrate heart may be associated with dynamic efficiency comes from studying invertebrates such as the snail (not known for its virtuosity on the race track), which has a simple, linear two-chambered heart (with not a curve in sight). The researchers hope to test their hypothesis with a more advanced magnetic resonance system that should provide the rapid imaging necessary to follow the dynamics of heart blood flow in exercising volunteers.
