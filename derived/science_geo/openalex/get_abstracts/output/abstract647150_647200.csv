https://openalex.org/W3004765197,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones have been used by disaster relief organizations in the United States since 2005. However, their place in the disaster response ecosystem-the standardization, utility, ethical, and legal challenges of drone use-remains largely unstudied. This case series describes how UAVs were used by two teams of responders for damage assessment purposes during the 2017 southeastern US Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Data streams ranged from social media, direct observation, participant-observation and semi-directed interviews. Qualitative analysis was performed for thematic content derived from field observation and from post-hoc interviews. Outcomes of the qualitative analysis emphasize the barriers to deploying drones in the disaster context, their tactical implementation, programmatic integration, and ethical and legal challenges. These observations lay the groundwork for both future research on the utilization of drones and the prudent and ethical implementation of programs that employ drones in post-disaster settings."
https://openalex.org/W3005138706,"Proper function of many physiological processes requires a robust circadian clock. Disruptions of the circadian clock can result in metabolic diseases, mood disorders, and accelerated aging. Therefore, identifying small molecules that specifically modulate regulatory core clock proteins may potentially enable better management of these disorders. In this study, we applied a structure-based molecular-docking approach to find small molecules that specifically bind to the core circadian regulator, the transcription factor circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK). We identified 100 candidate molecules by virtual screening of ∼2 million small molecules for those predicted to bind closely to the interface in CLOCK that interacts with its transcriptional co-regulator, Brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1). Using a mammalian two-hybrid system, real-time monitoring of circadian rhythm in U2OS cells, and various biochemical assays, we tested these compounds experimentally and found one, named CLK8, that specifically bound to and interfered with CLOCK activity. We show that CLK8 disrupts the interaction between CLOCK and BMAL1 and interferes with nuclear translocation of CLOCK both in vivo and in vitro. Results from further experiments indicated that CLK8 enhances the amplitude of the cellular circadian rhythm by stabilizing the negative arm of the transcription/translation feedback loop without affecting period length. Our results reveal CLK8 as a tool for further studies of CLOCK's role in circadian rhythm amplitude regulation and as a potential candidate for therapeutic development to manage disorders associated with dampened circadian rhythms.

https://openalex.org/W3004849562,"The main purpose of this study is to propose a research model to explore the key factors affecting consumers' willingness to use online banking. There are two stages in this research. Firstly, the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP) were used to explore the key factors of companies in operation of online banking. Secondly, the structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to explore the key factors of consumers' actual use of online banking. The results showed differences in the factors that companies and consumers adopted. Based on the findings, companies can adjust their business strategies and improve the consumers' willingness of online banking usage. The primary factor valued by both companies and consumers is trust. Hence, in the business of internet banking, the companies must strengthen areas such as liquidity monitoring, information security, and compliance with financial regulations, in order to reduce risks and gain customers' trust."
https://openalex.org/W3005063922,"Understanding the distribution of life’s variety has driven naturalists and scientists for centuries, yet this has been constrained both by the available data and the models needed for their analysis. Here we compiled data for over 67,000 marine and terrestrial species and used artificial neural networks to model species richness with the state and variability of climate, productivity, and multiple other environmental variables. We find terrestrial diversity is better predicted by the available environmental drivers than is marine diversity, and that marine diversity can be predicted with a smaller set of variables. Ecological mechanisms such as geographic isolation and structural complexity appear to explain model residuals and also identify regions and processes that deserve further attention at the global scale. Improving estimates of the relationships between the patterns of global biodiversity, and the environmental mechanisms that support them, should help in efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change and provide guidance for adapting to life in the Anthropocene."
https://openalex.org/W3005296067,"The neonatal period, during which the initial gut microbiota is acquired, is a critical phase. The healthy development of the infant's microbiome can be interrupted by external perturbations, like antibiotics, which are associated with profound effects on the gut microbiome and various disorders later in life. The aim of this study was to investigate the development of intestinal microbiota and the effect of antibiotic exposure during the first three months of life in term infants. Fecal samples were collected from healthy infants and infants who received antibiotics in the first week of life at one week, one month, and three months after birth. Microbial composition was analyzed using IS-pro and compared between antibiotics-treated and untreated infants. In total, 98 infants, divided into four groups based on feeding type and delivery mode, were analyzed. At one week of age, samples clustered into two distinct groups, which were termed ""settler types"", based on their Bacteroidetes abundance. Caesarean-born infants belonged to the low-Bacteroidetes settler type, but vaginally-born infants were divided between the two groups. The antibiotics effect was assessed within a subgroup of 45 infants, vaginally-born and exclusively breastfed, to minimize the effect of other confounders. Antibiotics administration resulted in lower Bacteroidetes diversity and/or a delay in Bacteroidetes colonization, which persisted for three months, and in a differential development of the microbiota. Antibiotics resulted in pronounced effects on the Bacteroidetes composition and dynamics. Finally, we hypothesize that stratification of children's cohorts based on settler types may reveal group effects that might otherwise be masked."
https://openalex.org/W3005243238,"There are limited reports about the impacts of long-term cropping and land-use systems (CLUS) on soil properties and nutrient stocks under smallholder farmers’ conditions in developing countries. The objective of this research was to examine variation in soil properties and OC and TN stocks across the different CLUS in Dura sub-catchment, northern Ethiopia. Surveys and discussions on field history were used to identify nine CLUS, namely, tef (Eragrostis tef (Zucc) Trot)) mono-cropping (TM), maize (Zea mays L.) mono-cropping (MM), cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis)-maize intercropping (IC1), red beet (Beta Vulgaris)-maize intercropping (IC2), cauliflower-tef-maize rotation (R1), onion (Allium cepa L.)-maize-onion rotation (R2), tr eated gully (TG), untreated gully (UTG), and natural forest system (NF). A total of 27 composite soil samples were randomly collected from the CLUS for soil analysis. Data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance and PCA. The lowest and highest bulk density was determined from NF (1.19 Mg m-3) and UTG (1.77 Mg m-3), respectively. Soil pH, EC and CEC varied significantly among the CLUS. The highest CEC (50.3 cmolc kg-1) was reported under TG followed by NF. The highest soil OC stock (175.3 Mg C ha−1) and TN stock (13.6 Mg C ha−1) were found from NF. The PCA chosen soil properties explained 87% of the soil quality variability among the CLUS. Such soil properties and nutrient stocks variability among the CLUS suggested that introduction of suitable management practices that sustain the soil system of the CLUS with poor soil properties and nutrient stocks are crucial for the study area conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3004607284,"Young women diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) have poor prognosis due to increased rates of metastasis. In addition, women diagnosed within 10 years of most recent childbirth are approximately three times more likely to develop metastasis than age- and stage-matched nulliparous women. We define these cases as postpartum BC (PPBC) and propose that the unique biology of the postpartum mammary gland drives tumor progression. Our published results revealed roles for SEMA7A in breast tumor cell growth, motility, invasion, and tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis, all of which are also increased in preclinical models of PPBC. However, whether SEMA7A drives progression in PPBC remains largely unexplored. Our results presented herein show that silencing of SEMA7A decreases tumor growth in a model of PPBC, while overexpression is sufficient to increase growth in nulliparous hosts. Further, we show that SEMA7A promotes multiple known drivers of PPBC progression including tumor-associated COX-2 expression and fibroblast-mediated collagen deposition in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, we show for the first time that SEMA7A-expressing cells deposit fibronectin to promote tumor cell survival. Finally, we show that co-expression of SEMA7A/COX-2/FN predicts for poor prognosis in breast cancer patient cohorts. These studies suggest SEMA7A as a key mediator of BC progression, and that targeting SEMA7A may open avenues for novel therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3005067054,"This paper presents a procedure for the patient-specific prediction of epileptic seizures. To this end, a combination of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and smooth basis functions with robust regression is applied to power spectra of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) signals. The resulting time and frequency components capture the dominant information from power spectra, while removing outliers and noise. This makes it possible to detect structure in preictal states, which is used for classification. Linear support vector machines (SVM) with L1 regularization are used to select and weigh the contributions from different number of not equally informative channels among patients. Due to class imbalance in data, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is applied. The resulting method yields a computationally and conceptually simple, interpretable model of EEG signals of preictal and interictal states, which shows a good performance for the task of seizure prediction on two datasets (the EPILEPSIAE and on the public Epilepsyecosystem dataset)."
https://openalex.org/W3005240107,"The Akt (protein kinase B)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is dysregulated in various cancers, controls the assembly of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4E) complex. However, whether aberrant expression of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR) and phosphorylated eIF4E (p-eIF4E) is associated with clinicopathological characteristics in surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been rarely reported. Here, we investigated expression of p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-eIF4E proteins in NSCLC by immunohistochemistry and evaluated their correlation with clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic significance. The results showed that the positive percentage of p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-eIF4E was higher in NSCLC. Additionally, p-mTOR and p-eIF4E was dramatically higher in lung adenocarcinoma (both P<0.05). Most importantly, NSCLC patients with lymph node metastasis had significantly elevated expression of p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-eIF4E (all P<0.05). Positive expression of p-Akt, and any positive expression of p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-eIF4E proteins were positively correlated with clinical stages (both P<0.05). Spearman's rank correlation test revealed that expression of p-Akt was correlated with p-eIF4E and p-mTOR (r = 0.107, P = 0.047; r = 0.287, P<0.001, respectively). Also, p-eIF4E had positive correlation with p-mTOR (r = 0.265, P<0.001). Furthermore, NSCLC patients with increased expression of p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-eIF4E, and any positive expression of above three proteins had lower overall survival rates (all P<0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis further indicated thatp-eIF4E was an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC patients (P = 0.046). Taken together, overexpression of p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-eIF4E proteins is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis of NSCLC patients after surgical resection, and positive expression of p-eIF4E protein may act as an independent unfavorable prognostic biomarker for overall survival of NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3005525702,"Early diagnosis and prevention play a crucial role in the treatment of patients with ARDS. The definition of ARDS requires an arterial blood gas to define the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 ratio). However, many patients with ARDS do not have a blood gas measured, which may result in under-diagnosis of the condition. Using data from MIMIC-III Database, we propose an algorithm based on patient non-invasive physiological parameters to estimate P/F levels to aid in the diagnosis of ARDS disease. The machine learning algorithm was combined with the filter feature selection method to study the correlation of various noninvasive parameters from patients to identify the ARDS disease. Cross-validation techniques are used to verify the performance of algorithms for different feature subsets. XGBoost using the optimal feature subset had the best performance of ARDS identification with the sensitivity of 84.03%, the specificity of 87.75% and the AUC of 0.9128. For the four machine learning algorithms, reducing a certain number of features, AUC can still above 0.8. Compared to Rice Linear Model, this method has the advantages of high reliability and continually monitoring the development of patients with ARDS."
https://openalex.org/W3002552645,"Claws are involved in a number of behaviours including locomotion and prey capture, and as a result animals evolve claw morphologies that enable these functions. Past authors have found geometry of the keratinous sheath of the claw to correlate with mode of life for extant birds and squamates; this relationship has frequently been cited to infer lifestyles for Mesozoic theropods including Archaeopteryx. However, many fossil claws lack keratinous sheaths and thus cannot be analysed using current methods. As the ungual phalanx within the claw is more commonly preserved in the fossil record, geometry of this bone may provide a more useful metric for paleontological analysis. In this study, ungual bones of 108 birds and 5 squamates were imaged using X-ray techniques and a relationship was found between curvatures of the ungual bone within the claw of pedal digit III and four modes of life; ground-dwelling, perching, predatory, and scansorial; using linear discriminant analysis with weighted accuracy equal to 0.79. Our model predicts arboreal lifestyles for Archaeopteryx and Microraptor and a predatory ecology for Confuciusornis. These findings demonstrate the utility of our model in answering questions of palaeoecology, the theropod-bird transition, and the evolution of avian flight. Though the metric exhibits a strong correlation with lifestyle, morphospaces for PD-III curvatures overlap and so this metric should be considered alongside additional evidence."

https://openalex.org/W3004905599,"Globally, cities are growing rapidly in size and density and this has caused profound impacts on urban forest ecosystems. Urbanization requiring deforestation reduces ecosystem services that benefit both city dwellers and biodiversity. Understanding spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation changes associated with urbanization is thus a vital component of future sustainable urban development. We used Landsat time series data for three decades from 1988 to 2018 to characterize changes in vegetation cover and habitat connectivity in the Perth Metropolitan Area, in a rapidly urbanising Australian biodiversity hotspot, as a case study to understand the impacts of urbanization on urban forests. Moreover, as golf courses are a major component in urban areas, we assessed the role of golf courses in maintaining vegetation cover and creating habitat connectivity. To do this we employed (1) land use classification with post-classification change detection, and (2) Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA). Over 17,000 ha of vegetation were cleared and the area of vegetation contributing to biodiversity connectivity was reduced significantly over the three decades. The spatial patterns of vegetation loss and gain were different in each of the three decades (1988-2018) reflecting the implementation of urban planning. Furthermore, MSPA analysis showed that the reduction in vegetation cover led to habitat fragmentation with a significant decrease in the core and bridge classes and an increase in isolated patches in the urban landscape. Golf courses played a useful role in maintaining vegetation cover and contributing to connectivity in a regional biodiversity hotspot. Our findings suggest that for future urban expansion, urban planning needs to more carefully consider the impacts of deforestation on connectivity in the landscape. Moreover, there is a need to take into consideration opportunities for off-reserve conservation in smaller habitat fragments such as in golf courses in sustainable urban management."
https://openalex.org/W3004635674,"While many stakeholders believe worker wages in global supply chains are too low, there is disagreement about what, if anything, can be done to raise wages. Through a two-year quasi-experiment in an operating apparel factory, we assess the effects on productivity and profits of raising worker wages with a re-designed compensation system. We show that, even within current factory margins and constraints, important wage gains (4.2–9.7%) are possible and profitable. Productivity increased 8–10%-points while turnover decreased markedly. Workers were motivated by the potential for increased wages from an accelerating group rate as well as increased engagement and sense of fair compensation. Workers focused their increased effort on reducing quality defects and tardiness, two behaviors which individual workers largely control. Additional productivity-increasing behaviors were constrained by skill, position, and conflicts arising from free riders. Advanced apparel manufacturing demands a more engaged workforce; this research provides early evidence that compensation systems can be a critical tool to meet multiple needs."
https://openalex.org/W3004722810,"Aberrant expression of the transcription factor double homeobox protein 4 (DUX4) can lead to a number of diseases including facio-scapulo-humeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and sarcomas. Inhibition of DUX4 may represent a therapeutic strategy for these diseases. By applying Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment (SELEX), we identified aptamers against DUX4 with specific secondary structural elements conveying high affinity to DUX4 as assessed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence polarization techniques. Sequences analysis of these aptamers revealed the presence of two consensus DUX4 motifs in a reverse complementary fashion forming hairpins interspersed with bulge loops at distinct positions that enlarged the binding surface with the DUX4 protein, as determined by crystal structure analysis. We demonstrate that insertion of specific structural elements into transcription factor binding oligonucleotides can enhance specificity and affinity."
https://openalex.org/W3005200226,"Dietary fibre (DF) has multiple health benefits and wheat grains are major sources of DF for human health. However, DF is depleted in white wheat flour which is more widely consumed than wholegrain. The major DF component in white flour is the cell wall polysaccharide arabinoxylan (AX). We have identified the Chinese wheat cultivar Yumai 34 as having unusually high contents of AX in both water-soluble and insoluble forms. We have therefore used populations generated from crosses between Yumai 34 and four other wheat cultivars, three with average contents of AX (Ukrainka, Altigo and Claire) and one also having unusually high AX (Valoris), in order to map QTLs for soluble AX (determined as relative viscosity of aqueous extracts of wholemeal flours) and total AX (determined by enzyme fingerprinting of white flour). A number of QTL were mapped, but most were only detected in one or two crosses. However, all four crosses showed strong QTLs for high RV/total AX on chromosome 1B, with Yumai 34 being the increasing parent, and a KASP marker for the Yumai 34 high AX allele was validated by analysis of high AX lines derived from Yumai 34 but selected by biochemical analysis. A QTL for RV was also mapped on chromosome 6B in Yumai 34 x Valoris, with Valoris being the increasing allele, which is consistent with the observation of transgressive segregation for this population. Association studies in an independent germplasm panel identified marker trait associations for relative viscosity in these same locations while direct selection for fibre content in breeding resulted in high levels of enrichment for the Yumai 34 1B allele. The data therefore indicate that marker-assisted breeding can be used to develop wheat with high AX fibre in white flour."
https://openalex.org/W3004743955,"Promoting brown adipose tissue (BAT) function or browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) provides a defense against obesity. The aim of the study was to investigate whether maternal polar lipids-enriched milk fat globule membrane (MFGM-PL) supplementation to high-fat diet (HFD) rats during pregnancy and lactation could promote brown/beige adipogenesis and protect against HFD-induced adiposity in offspring. Female SD rats were fed a HFD for 8 weeks to induce obesity and, then, fed a HFD during pregnancy and lactation with or without MFGM-PL. Male offspring were weaned at postnatal Day 21 and then fed a HFD for 9 weeks. MFGM-PL treatment to HFD dams decreased the body weight gain and WAT mass as well as lowered the serum levels of insulin and triglycerides in male offspring at weaning. MFGM-PL+HFD offspring showed promoted thermogenic function in BAT and inguinal WAT through the upregulation of UCP1 and other thermogenic genes. In adulthood, maternal MFGM-PL supplementation reduced adiposity and increased oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio, and heat production in male offspring. The enhancement of energy expenditure was correlated with elevated BAT activity and inguinal WAT thermogenic program. In conclusion, maternal MFGM-PL treatment activated thermogenesis in offspring, which exerted long-term beneficial effects against HFD-induced obesity in later life."
https://openalex.org/W3004862892,"Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Repressor activator protein 1 (Rap1), an established telomere-associated protein, is a novel modulator of hypoxia-induced apoptosis. This study aimed to explore the potential direct role of Rap1 in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/RI) and to determine the underlying molecular mechanism. In a mouse model of myocardial I/RI (30-min of left descending coronary artery ligation followed by 2-h reperfusion), Rap1 deficiency significantly reduced myocardial infarct size (IS) and improved cardiac systolic/diastolic function. This was associated with a reduction in apoptosis in the post-ischemic myocardium. In H9C2 and primary cardiomyocytes, Rap1 knockdown or knockout significantly suppressed hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cell injury and apoptosis through increasing the phosphorylation/activation of STAT3 at site Ser727 and translocation of STAT3 to the nucleus. We surmise this since Stattic (selective STAT3 inhibitor) pretreatment canceled the abovementioned protective effect. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed a direct interaction between Rap1 and STAT3, but not JAK2, suggesting that the association of Rap1 with STAT3 may contribute to the reduced activity of STAT3 (Ser727 ) upon H/R stimulation. In conclusion, Rap1 deficiency protects the heart from ischemic damage through STAT3-dependent reduction of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which may yield viable target for pharmacological intervention in ischemic heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W3005330554,"Standard treatment for locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma (LARC) includes a combination of chemotherapy with pyrimidine analogues, such as capecitabine, and radiation therapy, followed by surgery. Currently no clinically useful genomic predictors of benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) exist for LARC. In this study we assessed the expression of 8,127 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), poorly studied in LARC, to infer their ability in classifying patients' pathological complete response (pCR). We collected and analyzed, using lncRNA-specific Agilent microarrays a consecutive series of 61 LARC cases undergoing nCRT. Potential lncRNA predictors in responders and non-responders to nCRT were identified with LASSO regression, and a model was optimized using k-fold cross-validation after selection of the three most informative lncRNA. 11 lncRNAs were differentially expressed with false discovery rate < 0.01 between responders and non-responders to NACT. We identified lnc-KLF7-1, lnc-MAB21L2-1, and LINC00324 as the most promising variable subset for classification building. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 0.91 and 0.94 respectively, with an AUC of our ROC curve = 0.93. Our study shows for the first time that lncRNAs can accurately predict response in LARC undergoing nCRT. Our three-lncRNA based signature must be independently validated and further analyses must be conducted to fully understand the biological role of the identified signature, but our results suggest lncRNAs may be an ideal biomarker for response prediction in the studied setting."
https://openalex.org/W3005341023,"Chromatin organization is essential for appropriate interpretation of the genetic information. Here, we demonstrated that the chromatin-associated proteins HP1 are dispensable for hepatocytes survival but are essential within hepatocytes to prevent liver tumor development in mice with HP1β being pivotal in these functions. Yet, we found that the loss of HP1 per se is not sufficient to induce cell transformation but renders cells more resistant to specific stress such as the expression of oncogenes and thus in fine, more prone to cell transformation. Molecular characterization of HP1-Triple KO premalignant livers and BMEL cells revealed that HP1 are essential for the maintenance of heterochromatin organization and for the regulation of specific genes with most of them having well characterized functions in liver functions and homeostasis. We further showed that some specific retrotransposons get reactivated upon loss of HP1, correlating with overexpression of genes in their neighborhood. Interestingly, we found that, although HP1-dependent genes are characterized by enrichment H3K9me3, this mark does not require HP1 for its maintenance and is not sufficient to maintain gene repression in absence of HP1. Finally, we demonstrated that the loss of TRIM28 association with HP1 recapitulated several phenotypes induced by the loss of HP1 including the reactivation of some retrotransposons and the increased incidence of liver cancer development. Altogether, our findings indicate that HP1 proteins act as guardians of liver homeostasis to prevent tumor development by modulating multiple chromatin-associated events within both the heterochromatic and euchromatic compartments, partly through regulation of the corepressor TRIM28 activity."

In this study, we evaluate machine learning methods for conducting syndromic surveillance using free-text veterinary necropsy reports. We train a system to detect if a necropsy report from the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory contains evidence of gastrointestinal, respiratory, or urinary pathology. We evaluate the performance of several machine learning algorithms including deep learning with a long short-term memory network. Although no single algorithm was superior, random forest using feature vectors of TF-IDF statistics ranked among the top-performing models with F1 scores of 0.923 (gastrointestinal), 0.960 (respiratory), and 0.888 (urinary). This model was applied to over 33,000 necropsy reports and was used to describe temporal and spatial features of diseases within a 14-year period, exposing epidemiological trends and detecting a potential focus of gastrointestinal disease from a single submitting producer in the fall of 2016."
https://openalex.org/W3004647923,"The striatum is involved in the completion and optimization of sensorimotor tasks. In rodents, its dorsolateral part receives converging glutamatergic corticostriatal (CS) inputs from whisker-related primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortical areas, which are interconnected at the cortical level. Although it has been demonstrated that the medium-spiny neurons (MSNs) from the dorsolateral striatum process sensory information from the whiskers via the S1 CS pathway, the functional impact of the corresponding M1 CS inputs onto the same striatal neurons remained unknown. Here, by combining in vivo S1 electrocorticogram with intracellular recordings from somatosensory MSNs in the rat, we first confirmed the heterogeneity of striatal responsiveness to whisker stimuli, encompassing MSNs responding exclusively by subthreshold synaptic depolarizations, MSNs exhibiting sub- and suprathreshold responses over successive stimulations, and non-responding cells. All recorded MSNs also exhibited clear-cut monosynaptic depolarizing potentials in response to electrical stimulations of the corresponding ipsilateral M1 cortex, which were efficient to fire striatal cells. Since M1-evoked responses in MSNs could result from the intra-cortical recruitment of S1 CS neurons, we performed intracellular recordings of S1 pyramidal neurons and compared their firing latency following M1 stimuli to the latency of striatal synaptic responses. We found that the onset of M1-evoked synaptic responses in MSNs significantly preceded the firing of S1 neurons, demonstrating a direct synaptic excitation of MSNs by M1. However, the firing of MSNs seemed to require the combined excitatory effects of S1 and M1 CS inputs. This study directly demonstrates that the same somatosensory MSNs can process excitatory synaptic inputs from two functionally-related sensory and motor cortical regions converging into the same striatal sector. The effectiveness of these convergent cortical inputs in eliciting action potentials in MSNs may represent a key mechanism of striatum-related sensorimotor behaviors."

T cells were characterized prior to transplantation by flow cytometry as naive (CD45RO-CCR7+), central-memory (CD45RO+CCR7+), effector-memory (CD45RO-CCR7-) or terminally differentiated CD8+ Temra (CD45RO-/CCR7-/CD28-) cells. T cell telomere length and thymic output were assessed prior to transplantation in 202 recipients. Follow-up was until December 2018. The date of the first time of biopsy-proven late rejection (>6 months after transplantation) was used to calculate the rejection-free survival time.Fifty cases of biopsy-proven rejection were recorded. Thymic output and T cell telomere length did not associate with late rejection-free survival. However, the percentage and absolute numbers of CD8+Temra and CD28null CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in patients with late rejection. Specifically, in the highest tertile of percentages of CD28null CD8+ T cells, the cumulative incidence of late rejection at 5 and 10 years was only 5% and 8% compared to 16% and 20% in the middle to lowest tertile (p = 0.002). Multivariate proportional hazard analysis showed that percentage and absolute number of CD28null CD8+ T cells remained significantly associated with late rejection and rejection-related graft loss.High numbers of differentiated CD28null CD8+ T cells decrease the risk for late rejection and rejection-related graft loss after kidney transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W3005352636,"Aims Fetuses affected by congenital heart defects (CHD) are considered to be at increased risk of fetal growth restriction and intrauterine demise. Whether these risks are a direct consequence of fetal CHD or a result of associated uteroplacental dysfunction is not evident from the data of recent studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of uteroplacental dysfunction reflected by abnormal uterine artery Doppler indices and reduced fetal growth in CHD pregnancies. Methods This is a retrospective case-control study including singleton pregnancies referred for detailed fetal cardiac assessment subsequently diagnosed with or without CHD. Mid-trimester uterine artery Doppler assessment at 20–24 weeks as well as third trimester fetal biometry and arterial Doppler pulsatility indices (PI) were performed. All fetal biometry were converted into centiles and Doppler values to multiples of median (MoM) to adjust for physiological changes with gestation. Results The study included 811 pregnancies including 153 cases where the fetus was diagnosed with CHD. Mid-pregnancy uterine artery PI was significantly higher in women with fetal CHD compared to controls (0.90MoM vs 0.83MoM; p = 0.006). In the third trimester, median centiles for fetal head circumference (45.4 vs 57.07; p<0.001), abdominal circumference (51.17 vs 55.71; p = 0.014), estimated fetal weight (33.6 vs 56.7; p<0.001) and cerebroplacental ratio (CPR: 0.84MoM vs 0.95MoM; p<0.001) were significantly lower in fetuses with CHD compared to controls. The percentage of small for gestational age births <10th centile (24.0% vs 10.7%; <0.001) and low CPR <0.6MoM (11.7% vs 2.5%; p<0.001) were significantly higher in the fetal CHD cohort. Conclusions Mid-pregnancy uterine artery resistance is increased and subsequent fetal biometry reduced in pregnancies with CHD fetuses. These findings suggest that fetal CHD are associated with uteroplacental dysfunction, secondary to impaired maternal uteroplacental perfusion resulting in relative fetal hypoxaemia and reduced fetal growth."
https://openalex.org/W3004678294,"The Kimberley region of Western Australia is one of the largest and most diverse rock art provenances in the world, with a complex stylistic sequence spanning at least 16 ka, culminating in the modern art-making of the Wunumbal people. The Gunu Site Complex, in the remote Mitchell River region of the northwest Kimberley, is one of many local expressions of the Kimberley rock art sequence. Here we report excavations at two sites in this complex: Gunu Rock, a sand sheet adjacent to rock art panels; and Gunu Cave, a floor deposit within an extensive rockshelter. Excavations at Gunu Rock provide evidence for two phases of occupation, the first from 7-8 to 2.7 ka, and the second from 1064 cal BP. Excavations at Gunu Rock provide evidence for occupation from the end of the second phase to the recent past. Stone for tools in the early phase were procured from a variety of sources, but quartz crystal reduction dominated the second occupation phase. Small quartz crystals were reduced by freehand percussion to provide small flake tools and blanks for manufacturing small points called nguni by the Wunambal people today. Quartz crystals were prominent in historic ritual practices associated with the Wanjina belief system. Complex methods of making bifacially-thinned and pressure flaked quartzite projectile points emerged after 2.7 ka. Ochre pigments were common in both occupation phases, but evidence for occupation contemporaneous with the putative age of the oldest rock art styles was not discovered in the excavations. Our results show that developing a complete understanding of rock art production and local occupation patterns requires paired excavations inside and outside of the rockshelters that dominate the Kimberley."

The integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) strategy seeks to improve essential health by means of nonmedical community health workers (CHWs) who treat the deadliest infectious diseases in remote rural areas where there is no nearby health center. The objective of this study was to assess whether SAM treatment delivered by CHWs close to families’ locations may improve the early identification of cases compared to outpatient treatment at health facilities (HFs), with a decreased number complicated cases referred to stabilization centers, increased anthropometric measurements at admission (closer to the admission threshold) and similarity in clinical outcomes (cure, death, and default). The study included 930 children aged 6 to 59 months suffering from SAM in the Kita district of the Kayes Region in Mali; 552 children were treated by trained CHWs. Anthropometric measurements, the presence of edema, and other medical signs were recorded at admission, and the length of stay and clinical outcomes were recorded at discharge. The results showed fewer children with edema at admission in the CHW group than in the HF group (0.4% vs. 3.7%; OR = 10.585 [2.222–50.416], p = 0.003). Anthropometric measurements at admission were higher in the CHW group, with fewer children falling into the lowest quartiles of both weight-for-height z-scores (20.2% vs. 31.5%; p = 0.002) and mid-upper arm circumference (18.0% vs. 32.4%; p<0.001), than in the HF group. There was no difference in the length of stay. More children in the CHW group were cured (95.9% vs. 88.7%; RR = 3.311 [1.772–6.185]; p<0.001), and there were fewer defaulters (3.7% vs. 9.8%; RR = 3.345 [1.702–6.577]; p<0.001) than in the HF group. Regression analyses demonstrated that less severe anthropometric measurements at admission resulted in an increased probability of cure at discharge. The study results also showed that CHWs provided more integrated care, as they diagnosed and treated significantly more cases of infectious diseases than HFs (diarrhea: 36.0% vs. 18.3%, p<0.001; malaria: 41.7% vs. 19.8%, p<0.001; acute respiratory infection: 34.8% vs. 25.2%, p = 0.007). The addition of SAM treatment in the curative tasks that the CHWs provided to the families resulted in earlier admission and more integrated care for children than those associated with HFs. CHW treatment also achieved better discharge outcomes than standard community treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3004993569,"Anopheles darlingi is the main vector of malaria in Brazil, characterized by a high level of anthropophilia and endophagy. Imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and acetamiprid are the most widespread insecticides of the neonicotinoid group. However, they produce adverse effects on the non-target insects. Flupyradifurone has been marketed as an alternative to non-fluorinated neonicotinoids. Neonicotinoids containing trifluoroacethyl substituent reveal increased insecticidal activity due to higher hydrophobicity and metabolic stability. We synthesized novel neonicotinoid insecticides containing fluorinated acceptor groups and their interactions were estimated with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) binding site by molecular docking studies, to evaluate their larvicidal activity against A. darlingi, and to assess their outdoor photodegradation behavior. New neonicotinoid analogues were prepared and characterized by NMR and mass-spectrometry. The synthesized molecules were modelled by time-dependent density functional theory and analyzed, their interaction with nAChR was investigated by molecular docking. Their insecticide activity was tested on Anopheles larvae collected in suburban area of Manaus, Brazil. Four new fluorinated neonicotinoid analogs were prepared and tested against 3rd instars larvae of A. darlingi showing high larvicidal activity. Docking studies reveal binding modes of the synthesized compounds and suggest that their insecticidal potency is governed by specific interactions with the receptor binding site and enhanced lipophilicity. 2-Chloro-5-(2-trifluoromethyl-pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)pyridine 5 showed fast degradation in water maintaining high larvicidal activity. All obtained substances possessed high larvicidal activity in low concentrations in 48 hours of exposure, compared to commercial flupyradifurone. Such activity is connected to a unique binding pattern of the synthesized compounds to insect’s nAChR and to their enhanced bioavailability owing to introduction of fluorinated amino-moieties. Therefore, the compounds in question have a high potential for application as control agents for insects transmitting tropical diseases, and they will be less persistent in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W3005288489,"American politics is becoming increasingly polarized, which biases decision-making and reduces open-minded debate. In two experiments, we demonstrate that despite this polarization, a simple manipulation can make people express and endorse less polarized views about competing political candidates. In Study 1, we approached 136 participants at the first 2016 presidential debate and on the streets of New York City. Participants completed a survey evaluating Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on various personality traits; 72% gave responses favoring a single candidate. We then covertly manipulated their surveys so that the majority of their responses became moderate instead. Participants only noticed and corrected a few of these manipulations. When asked to explain their responses, 94% accepted the manipulated responses as their own and rationalized this neutral position accordingly, even though they reported more polarized views moments earlier. In Study 2, we replicated the experiment online with a more politically diverse sample of 498 participants. Both Clinton and Trump supporters showed nearly identical rates of acceptance and rationalization of their manipulated-to-neutral positions. These studies demonstrate how false feedback can powerfully shape the expression of political views. More generally, our findings reveal the potential for open-minded discussion even in a fundamentally divided political climate."
https://openalex.org/W3005313619,"Posturography provides quantitative, objective measurements of human balance and postural control for research and clinical use. However, it usually requires access to specialist equipment to measure ground reaction forces, which are not widely available in practice, due to their size or cost. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to posturography. It uses the skeletal output of an inexpensive Kinect depth camera to localise the Centre of Mass (CoM) of an upright individual. We demonstrate a pipeline which is able to measure postural sway directly from CoM trajectories, obtained from tracking the relative position of three key joints. In addition, we present the results of a pilot study that compares this method of measuring postural sway to the output of a NeuroCom SMART Balance Master. 15 healthy individuals (age: 42.3 ± 20.4 yrs, height: 172 ± 11 cm, weight: 75.1 ± 14.2 kg, male = 11), completed 25 Sensory Organisation Test (SOT) on a NeuroCom SMART Balance Master. Simultaneously, the sessions were recorded using custom software developed for this study (CoM path recorder). Postural sway was calculated from the output of both methods and the level of agreement determined, using Bland-Altman plots. Good agreement was found for eyes open tasks with a firm support, the agreement decreased as the SOT tasks became more challenging. The reasons for this discrepancy may lie in the different approaches that each method takes to calculate CoM. This discrepancy warrants further study with a larger cohort, including fall-prone individuals, cross-referenced with a marker-based system. However, this pilot study lays the foundation for the development of a portable device, which could be used to assess postural control, more cost-effectively than existing equipment."
https://openalex.org/W3005056599,"The study of cell aggregation in vitro has a tremendous importance these days. In cancer biology, aggregates and spheroids serve as model systems and are considered as pseudo-tumors that are more realistic than 2D cell cultures. Recently, in the context of brain tumors (gliomas), we developed a new poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogel, with adhesive properties that can be controlled by the addition of poly(L-lysine) (PLL), and a stiffness close to the brain’s. This substrate allows the motion of individual cells and the formation of cell aggregates (within one day), and we showed that on a non-adhesive substrate (PEG without PLL is inert for cells), the aggregates are bigger and less numerous than on an adhesive substrate (with PLL). In this article, we present new experimental results on the follow-up of the formation of aggregates on our hydrogels, from the early stages (individual cells) to the late stages (aggregate compaction), in order to compare, for two cell lines (F98 and U87), the aggregation process on the adhesive and non-adhesive substrates. We first show that a spaceless model of perikinetic aggregation can reproduce the experimental evolution of the number of aggregates, but not of the mean area of the aggregates. We thus develop a minimal off-lattice agent-based model, with a few simple rules reproducing the main processes that are at stack during aggregation. Our spatial model can reproduce very well the experimental temporal evolution of both the number of aggregates and their mean area, on adhesive and non-adhesive soft gels and for the two different cell lines. From the fit of the experimental data, we were able to infer the quantitative values of the speed of motion of each cell line, its rate of proliferation in aggregates and its ability to organize in 3D. We also found qualitative differences between the two cell lines regarding the ability of aggregates to compact. These parameters could be inferred for any cell line, and correlated with clinical properties such as aggressiveness and invasiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3005438711,"Introduction The relationships between family history, sex, age at onset, and migraine occurrence have been documented. However, the associations between these factors across different sexes and subgroups of patients have yet to be elucidated. This study evaluated the association between family history and migraine in male and female patients experiencing episodic and chronic migraine with and without aura. Methods This cross-sectional, case–control study included 299 headache-free controls and 885 patients receiving outpatient treatment for migraine. Participants were classified into episodic (1–14 days/month) and chronic (≥15 days/month) migraine groups. Results Positive family history was significantly more frequently observed in the episodic group than in the chronic group (49.5% vs. 26%; P < 0.001) in male patients, particularly in male patients without aura (50.3% vs. 21.9%; P = 0.003); it was less frequently observed (58.7% vs. 73.7%; P = 0.048) in female patients with aura. Family history was correlated with an earlier age at onset (20.7 years vs. 22.8 years; P = 0.002), particularly in patients without aura (21 years vs. 23.7 years; P = 0.002), who were women (20.9 years vs. 23.9 years; P = 0.002). Conclusions Different patterns of association between family history and migraine can be observed between men and women. A positive family history of migraine is correlated with an earlier age at onset, particularly among female patients without aura."
https://openalex.org/W3004895417,"During our studies on asexual fungi colonizing herbaceous litter in northern Thailand, we discovered two new fungal species, viz. Dendryphion hydei and Torula hydei spp. nov. The latter are examined, and their morphological characters are described as well as their DNA sequences from ribosomal and protein coding genes are analysed to infer their phylogenetic relationships with extant fungi. Torula hydei is different from other similar Torula species in having tiny and catenate conidia. Dendryphion hydei can be distinguished from other similar Dendryphion species in having large conidiophores and subhyaline to pale olivaceous brown, 2–4(–5)-septate conidia. Multigene phylogenetic analyses of a combined LSU, SSU, TEF1-α, RPB2 and ITS DNA sequence dataset generated from maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses indicate that T. hydei forms a distinct lineage and basal to T. fici. Dendryphion hydei forms a distinct lineage and basal to D. europaeum, D. comosum, D. aquaticum and D. fluminicola within Torulaceae (Pleosporales, Dothideomycetes)."
https://openalex.org/W3005027802,"Human presence on the Yucatán Peninsula reaches back to the Late Pleistocene. Osteological evidence comes from submerged caves and sinkholes (cenotes) near Tulum in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. Here we report on a new skeleton discovered by us in the Chan Hol underwater cave, dating to a minimum age of 9.9±0.1 ky BP based on 230Th/U-dating of flowstone overlying and encrusting human phalanges. This is the third Paleoindian human skeleton with mesocephalic cranial characteristics documented by us in the cave, of which a male individual named Chan Hol 2 described recently is one of the oldest human skeletons found on the American continent. The new discovery emphasizes the importance of the Chan Hol cave and other systems in the Tulum area for understanding the early peopling of the Americas. The new individual, here named Chan Hol 3, is a woman of about 30 years of age with three cranial traumas. There is also evidence for a possible trepanomal bacterial disease that caused severe alteration of the posterior parietal and occipital bones of the cranium. This is the first time that the presence of such disease is reported in a Paleoindian skeleton in the Americas. All ten early skeletons found so far in the submerged caves from the Yucatán Peninsula have mesocephalic cranial morphology, different to the dolicocephalic morphology for Paleoindians from Central Mexico with equivalent dates. This supports the presence of two morphologically different Paleoindian populations for Mexico, coexisting in different geographical areas during the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene."
https://openalex.org/W3005112379,"Wood and wood products can harbor microorganisms that can raise phytosanitary concerns in countries importing or exporting these products. To evaluate the efficacy of wood treatment on the survival of microorganisms of phytosanitary concern the method of choice is to grow microbes in petri dishes for subsequent identification. However, some plant pathogens are difficult or impossible to grow in axenic cultures. A molecular methodology capable of detecting living fungi and fungus-like organisms in situ can provide a solution. RNA represents the transcription of genes and can become rapidly unstable after cell death, providing a proxy measure of viability. We designed and used RNA-based molecular diagnostic assays targeting genes essential to vital processes and assessed their presence in wood colonized by fungi and oomycetes through reverse transcription and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A stability analysis was conducted by comparing the ratio of mRNA to gDNA over time following heat treatment of mycelial cultures of the Oomycete Phytophthora ramorum and the fungus Grosmannia clavigera. The real-time PCR results indicated that the DNA remained stable over a period of 10 days post treatment in heat-treated samples, whereas mRNA could not be detected after 24 hours for P. ramorum or 96 hours for G. clavigera. Therefore, this method provides a reliable way to evaluate the viability of these pathogens and offers a potential way to assess the effectiveness of existing and emerging wood treatments. This can have important phytosanitary impacts on assessing both timber and non-timber forest products of commercial value in international wood trade."
https://openalex.org/W3004447045,"Urbanisation brings with it rapid socio-economic change with volatile livelihoods and unstable ownership of assets. Yet, current measures of wealth are based predominantly on static livelihoods found in rural areas. We sought to assess the extent to which seven common measures of wealth appropriately capture vulnerability to poverty in urban areas. We then sought to develop a measure that captures the characteristics of one urban area in Nepal. We collected and analysed data from 1,180 households collected during a survey conducted between November 2017 and January 2018 and designed to be representative of the Kathmandu valley. A separate survey of a sub set of households was conducted using participatory qualitative methods in slum and non-slum neighbourhoods. A series of currently used indices of deprivation were calculated from questionnaire data. We used bivariate statistical methods to examine the association between each index and identify characteristics of poor and non-poor. Qualitative data was used to identify characteristics of poverty from the perspective of urban poor communities which were used to construct an Urban Poverty Index that combined asset and consumption focused context specific measures of poverty that could be proxied by easily measured indicators as assessed through multivariate modelling. We found a strong but not perfect association between each measure of poverty. There was disagreement when comparing the consumption and deprivation index on the classification of 19% of the sample. Choice of short-term monetary and longer-term capital approaches accounted for much of the difference. Those who reported migrating due to economic necessity were most likely to be categorised as poor. A combined index was developed to capture these dimension of poverty and understand urban vulnerability. A second version of the index was constructed that can be computed using a smaller range of variables to identify those in poverty. Current measures may hide important aspects of urban poverty. Those who migrate out of economic necessity are particularly vulnerable. A composite index of socioeconomic status helps to capture the complex nature of economic vulnerability."

There is, however, a major drawback of flax as a source of functional food since the seeds contain significant level of cyanogenic glucosides. The final step of cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis is mediated by UDP-glucose dependent glucosyltransferase. To date, no flax cyanogenic glucosyl transferase genes have been reported with verified biochemical functionality. Here we present a study on the identification and enzymatic characterization of a first flax cyanogenic glucosyltransferase, LuCGT1. We show that LuCGT1 was highly active towards both aliphatic and aromatic substrates. The LuCGT1 gene is expressed in leaf tissues as well as in developing seeds, and its expression level was drastically reduced in flax mutant lines low in cyanogenic glucosides. Identification of LuCGT1 provides a molecular handle for developing gene specific markers for targeted breeding of low cyanogenic glucosides in flax."
https://openalex.org/W3005129891,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject cytotoxic effector proteins into host cells. The promiscuous nucleotidyl cyclase, exoenzyme Y (ExoY), is one of the most common effectors found in clinical P. aeruginosa isolates. Recent studies have revealed that the nucleotidyl cyclase activity of ExoY is stimulated by actin filaments (F-actin) and that ExoY alters actin cytoskeleton dynamics in vitro, via an unknown mechanism. The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in numerous key biological processes and is targeted by many pathogens to gain competitive advantages. We utilized total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, bulk actin assays, and EM to investigate how ExoY impacts actin dynamics. We found that ExoY can directly bundle actin filaments with high affinity, comparable with eukaryotic F-actin–bundling proteins, such as fimbrin. Of note, ExoY enzymatic activity was not required for F-actin bundling. Bundling is known to require multiple actin-binding sites, yet small-angle X-ray scattering experiments revealed that ExoY is a monomer in solution, and previous data suggested that ExoY possesses only one actin-binding site. We therefore hypothesized that ExoY oligomerizes in response to F-actin binding and have used the ExoY structure to construct a dimer-based structural model for the ExoY–F-actin complex. Subsequent mutational analyses suggested that the ExoY oligomerization interface plays a crucial role in mediating F-actin bundling. Our results indicate that ExoY represents a new class of actin-binding proteins that modulate the actin cytoskeleton both directly, via F-actin bundling, and indirectly, via actin-activated nucleotidyl cyclase activity.

In addition to its regulation by Rho GTPases, some proteins that influence actin cytoskeletal dynamics are controlled by the second messenger cAMP, which exerts its regulatory effect upon actin via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC) pathways (17Howe A.K. Regulation of actin-based cell migration by cAMP/PKA.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692 (15246685): 159-17410.1016/j.bbamcr.2004.03.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 18Schmidt M.

Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Cyclic Amp signaling and gene regulation.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18 (9706229): 353-38310.1146/annurev.nutr.18.1.353Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Other cyclic nucleotides, including cUMP, cGMP, and cCMP, are also utilized as signaling molecules, yet cAMP appears to be the dominant signaling molecule (20Beavo J.A. Brunton L.L.

As a result, many bacteria have evolved virulence factors that use adenylyl cyclase activity to interfere with host cytoskeleton regulatory processes to the benefit of the pathogen, such as Bordetella pertussis (CyaA), Bacillus anthracis (edema factor (EF)), and P. aeruginosa (ExoY) (21Guo Q.

Among these nucleotidyl cyclase toxins, ExoY is uniquely capable of influencing actin dynamics both directly, by binding to F-actin, and indirectly, via cyclase activity. Although it has been shown that ExoY mediates cytoskeletal dysfunction in vivo, the exact cellular consequences vary by cell type, including generalized cytoskeletal breakdown, cell rounding, and membrane blebbing (7Yahr T.L. Vallis A.J. Hancock M.K. Barbieri J.T. Frank D.W. ExoY, an adenylate cyclase secreted by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The enzymatic activity of ExoY has long been considered the primary mediator of these phenotypes. As a result, most studies of ExoY have focused on understanding the role of its enzymatic activity during infection. Recently, these efforts have culminated in the discovery that the enzymatic activity of ExoY is stimulated by binding to F-actin, but not G-actin (6Belyy A. Raoux-Barbot D. Saveanu C. Namane A. Ogryzko V. Worpenberg L. David V. Henriot V. Fellous S. Merrifield C. Assayag E. Ladant D. Renault L. Mechold U. Actin activates Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoY nucleotidyl cyclase toxin and ExoY-like effector domains from MARTX toxins.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27917880): 1358210.1038/ncomms13582Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ExoY can alter actin dynamics in vitro. However, the mechanisms explaining how ExoY affects actin dynamics and how F-actin activates ExoY remain elusive. ExoY bears no significant sequence or structural homology to any characterized ABP (27Khanppnavar B. Datta S. Crystal structure and substrate specificity of ExoY, a unique T3SS mediated secreted nucleotidyl cyclase toxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gen. Subj. 2018; 1862 (29859257): 2090-210310.1016/j.bbagen.2018.05.021Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, ExoY represents a new class of ABP. In this study, we utilized total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFm) and bulk actin assays to characterize the fundamental properties of ExoY as an ABP. We have discovered that ExoY is able to directly bundle actin filaments, independent of its enzymatic activity. We hypothesize that this behavior is mediated by ExoY dimerization and present a structural model for F-actin bundling that is supported by biochemical and mutational studies. Actin filaments are complex dynamic macromolecules that result in heterogenic populations. TIRFm has emerged as one of the most informative techniques to investigate F-actin dynamics and organization in vitro (28Zimmermann D. Morganthaler A.N. Kovar D.R. Suarez C. In vitro biochemical characterization of cytokinesis actin-binding proteins.Methods Mol.

Using TIRFm, we assessed the impact of ExoY on the organization of actin filaments under polymerizing conditions that promote the assembly of G-actin into F-actin. The F-actin nucleation and elongation rates were not noticeably altered in the presence of ExoY. However, we observed that ExoY facilitates the association of actin filaments along their length to form bundles of two (Fig. 1A and Movie S1) or more (Movie S2) filaments. An F-actin bundle is defined as a complex formed between two or more actin filaments, tethered lengthwise to each other by an accessory protein, and the bundling activity of ExoY is very similar to traditional cellular F-actin–bundling proteins that we have studied by TIRFm under similar conditions (15Winkelman J.D.

Analysis of TIRFm time-lapse videos allowed for identification of the fast (barbed) and slow (pointed) growing ends of F-actin. Thus, we were able to determine that ExoY-stimulated F-actin bundles are composed of filaments with mixed polarity (Fig. S1 and Movie S3). Mixed-polarity bundles are commonly generated by other cellular F-actin–bundling proteins, such as α-actinin and fimbrin (15Winkelman J.D. Suarez C. Hocky G.M. Harker A.J. Morganthaler A.N.

To further investigate whether ExoY promotes F-actin bundling, we then examined the ultrastructure of ExoY-mediated F-actin bundles using negative-stain EM. As predicted, in the absence of ExoY, only single actin filaments were observed, whereas bundles of F-actin were observed in the presence of ExoY (Fig. 1B). The ExoY-induced bundles were formed as three-dimensional cable-like clusters of actin filaments and appeared highly heterogeneous with great variation in the number of filaments within each bundle, consistent with the TIRFm. ExoY induced the formation of very tight F-actin bundles, to the point that we were unable to reliably measure the interfilament distance from the negatively stained micrographs, but we estimate the distance to be no more than several nanometers. ExoY promotes F-actin bundling in a concentration-dependent manner. Using TIRFm, we found that ExoY effectively stimulated F-actin bundling at concentrations ≥200 nm. At concentrations of 100 and 150 nm, ExoY was able to induce transient bundle formation, where two actin filaments would briefly interact and then separate. Occasionally at these concentrations, two actin filaments would interact to form a stable bundle. No F-actin bundling was observed at ExoY concentrations <100 nm. These results indicate that ExoY is able to stimulate F-actin bundle formation with similar efficiency as eukaryotic F-actin–bundling proteins, such as fascin and α-actinin (15Winkelman J.D. Suarez C. Hocky G.M. Harker A.J. Morganthaler A.N. Christensen J.R. Voth G.A. Bartles J.R. Kovar D.R.

ExoY is known to function as a promiscuous nucleotidyl cyclase, and, to date, this enzymatic activity has been considered its dominant biological activity (7Yahr T.L. Vallis A.J. Hancock M.K. Barbieri J.T. Frank D.W. ExoY, an adenylate cyclase secreted by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95 (9811898): 13899-1390410.1073/pnas.95.23.13899Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 8Beckert U. Wolter S. Hartwig C. Bähre H. Kaever V. Ladant D. Frank D.W. Seifert R. ExoY from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a nucleotidyl cyclase with preference for cGMP and cUMP formation.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Therefore, we sought to determine whether ExoY enzymatic activity was required for the formation of F-actin bundles. Previous work has established that a single point mutation, K81M, renders ExoY catalytically inactive (7Yahr T.L. Vallis A.J. Hancock M.K. Barbieri J.T. Frank D.W. ExoY, an adenylate cyclase secreted by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95 (9811898): 13899-1390410.1073/pnas.95.23.13899Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). We generated this mutation and purified the resulting construct, ExoYK81M. This construct was tested for its ability to stimulate F-actin bundling by TIRFm. ExoYK81M was found to promote the formation of bundles containing two or more actin filaments with similar efficiency compared with WT (Fig. 2A and Movie S1). We then confirmed ExoYK81M-mediated F-actin bundling via negative-stain EM (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the bundles formed in the presence of WT ExoY versus ExoYK81M appeared to display distinctly different morphologies. The bundles formed in the presence of WT ExoY appeared very thick and three-dimensional, similar to a cable, whereas the bundles formed in the presence of ExoYK81M appeared much flatter, and easier to image, somewhat reminiscent of a ribbon. We employed cryo-EM to investigate the apparent physiological differences with higher resolution. The F-actin bundles formed in the presence of WT ExoY appeared as they did in the negative-stain EM: thick cable-like structures with a high degree of heterogeneity (Fig. 2C). In contrast to the bundles formed in the presence of WT ExoY, the F-actin bundles formed in the presence of ExoYK81M fell apart during the grid-making process, and only single actin filaments were observed in the vitreous ice (Fig. 2D). This observation suggests that the visual differences between the F-actin bundles formed in the presence of WT versus inactive ExoY may correlate with distinct physical properties. We hypothesized that ExoY functions as a traditional F-actin–bundling protein, which physically binds multiple actin filaments simultaneously and organizes them into to a bundle. To test this hypothesis, we utilized bulk F-actin sedimentation assays to biochemically characterize ExoY-actin filament binding and bundling. As ExoY and actin have molecular masses of roughly 42 kDa and are indistinguishable via SDS-PAGE, we fused a HaloTag (32Los G.V. Encell L.P. McDougall M.G. Hartzell D.D. Karassina N. Zimprich C. Wood M.G. Learish R. Ohana R.F. Urh M. Simpson D. Mendez J. Zimmerman K. Otto P. Vidugiris G. et al.HaloTag: a novel protein labeling technology for cell imaging and protein analysis.ACS Chem. Biol. 2008; 3 (18533659): 373-38210.1021/cb800025kCrossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) to the N terminus of ExoY, via a flexible linker, to generate a roughly 77-kDa ExoY fusion protein that allowed visual differentiation by SDS-PAGE. Analysis using the TIRFm polymerization assay revealed no difference in the bundling efficiency between WT ExoY and HaloTag-ExoY (data not shown). We then performed a high-speed sedimentation assays to characterize ExoY binding to preformed actin filaments (Fig. 3A). The SDS-PAGE revealed that HaloTagged ExoY readily sedimented with the actin filaments and that the interaction between ExoY and actin is not mediated by covalent interaction, unlike some bacterial toxins that are known to covalently cross-link actin molecules (33Cordero C.L. Kudryashov D.S. Reisler E. Satchell K.J.F. The actin cross-linking domain of the Vibrio cholerae RTX toxin directly catalyzes the covalent cross-linking of actin.J. Biol.

The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) for ExoY binding to F-actin was estimated to be 1.44 μm. The data were fit to the Hill equation, and the resulting Hill coefficient (n = 1.37) suggests a modest degree of cooperativity for ExoY binding to F-actin. We then performed low-speed centrifugation F-actin sedimentation assays to assess the bundling efficiency of ExoY. ExoY appears to efficiently bundle F-actin, as the data from low-speed centrifugation experiments, once again fit to the Hill equation (n = 5.6), revealed an apparent EC50 for bundling of ∼334 nm (Fig. 3B). This value fits well with the earlier observation by TIRFm that F-actin bundling is rare at ExoY concentrations below 200 nm, and no bundling was observed at concentrations below 100 nm. F-actin bundling is known to be a cooperative behavior, and the high Hill coefficient (n = 5.6) is similar to those observed for other cellular bundling proteins, including fascin and α-actinin (15Winkelman J.D. Suarez C. Hocky G.M. Harker A.J. Morganthaler A.N. Christensen J.R. Voth G.A. Bartles J.R. Kovar D.R. Fascin- and α-actinin-bundled networks contain intrinsic structural features that drive protein sorting.Curr.

It must be noted that these calculations are based on the concentration of G-actin, rather than F-actin, which cannot be determined based on the stochastic nature of actin polymerization, meaning the actual Kd for ExoY–F-actin binding is significantly lower, likely in the low to mid nanomolar range. Direct comparison between the binding curves of ExoY and fission yeast fimbrin (30Skau C.T. Kovar D.R. Fimbrin and tropomyosin competition regulates endocytosis and cytokinesis kinetics in fission yeast.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20 (20705466): 1415-142210.1016/j.cub.2010.06.020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) reveals similar affinities, indicating that ExoY possesses a physiologically relevant affinity for F-actin comparable with eukaryotic ABPs. The fact that HaloTagged ExoY readily sediments with F-actin bundles during the low-speed sedimentation assays provided strong evidence that ExoY functions as a traditional bundling protein. However, the possibility remained that this behavior was somehow an artifact caused by the addition of the HaloTag. To confirm that ExoY was present within the F-actin bundles, WT ExoY was labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 (ExoY555), and two-color TIRFm was performed to visualize the association of ExoY with F-actin. We found that ExoY555 decorated along F-actin nearly uniformly and was present within the bundles of F-actin (Fig. 3C and Movie S4). Together, we conclude that ExoY bundles F-actin via direct, physical interactions that do not require its nucleotidyl cyclase activity. There are two general mechanisms for how cellular actin-binding proteins promote F-actin bundling or cross-l"

https://openalex.org/W3005319890,"Introduction We implemented a participatory quality improvement strategy in eight primary health care units of Ethiopia to improve use and quality of maternal and newborn health services. Methods We evaluated the effects of this strategy using mixed-methods research. We used before-and-after (March 2016 and November 2017) cross-sectional surveys of women who had children 0–11 months to compare changes in maternal and newborn health care indicators in the 39 communities that received the intervention and the 148 communities that did not. We used propensity scores to match the intervention with the comparison communities at baseline and difference-in-difference analyses to estimate intervention effects. The qualitative method included 51 in-depth interviews of community volunteers, health extension workers, health center directors and staff, and project specialists. Results The difference-in-difference analyses indicated that 7.9 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8–13.9%) increase in receiving skilled delivery care between baseline and follow-up surveys in the intervention area that is attributable to the strategy. The intervention effect on postnatal care in 48 hours of the mother was 15.3% (95% CI: 7.4–23.2). However, there was no evidence that the strategy affected the seven other maternal and newborn health care indicators considered. Interview participants said that the participatory design and implementation strategy helped them to realize gaps, identify real problems, and design appropriate solutions, and created a sense of ownership and shared responsibility for implementing interventions. Conclusions Community participation in planning and monitoring maternal and newborn health service delivery improves use of some high-impact maternal and newborn health services. The study supports the notion that participatory community strategies should be considered to foster community-responsive health systems."
https://openalex.org/W3005327625,"The Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (YGP) is a typical ecologically fragile region in southwest China. Water-erosion desertification (WED) is one of the most significant environmental and socio-economic issues on the YGP and has seriously restricted the socio-economic development of this region. However, the research on monitoring of the desertification trends in this region has been limited to long time-series Landsat imagery. The objectives of this research were to monitor the WED trends on the YGP using time-series Landsat imagery data from 1989 to 2016. In this paper, we present a multi-indicator rule-based method, which was used to map the WED on the YGP during this period. The results show that the addition of multiple indicators improved the WED classification accuracy to 90.61%. Overall, the following results were obtained by using the proposed method. (1) The slight desertification area on the YGP increased from 89,617.09 km2 in 1989 to 100,976.47 km2 in 2016 with an annual growth ratio (AGR) of 0.48%, the moderate desertification area increased from 80,276.65 km2 in 1989 to 90,768.39 km2 in 2016 with an AGR of 0.50%, and the severe desertification area increased from 8149.3 km2 in 1989 to 13,220.16 km2 in 2016 with an AGR of 2.39%. (2) The WED expansion on the YGP can be divided into three stages. Firstly, the total WED area increased slowly from 17.80×104 km2 in 1989 to 17.98×104 km2 in 2010 with an AGR of 0.05%. Then, the WED rapidly expanded from 17.98×104 km2 in 2010 to 20.28×104 km2 in 2013 with an AGR of 4.26%. Finally, the WED increased slightly from 20.28×104 km2 in 2013 to 20.50×104 km2 in 2016 with an AGR of 0.36%. The total areas of the different degrees of WED decreased in 1992, 1998, 2001, and 2004. (3) The driving factors of WED were analyzed based on the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model. We found that precipitation, vegetation area, and gross domestic product have key roles in the processes of desertification reversion and development. However, the regression coefficients between WED and these factors exhibited considerable spatial variations. The regression coefficients of the key driving factors showed different spatial distributions based on the GWR model in the YGP. The research results can provide scientific reference information for the prevention and control of WED in the YGP."

How neuronal diversity arises from very few cell progenitors is a central question in developmental neurobiology. We use the optic lobe of the fruit fly as a paradigm to understand how neuroblasts, the neural stem cells, generate multiple neuron types. Although the development of the fly brain has been the subject of extensive research, very little is known about the lineage relationships of the cell types forming the adult optic lobes. Here we perform a large-scale lineage bioinformatics analysis using the graph theory. We generated a large collection of cell clones that genetically label the progeny of neuroblasts and built a database to draw graphs showing the lineage relationships between cell types. By establishing biological criteria that measures the strength of the neuronal relationships and applying community detection tools we have identified eight clusters of neurons. Each cluster contains different cell types that we pose are the product of eight distinct classes of neuroblasts. Three of these clusters match the available lineage data, supporting the predictive value of the analysis. Finally, we show that the neuronal progeny of a neuroblast do not have preferential innervation patterns, but instead become part of different layers and neuropils. Here we establish a new methodology that helps understanding the logic of Drosophila brain development and can be applied to the more complex vertebrate brains."
https://openalex.org/W3004838174,"New methods of HIV-1 RNA quantification based on dual-target detection are increasingly used in HIV viral load monitoring, but clinical implications and impact of dual-target detection on HIV-1 infection management are not established. Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx assay is a last generation HIV viral load method, that uses pol and LTR as simultaneous target, providing quantitative results based mainly on pol target, while LTR target is used to report the results when pol signal is absent. In our laboratory, about 6% of results of all HIV-1 viral load tests performed with this platform in one year period resulted from LTR signal. Interestingly, LTR-based viremia (sometimes exceeding 1,000 copies/mL) was observed in a small proportion (up to 1%) of patients under ART, considered for long time virologically suppressed on the basis of a single target (pol-based) assay. Male gender, >700 vs <200 CD4 cell/mL and dual therapy including NRTI plus either NNRTI, or PI/b or INSTI were independently associated with increased risk of LTR-based HIV-1 viral load detection by multivariable logistic regression. A significant linear correlation was observed between LTR-based HIV-1 RNA levels and PBMC-associated proviral DNA. Moreover, in a small group of patients with HIV-1 RNA levels >200 copies/mL, longitudinal assessments showed parallel kinetics between plasma viremia and proviral DNA. Sequencing of pol region for drug resistance assessment in patients with LTR-based viremia failed on plasma HIV-1 RNA, while it was successful on proviral DNA. The detection/quantification of HIV-1 viremia based only on LTR signal with a dual target assay in samples resulting undetectable with the more conventional target pol needs accurate evaluation; unravelling the biological basis of this phenomenon, here described for the first time, is mandatory to establish relevance and implication by both pathogenetic (i.e. infectivity of LTR-detected viruses, reservoir turnover, immune activation, etc.) and clinical standpoint."
https://openalex.org/W3004954229,"A high-voltage generator (HVG) is an essential part of a radio frequency identification electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (RFID-EEPROM). An HVG circuit is used to generate a regulated output voltage that is higher than the power supply voltage. However, the performance of the HVG is affected owing to the high-power dissipation, high-ripple voltage and low-pumping efficiency. Therefore, a regulator circuit consists of a voltage divider, comparator and a voltage reference, which are respectively required to reduce the ripple voltage, increase pumping efficiency and decrease the power dissipation of the HVG. Conversely, a clock driving circuit consists of the current-starved ring oscillator (CSRO), and the non- overlapping clock generator is required to drive the clock signals of the HVG circuit. In this study, the Mentor Graphics EldoSpice software package is used to design and simulate the HVG circuitry. The results showed that the designed CSRO dissipated only 4.9 μW at 10.2 MHz and that the phase noise was only -119.38 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz. Moreover, the proposed charge pump circuit was able to generate a maximum VPP of 13.53 V and it dissipated a power of only 31.01 μW for an input voltage VDD of 1.8 V. After integrating all the HVG modules, the results showed that the regulated HVG circuit was also able to generate a higher VPP of 14.59 V, while the total power dissipated was only 0.12 mW with a chip area of 0.044 mm2. Moreover, the HVG circuit produced a pumping efficiency of 90% and reduced the ripple voltage to <4 mV. Therefore, the integration of all the proposed modules in HVG ensured low-ripple programming voltages, higher pumping efficiency, and EEPROMs with lower power dissipation, and can be extensively used in low-power applications, such as in non-volatile memory, radiofrequency identification transponders, on-chip direct current DC-DC converters."
https://openalex.org/W3005095936,"Background Behçet’s disease (BD) is a chronic multi-systemic vasculitis with a considerable prevalence in Asian countries. There are many genes associated with a higher risk of developing BD, one of which is endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase-1 (ERAP1). In this study, we aimed to investigate the interactions of ERAP1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using a novel data mining method called Model-based multifactor dimensionality reduction (MB-MDR). Methods We have included 748 BD patients and 776 healthy controls. A peripheral blood sample was collected, and eleven SNPs were assessed. Furthermore, we have applied the MB-MDR method to evaluate the interactions of ERAP1 gene polymorphisms. Results The TT genotype of rs1065407 had a synergistic effect on BD susceptibility, considering the significant main effect. In the second order of interactions, CC genotype of rs2287987 and GG genotype of rs1065407 had the most prominent synergistic effect (β = 12.74). The mentioned genotypes also had significant interactions with CC genotype of rs26653 and TT genotype of rs30187 in the third-order (β = 12.74 and β = 12.73, respectively). Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the interaction of a particular gene’s SNPs in BD patients by applying a novel data mining method. However, future studies investigating the interactions of various genes could clarify this issue."
https://openalex.org/W3004445406,"The follow up of Representative behavior after elections is imperative for a democratic Representative system, at the very least to punish betrayal with no re-election. Our goal was to show how to follow Representatives’ and how to show behavior in real situations and observe trends in political crises including the onset of game changing political instabilities. We used correlation and correlation distance matrices of Brazilian Representative votes during four presidential terms. Re-ordering these matrices with Minimal Spanning Trees displays the dynamical formation of clusters for the sixteen year period, which includes one Presidential impeachment. The reordered matrices, colored by correlation strength and by the parties clearly show the origin of observed clusters and their evolution over time. When large clusters provide government support cluster breaks, political instability arises, which could lead to an impeachment, a trend we observed three years before the Brazilian President was impeached. We believe this method could be applied to foresee other political storms."
https://openalex.org/W3004987443,"The protein phosphatase 2As (PP2As) play a key role in manipulating protein phosphorylation. Although a number of proteins in the latex of laticifers are phosphorylated during latex regeneration in rubber tree, information about the PP2A family is limited. In the present study, 36 members of the HbPP2A family were genome-wide identified. They were clustered into five subgroups: the subgroup HbPP2AA (4), HbPP2AB’ (14), HbPP2AB'' (6), HbPP2AB55 (4), and HbPP2AC (8). The members within the same subgroup shared highly conserved gene structures and protein motifs. Most of HbPP2As possessed ethylene- and wounding-responsive cis-acting elements. The transcripts of 29 genes could be detected in latex by using published high-throughput sequencing data. Of the 29 genes, seventeen genes were significantly down-regulated while HbPP2AA1-1 and HbPP2AB55α/Bα-1were up-regulated by tapping. Of the 17 genes, 14 genes were further significantly down-regulated by ethrel application. The down-regulated expression of a large number of HbPP2As may attribute to the enhanced phosphorylation of the proteins in latex from the tapped trees and the trees treated with ethrel application."
https://openalex.org/W3005035138,"Occupation was assessed as possible risk factors for prostate (PCa) and pancreatic cancer in a large Canadian worker cohort.The Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC) was derived from linking the 1991 Canadian Census Cohort to the Canadian Cancer Database (1969-2010), Canadian Mortality Database (1991-2011), and Tax Summary Files (1981-2011). From the total sample of 1,931,110 persons, we identified and derived two samples of 28,610 men and 3,220 men and women with a past history of PCa and pancreatic cancer diagnoses, respectively. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazards ratios and 95% confidence intervals for occupation.In Canadian men aged 24-64 years, the highest elevated risks of PCa were observed for library clerks (HR = 2.36, 95% CI:1.12-4.97), medical radiation technologists (HR = 1.66, 95% CI:1.04-2.65), telecommunications and line cable workers (HR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.22-3.16) and commissioned police officers (HR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.10-2.16. The highest elevated risk for pancreatic cancer were observed for commissioned police officers (HR = 4.34, 95% CI: 1.85-10.21), photographic and film processors (HR = 3.97, 95% CI:1.69-9.34), railway and motor transport labourers (HR = 3.94, 95% CI: 1.67-9.29), and computer engineers (HR = 3.82, 95%CI: 1.52-9.61).These findings emphasize the need for further study of job-related exposures and the potential influence of non-occupational factors such as screening practices."
https://openalex.org/W3004897493,"In this paper, we propose a technique that can efficiently express the preservation and breakup of liquid sheets by eliminating over-preserved liquid sheets using the motion of water particles projected onto the screen. First, we project three-dimensional water particles onto a two-dimensional screen. When multiple particles are projected onto the same pixel, we select one of the front most particles as a screened particle by comparing their depth values. Based on the anisotropic kernel and density, the motion of the screened water particles is tracked to determine whether preservation and breakup should be performed. As a result, new water particles are added or existing ones are deleted, which makes it possible to express two characteristics of particle-based fluids: preservation and breakup of liquid sheets. The proposed technique is based on particle-based fluids, which can be used to remove the over-preserved liquid sheets and thus improve the quality of liquid sheets without surface noise."
