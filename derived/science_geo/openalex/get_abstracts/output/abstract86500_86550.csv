https://openalex.org/W2041779329,"A number of mink cell focus-forming (MCF) proviruses was molecularly cloned from mouse lymphoma DNA. From each clone, flanking probes were prepared to detect common integration regions in other MuLV-induced lymphomas. One clone frequently revealed variations in the molecular structure of the corresponding region (Pim-1) in other lymphomas. The results show the following. Changes in the Pim region are seen in 24 out of 93 lymphomas tested. Over 50% of the early T-cell lymphomas show integration in the Pim-1 region. The alterations are seen in different mouse strains and with various MuLVs. The observed variations are caused by the integration of predominantly MCF genomes. All integrations occur in a region spanning less than 20 kb and are associated with the transcriptional activation of a distinct region within the Pim-1 domain. The activated region does not show any homology with 13 known and three putative oncogenes."

https://openalex.org/W2032725109,"Polypeptide analogs of the known members of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family were synthesized and tested in vitro and in vivo for enhanced potency or competitive antagonism. Predictive methods and physicochemical measurements had suggested an internal secondary α-helical conformation spanning about 25 residues for at least three members of the CRF family. Maximization of α-helix-forming potential by amino acid substitutions from the native known sequences (rat/human and ovine CRF, sauvagine, and carp and sucker urotensin 1) led to the synthesis of an analog that was found to be more than twice as potent as either of the parent peptides in vitro. In contrast, certain amino-terminally shortened fragments, such as α-helical CRF or ovine CRF residues 8 to 41, 9 to 41, and 10 to 41, were found to be competitive inhibitors in vitro. Selected antagonists were examined and also found to be active in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2024494699,"Crude extracts of rat atria reduced the basal amount of aldosterone released from rat zona glomerulosa cells and partially inhibited aldosterone stimulation by adrenocorticotropic hormone and angiotensin II. The destruction of this activity by trypsin suggests that the active factor is a peptide, possibly atrial natriuretic factor. These data suggest that atrial natriuretic factor affects sodium excretion by the kidneys both directly and through the inhibition of aldosterone production."

https://openalex.org/W1973979381,"In order to further define the mechanisms by which polypeptide growth factors regulate gene transcription and cellular growth, expression cloning techniques were used to select human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor complementary DNA clones. The EGF 3′ coding domain shows striking homology to the transforming gene product of avian erythroblastosis virus (v- erbB). Over-expression of EGF receptors in A431 cell lines correlates with increased EGF receptor mRNA levels and amplification (up to 110 times) of the apparently singular EGF receptor gene. There appear to be three cytoplasmic polyadenylated RNA products of EGF receptor gene expression in A431 cells, one of which contains only 5′ (EGF binding domain) sequences and is postulated to encode the secreted EGF receptor-related protein."

https://openalex.org/W1968395750,"Using double-label quantitative immunoelectron microscopy on ultrathin cryosections of rat liver, we have compared the endocytotic pathways of the receptors for asialoglycoprotein (ASGP-R), mannose-6-phosphate ligands (MP-R), and polymeric IgA (IgA-R). All three were found within the Golgi complex, along the entire plasma membrane, in coated pits and vesicles, and within a compartment of uncoupling of receptors and ligand ( CURL ). The receptors occurred randomly at the cell surface, in coated pits and vesicles. Within CURL tubules ASGP-R and MP-R were colocalized , but IgA-R and ASGP-R displayed dramatic microheterogeneity. Thus, in addition to its role in uncoupling and sorting recycling receptor from ligand, CURL serves as a compartment to segregate recycling receptor (e.g. ASGP-R) from receptor involved in transcytosis (e.g. IgA-R)."
https://openalex.org/W2033623749,"The myc oncogene is implicated here in T lymphocyte neoplasia. Cloning revealed a retroviral insert 0.7-1.3 kb 5' to c-myc in two T lymphomas induced by Soule murine leukemia virus and in a spontaneous T lymphoma ( Tikaut ) of an AKR mouse, a strain in which leukemogenesis involves recombinant retroviruses (MCF viruses). The tumor c-myc mRNAs appear normal but their level is approximately 5-fold higher than in most T lymphomas lacking c-myc rearrangement. Since each insert would be transcribed away from c-myc, its activation cannot involve the promoter of the long terminal repeat (LTR) but could reflect an enhancer, like that demonstrated within the Soule LTR. The Tikaut provirus has an MCF-like recombinant env gene and LTR sequence. MCF-like inserts were found near c-myc in seven of 31 other AKR T lymphomas; two lie 3' to c-myc and the five upstream are oriented away from c-myc. We conclude that a quarter of retrovirus-induced T lymphomas involve activation of c-myc, probably via the LTR enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W1495429371,"Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (CCl39) possess in their plasma membrane an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ antiport, activated by growth factors. Measurements of intracellular pH (pHi), using equilibrium distribution of benzoic acid, provide evidence for a major role of this antiport in 1) regulation of cytoplasmic pH, in response to an acute acid load or to varying external pH values, and 2) the increase in cytoplasmic pH (by 0.2-0.3 pH unit) upon addition of growth factors (alpha-thrombin and insulin) to G0/G1-arrested cells. Indeed, these two processes are Na+-dependent and amiloride-sensitive; furthermore, CCl39-derived mutant cells, lacking the Na+/H+ exchange activity, are greatly impaired in pHi regulation and present no cytoplasmic alkalinization upon growth factor addition. In wild type G0-arrested cells, the amplitude of the mitogen-induced alkalinization reflects directly the activity of the Na+/H+ antiport, and is tightly correlated with the magnitude of DNA synthesis stimulation. Therefore, we conclude that cytoplasmic pH, regulated by the Na+/H+ antiport, is of crucial importance in the mitogenic response."

https://openalex.org/W1658992953,"Methods were developed to adequately extract, separate and, without the use of NaF as stabilizing agent, purify to better than 90% purity human erythrocyte Ns and Ni, the stimulatory and inhibitory guanine nucleotide- and Mg-binding regulatory components of adenylyl cyclases, as well as a protein containing Mr = 35,000 subunits. On the basis of a functional assay for Ns, it was purified about 5,000-fold from starting washed erythrocyte membranes with a yield of about 10%. A typical purification yields from 60 units of outdated human blood, between 500 and 1,000 micrograms of pure Ns, and a similar amount of Ni. Pure Ns and Ni contain each at least one alpha and one beta subunit (Northup, J.K., Sternweis, P.C., Smigel, M.D., Schleifer, L.S., Ross, E.M., and Gilman, A.G. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74, 6516-6520; Codina, J., Hildebrandt, J.D., Iyengar, R., Birnbaumer, L., Sekura, R.D., and Manclark, C.R. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 4276-4280). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate at varying acrylamide concentrations yielded Mr values of 42,000 and 40,000 for the alpha subunits of Ns and Ni, and of 35,000 for the beta subunits of Ns and Ni. Two-dimensional thin layer analysis of tryptic peptides obtained from digesting 125I-labeled subunits of Ns and Ni confirmed the finding of Manning, D., and Gilman, A.G. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7059-7063) that while their alpha subunits are clearly different, their beta subunits are the same. Hydrodynamic analysis of the molecular weights of the nondenatured proteins showed behavior consistent with Mr = 95,500 for Ns, the same for Ni, and Mr = 40,000 for the protein containing the Mr = 35,000 beta subunit. Sedimentation coefficients and Stokes radii of the purified Ns were indistinguishable from those of Ns activity present in initial cholate extracts from human erythrocyte membranes. Further, the overall kinetics with which Ns activity in cholate extracts and Ns activity in the purified protein reconstituted the Ns-deficient adenylyl cyclase system of cyc- S49 cells was also indistinguishable. We conclude that we have purified the native unactivated form of Ns, and by serendipity the Ni, as well as a protein containing the 35 kDa beta subunit of Ns and Ni.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1983468246,"In the eukaryotic cell, both secreted and plasma membrane proteins are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum, then transported, via the Golgi complex, to the cell surface. Each of the compartments of this transport pathway carries out particular metabolic functions, and therefore presumably contains a distinct complement of membrane proteins. Thus, mechanisms must exist for localizing such proteins to their respective destinations. However, a major obstacle to the study of such mechanisms is that the isolation and detailed analysis of such internal membrane proteins pose formidable technical problems. We have therefore used the E1 glycoprotein from coronavirus MHV-A59 as a viral model for this class of protein. Here we present the primary structure of the protein, determined by analysis of cDNA clones prepared from viral mRNA. In combination with a previous study of its assembly into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the sequence reveals several unusual features of the protein which may be related to its intracellular localization."
https://openalex.org/W1608198953,"Soluble extracts from serum- or epidermal growth factor-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells show up to a 25-fold increase in their ability to phosphorylate 40 S ribosomal protein S6. The increased S6 phosphorylation is due to increased protein kinase activity in extracts of stimulated cells and not due to the inactivation of an S6 phosphatase. However, the presence of phosphatase inhibitors as well as EGTA is required during the preparation of cell extracts to obtain fully active S6 kinase(s). Epidermal growth factor has little effect at concentrations below 10(-10) M: activity increases sharply at 10(-9) M epidermal growth factor and reaches saturation at 10(-8) M (50-60% of the activity obtained by stimulating with 10% serum). Activation of the kinase activity in cell extracts is observed as early as 2 min after serum stimulation, reaches 50% between 10 and 15 min, and is maximal by 60 min of serum stimulation. Phosphorylation in vitro of ribosomal protein S6 with extracts from serum-stimulated cells followed by analysis of the tryptic phosphopeptides shows the presence of 9 of the 11 phosphopeptides induced by serum in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1548067503,"Escherichia coli photolyase is a DNA repair enzyme which monomerizes pyrimidine dimers, the major UV photoproducts in DNA, to pyrimidines in a light-dependent reaction. We recently described the construction of a tac-phr plasmid that greatly overproduces the enzyme (Sancar, G. B., Smith, F. W., and Sancar, A. (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 6667-6678). Using a strain carrying the overproducing plasmid as the starting material, we have developed a purification procedure that yields several milligrams of apparently homogeneous enzyme. The purified protein is a single polypeptide that has an apparent Mr of 49,000 under both denaturing and nondenaturing conditions. The enzyme has no requirement for divalent cations and it restores the biological activity of irradiated DNA only in the presence of photoreactivating light. The purified photolyase has a turnover number of 2.4 dimers/molecule/min; this value agrees well with the in vivo rate of photoreactivation in E. coli."

https://openalex.org/W2052979122,"A pool of synthetic oligonucleotides was prepared based on the amino terminal amino acid sequence of tetanus toxin. This probe hybridized to plasmid DNA isolated from three toxigenic strains of Clostridium tetani but not to plasmid DNA from a nontoxigenic strain. These results show that the structural gene for the toxin is on the plasmid. The pCL1 plasmid from one of the toxigenic strains spontaneously deleted 22 kilobase pairs of DNA to form pCL2. Strains harboring this deleted plasmid are nontoxigenic. However, the probe mixture hybridized to pCL2, indicating that the DNA encoding the amino terminus of the toxin had not been deleted. Restriction endonuclease cleavage maps of pCL1 and pCL2 were constructed and indicate the approximate location and orientation of the structural gene for tetanus toxin."

https://openalex.org/W1516561402,"The mechanism of activation of the Mg(II) X ATP-dependent phosphatase by the kinase FA has been investigated. The inactive protein phosphatase can be represented as FC X M where FC is the inactive catalytic component and M is the heat-stable modulator protein (also known as inhibitor-2). Phosphorylation of the modulator protein is demonstrated during activation of FC X M. In addition, continuous ATP hydrolysis during the activation is observed. This suggests that a cyclic phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction is continuously occurring during the activation. It is proposed that phosphorylation of the modulator protein causes an isomerization in FC to generate an active phosphatase. The activated phosphatase is capable of dephosphorylating the phosphorylated modulator. Upon dephosphorylation of modulator, the active phosphatase returns to its inactive form via a slow isomerization."

https://openalex.org/W2080120851,"Cultured fibroblasts obtained from patients with tissue resistance to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D3--dependent rickets, type II) contain normal, low, or undetectable concentrations of this hormone's receptor protein as measured by a ligand-binding assay. Extracts from these cells were evaluated for receptors by immunoassay with a recently developed monoclonal antibody to the chick receptor. The results show that a protein sedimenting at 3.7S and recognizable by the antibody exists in comparable concentrations in cells from both normal and resistant patients, irrespective of the hormone-binding abnormalities of the cells. This implies that deficiencies in hormone binding associated with inherited tissue resistance to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 probably arise from structural variations in the receptor molecule and not from defective receptor synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1534913757,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a 2039-base pair segment of Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA containing the phr gene, which encodes deoxyribopyrimidine photolyase. The coding region of phr is 1416 base pairs and is preceded by regions homologous to consensus sequences for E. coli promoters and ribosome binding sites. The phr gene is preceeded by an open reading frame of 169 codons (orf169) which is transcribed in the same direction. The proximity of orf169 to phr suggests that both are members of a single operon containing one or more internal promoters allowing differential expression of phr. An unusually large number of rare or infrequently used codons are utilized in phr, which may contribute to the low copy number of photolyase. The sequence at the NH2 and COOH termini and the overall amino acid composition of mature photolyase, determined using purified protein, agrees with predictions based upon the nucleotide sequence. Photolyase consists of 471 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 53,994."
https://openalex.org/W1488248876,"Phosphorylase phosphatase is isolated as an inactive Mr = 70,000 complex made up of a catalytic and a regulatory subunit (inhibitor 2). Separation of the two components yields the free catalytic subunit in a completely inactive state. It can be activated by Mn2+ or Co2+, not Mg2+ or Ca2+. No metal ion is incorporated during this process, as shown by the use of 54Mn2+. The inactive complex, but not the isolated catalytic subunit, can be activated by the protein kinase FA (Vandenheede, J.R., Yang, S.-D., Goris, J., and Merlevede, W. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11768-11774), which causes the simultaneous phosphorylation of inhibitor 2 and conversion of the catalytic subunit to an active conformation. The activated enzyme undergoes autodephosphorylation to produce a complex that is inactive even though the catalytic subunit is still in the active form; in a slower step, it returns to its original inactive state. No such conversion occurs in the absence of inhibitor 2, indicating that the regulatory subunit is required for both the activation and inactivation reactions. Complexes were prepared by adding inhibitor 2 to various isolated catalytic subunits. Only the one reconstituted with the FA-activated species behaved like the native enzyme in that the catalytic subunit underwent transformation to the inactive form, then could be reactivated by FA. These data suggest that the two subunits must interact in a highly specific manner to allow the structural changes accompanying the activation-inactivation process. Models are proposed for the changes in conformation induced by Mn2+ or FA."
https://openalex.org/W2143676429,"A recombinant plasmid containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) gene, flanked on one side by two murine immunoglobulin heavy chain diversity (D) elements and on the other by two murine immunoglobulin heavy chain joining (JH) elements, was introduced into a tk- variant of a pre-B cell line transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus. The four possible site-specific joining events between the D and JH segments within the integrated construct occurred frequently during passage of the cloned line under nonselective conditions, and deletion of the internal tk gene as a result of these joining events was, by far, the predominant mechanism of resistance to BUdR within this line. These studies demonstrate that a precise chromosomal location is not essential for the assembly of D and JH elements and provide a model system for mechanistic and genetic studies of this recombination process."

https://openalex.org/W1509073604,"Retinoic acid induces the differentiation of many murine teratocarcinoma stem cell lines. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of action of retinoic acid, we have selected a series of mutants which exhibit altered differentiation responses to retinoic acid. All of the mutants display abnormal morphology following addition of 5 X 10(-7) M retinoic acid (RA) and dibutyryl cAMP. In addition, none of the mutants are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of higher concentrations of retinoic acid (greater than 75 microM). After the addition of retinoic acid, one mutant, RA-3-10, does not differentiate by any of the biochemical criteria we have used; this mutant also possesses less than 5% of the wild type level of cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP). Other mutants, such as RA-3-3, RA-3-4, and RA-5-1, contain the same amount of CRABP as wild type F9 cells. However, the mutants RA-3-3 and RA-3-4 exhibit lower levels of plasminogen activator activity, and RA-3-4 also exhibits only 10-20% of the wild type synthesis and secretion of laminin and collagen IV following treatment with RA. After RA treatment of the mutant RA-5-1, laminin and collagen IV are synthesized and secreted at reduced rates relative to wild type cells, and the secreted collagen IV has a lower molecular weight than that of wild type; this suggests that RA-5-1 cells have a mutation in one of the enzymes responsible for post-translational modification of collagen IV. None of the mutants tested exhibits alterations in either cytosolic or membrane bound cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. These studies provide genetic evidence that the CRABP is required for the differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells by retinoic acid. However, even in the presence of CRABP, other types of alterations, such as synthesis of collagen IV with an abnormal molecular weight, appear to cause alterations in the differentiation response of cells to retinoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1588616648,"Transcription of the yeast mitochondrial var 1 gene encoding the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit protein, var 1, has been examined in wild type and petite strains by Northern hybridization, S 1 nuclease protection experiments, and analysis of primary transcripts by in vitro labeling of mitochondrial RNAs with [alpha-32P]GTP and guanylyl transferase. We have identified a transcription unit in which a polycistronic precursor gives rise to the mRNAs for ATPase subunit 9 (the product of the oli 1 gene), var 1, and tRNASerUCN. Potential cleavage sites have been identified within this precursor that separates oli 1, tRNASerUCN, and var 1 transcripts. Transcriptional initiation of the polycistronic precursor occurs from one of two nearby copies of the sequence, 5'-ATATAAGTA-3', located approximately 550 and 630 base pairs 5' to the oli 1 gene. A closely related sequence, 5'-TTATAAGTA-3', is found within the var 1 gene and may serve as a transcriptional initiation site for one of a pair of primary transcripts detected in a petite retaining the var 1[40.0] allele. The other primary transcript in this strain initiates upstream in a region of the var 1 gene containing no recognizable initiation sites."

https://openalex.org/W1990248303,Beta-Endorphin-like immunoreactivity in cerebrospinal fluid was assayed in 11 patients receiving electrical stimulation of the brain for chronic pain. Immunoreactivity increased dramatically after contrast ventriculography prior to stimulation. No further elevations were observed after stimulation. The magnitude and time course of elevations were identical after placement of electrodes either in the thalamus or in the periventricular gray matter. These results suggest that previous findings of stimulation-induced elevation of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity in cerebrospinal fluid are attributable to an artifact of contrast ventriculography.
https://openalex.org/W1948737079,"Abstract A rapid and reproducible method for the purification of the Ca/Mg-endonuclease from porcine and rat liver and for the stabilization of the enzyme activity is presented. The optimum conditions for enzyme activity were determined. The enzyme degrades double-stranded DNA endonucleolytically. In the course of digestion of form I closed circular SV 40 DNA, the form II nicked circular DNA is the prominent intermediate product. Digestion of hen erythrocyte nuclei with added endonuclease produces a ladder of mono- and oligonucleosomal fragments similar to that generated by micrococcal nuclease digestion. Determination of the 5'-terminal nucleotides indicates the absence of a significant base specificity. Analyzing the cleavage pattern of end-labeled pBR322 restriction fragments on sequencing gels shows that the enzyme exhibits a weak preference for dinucleotides with A in the 5'-position; dinucleotides with 5%-C are less readily cleaved. Digestion of end-labeled pBR322 DNA, followed by electrophoresis in agarose gels produces a smear-like fragmentation pattern with weak superimposed bands, while micrococcal nuclease generates a different and much more distinct pattern. These data show that the sequence specificity of the enzyme is less pronounced than that of micrococcal nuclease and that the sites preferentially cleaved are not the same."
https://openalex.org/W2068851858,Several polar androgens increased the binding of angiotensin and its stimulation of aldosteronogenesis in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells. The effect was seen only if the steroids were applied to the cells and then washed away. This phenomenon and the technique for demonstrating it may have implications for studies of receptor modulation and for clinical states in which responsiveness to angiotensin is increased.
https://openalex.org/W1517919442,"A chimera gene consisting of the ompF promoter, the coding regions for the signal peptide and the NH2-terminal 11 amino acid residues of outer membrane OmpF protein, and the coding region for the major outer membrane lipoprotein devoid of the NH2-terminal 7 amino acid residues was constructed. Escherichia coli carrying the cloned chimera gene produced a hybrid protein with the predicted chemical structure. The protein was localized in the periplasmic space with an interaction with the peptidoglycan layer. These results indicate that the hybrid protein was expressed, secreted across the cytoplasmic membrane, and processed for the signal peptide normally. The hybrid protein, however, was not incorporated into the outer membrane, suggesting the importance of the lipid domain in the assembly of the lipoprotein into the outer membrane. Although a larger part of the protein was extractable with sodium dodecyl sulfate, a part of the hybrid protein was covalently bound to the peptidoglycan layer as the lipoprotein is. Upon treatment with lysozyme of the envelope the hybrid protein became water soluble. The solubilized protein most probably existed as a trimer. These results most likely suggest that the major lipoprotein exists as a trimer in the periplasmic space with interactions with the peptidoglycan layer through the protein domain on one side and with the outer membrane through the lipid domain on the other side."
https://openalex.org/W1509554287,"Agonist, but not antagonist, protects the beta-adrenergic receptor from inactivation during solubilization in deoxycholate. Protection is apparently due to locking of the agonist in the receptor, a high affinity interaction induced or stabilized by this detergent. The guanyl nucleotide-binding protein which normally interacts with the receptor to induce high affinity binding of the hormone is apparently not required in this agonist-specific locking process. It is therefore possible that deoxycholate mimics the effect of the guanyl nucleotide-binding protein on the conformation of the hormone-occupied receptor. The experiments further show that the receptor in deoxycholate is quite stable for days, provided that it is occupied by the agonist. Removal of deoxycholate brings about the release of the locked agonist and the return of the receptor to the dynamic functional state."
